1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,400
my name is dr benassie i'm here to

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,360
present

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,360
um my my talk which the topic is towards

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,199
electro optical sound is dropping

5
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,199
now i will start by introducing myself

6
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,039
um

7
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,519
um i have a phd i'm a graduated phd

8
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,199
student from bengal university of the

9
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,000
negev i'm also a computer scientist and

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,400
a former google employee

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,800
and i'm an infosec researcher at cyber

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,320
bgu

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,680
uh

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,600
i'm also a frequent conference speaker

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,760
this is partial list of the conferences

16
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,399
that i gave talks in the last two years

17
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,120
you can find them black cat and black at

18
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,840
rsa conferences and

19
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,520
other interesting conferences as well

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,600
you can find uh for those of you who

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,800
have interest in my work the videos of

22
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,239
these conferences

23
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,800
on my website

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,840
and

25
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,559
in this conferences i usually present uh

26
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,159
my research and

27
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,960
um my research and most of the activity

28
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,200
that i do is in the area of uh security

29
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,640
of semi

30
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,680
of semi and full autonomous vehicles

31
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,680
for example uh about two years ago we

32
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,000
were able to present an attack a remote

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,040
attack against castle and mobileye that

34
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,759
causes tesla's autopilot to stop the car

35
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,439
in the middle of the road due to a

36
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,200
digital advertising compromise digital

37
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,119
advertisement that presented in front of

38
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,280
it

39
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,280
three or four years ago i presented

40
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,200
another research of mine which was how

41
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,520
to detect illicit drone filming

42
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,000
and another topic or another area that

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,479
can investigate is security of iot

44
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,640
devices uh for example

45
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,920
um

46
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,360
how to attack

47
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,759
smart irrigation systems uh how to

48
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,439
establish a cover channel vi

49
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,600
multifunction printer

50
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,200
and how to do

51
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,439
verification for a handwritten signature

52
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,040
via

53
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,790
smartwatch

54
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,479
[Music]

55
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:05,840
and finally

56
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,119
what you come here to to hear it's the

57
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,120
area of electro optical sound

58
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,879
eavesdropping

59
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,720
now a few notes regarding stock um this

60
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,040
talk is based on three studies that i've

61
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,160
conducted in the last few years two

62
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,000
studies were already published uh they

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,760
named uh lamphon which was published uh

64
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,720
about

65
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,200
about two years ago and also glom attack

66
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,200
that was published this year

67
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,000
and

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,680
you are you will be the first to hear

69
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,760
about the graham attack and we also uh

70
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,000
you will be the first to uh hear about

71
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,879
uh a new study of our that we haven't

72
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,040
published yet we intend to publish it uh

73
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,239
uh during next year next year um its

74
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,560
name is the little

75
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,640
seal bug

76
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,480
now this is the agenda for today we will

77
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,560
start with background of sound

78
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,319
eavesdropping methods we will discuss

79
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,720
about related works we will then discuss

80
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,080
about electro optical sound

81
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,239
eavesdropping we will cover length on

82
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,280
glom attack and this little steel bug

83
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,280
and at the end we will end up with some

84
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,720
takeaways and

85
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,239
on the spare time that we will have i

86
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,440
will take some questions from the

87
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,440
audience

88
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,959
okay so let's start to understand what

89
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,760
is exactly sound eavesdropping now

90
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,159
according to wikipedia eavesdropping is

91
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,760
the act of secretly

92
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,840
recovering sound from a target victim

93
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,959
without

94
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,879
his consent okay

95
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,120
this is one sentence that defines

96
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,360
eavesdropping now you should know that

97
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,239
most

98
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,080
of the methods related to sound

99
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,159
eavesdropping were developed by r d

100
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,720
departments of secret agencies not by

101
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,440
the academia

102
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,040
however some methods were also

103
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,959
published to the uh were also developed

104
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,440
by the academia and as a result they are

105
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,319
known to the public

106
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,959
and for example there is an early

107
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,480
evidence of

108
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,920
science in the area of sound

109
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,239
eavesdropping uh which appeared around

110
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,720
world war ii and maybe even some before

111
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,239
okay so let's understand what is exactly

112
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,840
what the related work in this area

113
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,680
in recent years the scientific community

114
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,238
suggested various ways to recover sound

115
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,160
okay however you can basically

116
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,880
categorize them into two categories the

117
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,479
first one is the internal methods and

118
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,560
the second one is the external methods

119
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,000
so let's try to understand first of all

120
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
what is the internal methods

121
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,759
now internal methods are methods that

122
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,400
rely on data obtained by

123
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,759
a device

124
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,320
located in proximity to a victim okay by

125
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,960
a device by a compromised device

126
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,160
and it was demonstrated how for example

127
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,160
motion sensors of

128
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,759
uh smartphones

129
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,240
uh can be used to recover data obtained

130
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,479
from motion sensors of smartphone now

131
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,160
for example gyroscope and accelerometer

132
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,720
can be used to recover speech

133
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,759
okay it was also demonstrated how data

134
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,600
obtained from the lidar

135
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,240
of a robotic vacuum cleaner can also be

136
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,840
used to recover speech

137
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,479
and from an eavesdropper perspective

138
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,880
uh the greatest advantage of these

139
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,960
methods are that in fact they are

140
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,240
permissionless

141
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,720
it means that if an eavesdropper wants

142
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,120
to basically obtain the data

143
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,880
for example the data from the motion

144
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,080
sensor or the data from the lidar

145
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,240
you won't need to basically uh

146
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,919
the application doesn't require any

147
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,000
special permission to do it you can

148
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,240
obtain motion sensor data even without

149
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,639
showing it to the user the user of the

150
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,080
application okay so they are

151
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,759
permissionless and as a result um

152
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,479
it is easy for uh for

153
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,120
attackers to obtain data without

154
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,120
basically uh

155
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,520
telling the user that they do so

156
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,560
however

157
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,319
the greatest disadvantage of these

158
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,919
methods is the fact that they require

159
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,280
the attacker

160
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,960
basically to compromise the device with

161
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,880
the malware either in the application or

162
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,120
either in the device itself in order to

163
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,080
obtain the data and also exfiltrate the

164
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,000
data from the device

165
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,120
to

166
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,039
the uh attacker

167
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,280
via the internet okay so

168
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,360
attackers or eavesdroppers need to

169
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,280
basically compromise a device with the

170
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,919
malware in order to do so

171
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,520
and as a result there is a second

172
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,840
category which i define as external

173
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,160
methods and external methods are methods

174
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,759
that rely on data

175
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,960
obtained by a remote sensor okay

176
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,919
which is not located near the victim

177
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,680
the victim is the one that basically do

178
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,639
the conversation the one that we intend

179
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,800
to recover the content

180
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,600
uh

181
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,000
its conversation

182
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,840
now for example it was demonstrated that

183
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,440
the laser microphone

184
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,080
can be used to recover sound okay and

185
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,120
this is

186
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,400
for those of you who are not familiar

187
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,160
with laser microphone laser microphones

188
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,440
basically relies on a laser transceiver

189
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,599
to recover sound by directing a laser

190
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,560
beam towered an object

191
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,160
okay this can be for example a bag of

192
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,520
chips that is located near the victim

193
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,160
and analyzing the object's response to

194
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,759
sound

195
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,919
now um if you think about it this is

196
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,000
pretty amazing okay because from an

197
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,160
absorber perspective this is completely

198
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,319
an external method it doesn't require

199
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,840
this method doesn't require the

200
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,240
eavesdropper to compromise any device

201
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,599
with the malware

202
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,520
okay moreover this can be applied in

203
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,280
real time

204
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,840
um however the greatest disadvantage of

205
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,599
this method is the fact that this method

206
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,840
is active it means

207
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,720
that basically a laser beam is utilized

208
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,039
in order to obtain

209
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,360
uh data that can be used to recover

210
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,199
sound and as a result it gives

211
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,039
indication for the victim or the

212
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,440
organization that this method is being

213
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,400
applied

214
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,759
by someone by an eavesdropper to recover

215
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,080
sound

216
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,599
now finally it was demonstrated about

217
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,520
five or six or maybe seven years ago by

218
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,680
a group of scientists from mit

219
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,560
uh

220
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,800
a new method an innovative method uh

221
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,039
they named it the visual microphone now

222
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,919
the visual microphone basically uses a

223
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,560
high frequency video camera

224
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,840
that able to capture about 2 000

225
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,240
frames per second

226
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,879
and they did it and they used this uh

227
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,440
amazing uh video camera in order to

228
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,800
recover sound

229
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,519
by analyzing the object's response its

230
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,240
vibration okay for example take a bag of

231
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,479
 bag of chips they analyze the the

232
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,120
vibration of the bag of chips to sound

233
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,880
from the frames okay this is why they

234
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,000
use a high frequency video camera

235
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,279
now

236
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,720
the visual microphone the visual

237
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,720
microphone is an amazing method that was

238
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,320
demonstrated by uh the guys from mit um

239
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,240
it is also external method you don't

240
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,160
need to compromise any device with a

241
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,279
malware okay it is passive as opposed to

242
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,760
the laser microphone which utilize a

243
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,399
laser beam in this case this is being

244
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,720
done via a video camera this is

245
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,040
completely passive as a result the user

246
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,040
or the victim doesn't have any

247
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,800
indication that this method is being

248
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,440
utilized or being used uh to recover

249
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,800
sound

250
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,959
however there are two main disadvantages

251
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,480
for this method first of all it cannot

252
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,720
be applied in real time it require heavy

253
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,040
computational resources in order to

254
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,200
process this amount of uh frames uh in

255
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,240
uh in real time and as a result this can

256
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,040
cannot be obtained in real time just to

257
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,800
for you to understand they were able to

258
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,279
recover three hours of sound uh three

259
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,800
seconds of sound in three hours of

260
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,160
processing

261
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,120
and also it was demonstrated only

262
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,240
against

263
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,560
uh i would say screaming

264
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,839
uh the orders of this uh paper haven't

265
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,959
demonstrated this method against i would

266
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,519
say a normal volume or something like

267
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,440
the volume that i'm currently speaking

268
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,279
in this conference which is

269
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,399
somehow beyond the normal um for example

270
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,800
this is what you will use in a virtual

271
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,640
meeting okay

272
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,000
so this is the greatest advantages of

273
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,279
this method

274
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,959
and if i will have to summarize the

275
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,720
entire section of related work i will

276
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,959
say that um

277
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,320
all of the methods that were

278
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,399
demonstrated so far

279
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,079
basically either

280
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,600
suffers from one of the following

281
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,320
properties some of them require the

282
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,480
attackers or the eavesdroppers to

283
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,560
compromise the device with the malware

284
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,600
okay

285
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,839
other are active it means that they give

286
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,720
indication to the victim

287
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,560
when they are being utilized by the

288
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,079
eavesdropper

289
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,920
and others cannot be applied in real

290
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,800
time or can only be used to recover

291
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,560
screaming and not

292
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,360
uh i would say normal

293
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,399
normal levels of speech as

294
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,519
the the level that i'm adjusting

295
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,680
okay so this is for the section of the

296
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,680
related work let's try to understand

297
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,000
what is electro optical sound is

298
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,680
dropping

299
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,959
now

300
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,600
electro optical sound eavesdropping is

301
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,360
somehow very

302
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,839
complex sentence however if i will have

303
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,560
to summarize it in a more simple way in

304
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,000
four words

305
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,839
electro optical sound it's dropping is

306
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,120
basically converting light to sound

307
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,120
okay this is an optical method which

308
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,560
convert light

309
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,800
to sound

310
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,680
and

311
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,440
some of you probably wonder how can we

312
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,839
convert light to sound so it goes as

313
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,480
follows the process goes as follows

314
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,640
sound waves are produced either by a

315
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,040
human victim or a victim device a victim

316
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,440
device can be a speaker for example

317
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,440
a photodiode

318
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,079
is directed via telescope

319
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,040
to capture light from a target human or

320
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,360
the device

321
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,519
an optical acoustical transformation is

322
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,760
performed to isolate the audio signal

323
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,920
from the optical measurements

324
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,480
and perceptible sound is isolated from

325
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,839
the optical measurements and can be

326
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,839
heard by the

327
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,600
ears now some of you probably wonder

328
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,360
what is a photodiode

329
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,440
um so a photodiode is a device that

330
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,320
converts light into an associated

331
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,000
electrical current

332
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,760
okay so

333
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,519
photodiode can be sampled by an a2d

334
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,760
at any desired frequency rate given that

335
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,200
they have the

336
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,519
the they need the sensitivity to support

337
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,800
it

338
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,720
and

339
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,560
photodiodes have various uses for

340
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,600
example to detect the ambient light in

341
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,079
smartphone this is being used to

342
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,399
basically balance

343
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,440
um

344
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,639
your uh

345
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,720
the light of your the

346
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,880
the level of light of your smartphone

347
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,680
screen you can see it it is integrated

348
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,160
to each and every smartphone however in

349
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,160
this study we used more professional

350
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,600
photodiode you can see it on the right

351
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,839
side this is the photodiode that we used

352
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,120
for our

353
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,440
um experiments or for our research

354
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,440
now here is an interesting fact

355
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,399
we are all carry a photo diode in our

356
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,079
pockets right now

357
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,839
they are as i mentioned before

358
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,959
integrated to our smartphones

359
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,800
so electro optical sound eavesdropping

360
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,200
let's discuss about the advantages of

361
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,079
this method basically it's external okay

362
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,680
you don't need to compromise any device

363
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,920
with a malware this is being done

364
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,880
completely with a remote sensor

365
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,480
this is passive

366
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,839
it means that it doesn't give any

367
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,839
indication regarding its use okay a

368
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,639
photodiode doesn't rely on a laser beam

369
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,839
it's completely passive sensor

370
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,120
moreover it can be applied in real time

371
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,800
the transmission from optics to

372
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,160
acoustics

373
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,079
can be applied immediately

374
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,959
and finally it can be used to recover

375
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,199
speech at the normal volume

376
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,440
okay now let's start to discuss about

377
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,680
the first research that we did

378
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,160
we named it lamphon now

379
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,040
uh

380
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,720
i would say that this uh research was

381
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,560
coded by myself by alan pirotin by

382
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,079
professor adishamir professor yuval

383
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,040
alovech and dr bob

384
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,399
and lamphon basically

385
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,519
converts optical measurements obtained

386
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,920
from the movement of a hanging light

387
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,320
bulb to sound okay this is a side

388
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,920
channel attack for those of you are

389
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,279
familiar with this category of research

390
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,360
this is done by exploiting the small or

391
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,079
the subtle changes in light as they are

392
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,360
captured

393
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,760
by the remote photodiode

394
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,079
and the small changes in light are the

395
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,720
result of the small vibrations

396
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,639
of the hanging light bulb

397
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,160
when sound waves

398
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,079
okay hit

399
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,519
the uh the light bulb surface

400
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,760
okay now i would start

401
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,680
with a warning

402
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,199
turning a hanging light bulb into a

403
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,079
microphone is very challenging task uh

404
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,079
some of you are probably wonder why

405
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:06,880
um

406
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,639
and the fact is that light bulbs were

407
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,399
not exactly designed to be used as

408
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,399
microphones so i will try to convince

409
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:13,760
you that despite the fact that they were

410
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,720
not

411
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,399
designed to be used as a microphone you

412
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,399
can exploit

413
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,000
their use for a different purpose

414
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,959
and

415
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,880
landform spread model goes as follows

416
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,959
basically we assume that there is a

417
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,519
hanging light bulb which exists in a

418
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,000
target room and a sound which can be for

419
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
example the result of a conversation

420
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,720
made by two colleagues um

421
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,040
creates fluctuations create sound waves

422
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,199
which create fluctuations on the surface

423
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,759
of the hanging light bulb and from here

424
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,399
it goes uh as i

425
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,160
discussed before there is an

426
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,160
eavesdropper which directs a photodiode

427
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,639
via a telescope to

428
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:53,519
the

429
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,360
light bulb

430
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,759
and the photodiode is being sampled by

431
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,440
an a2d

432
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,079
the measurements are given as an input

433
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,399
to an algorithm to an optical acoustical

434
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:05,920
transformation

435
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,480
and the output of that optical

436
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,800
acoustical transformation is perceptible

437
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,880
sound

438
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,759
now

439
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,360
some of you are probably wondering how

440
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,160
small are the hanging bulb vibrations so

441
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,600
in order to answer it we actually

442
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,160
conducted an experiment uh we obtained

443
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,480
we actually attached a gyroscope to the

444
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,240
bottom of the hanging light bulb we took

445
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,480
a standard uh hanging light bulb this

446
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,440
was an e27 12 watts hanging light bulb

447
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,639
and led

448
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,199
um we produce various sound waves

449
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,560
between 100 to 400 health

450
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,519
at different volumes from 70 db 70 db is

451
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,279
the amount of volume we can currently

452
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,959
use to 115 db

453
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,399
uh using via speakers and we sampled the

454
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,839
gyroscope at 800 hertz using raspberry

455
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,360
pi okay we connected gyroscope to

456
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,519
raspberry pi in order to sample or to

457
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,560
obtain the measurements from the

458
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,839
javascript

459
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,919
um we computed the angle as the function

460
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,199
of the frequency okay the function of

461
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,559
the frequency basically it's the sine

462
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,359
wave that was produced from the speakers

463
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,799
um for the two angles which are phi and

464
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:15,919
theta

465
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,720
and these were the results and the

466
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,720
conclusions we made from these results

467
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,000
are as follows

468
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,400
basically as can you see uh

469
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,199
the movement is very uh very small it's

470
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,400
in milli degrees okay it's between five

471
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,080
uh milli degrees to 60 milli degrees

472
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,320
um as you can see the

473
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,440
the the response is not equal across the

474
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,880
spectrum okay the angle changes as a

475
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,640
function of the frequency you can see

476
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,440
that there are peaks

477
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,320
on 250 however

478
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,960
around 100 and around 400

479
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,880
this is somehow the response is more

480
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,200
flat

481
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,200
and finally as you can see from the

482
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,919
results um basically the response

483
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,080
increases as the volume increases this

484
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,080
is somehow not very surprising because

485
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,240
when you're using uh i would say higher

486
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,200
volume

487
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,160
um

488
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,840
you actually create a

489
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,440
stronger uh vibration from the valve

490
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,960
from the bottom

491
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,480
okay

492
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,679
so we wanted to test our method in a

493
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,880
real setup um and we decided to evaluate

494
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,440
length performance when recovering sound

495
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,320
from a bridge located 25 meters from an

496
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,360
office

497
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,200
and the office contained a 12 watt e27

498
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,240
hanging light bulb and led light bulb

499
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,840
and let me show you a video

500
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,199
of the experimental setup

501
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,480
okay so we placed our uh equipment where

502
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,760
you can see on the bridge and

503
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,160
this is a video of us during the

504
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,010
experiment

505
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:00,559
[Applause]

506
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,240
okay you can see you can see two

507
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,320
interesting things first of all the

508
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,799
sound that was played

509
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,160
um inside the office

510
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,080
couldn't be heard

511
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,240
from the bridge it's located 25 meters

512
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,520
and there's a glass uh window closed

513
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,440
inside the office

514
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,280
and as you can see there's the laptop

515
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,240
and the telescope which is uh which is

516
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,039
uh

517
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,640
used to obtain the

518
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,919
which is used to obtain the optical

519
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,000
measurements a photodiode is placed on

520
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,160
top or is mounted to the telescope and

521
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,200
there's an a2d which takes obtains the

522
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,960
basically digitized

523
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,840
uh the optical measurements to digital

524
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,720
uh measurements and on the right side

525
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,240
you can see how the uh light bulb looks

526
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,240
when it is being you know um

527
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,840
when you look it through the uh

528
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,679
telescope okay you can see it's very

529
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:56,960
very small

530
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,720
and you are about to see that it

531
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,720
produces some very interesting uh

532
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,520
very interesting sound

533
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,679
now the first experiment that we did uh

534
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,440
we wanted to characterize the baseline

535
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,760
okay the baseline basically is the um

536
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,159
trying to obtain optical measurements

537
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,919
via the photodiode

538
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,000
when no sound is played inside the

539
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,840
office okay this is what we call the

540
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,960
baseline

541
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,960
so basically what we did is we obtained

542
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,360
optical measurements uh via the

543
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,320
telescope no sound was played uh we

544
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,080
directed the uh

545
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,000
the telescope to the uh to the light

546
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,919
bulb no sound was played near the light

547
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,000
bulb it was completely silenced

548
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,280
now these are the results that were

549
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,559
obtained uh this is an fft graph of the

550
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,960
result uh what you can see the there are

551
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,720
two interesting conclusions

552
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,400
first of all the led bulb works at 100

553
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,000
health um

554
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,320
there are peaks around 100 hertz and

555
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,039
it's harmonics it means 200 hertz 300

556
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,600
hertz 400 earths etc and as you can

557
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,520
understand this is a side effect we

558
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,919
don't want to uh to

559
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,880
to that this side effect will affect

560
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,679
the

561
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,000
the audio that we intend to basically uh

562
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,480
convert or to obtain so

563
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,840
as you can understand for those of you

564
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,360
who understand some

565
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,840
some dsp some digital signal processing

566
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,559
we need to filter this uh

567
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,880
noise with bend stop filters okay so

568
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,559
this is one of the first things that we

569
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,360
do

570
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,440
and also as you can see there is

571
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,120
a noise uh at low frequencies below

572
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,280
uh 50 health

573
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,520
and again this is i do not want to get

574
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,520
to into too much explanations on why

575
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,760
this is uh the result of the bridge that

576
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,200
we located our uh equipment on it um

577
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,159
again this can be um

578
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,880
filtered out with high pass filter again

579
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,440
this is our side effects they will

580
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,320
affect our audio signals so we know how

581
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,679
to basically filter them out okay so ben

582
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,200
stop filtering and high pass filtering

583
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,440
will completely uh

584
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,000
filter this side effects out

585
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,120
of the expected audio signal

586
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,440
now the next thing that we did is we try

587
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,240
to

588
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,640
analyze the frequency response of

589
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,480
the light bulb to sound so we actually

590
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,919
uh

591
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,240
uh obtained optical measurements okay

592
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,640
via the photodiode while the speakers

593
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,039
play the frequency scan a frequency scan

594
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,400
is a chirp okay

595
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,520
um

596
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,440
a sweep maybe uh you are familiar with

597
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,520
this name it was played

598
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,280
via the speakers in proximity to the

599
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,960
hanging light bulb again we obtained

600
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,120
optical measurements from the photodiode

601
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,760
that was directed via the telescope

602
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,320
to the hanging light bulb

603
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,520
now these are the results that we

604
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,440
obtained um

605
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,720
there are two interesting conclusions

606
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,960
that you can see from this results

607
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,280
first of all the signal to noise ratio

608
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,400
improves

609
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,200
when a telescope with a bigger lens is

610
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,039
used okay this is an optical

611
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,520
amplification if you use a bigger

612
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,679
telescope you get a better

613
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,080
uh signal-to-noise ratio

614
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,720
and also you can see that the estenal is

615
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,240
not equal across the spectrum um

616
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,159
for those of you who understand a bit

617
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,640
with dsp or digital signal processing of

618
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,480
audio basically all you need to do is to

619
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,799
use equalizer in order to balance the

620
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,880
frequencies so they have the same

621
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,840
response so you basically try to first

622
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,400
of all profile the response and then you

623
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,000
design the equalizer and the equalizer

624
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,919
that we design you can see it on the

625
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,120
right side

626
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,480
now this is a good time for us to

627
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,840
discuss about the optical acoustical

628
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,280
transformation so in order to recover

629
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,679
sound from light from optical

630
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:40,799
measurements

631
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,080
you need to basically apply the

632
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,600
following uh

633
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,080
i would say stages the following process

634
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,440
first of all you need to use bend stop

635
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,559
filtering and high pass filtering to

636
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,039
filter the side effects

637
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,200
we do some noise reduction uh we do some

638
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,200
normalization basically we scale the

639
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,400
signal to the scale of zero to one

640
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,200
we do some noise reduction uh we

641
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,720
basically apply for those of you are

642
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,880
familiar with spectral subtraction

643
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,200
this is a classic uh

644
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,080
method being used to reduce noise

645
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,480
and finally we apply the equalizer that

646
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,840
we designed at the beginning in order to

647
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,600
uh basically balance the frequency

648
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,039
response of each of the components in

649
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,360
the spectrum

650
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,360
now

651
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,200
the first thing that we try to do is to

652
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,120
recover non-speech audio

653
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,679
and in order to do so we play two famous

654
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,320
songs in the target office the first one

655
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,640
was let it be by the beatles and the

656
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,240
second one was

657
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,159
clocks by coldplay

658
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,000
we obtained the optical measurements and

659
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,640
we recovered the signals using the

660
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,200
transformation the optical acoustical

661
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,840
transformation that i've presented uh in

662
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,000
the previous slide

663
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,120
and

664
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,559
on the left side you can see the raw

665
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,480
data this is the raw optical

666
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,720
measurements that were obtained from

667
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,320
uh the optical uh from the photodiode

668
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,320
in the middle you can see

669
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,400
how the signals uh

670
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,960
looks at the end of the process

671
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,960
and on the right side you can see the

672
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,440
original signals that were played

673
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,559
by the speakers or via the speakers okay

674
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,159
now for many of you it doesn't says a

675
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,080
lot because this is completely visual so

676
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,600
let me just try to play you the

677
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,000
recoveries and what i want to show you

678
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,440
is that shazam

679
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,440
and sound hound are able to uh to

680
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,200
basically identify the recoveries

681
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,279
because they are very high quality so

682
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,360
the first recovery

683
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,279
is this and let me know that you are

684
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,000
able to hear it

685
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,279
okay this is the recovery of clocks by

686
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,120
coldplay and the second one is the

687
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,559
recovery of

688
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,600
let it be by details

689
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:09,360
[Music]

690
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,360
okay i think that you can see that

691
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,480
shazam

692
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,720
able to recognize them and to identify

693
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,760
them

694
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,120
the quality is

695
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,120
very good

696
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,679
now the next thing that we try to do is

697
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,159
to recover speech audio and in order to

698
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,720
do so we play the famous famous

699
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,720
statement made by president the former

700
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,840
president of the u.s mr donald trump we

701
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,080
will make america great again and we

702
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,679
obtain the optical measurements and we

703
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,360
use the optical acoustical

704
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,919
transformation to recover sound

705
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,279
and basically as you can see these are

706
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,159
the results um

707
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,279
on the left side you can see the

708
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,919
original uh

709
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,279
optical measurements that were obtained

710
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,440
from the photodiode in the middle you

711
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,760
can see the recovered signal and in the

712
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,120
right side

713
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,080
you can see the original signal that was

714
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,440
played from the speakers

715
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,600
now i want to show you uh i want to play

716
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,480
you the uh the recovery and as you can

717
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,559
see google text to speech engine able to

718
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,880
basically recognize and transcribe the

719
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,279
results

720
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,279
okay

721
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,039
great again

722
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,640
okay i hope that you were able to hear

723
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,880
it this is president donald trump we

724
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,880
will make america great again as you can

725
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,880
see google text to speech engine was

726
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,200
also able to transcribe it correctly

727
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,960
accurately

728
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,840
so let's uh uh try to conclude lanfon

729
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,240
and a few notes about this method

730
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,039
so in the experiments performed in this

731
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,320
research

732
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,399
we actually used a small distance

733
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,039
between the uh i would say the victim or

734
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,520
the speakers and the light bulb

735
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,840
basically the recoveries are the result

736
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,399
of uh five centimeters this is something

737
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,360
it's between the light bulb and the

738
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,200
victim okay and also we use very high uh

739
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,600
uh sound very high uh sound level in

740
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,080
order to uh to perform this uh

741
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,360
experiments

742
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,880
however

743
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,880
by using more professional equipment and

744
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,200
basically this is day to day and the

745
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,720
optical and the photo diode that

746
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,480
we are using um we were able to extend

747
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,880
this uh distance between

748
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,799
the light bulb and the speakers or the

749
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,760
victim to 50 centimeters okay 50

750
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,559
centimeters is something like this

751
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:35,279
now uh and also we were able to recover

752
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,679
it from i would say normal uh speech

753
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,600
level normal speech level is about the

754
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,840
level of a virtual meeting 70 to 75

755
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,279
decibels and we're able to produce

756
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:46,799
somehow

757
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,559
perceptible sound um i wanna

758
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,399
show you the demonstrations you are

759
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,880
about to see uh you are about to hear

760
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,039
demonstration of

761
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,200
recoveries of we will make america great

762
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,760
again from 25 meters between the light

763
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,960
bulb and

764
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,559
the uh

765
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,200
and the speakers which were recovered

766
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,760
from 50 meters 25 meters 35 meters and

767
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,440
45 meters

768
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,919
and we will start with the original

769
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:19,600
we will make america great again

770
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,000
[Music]

771
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,640
this is 15 meters

772
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,799
[Music]

773
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:34,080
this is 25 meters

774
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:37,559
[Music]

775
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:41,760
this is 35 meters

776
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,159
okay so probably some of you i wonder if

777
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,720
it's only like a half of a meter which

778
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,880
is something like this uh what is where

779
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,799
is length on make sense so basically

780
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,799
length makes more sense

781
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,600
in terms of the threat model um as a

782
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,840
method to recover sound from a desktop

783
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,880
light bulb

784
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,760
okay in offices setups now think about

785
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,520
how the conversation that you do in

786
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,520
front of a desktop uh where in on on top

787
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,159
of the desktop there is a light bulb

788
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,720
located uh on top of it

789
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,760
and this is because the standard depth

790
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,039
of desks

791
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,440
is usually 60 centimeters okay so from

792
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,919
25 centimeters this is about the half of

793
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:23,840
the depth and 50 centimeters this is

794
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,880
almost uh the uh i would say the the

795
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,440
depth of uh a standard

796
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,799
um

797
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,640
a standard desktop so this is where

798
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,960
landform makes more sense in terms of

799
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,120
its threat model okay as a method to

800
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,760
recover sound from a light bulb placed

801
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,480
on top of a desktop while you're doing a

802
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,240
conversation whether it's

803
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,240
a virtual conversation whether it's a

804
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,000
physical conversation whether it's a

805
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,840
phone conversation

806
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,279
this is where you should be worried

807
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:52,720
about the

808
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,320
lymphoma

809
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,840
now we will make

810
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,320
the next uh the second reset that we did

811
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,399
in this category we named it the glom

812
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:03,600
attack

813
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,880
and

814
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,279
the glom attack is a different type of

815
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,600
method it's also a method that converts

816
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,559
light to sound however in this case

817
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:13,600
um

818
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,519
the gramata converts optical

819
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,919
measurements obtained from a device

820
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,600
power led

821
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,000
okay to sound

822
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,840
and this is a tempest attack for those

823
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,320
of you are familiar with tempest attack

824
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,200
this can be done by the way because

825
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,360
the power led of various devices and i'm

826
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,200
about to show that most of the devices

827
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,240
are basically vulnerable to this attack

828
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,919
the power led the various devices is

829
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,720
connected directly to the power line

830
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,120
and as a result the intensity of the

831
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,840
power led correlates to the power

832
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,840
consumption of the device

833
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,760
okay and

834
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,279
also many devices lack a dedicated means

835
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:56,720
of countering this phenomenon

836
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,080
now this is glom's attack threat model

837
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,000
okay

838
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,600
basically assume that there is a sound

839
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,679
which is the result of a virtual meeting

840
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,039
that is being done in an office

841
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,519
the sound displayed by a connected

842
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,559
speaker or connected speakers it create

843
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:17,519
changes in the power consumption of

844
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,200
the power led

845
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,600
of either the speakers themselves or

846
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,080
either for example usb hub which is

847
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,200
connected to the speakers and

848
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,960
ear stoppers basically obtain the

849
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,120
optical measurements from the power led

850
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,159
of the speakers or from the power leds

851
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,559
of the usb hub and recover sound from it

852
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,640
using a photodiode

853
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,760
okay so this is the glom

854
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,000
now the first thing that we do is a nice

855
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,559
experiment where we try to analyze uh

856
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,039
why exactly this is even possible

857
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:54,640
so a usb hub in this experiment was used

858
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,559
to provide power

859
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,039
to usb speakers okay via of course the

860
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,880
usb cable

861
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,880
and we played the frequency scan a chip

862
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,760
or a sweep from the speakers

863
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,080
and we obtained four signals okay two of

864
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:08,880
them

865
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,279
were signals of the power consumption of

866
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:14,159
the speakers in the usb hub

867
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,559
and two optical signals

868
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,720
that were obtained from the power led of

869
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,360
the usb hub and the power led of the

870
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,480
speakers

871
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,480
okay so we have a chair

872
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,720
two uh um

873
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,399
optical signals and two power

874
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,640
consumption signals and which were

875
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,360
obtained from speakers and usb hubs and

876
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,279
usb hub

877
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,799
and this is the result

878
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,000
on the left side you can see the

879
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,480
original uh audio that was played from

880
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,760
the speakers

881
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,919
okay in the middle you can see uh

882
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:47,600
the power measurements the power

883
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,000
consumption measurements of both devices

884
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,840
the speakers on the on top and

885
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,000
ah sorry uh on the middle you can see

886
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
the the power measurements of the

887
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,960
speakers and the on top and on the

888
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,399
bottom you can see the optical

889
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,239
measurements of the speakers and on the

890
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,760
right side you can see

891
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,359
the power measurements obtained from the

892
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,280
usb up and the optical measurements

893
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,599
obtained via the

894
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:20,560
power led of the usb hub and the first

895
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,159
conclusion that you can see is that the

896
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,480
power consumption and the intensity of

897
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,040
the power indicator led

898
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,159
of both the speakers and the usb hub

899
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,359
okay

900
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,760
correlate with the sound that was played

901
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,679
from the speakers okay you can see the

902
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,320
original uh um frequency scan that was

903
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,480
played from the uh from the speakers and

904
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,079
you can spot it in the power

905
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,599
measurements and also in the optical

906
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,079
measurements as well

907
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,000
now the next thing that you can see is

908
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,399
that the manufacturers of the the the

909
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,480
manufacturers of these devices

910
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,960
do not distort or change the non-linear

911
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,400
response of the intensity of an led

912
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,640
to power consumption and this can easily

913
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,480
be done by integrating filters and

914
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,440
voltage stabilizers into the electrical

915
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,800
uh circuits okay if they would

916
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,119
do it you won't be able to spot this

917
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:12,640
frequency scan inside the power

918
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,599
measurements or inside uh the uh

919
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,880
the uh optical measurements

920
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,320
and

921
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,079
one last thing that you can see is that

922
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,359
these devices leak information regarding

923
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,839
the sound played by the speakers okay

924
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,599
you can see it you can spot the chip

925
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,040
function you can

926
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,000
in the

927
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,920
power measurements and in

928
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,440
the optical measurements that was

929
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,480
obtained from the power led

930
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,960
and the first conclusion that we made is

931
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,000
that if stoppers can exploit this fact

932
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,320
to recover sound directly

933
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,560
from the power indicator and if the led

934
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,240
of the speakers

935
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,599
moreover

936
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,320
if stoppers can exploit this fact

937
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,119
to recover sound indirectly

938
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,760
from the usb hub that was used

939
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,599
to provide power to the speakers okay so

940
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,680
you can go directly from the speakers

941
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,560
and indirectly from the usb hub

942
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,119
from the power led

943
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,880
now so probably some of you i wonder um

944
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,040
which devices are vulnerable to this uh

945
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,119
attack to this to the glom attack so in

946
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,680
two words i would say that many devices

947
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,640
um

948
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,640
there are smart assistants which are

949
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,960
google home mini and google nest audio

950
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,760
and

951
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,440
speakers the greatest manufacturers of

952
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,960
the of speakers which are jbl creative

953
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,640
pebel logitech and sony and beach which

954
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,040
was acquired by apple

955
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,400
and also you have

956
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,359
uh

957
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:44,640
tp-link and mirror case for the usb hubs

958
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,000
and interestingly you also have some

959
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,280
microcontrollers for example the

960
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,520
raspberry pi 3 and four also leak

961
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,760
information via their

962
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,800
power led

963
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,480
so i think that you will agree with me

964
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,200
that the problem is universal okay many

965
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,680
devices leak information from the power

966
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,560
led

967
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,680
um regarding the sound played by the

968
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,200
speakers

969
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,880
and the recovered scenario as you can

970
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,240
see on top

971
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,119
is basically depends on the device

972
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,119
and is affected by the intensity of the

973
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:17,680
power indicator led

974
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,280
of the device

975
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,599
and some other factors which

976
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,839
i will say for those of you for the q a

977
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:26,720
if you are interested

978
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,280
okay so we made the the next experiment

979
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,200
we actually recovered speech from

980
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,359
various devices by obtaining optical

981
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:37,040
measurements from the power led of these

982
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,320
devices and we actually used um we

983
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,720
actually played the sentence uh don't

984
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,359
ask me to carry an oily rag like that

985
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,280
you can see the original spectrogram and

986
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,359
wiener and logitech are the two speakers

987
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:51,200
and tp link and mirror case are the two

988
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,839
usb hubs and i want to play you the

989
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,720
recovered signals so you'll be able to

990
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,320
uh to hear them you're about the first

991
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,839
two that you will hear

992
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:01,760
were recovered from the power light of

993
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,880
the speakers and the other two that you

994
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,720
will hear at the end were recovered from

995
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,279
the usb hubs

996
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:18,869
[Music]

997
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,880
okay so in this case we were able to

998
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,119
recover it from about five meters

999
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,880
however we wanted to

1000
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,880
however we wanted to do some a more

1001
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,960
interesting experiment in order to test

1002
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,800
how we were able to the quality of the

1003
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,480
recovered sound as a function of the

1004
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,960
distance between the eavesdropper and

1005
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,800
the target device okay the target device

1006
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,280
was in this case speakers so we place

1007
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,280
the speakers and we place the ease

1008
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,720
dropping equipment basically the

1009
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,800
photodiode and the telescope from 15

1010
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,640
meters 25 meters and 35 meters and

1011
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,480
let me

1012
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,200
play you the recoveries

1013
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,200
this is from 5 meters to 15 meters 25

1014
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,320
meters and again 35 meters

1015
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:11,240
this is we will make america great again

1016
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:21,639
[Music]

1017
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,480
okay

1018
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,680
so we actually uh this brings us to the

1019
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,320
last uh research that we uh intend to

1020
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,880
publish next year and again you are you

1021
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,880
are the first to hear about groom and

1022
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,000
also about this research we named it the

1023
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,880
little seal bug um it was quartered by

1024
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,800
myself uh rasuisa

1025
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,520
and let me try to explain you what is

1026
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,480
the little seal bag the little seal bug

1027
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,680
converts optical measurements obtained

1028
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,960
from light

1029
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,319
reflected from shiny objects okay

1030
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:13,839
to sound

1031
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:15,440
and this can be done

1032
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,319
because lightweight shiny objects

1033
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:19,440
vibrate

1034
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,680
when sound hits their surface

1035
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,720
and moreover shiny objects reflects

1036
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,959
sound

1037
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,839
now basically the idea resembles to the

1038
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:32,400
idea discussed in length however in this

1039
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,440
case

1040
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,839
we are not converting the light

1041
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:40,560
from uh a device which produces light

1042
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,800
okay we actually convert light from

1043
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,040
reflections of the light

1044
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:50,160
on uh a nearby object okay now

1045
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,599
basically the little seal bug threat

1046
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,359
model goes as follows

1047
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:56,079
um we assume that sound

1048
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,680
basically uh

1049
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,160
which can be done of which is probably

1050
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,760
the result of a conversation made in the

1051
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,440
room creates fluctuations on the surface

1052
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,800
of a shiny object which reflects light

1053
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,240
now prob some of you probably wonder

1054
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,599
what are these

1055
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:14,240
uh shiny objects so

1056
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,960
before i came to here to abu dhabi i uh

1057
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,440
was in dubai i bought these two nice um

1058
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,359
khalifa statues

1059
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:25,440
these are the type of the things that

1060
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,160
can be used to recover sound because

1061
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,240
they are shiny and as a result they

1062
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,240
reflect light

1063
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,400
that hits their surface

1064
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,400
okay we didn't use these specific

1065
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,400
statues in this uh research we use her

1066
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,920
equipment let me show it to you

1067
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,359
this was the this was basically the

1068
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,520
equipment that we used to recover sound

1069
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,240
okay you can see a master coffee i can

1070
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,400
you can see a stand for smartphone and

1071
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,800
you can see a different type of statute

1072
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,640
statute of a bird that was used to

1073
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,599
convert

1074
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:00,800
light

1075
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,720
to sound okay based on the reflections

1076
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,440
of light on its surface

1077
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,680
now

1078
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,599
the entire recovery in this case is the

1079
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:14,560
same as in global attack as uh also as

1080
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,640
in length attack

1081
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,599
again

1082
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:19,920
the eavesdropper in this case directs a

1083
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,280
photodiode

1084
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,920
towards the uh shiny

1085
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,119
object

1086
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,280
and obtain the optical measurements and

1087
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,560
converts them to sound using the same

1088
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,319
algorithm or the same transformation

1089
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:36,000
that i've presented a few slides ago

1090
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:37,920
and this is basically the evaluation

1091
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,400
setup okay you can see the telescope on

1092
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,839
the left side and you can see on the

1093
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:45,040
right side how the this nice statutes of

1094
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,599
this night uh what we call the little

1095
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:51,040
sea bugs are placed on uh on

1096
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,720
on a desktop

1097
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,640
probably some of you

1098
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,960
have this type of objects

1099
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,359
on the desktop some of them even reflect

1100
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:00,800
slide

1101
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,359
master can copy you can see

1102
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:05,520
basically the standard object that some

1103
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,680
of you maybe even got from this

1104
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,400
conference as well

1105
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,839
by the way i just want to mention that

1106
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,280
completely passive

1107
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,119
there is nothing inside of them

1108
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:16,960
completely passive objects were used to

1109
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,960
recover some

1110
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,079
okay so we actually you're about to hear

1111
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:25,280
the recoveries of uh she had your dark

1112
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,480
suit in greasy wash water all year

1113
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,280
um

1114
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,359
you will at the uh at the beginning here

1115
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,839
the original one and you will see the

1116
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:37,040
recoveries from the objects

1117
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,839
she had your dark suit greasy wash water

1118
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:41,150
all year

1119
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:44,199
[Music]

1120
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:57,839
[Music]

1121
00:43:57,839 --> 00:43:59,839
okay so i just want to mention one thing

1122
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:01,839
the last thing that you this thing that

1123
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:04,160
you're seeing in here is basically uh a

1124
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,960
blind shutter okay this is venetian

1125
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,440
blind shutter they are commonly used in

1126
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,480
offices

1127
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,640
we are able to recover sound from these

1128
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,920
shadow blinds

1129
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,400
this is a device which is intended to

1130
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,440
secure the privacy of individuals inside

1131
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,359
the room who are able to recover sound

1132
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,760
beca from it because it's light and it

1133
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,839
is shiny and as a result it reflects

1134
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:28,079
sound so we use

1135
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:30,800
this nice equipment to recover speech

1136
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,119
from it

1137
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,040
now i would like to conclude this uh

1138
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,920
basically the the talk that i gave

1139
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,400
and i would start by uh

1140
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,520
mentioning that landform and glom attack

1141
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,160
were published in the last year or yes

1142
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,800
last year and a half by our group and

1143
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,560
we're about to publish a new research

1144
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,279
next year

1145
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:57,520
we wonder however

1146
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,920
how old they really are

1147
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,480
and it seems that in the area of sound

1148
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,599
eavesdropping academia is many years

1149
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:08,319
behind rnd departments of secret

1150
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:11,200
agencies and let me explain why

1151
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,640
so for those of you are not familiar

1152
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,920
with this nice picture this is the great

1153
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,280
seal bug okay this is a spying equipment

1154
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,040
that was concealed inside a gift given

1155
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,160
by the soviet union to the united states

1156
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,560
ambassador to the soviet union around

1157
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,839
world war ii in

1158
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:34,160
1945 okay it contains an rfid inside of

1159
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,079
it and it was completely passive it was

1160
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:38,720
given by the russians to the americans

1161
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,359
to the american ambassador um

1162
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:44,480
and it took the americans about six

1163
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,520
years

1164
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,560
uh six or six years uh to basically

1165
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,960
understand this is not a gift and this

1166
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,400
is a spying equipment and during the

1167
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,400
entire six years it was used by the

1168
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:57,280
soviets to eavesdrop the conversations

1169
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,720
of the ambassador inside its embassy

1170
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:05,040
now why do i ever show it to you so

1171
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,800
this buying equipment is considered the

1172
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:11,680
predecessor of the rfid technology okay

1173
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:16,400
it was used by the soviets in 1945

1174
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,720
and it took the americans three decades

1175
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,440
about three decades until it was

1176
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:25,119
patented in america

1177
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:30,400
as an rfid technology and as you can uh

1178
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,839
as it is now being used in our

1179
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:34,880
smartphones and uh some other equipment

1180
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,280
okay so it took

1181
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,119
basically um

1182
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:40,960
the public not exactly the public but

1183
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,440
researchers three decades

1184
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,240
to

1185
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,079
basically develop

1186
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,800
a device that was used three decades

1187
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,079
before

1188
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:51,599
commercially to

1189
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:55,040
uh eavesdrop sound by the soviets

1190
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,599
so it seems that rnd departments of

1191
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:00,079
secret agencies lead the innovation in

1192
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:02,079
the area of eavesdropping

1193
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:04,000
in three decades okay

1194
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,839
i would say comparing to the rest of the

1195
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:07,520
contestants

1196
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,520
this can be for example academia or even

1197
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,760
industry

1198
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,400
and let's return back to the glom attack

1199
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,560
and landform attacks and

1200
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,319
i would say that electro-optical

1201
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:19,599
eavesdopping

1202
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:22,160
suffers from various limitations okay

1203
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,520
first of all

1204
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,000
expensive equipment yields better

1205
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,720
results okay if you have a better a2d if

1206
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,800
you have a better photo diode

1207
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,040
the quality of the sound that is

1208
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,480
recovered from

1209
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,359
uh

1210
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:38,240
or by the these attacks is expected to

1211
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,359
be higher or better

1212
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,040
moreover attackers need to have a line

1213
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,400
of sight

1214
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,119
to

1215
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:49,599
the basically the the device or the

1216
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,599
object which emits

1217
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:53,119
light

1218
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:55,839
and as you can as you can understand

1219
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:58,079
this attacks can basically

1220
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:00,720
applied by professionals okay and shows

1221
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,559
will probably struggle if they do not

1222
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:05,280
know some dsp and some other things in

1223
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,480
audio dsp

1224
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,319
they're probably not going to be able to

1225
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:10,240
recover the sound from the optical

1226
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,559
measurements however i would like to end

1227
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:14,000
with two interesting questions for you

1228
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,920
don't ask them just hear them

1229
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,240
the first one is

1230
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,880
do you consider uh an expensive

1231
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,359
equipment a relimitation

1232
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:26,160
to secret agencies that spend

1233
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,720
basically unlimited amount of resources

1234
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,599
in order to recover sound for the last

1235
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:34,319
70 or 80 years don't answer it just

1236
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:36,160
think about it i claim that the first

1237
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,240
limitation is not a real limitation for

1238
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,559
these agencies

1239
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:43,920
and if we learn something from the past

1240
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:44,800
um

1241
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,960
maybe and i'm just saying maybe

1242
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,040
it is possible that electro-optical

1243
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,480
eavesdropping

1244
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,079
has been used

1245
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:53,920
for three decades

1246
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,000
without

1247
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,559
our awareness by these agencies to

1248
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:01,520
recover sounds from power led that are

1249
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,960
probably integrated to devices uh

1250
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:07,119
before that i was even born or from

1251
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:09,280
hanging light bulbs that are very

1252
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,359
popular for the last i'm not sure how

1253
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:14,480
many decades even before i was born um

1254
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:17,040
again this is only something to think of

1255
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,359
um nothing else you need to be uh

1256
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,440
answered in here

1257
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:22,240
now

1258
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,520
i'm about to take questions from the

1259
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,599
audience if you have some um i want to

1260
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:27,599
thank you for attending this talk

1261
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:30,720
asking for 15 minutes of your time is uh

1262
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,160
a large request

1263
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,740
and i hope that

1264
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:35,440
[Music]

1265
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,240

00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,240
um i enjoy talking with people and

1287
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,720
discussing with people um whatever you

1288
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,280
want by the way i do some freelancing

1289
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,880
work again if you want to discuss about

1290
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,559
this type of collaboration

1291
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,079
come and join me and we'll discuss about

1292
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:44,800
it

we will have a short

1298
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,520
turn off for the next speaker in any

1299
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,520
moment i will announce the next speaker

1300
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:19,000
thank you very much

1301
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,280
