1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,000
right good evening welcome back to hack

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,839
in the box studio

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:09,760
we are

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,400
towards the tail end of

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,799
hack in the box cyber week 2021 my name

6
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,239
is saw shah

7
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,279
and

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,680
for the final uh discussion with our

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,000
guests i am joined by two

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,080
very near and dear friends of mine

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,880
christopher moon from realize he's the

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,039
co-founder of realize welcome to the

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,840
studio christopharo thank you and uh a

14
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,600
long-running friend of mine

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,840
adam laurie i've had the pleasure of

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,559
knowing him as a major malfunction

17
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,920
adam works with ibm x-force

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,800
and adam and christopharo

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,840
have

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,280
you know most uh

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,280
graciously agreed to spend this time

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,520
with us in the studio

23
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,399
we um

24
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,719
we just pretty much gonna have an

25
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,879
informal conversation

26
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,520
adam i've known you since 1999. is it

27
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,559
that long

28
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,159
it's been that long

29
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,720
it's like you are out there as a defcon

30
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,680
goon

31
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,799
um

32
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,600
you are the closest person i can i know

33
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,200
who is like q

34
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,799
from james bond

35
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,799
because you can do all those things and

36
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,880
even more and what's more i've seen you

37
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,920
do that

38
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,680
from uh

39
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,640
replaying infrared infrared signals from

40
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,720
tv remotes

41
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,840
um

42
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,320
rfid doors

43
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,000
satellites

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,840
and every time i hear you speak you're

45
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,759
doing something completely different and

46
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,880
then you go like way deep into it

47
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,439
i would love to discuss more of your

48
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,439
past research and your present research

49
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,960
what you're doing

50
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,720
christopharo i've also known you as a

51
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,119
good friend since many years

52
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,200
it was an honor that you were a student

53
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,840
in my class at one point that's true um

54
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,920
and i wish to be a student in your class

55
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,200
at some point

56
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,240
in the

57
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,079
not so far future in fact in the next

58
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,520
couple of years

59
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,840
uh christopher has been basically

60
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,399
attacking

61
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,160
several areas

62
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,440
of

63
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,200
this rectangle that we carry in our

64
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,959
pockets typically called a mobile device

65
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,800
christopher and his colleague have

66
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,800
worked extensively on

67
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,480
attacking the trusted execution

68
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,239
environment typically known as trust

69
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,120
zone

70
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,040
and also work on secure boot

71
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,280
and exploiting secure boot environments

72
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,640
to me this both your fields like your

73
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,800
wizardry with with electromagnetic

74
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,360
signals and radio frequencies adam and

75
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,040
your expertise

76
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,599
in the layer below the operating system

77
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,760
and slightly above the hardware it's

78
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,599
like a very thin layer that you operate

79
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,720
on

80
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,720
these are areas unknown to me i mean i

81
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,800
am a user space and a kernel guy and

82
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,080
then like my world view ends over there

83
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,519
so

84
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,440
one of my selfish reasons of bringing in

85
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,519
the studios i just wanted to learn

86
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:02,959
firsthand from you

87
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,879
what is it uh what is it that brought

88
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,879
you here what is it that you do and what

89
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,040
do you what are the next things to come

90
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,959
i know adam you have to uh i'll let you

91
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,480
go first

92
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,400
well it's kind of funny because most of

93
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,720
the stuff you know what you referenced

94
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,400
in your introduction and thank you by

95
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,840
the way for inviting me it's a real

96
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,319
honor to be here um and lovely to see

97
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,239
you again after so many

98
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,760
months in isolation i know um

99
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,799
but

100
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,560
most of the things that i look at are

101
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,080
actually in plain sight and it's like

102
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,840
even though you can't physically see

103
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,760
them the thing i always find amusing is

104
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,920
the protocols that are being used that

105
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,599
are so insecure

106
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,280
are being transmitted

107
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,599
in plain text but because they're going

108
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,440
by rf or infrared or

109
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,200
you know magic moonbeams as i like to

110
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,879
say whatever

111
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,720
because you can't see them people assume

112
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,080
they don't need to worry about the

113
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,280
security

114
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,799
so my kind of speciality i guess is is

115
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,319
spotting uh these invisible signals that

116
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,319
are actually right there for everyone to

117
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,799
see if they just looked using the right

118
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,439
technologies or the right spectrum so

119
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,439
essentially just like the physical layer

120
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,759
changes right it's uh yeah it's a

121
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,519
protocol we're typically used to having

122
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,600
it over the ethernet or over

123
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,919
maybe serial port or

124
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,520
if you're if you know you're the cool

125
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,720
kid extra 25 yeah but then you go above

126
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,240
and beyond to

127
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,479
to anything that talks a protocol over

128
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,560
any magic moon beam yeah that and that's

129
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,479
exactly right so you know things like

130
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,120
mag stripes then became

131
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,280
nfc but the data that's being

132
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,600
transmitted is exactly the same

133
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,240
um serial data connecting mobile phones

134
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,759
in the early days where you physically

135
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,040
plug the cable in then became infrared

136
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,759
then became bluetooth but the actual

137
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,600
data and the conversation that's being

138
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,919
had over those mediums

139
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,840
are following the original plan which

140
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,919
was not secure because it's a directly

141
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,759
connected physical

142
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,680
wire you know you're plugging a cable in

143
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,759
so that's a private conversation but

144
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,000
then when it moved to infrared suddenly

145
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,080
it's a broadcast conversation

146
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,960
but they didn't add any security so

147
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,960
so essentially anybody who rocks up with

148
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,080
a device

149
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,280
that emits those magic moon beams can

150
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,680
can take over exactly you can sniff them

151
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,120
understand what's going on and then

152
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,600
rebroadcast them and take over so and

153
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,320
it's up to the protocol to figure out if

154
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,080
for the designers to think if this could

155
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,400
possibly happen or not yeah and then

156
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,919
whenever there's a change of physical

157
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,000
medium they should also be a you know

158
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,440
they should step back

159
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,600
and rethink well have i introduced a new

160
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,759
attack surface or am i just going to

161
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,360
take my existing

162
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,720
protocol and and present it to the world

163
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,720
without any modifications even though

164
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,400
the attack surface has completely

165
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,919
changed yep

166
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,400
crazy and i can vouch for that because

167
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,440
he's opened up hotel safes

168
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,639
he's

169
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,840
changed photographs on passports while

170
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,840
they were in the protective covers being

171
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,840
shipped in transit

172
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,400
he's opened up uh

173
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,240
training venue doors when i returned

174
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,759
from lunch a little too early and there

175
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,240
was no staff and i really wanted to get

176
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,080
in so he's like pulled out his laptop

177
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,160
click click click click the door open

178
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,600
and you go

179
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,400
i've seen you do all that it's like

180
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,360
you make it sound really easy but

181
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,440
to even a person like me it's it's it's

182
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,560
magic

183
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,800
thank you but uh i mean it's just

184
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,319
being observant we actually had this

185
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,440
conversation last night over dinner um

186
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,880
talking about

187
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,199
being observant to the things that are

188
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,120
going on around you and that's probably

189
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,280
one of the biggest sort of hacker

190
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,160
mindset things is that we don't just

191
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,160
accept things for what they are as soon

192
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,680
as we see something we want to

193
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,160
understand well why does it behave like

194
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,039
that

195
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,880
so when we see it again and it behaves

196
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,880
differently we notice the difference

197
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,720
okay and then we're like oh well

198
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,319
something's not right there it behaves

199
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,840
slightly differently

200
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,199
so therefore

201
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,759
and that's the that whole process is is

202
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,560
how you lead into breaking things um i

203
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,599
also attended your dvb tuner

204
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,360
talk at one point where you were

205
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,280
figuring out what type of satellite it

206
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,039
might be aiming it

207
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,759
at that time i realized that

208
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,840
what you mentioned is is right like if

209
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,479
you have a dvd tuner that's great you

210
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,199
could get these signals but then

211
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,720
connecting them to generic software

212
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,520
and scripts or tools that you can plug

213
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,039
in and interface

214
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,039
like how easy

215
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,160
is it for you to find drivers or

216
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,160
adapters or shims for these

217
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,400
um generally it's pretty easy and

218
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,199
actually uh you know i'm i'm lazy i'm

219
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,960
one of the lazy hackers that tries not

220
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,599
to write code when i don't have to yep

221
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:56,400
so

222
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,400
you will find that the manufacturers of

223
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,479
the hardware of course they they want to

224
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,400
sell it into a market and they want that

225
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,560
market to be as big as possible

226
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,639
so generally they will you know they'll

227
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,639
write drivers for linux or windows or

228
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,960
whatever so you just have to do a bit of

229
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,639
digging and

230
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,160
very often what you're dealing with is a

231
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,560
white label product so you know that the

232
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,479
logo on the product

233
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,560
might not be the actual manufacturer so

234
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,319
you do a bit of digging to figure out

235
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,479
who really made it what the oem is who

236
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,400
the oem is and then go and find their

237
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,840
software and then hey presto

238
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,599
and really like all of us i'm standing

239
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,120
on the shoulders of giants you know

240
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,320
other people

241
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,479
have done the work for me i'm just

242
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,799
adding another little step

243
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,399
using tools that were probably designed

244
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,320
for something totally different like

245
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,880
building a set top tv box for

246
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,200
hotel networks right to sell as a

247
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,800
commercial product and i say oh well i

248
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,720
could use that as a hacking tool they've

249
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,680
done 99 of the work for me i just have

250
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,399
to add this little one on top so

251
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,279
i mean one one other takeaway from the

252
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,279
from seeing you in action was when

253
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,040
you're brute forcing the

254
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,959
hotel tv network

255
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,560
all you're doing is literally like

256
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,200
playing out keys on the tv remote

257
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,800
figuring out what codes were being

258
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,640
emitted and then trying all the codes

259
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,560
that were not being emitted

260
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,720
that was the first time it you know

261
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,200
light went off in my mind saying uh

262
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,959
this is what you know

263
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,000
inverse fuzzing is and uh

264
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,600
but question to you is

265
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,839
that thing happened

266
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,080
almost 20 years ago it happened in

267
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,240
washington dc i know that very well

268
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,200
um and and q our friend q was in that

269
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,000
same room yeah

270
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,200
why have things not changed

271
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,880
that's such a good question i'd love to

272
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,519
see you here but why are we still here

273
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,040
we have this congress i mean it's a

274
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,200
running joke in our industry

275
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,760
that we work really hard and yet nothing

276
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,440
gets better so

277
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,519
what are we doing wrong um

278
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,279
people make the same mistakes over and

279
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,200
over again

280
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,959
they like to take the shortcut like we

281
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,600
do you know where as hackers we we take

282
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,680
existing code and we build on it the

283
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,839
same is true of developers the same is

284
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:08,800
true of

285
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,279
startups you know they have an idea

286
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,200
they want to get it to market as fast as

287
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,640
possible they just take what's come

288
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,000
before

289
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,959
and use that so that that comes with it

290
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,560
a legacy of

291
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,200
problems great and

292
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,839
you know people don't prioritize those

293
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,839
problems they're like no we get it to

294
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,240
market first we can worry about that

295
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,079
later and that's the same story we've

296
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,399
been hearing for 20 30 years

297
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,680
is uh is proprietary also

298
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,920
ironically a synonym for security

299
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,560
because you know we make it so ergo

300
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,839
nobody's going to make it so who the

301
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,600
hell is going to find it

302
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,839
security by obscurity never works i mean

303
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,839
i'm a big believer in open source that's

304
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,279
what i've been since

305
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,480
day one

306
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,680
um

307
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,440
and you you know you're seeing a lot of

308
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,240
problems take uh y2k for example that

309
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,320
wasn't a security problem yeah that was

310
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,560
an operational problem yep in the open

311
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,399
source world all the problems were

312
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,720
resolved like two years before the date

313
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,440
change right in the closed source world

314
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,839
it up to the last minute i mean and and

315
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,959
beyond they were

316
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,839
i mean thank you for letting me in your

317
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,920
training earlier this week it was

318
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,720
actually the first time i got to

319
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,720
another epiphany happened

320
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,200
when you mentioned that

321
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,760
we as exploit writers i write exploits i

322
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,839
teach how to do that as well we don't

323
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,560
look at this dimension at all we spend

324
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,640
so much time breaking

325
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,800
the exploit mechanism mitigation

326
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,120
mechanisms that are put in place

327
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,560
but all you have to do is look at a

328
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,120
layer below if we look at those read and

329
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,639
write primitives that you mentioned the

330
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,600
whole trusted environment opened up in a

331
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,440
way

332
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,600
i won't even begin to know where to look

333
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,440
for these things but that got me

334
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,360
questioning that is this thing that i'm

335
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,160
carrying in my pocket so proudly being

336
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,399
touted as hey you know

337
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,240
it's it's it's a very very secure

338
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,480
environment like

339
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,760
how

340
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,680
how insecure is it compared to an

341
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,680
average pc

342
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,680
i think that's also a very good question

343
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,120
thank you so much for having me here

344
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,040
honestly i think that like

345
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,480
everything

346
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,800
is by default insecure but the point is

347
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,720
that it can be insecure in ways that you

348
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,720
don't expect right and that is the

349
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,079
important part

350
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,160
honestly i

351
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,399
one of my favorite things i think if i

352
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,720
should describe what i like to do in uh

353
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,720
in a nutshell is i like failing

354
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,320
assumptions

355
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,639
okay so basically

356
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,480
there is an entire world of people

357
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,560
actually look for softer vulnerability i

358
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,800
won't exploit in a in a common way we

359
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,720
have a very broad literature now

360
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,480
techniques and so on but those

361
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,160
techniques have been built mostly under

362
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,240
the assumption that you have

363
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,800
one cpu executing code that you have

364
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,920
some memory that is uh being used for

365
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,200
such tasks

366
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,160
and basically that's it

367
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,000
this is not anymore like this since like

368
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,800
these 20 years we don't leave it under

369
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,279
the illusion of any one core we are

370
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,560
already 12.

371
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,880
our system are so much complex that

372
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,959
thinking that they have only one cpu

373
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,959
because we want to think like that it's

374
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,320
again an illusion so nowadays basically

375
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,079
what you have in hand is a very complex

376
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,040
system

377
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,639
and you think that the part you should

378
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,120
secure of that is only what is executed

379
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,040
on the main cpu

380
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,680
so there are many ways of failing that

381
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,199
illusion

382
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,079
that

383
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,160
are way beyond your single cpu which you

384
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,160
have the layers below but you have also

385
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,160
the components which are outside of your

386
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,199
cpu which may fail the current boundary

387
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,279
so basically your security model only

388
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,399
exists it's an illusion of your cpu

389
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,279
it's not a system level illusion so this

390
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,639
means that the system may completely

391
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,959
disregard what you think is the security

392
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,720
model that is not the security model of

393
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,639
the phone there is a series model that

394
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,240
runs on your cpu that you would like to

395
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,760
see

396
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,639
this yeah i opened up my introduction

397
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,720
saying that i'm a user space and kernel

398
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,079
guy and this is exactly what i've been

399
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,920
trained in like i have been seeing this

400
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,800
diagram that here's the software here's

401
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,440
the kernel here's the cpu and here are

402
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,680
the peripherals i only see that

403
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,959
rectangle and

404
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,920
a ceiling yeah it's it's a yeah

405
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,279
so basically

406
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,880
like your the cpu that we usually

407
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,360
discuss that we typically use and we see

408
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,440
the result from

409
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,120
well there are many others for example

410
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,399
think about having an ethernet

411
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,880
controller on the device you have also

412
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,199
in many cases wi-fi sock which is an

413
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,839
entire server which executes code you

414
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,680
have a base band you have a gpu which

415
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,519
selects a youtube code you have a video

416
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,120
decoder which have firmware you have an

417
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,199
audio decoder with your firmware

418
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,800
so there are many of these devices which

419
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,199
are firmware so we call them execution

420
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,279
units because they're able to execute

421
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,399
code when you think about not cpu but

422
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,160
execution units

423
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,800
think about that there may be tens which

424
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,519
are running concurrently to your cpu

425
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,680
that you think should be secured

426
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,880
where nobody there are only two

427
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,320
solutions either you are aware you are

428
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,440
scared of

429
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,079
or you are simply

430
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,079
just forgetting about it

431
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,160
this is actually a good situation and

432
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,360
this is why i like to dig into

433
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,040
failing as this assumption the security

434
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,480
model by looking

435
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,279
broadly like a different components like

436
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,519
in class zone by looking lower layers

437
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,440
like in boot loaders or it

438
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,720
by the way also we have something in

439
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,560
common with the with adam we like a lot

440
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,800
fault injection yes basically and in the

441
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,120
case we are failing the model where

442
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,600
an instruction is executed by cpu

443
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,600
correctly and not only even by the

444
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,839
hardware itself so i would say that now

445
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,360
after it is a

446
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,120
short let's say interact about this

447
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,880
introduction i think that

448
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,560
i would say myself that i like feeling

449
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,519
assumptions yep that's that's that's uh

450
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,320
great and i saw your stuff in action at

451
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,480
the last cyber week as well where you

452
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,320
showed me glitching and that also opened

453
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,480
up my eyes like honestly the reason why

454
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,720
i go to conferences is this is where i

455
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,920
learn is where i get new ideas of course

456
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,040
it's lovely to see see friends

457
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,040
is also this is the only opportunity i

458
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,000
get to learn this is what keeps me going

459
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,079
so what's uh what's next adam what are

460
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,560
you working on uh so what i was

461
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,639
presenting here today was

462
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,720
again

463
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,880
you know a protocol that's that's

464
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,519
being transmitted over thin air

465
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,600
and is surprisingly

466
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,639
not secured not encrypted not authorized

467
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,000
or verified

468
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,240
and it's time synchronization so

469
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,240
basically you know we all take for

470
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,240
granted that you can tell the time you

471
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,079
can look at your watch but at some point

472
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,680
you had to set that watch to the right

473
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,600
time so you will have got that from

474
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,240
somewhere like a network clock or your

475
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,920
your laptop clock

476
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,519
which is in turn

477
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,199
synchronized to an atomic clock

478
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,160
somewhere

479
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,160
so what i'm looking at is well how is

480
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,480
the atomic clock signal

481
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,839
transmitted

482
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,640
to the global

483
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,959
consumer base which isn't just us

484
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,119
consumers it's you know banking

485
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,119
high-speed trading

486
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,919
uh transport networks communications

487
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,439
networks everything

488
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,839
relies on the security

489
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,480
of a completely unsecured protocol

490
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,200
so it's like so we're like one step

491
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,520
closer to tomorrow never dies

492
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,240
with there's so many disaster scenarios

493
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,240
we could bring into the

494
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,480
equation it's not funny and and for me

495
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,440
what was the most interesting thing is

496
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,559
that nobody's really talking about it in

497
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,080
this

498
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,160
community and in this environment i mean

499
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,120
yes there's a lot of government agencies

500
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,320
and

501
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,000
you know people who are responsible for

502
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,200
the infrastructure you put the

503
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,880
satellites with the atomic clocks up

504
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,400
into space

505
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,000
they're talking about it they know it's

506
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,360
a problem but

507
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,039
the people who are actually on the front

508
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,039
line defending uh from these things

509
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,880
which is us you know

510
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,240
we've talked about things not getting

511
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,200
better for 20 years yes it gets better

512
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,679
incrementally because people like

513
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,559
um christofaro and all and you and all

514
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,080
my peers here

515
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,160
actually go out there and spend their

516
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,799
day trying to find these little problems

517
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,440
um we're on the front line and yet we're

518
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,200
not talking about this and that really

519
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,000
surprised me when i looked into it

520
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,200
i fully agree definitely that's that's

521
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,799
i i think that the part where

522
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,440
we are simply disregarding complexity or

523
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,400
ongoing complexity i think it's in a way

524
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,400
maybe just um

525
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,120
a way that of the real length for coping

526
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,880
with technology maybe

527
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,600
it

528
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,480
could be

529
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,080
could be something but for sure we are

530
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,600
not discussing many things which could

531
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,080
be definitely

532
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,400
relevant and dangerous in some cases

533
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,919
yeah i mean it's strange it's become

534
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,320
ubiquitous not through design but just

535
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,679
because it's there

536
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,280
and because it's cheap and because it's

537
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,679
easy and because everyone just took it

538
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,280
for granted so

539
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,200
entire infrastructures are built on

540
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,280
these single points of failure

541
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,200
that nobody has addressed literally

542
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,840
until a year ago so so in the end it

543
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,679
just boils down to that that you've just

544
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,679
not factored it in

545
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,760
in your thread model these protocol i

546
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,760
mean ntp which is the network time

547
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,080
protocol is one of the oldest protocols

548
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,280
on the internet yes and yet it was only

549
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,760
the idea of adding crypto to it was only

550
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,039
ratified

551
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,280
a year ago right so i mean you've got

552
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,320
ptp which is secure

553
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,400
time protocol but again it's just a

554
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,280
distribution method it's not the source

555
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,840
of the accurate time that source

556
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,000
is still coming to it over plain text

557
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,360
either from satellite or from rf

558
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,760
or you know whatever across the network

559
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,559
through

560
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,280
tv broadcast

561
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,799
yeah i mean i can see the possibilities

562
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,520
once you notice it it's like

563
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,880
yikes

564
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,400
um so yeah sorry about that if uh

565
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,320
everything breaks tomorrow

566
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,039
everything breaks tomorrow uh no doubt

567
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,520
and christopher what are your next steps

568
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,240
um greetings to nick uh thank you if

569
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,799
you're doing this

570
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,159
um

571
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,280
what are the two of you gonna do uh yeah

572
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,400
so we

573
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,360
for sure we like uh bringing uh

574
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,400
say

575
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,320
the frontier of fault injection a bit

576
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,159
pushing it a bit forward

577
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,080
for example uh

578
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,200
we have been doing would like to

579
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,760
continue the implication of our fault

580
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,520
model which is called instruction

581
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,480
corruption to give you an idea with this

582
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,960
we during the last few years we

583
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,440
went from user space to kernel pc

584
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,600
control with just one single glitch

585
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,840
precise pc control so we can say to the

586
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,640
pc to pc program counter just go here

587
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,360
here here with let's say extremely

588
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,640
precise resolution without any problem

589
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,400
with this technique we have been able to

590
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,400
bypass an encrypted serial boot without

591
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,200
having keys that's brilliant so we could

592
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,280
jump over it yeah so basically we were

593
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,440
able to bypass this reboot and the

594
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,880
encryption

595
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,480
side stepping them with one single

596
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,440
glitch

597
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,520
and we don't need keys

598
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,280
why would you need keys and this is

599
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,960
possible because of the

600
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,480
fault model that which has not been

601
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,960
explored let's say in the way we like we

602
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,039
think there is more to be done that so

603
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,440
fault injection is for sure one thing

604
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,000
and we're seeing more complexity which

605
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,679
are coming into trusted execution

606
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,760
execution environment for example in the

607
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,520
last couple of years

608
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,120
what we are achieving we have achieved

609
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,280
for example is that we have running

610
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,559
concurrent

611
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,640
trusted application and code on the te

612
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,320
side so this means that the race

613
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,400
condition which were only

614
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,440
uh something available mostly in let's

615
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,919
say in uh on the other side kernel is a

616
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,760
space and so on now they may be

617
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,760
transferring also to the te side and

618
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,679
here is something that opens up a number

619
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,440
of an amount of resources of things that

620
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,280
we would like to explore which is

621
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,480
interesting

622
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,640
these are mainly the kind of things and

623
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,080
we also see

624
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,440
what's the other part is that we see

625
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,200
more and more of the security features

626
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,760
secure boots and trust ntes

627
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,600
being

628
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,320
surfacing in devices which are really

629
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,640
cheap and simple so nowadays you can buy

630
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,240
a five dollar

631
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,240
stock system on chip which has secure

632
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,919
boots and addresses on

633
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,240
on top so this means that we'll find

634
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,919
them everywhere even if we don't use

635
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:42,640
them yeah it's it's gonna be here so

636
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,400
there are many opportunities there which

637
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,320
we we find interesting for sure that's

638
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,720
that's awesome and uh

639
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,480
well i know for one thing for sure the

640
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,400
next time i see you folks uh i'm gonna

641
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,960
learn something even something new

642
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,840
something completely different and i'm

643
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,679
personally excited

644
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,520
i um

645
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,159
with this i would like to thank you both

646
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,600
of you for joining

647
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,159
me in the hidb studio thanks very much

648
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,440
thank you thank you all for the

649
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,960
information thank you great pleasure
