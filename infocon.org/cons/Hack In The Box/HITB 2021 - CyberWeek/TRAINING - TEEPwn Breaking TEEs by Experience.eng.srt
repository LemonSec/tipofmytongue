00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,200
hi everyone i'm christopher from realize

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,640
today i'm going to introduce you to

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,040
tipon the realest training on trusted

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,360
execution environment welcome to the

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,120
deepon experience

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,599
t-pawn is the first security training

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,840
exclusively focused on trusted execution

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,359
environment t

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,359
it dives into the darker corners of t

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,519
security while maintaining an offensive

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,680
system level perspective let us be very

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,760
clear from the start the training does

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,000
not aim to cover general exploitation

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
techniques yes basically we spare you

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,320
the usual buffer of law explanations and

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,880
one-on-ones it is instead fully targeted

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,120
to t specific vulnerabilities attacks

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,960
and exploitation techniques rather than

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,120
just a training t-pawn is an all-round

20
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,200
experience in t security you will learn

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,600
by practice and exercises all the

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,520
exercises have been based on real

23
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,600
attacks these attacks have been ported

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,440
to the realized environment where you

25
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,440
will have to identify vulnerabilities

26
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,039
and write your own exploit the

27
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,199
environment is fully modeled on real

28
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,199
targets out there we are going to have

29
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,680
from the hardware side 64-bit rv8 cpus

30
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,880
arc64 instruction set and untransport

31
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,960
on the software side we are going to

32
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,760
have arm trusted firmware a real tos and

33
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,479
a linux based re basically everything is

34
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,880
in place for an experience which comes

35
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,040
as close as possible to the real thing

36
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,960
in t-pawn we provide a comprehensive

37
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,360
coverage of a t we understand what a tea

38
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,280
is and how it is implemented we also

39
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,520
make sure to clear any misconception and

40
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,439
to build a clear picture of the entire

41
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,920
system including its hardware foundation

42
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,320
we explore the entire t attack surface

43
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,240
in the light of several attacker models

44
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,000
for instance we'll take the seat of an

45
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,159
attacker in control over e such an

46
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,960
attacker may target the te by exploiting

47
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,399
vulnerabilities in high priority

48
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,560
components like a tos or the monitor

49
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,040
code or aim a target directly across the

50
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,520
application at ea in order to access its

51
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,600
protected assets or exploit funding

52
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,520
abilities to gain control of other

53
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,360
trusted applications or escalate

54
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,280
privilege to the taos

55
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,880
all along the journey we are going to

56
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,520
explore several fundamental tea security

57
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,759
issues and vulnerability classes a few

58
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,758
examples issues like pointer

59
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,760
sanitization across security boundaries

60
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,000
of time of check time of use also known

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,239
as double fetch attacks or type

62
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,480
confusion which may lie in the

63
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,120
communication protocol between tas

64
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,800
apart from exploring the more common

65
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,400
techniques we are going to touch upon

66
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,400
some exotic tea attacks

67
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,239
which will become easily understandable

68
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,239
with the tea security model that we use

69
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,239
during the training it will be much

70
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,120
easier to grasp how some attacks may

71
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,800
break the security boundaries in many

72
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,040
unexpected ways or for the expectation

73
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,959
you're going to learn how it's possible

74
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,959
to use the underlying hardware to your

75
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,000
advantage while riding an exploit

76
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,080
well we are now at the end of this short

77
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,480
introduction of t-pawn we hope we have

78
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,720
been able to pick your curiosity and get

79
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,560
you interested if you would like to know

82
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,280
information on tbone as well as our

for the next trainings can be found at

85
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,840
the bottom of the training page

86
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,280
we hope you have enjoyed this brief

87
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,120
introduction to the tipone experience

88
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,959
and to meet you in one on the upcoming

89
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,599
tpon session and the next opportunity is

90
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,120
going to be in the http cyberweek 2021

91
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,040
we're going to be four days in abu dhabi

92
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,760
from the 21st to the 24th of november

93
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,599
where christopher nick will bring you

94
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,920
along in the tipone experience for which

95
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,840
you can find even the qr code to

96
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,959
register

97
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,560
this is going to be a very interesting

98
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,400
session because we are going to apply an

99
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,120
hybrid formula where we merge the online

100
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,200
experience with the classroom experience

101
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,120
this means that you can join the

102
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,120
training session even if you are not

103
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,519
able to join us physically in abu dhabi

104
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,440
this is another reason not to miss this

105
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,440
opportunity we hope to see you at the

106
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,680
next tip-on experience at the hitb

107
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,599
cyberweek 2021 thank you

108
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,519
you
