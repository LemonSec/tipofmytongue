00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,680
hey guys

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,600
so a couple of weeks ago this

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,599
package came in the mail

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,080
so we're just getting ready to unbox it

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,519
i wanted to show it to you guys it's

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,679
basically the

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,480
cyber week badge maybe

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,720
which was created by a

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,519
guy from tech maker

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:24,640
check that out

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,560
[Music]

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,119
so nice

13
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,359
yeah so we've been actually talking to

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,040
the damager for i don't know like well

15
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,920
over a year about designing a badge

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,320
which is out of the way and so this was

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,520
actually supposed to have been

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,719
ready for amsterdam last year

19
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,280
but you know kobe

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,480
and then we couldn't do it so

21
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,239
we moved it to cyber week

22
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:53,680
and so there's two parts to the bench

23
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,719
there's the

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:55,840
face

25
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,239
and then there's an add-on which is a

26
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,079
basically a hat

27
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,719
which connects to the back of it

28
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,400
and this is

29
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,920
expandable

30
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,600
options right so

31
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,040
i think this is for a can bus if you're

32
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,799
not mistaken so it allows you to do some

33
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,560
car hiking stuff

34
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,720
but they're gonna make other hats and so

35
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,799
if you're coming to cyber week

36
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,759
which i hope you guys are

37
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,960
you'll be able to uh

38
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,200
to get these badges basically

39
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,960
everybody who's attending in person will

40
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,439
get these badges given to you and if

41
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,759

43
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,360
but for the guys who are actually coming

44
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,360

45
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,119
tech maker badge with me

46
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,600
it looks pretty epic i have to say

47
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,680
it's got like uh

48
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,840
some debug ports here i should put a

49
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,159
battery in later and i kind of show it

50
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,520

51
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,880
on

52
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,399
but yeah let's see i guess it connects

53
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:53,759
into

54
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,840
