00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,320
welcome to linux heap exploitation by

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,320
infosect

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,320
why do a course on linux heap

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,240
exploitation and one of the reasons that

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,080
we want to do this course is that

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,000
classic stack overflows have been

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,080
largely mitigated against

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,640
in server and desktop operating systems

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,960
now in the embedded space in iot space

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,280
classic stack overflows are probably

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,160
still exploitable but on server systems

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,640
and desktop systems they're very they're

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,719
reasonably mitigated again now heap

16
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,559
allocators have some mitigations and

17
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,520
more are introduced regularly in linux

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,239
but even with that modern exploit

19
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,320
primitives and many exploit privileges

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,559
can be gained on modern linux systems

21
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,800
and heap exploitation is still possible

22
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,640
on many allocators

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,440
with appropriate heat grooming

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,280
mostly these give us arbitrary read

25
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,199
write primitives and maybe an

26
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,200
information disclosure which in this

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,799
course will lead to control flow

28
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,920
hijacking and code execution this course

29
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,680
is an advanced course but it's

30
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,600
definitely achievable

31
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,200
a little bit about myself i'm the

32
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,600
managing director here at infosec i'm

33
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,439
also a conference organizer of b-sides

34
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,280
camera and the c-size monthly link that

35
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,080
we run in australia but before i was at

36
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,400
infosec full-time i was the director of

37
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,720
education and training at unsw canberra

38
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,479
which is university of new south wales

39
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,799
canberra at the australian defense force

40
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,119
academy overseeing the content and

41
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,799
ensuring that we had quality delivery

42
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,680
and quality content and training

43
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,840
i've also worked in industry on the blue

44
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,240
side i was the director of anti-malware

45
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,560
engineering at wallace effectively

46
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,880
commercializing my work on malware

47
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,399
variant detection

48
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,240
many years ago as also the scanner

49
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,799
architect wallace uh and wrote or

50
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,640
rewrote much of their core engine police

51
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,880
guard wrote about 50 000 lines of c code

52
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,560
for them and that's pretty much the

53
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,079
industry standard for vulnerability

54
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,600
assessment today

55
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,520
i've also worked on the red side i was a

56
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,440
senior software specialist at azimuth

57
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,319
security doing vulnerability research

58
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,239
online training at infosec has been very

59
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,640
well received we've been doing it for

60
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,599
more than a year now we have

61
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,920
a good lab environment using amazon

62
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,920
instances you basically get a desktop

63
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,840
environment through the browser

64
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,599
we have good lectures we have high

65
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,720
quality av to provide this as well in

66
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,200
face-to-face training using a whiteboard

67
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,560
is a very important process of showing

68
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,000
how certain things are laid out in

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,400
memory we replicate that experience

70
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,519
using

71
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:42,959
you know a tablet to

72
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,160
that we can interactively draw on

73
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,640
we have lab exercises that cover

74
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,319
all of the techniques and attacks that

75
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,800
we're working on the labs are running on

76
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,400
ubuntu 20.04 the latest version of that

77
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,280
which is the lts release of ubuntu

78
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,720
the most recent lt lts release as well i

79
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,560
was very nice that rgr security did

80
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,800
quote one of our uh one of our bits of

81
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,120
research at infosec where we attack

82
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,280
the linux kernel heap allocator from a

83
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,200
year or two ago and we'll talk about

84
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,560
some of the weaknesses in that linux

85
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,800
penalty validator implementation and how

86
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,319
it was fixed and it's very nice to do

87
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,640
our security to talk about that in one

88
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,640
of their recent blog posts

89
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,680
if

90
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,360
modern exploitation against linux

91
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,519
systems interests you

92
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,680
register for the training and i'll see

93
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,000
you on the course
