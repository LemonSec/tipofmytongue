00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:03,520
hello everybody this is

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,359
from defensive security hope you are

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:06,480
doing well

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,680
i would like to invite you for the

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,320
upcoming cyber week conference which is

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,080
the largest cyber security event in the

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,080
middle east organized by the greatest

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,800
hike in the box crew cheers guys

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,880
so this year i will have a pleasure to

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,720
run a technical in and out attack

11
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,880
detection and hunting with purple ops

12
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,720
training and i believe it's gonna be

13
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,760
awesome

14
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,800
so expect very challenging time brain

15
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,359
overflow eventually with a ton of

16
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,558
different

17
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,640
hands-on labs in the formula of attack

18
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,239
versus detection

19
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,640
uh during the last year i have trained

20
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,480
over 100 people from the largest

21
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,399
companies over the world

22
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,559
threat hunter security engineers sock

23
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,960
analysts penetration testers red and

24
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,160
blue team members and everyone were

25
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,559
extremely happy and impressed because of

26
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,879
the content the new skills they gained

27
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,120
and overall training environment not to

28
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,000
mention the atmosphere of course so

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
if you would like to learn more about

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,199
how to run

31
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,360
adversary simulations effectively

32
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,119
including the development of attack

33
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,600
paths and chain attack scenarios if you

34
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,080
would like to know more about how to get

35
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,400
sufficient network and os visibility how

36
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,280
the sigma detection rules work and how

37
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,520
to use them to know more about the apt

38
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,360
and the malware behavior

39
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,960
if you are interested in detection

40
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,840
methods and capabilities of well or

41
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,000
recognized hunting and detection tools

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,479
including hunting elk systems plank

43
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,360
elastiflow moloch osquery was a great

44
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,680
look just to name a few

45
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,640

almost 20 years of experience in the

49
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,119

50
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,880
i can't wait for it

51
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,280
