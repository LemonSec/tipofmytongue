1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,360
hello hackers good morning how are you

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,960
well thank you for being here in this

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,160
talk

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,840
today is uh

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,880
it's a special day i decide not being in

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,920
conferences almost eight years ago when

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,760
my second daughter

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,480
was born but this was a very good

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,920
opportunity to

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,800
to be again on a stage so i'm gonna tell

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,840
you today uh a story is a story about

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,239
something that we research

13
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,800
years ago we did a proof of concept but

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,480
we decide not to

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,760
publish it we just do it internally

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,120
because it's something that

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,320
from my our point of view is working

18
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,320
years and years before we did the

19
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,480
research and it's still

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,039
happening today and

21
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,960
i thought that today was a good

22
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,199
opportunity to tell you that story it's

23
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:00,719
a story about grand league maps and

24
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,280
greenland bonnets and it's a story about

25
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,640
what we

26
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,280
what we were doing with that and what

27
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,280
can be done in your company your

28
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,840
smartphone in your device or to attack

29
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,479
companies so the idea is is quite simple

30
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,479
the idea started years ago in 2010

31
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,920
this is a blog post of my my personal

32
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,479
blog is a blog post in the day

33
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,439
the april's full day in spain which is

34
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,720
20th 28th of december that day you can

35
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,000
publish anything which is live just to

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,119
make people worried so that day i used

37
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,799
to publish always something and in 2010

38
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,360
when we started to work in this idea i

39
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,920
published this i said that foca how many

40
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,720
of you now foca

41
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,000
i love you

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,600
the rest you can go out of the room

43
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,839
please

44
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,200
so focus is a tool that we created and

45
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,159
we published in 2006 if i remember

46
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,399
correctly and the idea is that it's a

47
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,880
tool that allows you to download public

48
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,959
documents from website pdf word excel

49
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,440
word files whatever download

50
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,920
automatically all of them extract

51
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,360
metadata hidden information and

52
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,319
hidden data inside the document and

53
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,360
using

54
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,920
some algorithms it's able to cluster

55
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,760
information and print out the internal

56
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,160
network map of a company it was it's

57
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,120
very easy and spanish tool it's just one

58
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,599
click tool just click

59
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,280
the button and

60
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,280
that's everything and it became very

61
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,440
popular at that time

62
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,319
one

63
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,400
hundred of thousand installation around

64
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,720
the globe and we start to think

65
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,239
about the idea of making this show what

66
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:51,920
if we turn

67
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,720
this

68
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,519
app

69
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,400
this very popular app which is not open

70
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,200
source at all it was property

71
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,959
source code and we use a banner as a

72
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,120
cover channel to send commands to the

73
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,840
phoca and do things in the laptops of

74
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,760
people that have installed

75
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,280
the tool of course we didn't do that

76
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,480
you trust me

77
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,200
we didn't do that but we published this

78
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,360
and a lot of people started to worry

79
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,319
about

80
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,080
and it happened there the idea was

81
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,640
like this it was very simple every

82
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,400
single focus that was installed around

83
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,080
the world was

84
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,280
downloading

85
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,680
an image that image was an ad

86
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,760
and we could put

87
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,360
commands in that app using a

88
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,920
stereography the idea is that you have a

89
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,760
cover channel to connect to the app and

90
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,720
you can

91
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,680
transform malicious one only one single

92
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,480
app and do whatever in that computer

93
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,280
that was the idea in 2010 but we decided

94
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,439
not to do it

95
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:00,319
the truth is that in 2000 and 2013 when

96
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,400
we sold the company to telefonica and we

97
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,799
created a cyber security company called

98
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,920
eleven parts we started to work in the

99
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,799
mobile world so we created a tool that

100
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,159
tools was a big data that was collecting

101
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,880
all apps that that were published

102
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,959
were published in all the

103
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,400
markets google play app store and all

104
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,720
the android markets

105
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,520
every day we download every single app

106
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,040
that we have identified and once that we

107
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,160
have that app we open the app and index

108
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,400
it in a big data environment for every

109
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,120
single parameter that we have in the app

110
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,560
so using using having that big data that

111
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,199
was created in real time it was day by

112
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,240
day

113
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,160
generating more information and more

114
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,800
data about the app we did a lot of

115
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,960
research one of the research that we did

116
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,360
is about the steganography and the idea

117
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,560
was trying to discover if is possible

118
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,039
for someone for instance someone in in

119
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,600
google play or in

120
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,400
in app store to discover a cover channel

121
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,280
using sterenography in pictures and the

122
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,199
truth is that it's very complicated

123
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,520
because when you upload the app it's an

124
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,479
uh an static analysis that

125
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,960
that is performed and if you are using a

126
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,080
steganography you need to have a dynamic

127
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,160
analysis of the environment you need to

128
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,360
run the app and and see how it works to

129
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,840
detect the cover channel we did it with

130
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,759
a lot of images and

131
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,680
that were

132
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,840
were belonging to apps in the google

133
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,600
play and the truth is that we were

134
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,280
unable to discover

135
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,960
any single

136
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,919
steganography channel in the app could

137
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:44,639
be

138
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,600
some

139
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,759
warnings and

140
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,880
specific images that could be

141
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,560
one of those cover channels but the

142
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,479
truth is that we were unable to discover

143
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,600
one single saying it's true someone is

144
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,280
using this cover channel with a

145
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,199
steganora

146
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,039
later on

147
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,600
after we have that tool and we did that

148
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,039
first research

149
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,880
something started to happen in google

150
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,080
play gremlin apps appeared this was one

151
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,639
of the gremlin apps that was this was

152
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,680
discovered in google play in android the

153
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,000
idea is quite simple the developer

154
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,639
upload this app to the market to the

155
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,479
google play

156
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,199
market and it was analyzed by the system

157
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,080
in in google play and at some time

158
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,880
it

159
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,840
changed it it became another and

160
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,240
completely different app so in this case

161
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,960
as you can see it has the icon and the

162
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,080
name of a very popular game which is

163
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,639
capped the road in this example if you

164
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,160
look for the

165
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,400
package name the package name

166
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,199
it

167
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,800
it doesn't have

168
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,240
to to meet with the app name and if you

169
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,880
go if you were

170
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,440
to google play and look for that

171
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,080
package in the cache you will discover

172
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,720
that the app days before was completely

173
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,919
different it was a screen saver to put

174
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,000
beautiful images on your android device

175
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,639
but at some point the developer decided

176
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,120
to change the app and transforming in

177
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,440
something different and

178
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,880
when the app was transformed in that cup

179
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,520
rope christmas edition it becomes

180
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,280
malicious this is not this is the this

181
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,560
wasn't the only one it started to to be

182
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,720
a trend in the

183
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,960
in the malware industry and they started

184
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,199
to do this with a lot of apps this is

185
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,360
another example this was a an app pixel

186
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,319
breaker

187
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,520
battery saver it was

188
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,759
on sale in the internet they were

189
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,960
selling the app by 700

190
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,080
dollars which is peanuts and

191
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,879
with

192
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,440
a 50 000

193
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,960
installations so you have 50 000 devices

194
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,360
controlled by one single app that you

195
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,599
can pay for

196
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:10,160
700 dollars which is very very cheap at

197
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,639
some point someone did the maths and say

198
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,960
okay this is a business case perfect for

199
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,479
us so they bought this app and

200
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,319
transforming into a rogue antivirus to

201
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,080
steal money for the customer that

202
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,879
install it so people that had this app

203
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,240
at that time

204
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,759
the next morning

205
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,680
they receive alerts saying okay you have

206
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,159
a virus you have to pay you want to

207
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,399
remove the virus etc and they were able

208
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,279
to get to get to earn a lot of money

209
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,519
with this example so

210
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,120
having all this

211
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,360
on the on the table

212
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,120
and having that this technology we

213
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,480
decide to look for another way

214
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,680
of analyzing and using gremlin apps and

215
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,000
gremlin botnets the idea is that our

216
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,320
tool which is we decided to call it

217
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,120
tacit which is a big data with data

218
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,240
stream

219
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,560
was having a lot of information and we

220
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,279
have all versions for all the apps so to

221
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,320
us it was very easy to discover an app

222
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,360
that

223
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,600
was transformed into a

224
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,560
malicious agreement app and also on the

225
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,399
other way to track

226
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,200
what happened before with the with this

227
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,800
app so

228
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,920
the tool

229
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,959
in essence is like a google for looking

230
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:27,680
to

231
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,920
like a search in which you can search

232
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,720
for any single detail about the apps you

233
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,920
can look for urls you can look for user

234
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,240
you can look for

235
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,080
the developer emails you can look for

236
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,040
apks you can look for

237
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,279
library versions whatever piece of

238
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,839
information that is in an app

239
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,640
is indexed and you were able to search

240
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,880
for that app and it was nice because you

241
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,360
can discover a lot of leakages looking

242
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,080
for ports in the urls for user names in

243
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,040
their urls for text file with password

244
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,560
etc it was like darkening in google if

245
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,279
you

246
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,120
like this in youtube there are a lot of

247
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,320
videos of me showing how to dark into

248
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,160
this technology

249
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,480
and discover a lot of things

250
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,680
password files user in urls

251
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,880
users in ftps whatever whatever you

252
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,839
think that you cannot find in an app is

253
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,480
is wrong isn't it someone believes at

254
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,240
some point that it's a good idea to put

255
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,120
a password an ip or an apk

256
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,160
inside the the app so doing that we

257
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,519
decided to do a previous concept

258
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,040
what if instead of creating a

259
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,640
a bonnet

260
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,200
and transform all the apps into

261
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,560
malicious

262
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,360
change the business model of this

263
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,720
of this

264
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,160
technology

265
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,399
what if instead of selling the bonnet of

266
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,200
becoming malicious all the app and get

267
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,680
and do something to all the customers we

268
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,200
go for something more quiet instead of

269
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,320
that we are going to sell targets the

270
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,440
idea is

271
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,680
what if we are able to control a lot of

272
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,560
ads with a lot of permissions installing

273
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,440
a lot of devices and we are able to

274
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,839
discover who people is behind of each

275
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,040
device

276
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,600
what if we are able to discover what

277
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,920
email address phone number twitter

278
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,560
account whatever is behind

279
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,440
that app and we are able to sell

280
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,200
not devices but companies but executives

281
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,560
but people

282
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,680
that are working for specific companies

283
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,000
or organizations that was the idea in

284
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,560
essence just to sell

285
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,440
targets that were installing data for

286
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,800
instance how many of you have installed

287
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,800
anytime in your life

288
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,279
in your life a free app in your device

289
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,360
hands up

290
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,600
and how many of you did that because

291
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,040
your daughter your son your kid said dad

292
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,440
please can you install this app that is

293
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,800
a free game

294
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,519
that my friends are playing in

295
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,720
their

296
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,000
parents device how many of you did that

297
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,040
well this is very common free apps is

298
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,440
something that people love the most so

299
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,040
we started to work in this idea so

300
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,920
let's

301
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,240
let's see how can we control a lot of

302
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,600
apps let's see how can use

303
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,920
to get information from the device to

304
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,040
know who is

305
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,560
that people behind

306
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,040
let's try to do some open source

307
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,880
intelligence to collect more data from

308
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,279
that person trying to discover what is

309
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,920
that we created a tool that we

310
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,480
we name it as dirty business card the

311
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,320
idea is you give me your business card i

312
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,000
scan your phone number your email

313
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,079
address and search on the internet every

314
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,839
piece of information that is related to

315
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,000
you and we are

316
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,680
doing exactly the same with the

317
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,920
information that we collect from the app

318
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,720
and once that we got that turn

319
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,680
a gremlin up only one of them

320
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,880
only one of the bonnets into malicious

321
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,600
and using steganography too to transfer

322
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,160
and exchange data between the common and

323
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,680
control and the end point we have a

324
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,519
quiet and secure communication channels

325
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,320
and later on not trying to

326
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,160
be very

327
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,320
very obvious that the app is doing

328
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,880
something wrong we are going to use

329
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,560
always opportunistic usage of permission

330
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,680
it means that we are going to use only

331
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,120
permissions

332
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,240
that for the user are normal are okay

333
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,399
and we are going to use that permission

334
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,440
in the right moment in when the user is

335
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,199
doing something related to that

336
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,160
permission just to not make any warning

337
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,279
on it

338
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,959
so

339
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,199
when we did that we tried to discover

340
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,120
how many permissions

341
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,360
do you have to collect information from

342
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,720
one single app and how many of those

343
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,480
permissions you need to

344
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,880
to have to make sure about what the

345
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,920
people

346
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,920
is behind that device and the truth is

347
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,959
that at the time in which we did this

348
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,839
research and this proof of concept

349
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,959
we were in 2018 and 60 of the devices of

350
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,480
android devices

351
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,160
which was the operating system that we

352
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,240
use for this proof of concept

353
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,399
uh we're having

354
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,600
android is android

355
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,120
6.0 or less

356
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,720
which means that you have access to

357
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,880
account permission and you have access

358
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,199
to a lot of

359
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,800
permissions to to get that data

360
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,600
so you can get the phone number we did

361
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,680
we managed to collect the the phone

362
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,320
number you can take it from the sim card

363
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,120
we can take it from the operating system

364
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,440
operating system we can you can take it

365
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,880
also from accounts because some of the

366
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,519
internet accounts that people are using

367
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,880
are based on email but others are basing

368
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,680
phone number for instance telegram was

369
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,240
one of those

370
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,040
accounts and you can access to

371
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,000
information to almost everything related

372
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,519
to that user

373
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,600
doing tricky things in the app but you

374
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,880
can er using common permissions that you

375
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,639
can export to the

376
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,800
to the into the pro to the installation

377
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,920
process and most of the apps that are

378
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,399
in the selling markets

379
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,160
have that permission so you don't have

380
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,120
to worry so much about that permission

381
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,320
and this is the truth the reality 61

382
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,800
percent was having

383
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,639
a a version under android 8 uh

384
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,839
x0 in 2018 uh

385
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,680
february of 2018 if i remember correctly

386
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,000
and you were able to now very well who

387
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,279
was before that android device today and

388
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,320
this is from one week ago

389
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,959
almost fifty percent of the devices are

390
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,680
still in android nine or less because

391
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,480
fragmentation in android is a nine more

392
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,199
so there are is very complicated for

393
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,320
google

394
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,199
google engineers to make sure that

395
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,279
something which is improving security in

396
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,639
android is reaching all the all the

397
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,720
installation base

398
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,600
so if not we were looking for another

399
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,040
trick very

400
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,000
nice trick which is using oauth there

401
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,600
are a lot of apps

402
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,920
that were asking for logging with your

403
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,000
google account or your facebook account

404
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,399
your twitter account how many of you has

405
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,360
have logged in a company in an app using

406
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,279
your google account or facebook account

407
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,680
twitter account is wonderful when you

408
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,680
log with

409
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,600
with one of those

410
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,600
identities that you have your identity

411
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,279
provider

412
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,319
asks you for permission in something

413
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,880
that they call a scope list is a list of

414
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,359
permissions that you are giving to that

415
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,160
app

416
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,319
to access to all information that you

417
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,799
have for instance if someone asks

418
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,400
access for your emails and your

419
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,599
files

420
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,000
or or your personal information or

421
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,959
whatever you need to make sure that you

422
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,400
are not

423
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,039
doing click on just because one single

424
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,600
dress and it doesn't matter if you have

425
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,919
a second factor authentication because

426
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,840
oauth is not using second factor

427
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,960
authentication so anyone that has one

428
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,919
single approval of your auth token to

429
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,840
connect to your identity provider is

430
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,440
going to be able to access all your

431
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,000
emails send information impersonating

432
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,760
you get all the data that you're

433
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,320
receiving etc so one of the tricks that

434
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,520
we did is okay let's look for apps that

435
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,600
we're using out

436
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,720
less asks for simple permission three

437
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,360
four five times and after that

438
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,120
if we want to

439
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,679
becoming malicious that app

440
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,440
the only thing that we need to do is to

441
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,840
change the scope list and

442
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,720
just because the user is used is trying

443
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,679
it to say yes to this authentication

444
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,160
process in this app it's going to say

445
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,400
yes by default this is a nice trick it

446
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,080
works very well because

447
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,320
once that you get into one single app

448
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,000
three four five times you are not

449
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,799
reading any any change in the permission

450
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,799
list

451
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,280
so once that you getting information

452
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,559
about

453
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,360
who is behind that app

454
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,679
you can search for information related

455
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,000
to that specific person

456
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,960
so

457
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,280
we created this tool this dirty business

458
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,360
card i'm not going to show you the video

459
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,240
but we use a lot of easy simple tricks

460
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,240
to discover where you are tricks that

461
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,440
are user

462
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,320
are

463
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,880
very common in water hauling attacks etc

464
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,640
the idea is that just trying to recreate

465
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,039
accounting you're using your email or

466
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,600
your phone number and if we cannot

467
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,600
recreate the account because the account

468
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,760
exceeds we know that you have an account

469
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,640
in that website that was very common

470
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,080
today still is a leakage that a lot of

471
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,120
companies a lot of websites have on the

472
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,360
internet this is an example just trying

473
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,360
to reset a password for

474
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,080
for a user that exists and doesn't exist

475
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,440
and you just

476
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,720
getting true or false answer you now if

477
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,360
that person has an account in that place

478
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,919
so we have hundreds of places on the

479
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,880
internet that are of our interest to

480
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,919
check if one email belongs to one or

481
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,440
another

482
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,440
another

483
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,880
website

484
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,320
so

485
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,799
later on let's do less to the

486
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,000
supermarket um let's buy the apps it's

487
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,760
like going to the

488
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,720
to the

489
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,039
to the shops and select exactly what you

490
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,520
want you need to do several decisions

491
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,280
first one

492
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,159
does

493
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,960
this app the right permissions that i

494
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,760
need for my scheme yes or not you look

495
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,320
for the app you look for the permissions

496
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,679
what is the

497
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,400
the number of installation that is that

498
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,640
this app has is good for me yes or not

499
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,000
the price is good for me yes or not and

500
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,120
later on you can decide if it has the

501
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,440
right target for instance if you want to

502
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,840
to target

503
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,480
people working in the army or or

504
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,240
personnel working in the administration

505
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,280
probably you

506
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,760
need to look for the right apps if you

507
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,080
have an app for

508
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,200
information related to where are the

509
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,520
military camps in one company and it's a

510
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,080
free app probably some of the people

511
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,720
that is installing that app is related

512
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,200
to the go to the army so it's a good

513
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,159
target to buy so i can select

514
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,600
specifically

515
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,039
which kind of target people is good for

516
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,080
my

517
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,520
my bond

518
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,000
and also the price so this is this is

519
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,960
the price that i took yesterday so

520
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,440
one app with

521
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,080
hundred thousand installation is between

522
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,480
one thousand and five uh and five

523
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,159
thousand dollars which is peanuts

524
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,280
so

525
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,039
one of the things that we started to

526
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,640
worried in at that time in 2000

527
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,480
when we started with this

528
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,679
is that we needed to check

529
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,400
uh all the apps that were

530
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,120
that were installed in the employees

531
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,559
devices

532
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:46,799
yes for make sure that no one of them

533
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:47,679
is

534
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,480
in a market to be sold because if

535
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,760
someone buys that up it's going it could

536
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,799
be

537
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,600
a cyber criminal or someone trying to

538
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,919
change the behavior of the app so we

539
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,600
created this app

540
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,600
looking for security in all in all the

541
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,679
app but one of the things that for us

542
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,000
was very relevant is how many of the

543
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,640
apps installed by my employees

544
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,679
is on sale right now

545
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,039
later

546
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,640
how can take

547
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,360
the data how can transform it into

548
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,080
malicious in a silent way in a quiet

549
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,120
mode well first of all nobody suspect of

550
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,080
a permission if they can explain it

551
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,000
this is wonderful

552
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,640
if you are able to explain

553
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,000
why an app is asking for one permission

554
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,760
you don't need to know

555
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,720
how many times is using that permission

556
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,880
off or if

557
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,280
in true they are using that permission

558
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,400
for that

559
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,320
you can explain it in your mind it's

560
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,039
good so yeah it's because this is enough

561
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,280
for enhancing photo with video beauty

562
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,520
threads i'm going to give access to all

563
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,720
my photos that's it

564
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,919
very simple idea nobody

565
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,760
has worried about the number

566
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,679
huge number of

567
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,440
apps for

568
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,840
applying effects in pictures that are

569
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,960
asking for

570
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,200
access to all your pictures how many of

571
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,240
you have been using one of those apps

572
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,080
no none

573
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,039
yeah

574
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,400
this welcome

575
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,440
secondly if you are using a for instance

576
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,360
you are using an app

577
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,640
and you

578
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,480
access to your

579
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,760
your

580
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,360
photos

581
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,600
if the app is accessing

582
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,520
much more photos than the one that you

583
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,840
are selecting

584
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,919
you cannot detect it because at that

585
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,559
moment you are accessing to the

586
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,039
to the photos so for you is normal any

587
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,360
behavior that the the app is doing

588
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,120
exactly the same with the camera if you

589
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,919
are opening the camera to do uh

590
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,000
something to take a picture like pokemon

591
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,039
go or

592
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,760
which is augmented reality now no one is

593
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,960
going to worry

594
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,600
if that app at that moment is using

595
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,159
exactly that permission to take pictures

596
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,159
for instance that's something

597
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,480
that is very difficult to

598
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,039
to detect so if you use

599
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,799
at the same time

600
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,000
that the app is using that permission

601
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,760
on your own um benefit no one is going

602
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,400
to detect it

603
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,200
so and of course you can there are a lot

604
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,080
of tricks to do that you can infect the

605
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,799
deliveries et cetera there is one proof

606
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,600
of concept quite nice this

607
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,720
long time ago is a x code ghost that

608
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,919
infected

609
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,400
um

610
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,080
xcode compiler that was pirate on the

611
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,640
internet to infect all app and was doing

612
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,880
more or less the the similar trick

613
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,039
so

614
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,320
putting all this on the same picture we

615
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,919
decided to do a test with what with this

616
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,480
app this was a proof of concept very

617
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,000
very simple it's a game it's a game just

618
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,240
asking what do you prefer

619
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,480
i'm showing you two pictures and you

620
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,360
need to say i prefer this i prefer this

621
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,840
this other one how many prefer real

622
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,039
madrid

623
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,360
how many prefer barcelona

624
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,799
please barcelona out of the room

625
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,159
well

626
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,320
that was the game that was the game and

627
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,520
it worked it's a good work you can have

628
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,039
thousand of installation and it's

629
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,880
working very well

630
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,520
only when you activate

631
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,919
one of them when you trigger one of

632
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,799
those apps using a steganography you are

633
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,200
going to control the app so the idea is

634
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,520
is quite simple you have a we are using

635
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,000
the banner in this case the banner and

636
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,159
as you are going to see the banner is

637
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,520
always still you cannot see anything we

638
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,360
reload the banner

639
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,400
quietly so for the user the interface is

640
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,279
just

641
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,240
loading the pictures but the trick is in

642
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,120
the banner and the banner is configuring

643
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,799
one email one

644
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,960
phone number or one twitter account to

645
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,640
activate it

646
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,760
that app

647
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,559
so

648
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,600
in the example is with with one simple

649
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,679
app but you can use it with different

650
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,880
apps for different types is one single

651
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,240
banner that you

652
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,559
share with all the apps that you have it

653
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,200
doesn't matter if one app is

654
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,679
a game another app is for photo

655
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,880
enhancing if you have another app for

656
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,120
calendars or whatever you control the

657
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,480
apps all of them

658
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,840
load they download the banner and you

659
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,240
activate it one of them and once that

660
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,559
you activated one of them with the

661
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,960
information the example the the phone

662
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,520
number you can do whatever you want this

663
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,480
is a

664
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,039
an easy a video an example

665
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,080
quite a

666
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,640
simple example as you can see we have

667
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,919
two apps we are we put a phone number

668
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,120
sorry i covered the phone number you

669
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,360
activated the phone number and

670
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,320
the app that is activated is going to

671
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,200
become malicious so in this example as

672
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,200
you can see the banner is not moving at

673
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,159
all

674
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,720
but we are downloading a

675
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,399
asynchronous a synchrony the banner and

676
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,120
when the app is activated it said owns

677
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,360
and in this example just open my

678
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,679
personal blog post this is not activated

679
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,679
so you can be playing whatever you want

680
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,000
it it's nothing gonna happen on the

681
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,399
other hand when you decide to activate

682
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:39,679
this exactly the same you set up

683
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,720
a a new number which is what we already

684
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,600
did

685
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,640
and

686
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,279
exactly the same is going to be out this

687
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,559
is

688
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,440
an example about how it works just using

689
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,640
a steganography to connect to the app so

690
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,480
right now the left one is being

691
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,760
activated

692
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,120
you will see here aunt and that's it so

693
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,320
quite simple once that you have that

694
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,960
you can sell whatever you want so you

695
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,440
can sell this target to that

696
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,080
for this price because this is a mobile

697
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,159
device that is belonging to a top

698
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:18,960
executive in a company or in

699
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,120
in the government or wherever and once

700
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,000
that you activated that device

701
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,120
you sell

702
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,919
to the customer that device

703
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,559
this is example exactly the same just

704
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,720
connecting the apps getting information

705
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,480
using the permission to discover who you

706
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,520
are and once that i know who you are

707
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,679
we are going to be able to

708
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,399
select you as sell you as a target to

709
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,799
anyone and to do whatever you

710
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,799
you think in this example is another

711
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,200
proof of concept that we use to to

712
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,039
report this this

713
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,279
and we are going to

714
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,960
to have a

715
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,559
access to

716
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,760
fun to contacts pictures

717
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,520
email etc

718
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,000
all that you wanted

719
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,600
so it's

720
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,960
two minutes right now we are activating

721
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,679
the app is activated now what happens

722
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:15,840
because right now we ask for another

723
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,840
another command

724
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,760
nothing happens on the other one

725
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:25,520
just activated and now if we go

726
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,840
to the control panel that app that had

727
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,000
been activated allows you to sell

728
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,520
whatever you wanted

729
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,000
contact

730
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,200
or whatever

731
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,600
so we are using steganography to as a

732
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,279
cover channel because of that we need to

733
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,840
to continue playing because data is

734
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,520
being transferred in a cover channel and

735
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,320
what we are going to have

736
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,679
is a

737
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,320
context for instance

738
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,399
that's it that's simple so

739
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:55,840
we decided to

740
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,840
to do something

741
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,520
different so

742
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,000
okay this is the idea we can create an

743
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,200
app

744
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,520
and build a command

745
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,440
a community of people that want to

746
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,159
install that app buy the app but what

747
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:10,960
about

748
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,679
if we are able to steal the apps so we

749
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,640
started to work with an idea

750
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,039
and the idea was quite simple

751
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:22,159
how many apps of all of them that we

752
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,480
have in our big data

753
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,279
are belonging to a

754
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:28,720
developer

755
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,840
i mean

756
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,240
the developer upload the apps and what

757
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,559
happened if the developer

758
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,039
died

759
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,279
is someone go to

760
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,840
to the google play and remove the app

761
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,960
and

762
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,760
say

763
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,159
on advice to all people that installed

764
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,320
that free game that that developer is

765
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,399
dead this is an orphan app

766
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:53,279
no one is taking control of that app so

767
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:56,000
we have the big data we have

768
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,840
tons of apps in

769
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,760
on it and we decide to do

770
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,000
for a simple idea let's try to discover

771
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,960
how many

772
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,840
of those apps are belonging to the

773
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,880
developers so with analyze first

774
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,720
first um

775
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,240
first sign

776
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,440
of a

777
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,399
developer is that the mail is going to

778
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,279
be removed so we were looking for how

779
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,279
many how many times

780
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,120
without logging

781
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,639
into one email account

782
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,399
allows you to

783
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:31,039
recreate the email account so we were

784
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:33,200
analyzing all different domains as you

785
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,559
can see

786
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,600
very simple idea and we decided to go

787
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,640
for

788
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,679
for a

789
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:41,559
simple example of

790
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:43,519
217

791
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:46,399
outlook email the idea of using outlook

792
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:50,559
is that was not synchronized with google

793
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,559
because it's microsoft world it's

794
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:55,200
microsoft wallet garden and the other is

795
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,000
google wallet garden so if the developer

796
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,519
was using as a login an outlook account

797
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,240
we can try to look for outlook account

798
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,519
that was

799
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:06,320
a

800
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,360
death on microsoft wallet garden but not

801
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,279
in google wallet garden

802
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:16,960
so we select 200 217 email accounts 217

803
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,559
email accounts

804
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:19,679
and we

805
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,000
discovered

806
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,240
215 email accounts that were able to

807
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,559
recreate all of them with a with

808
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:31,360
eight accounts only with eight accounts

809
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,240
we were able to access to

810
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,080
four million

811
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,200
eight hundred fifty four thousand three

812
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,159
hundred

813
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:44,320
fifty downloads of apps for

814
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,039
those eight developers and we try to

815
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:50,799
recover and get access and control for

816
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,720
for those apps into the developer

817
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,919
account we

818
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,679
recreate the accounts

819
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,840
and we asked to recover the password for

820
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,679
android developer

821
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,399
identity and well this is an example and

822
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:05,440
how we were able to to recover the

823
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,159
account and we decided to stop here and

824
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:09,519
share that information with the

825
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:10,880
government

826
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,799
and let things

827
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:13,840
inform

828
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,720
because it was very easy for anyone to

829
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,440
to do this this example

830
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,440
and the last part of the

831
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,600
of this

832
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,640
is related to the corporate uh

833
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,960
the corporate gremlin

834
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,799
bots or gremlin

835
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,159
apps and

836
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,440
this is because i work in a company as

837
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,919
as probably all of you and in that

838
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:40,159
company in our company we have a bring

839
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,080
your own device policy how many of you

840
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,080
have that policy in your company bring

841
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,519
your own device

842
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,440
and how many of you need to install an

843
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,799
app from your

844
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:51,519
from your company

845
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:52,640
no one

846
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,440
no one the last part is that

847
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,919
in another companies there is uh take

848
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,120
your own device which is not

849
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,120
i'm giving you a corporate device which

850
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,799
is completely

851
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:08,320
set up with user apps etc is when the

852
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,320
company gives to you the device the

853
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,760
hardware

854
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,839
but that device is free

855
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,918
you need to configure one

856
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:19,040
google or apple account how many of you

857
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,040
have that policy in your company i give

858
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,800
you the mobile phone

859
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,440
but it's not it's not set up it's free

860
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,440
you can do whatever you think and it's

861
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,599
strange because it's like take your own

862
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,079
device and in the end you are setting up

863
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:35,040
an email account an identity which is

864
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,960
belonging to you is a contract between

865
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,280
you and google between apple and

866
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,480
and you

867
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,918
and what if that apps that you are

868
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,639
forced or invited to to install for

869
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,520
instance apps related to a

870
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,599
an event

871
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,239
belongs becomes malicious so that was

872
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:57,760
the the idea of of

873
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,720
of corporate and events apps in which

874
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,440
you are using sometimes site loading any

875
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,640
of you have been

876
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,400
using site loading of an app in a

877
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,160
company because the company said this is

878
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,440
the app that you need to install it's

879
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,119
not in the market because it's only for

880
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,680
ad blah blah blah

881
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,680
if you install that app it's exactly the

882
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,000
same you know you don't have

883
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,640
you you you cannot make sure

884
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,280
that that app is doing whatever

885
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,000
it's supposed to to be doing at least

886
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
you update the code and it's not very

887
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,839
easy and one of the things that you need

888
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:32,160
to take into account is that even if is

889
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,320
your own device or take your own device

890
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,400
which is not a corporate device it's a

891
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,160
device that i give to you for free but

892
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,560
you need to set up your account your

893
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,560
photos your files your contact your

894
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,079
messages are belonging to you so we

895
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,320
tested this with a

896
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,560
a common app and it's exactly the same

897
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,359
in a corporate app you can do exactly

898
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,480
and i'm going to to show you the the

899
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,359
long video because i took

900
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:00,880
a

901
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,119
longer time but the idea is exactly the

902
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,040
same this is a company what happened if

903
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,800
the company said okay

904
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,040
you can this is

905
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,839
the command and control let's do side

906
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:14,560
loading you know you need to know that

907
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,320
there is a

908
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,280
you need to allow side loading right now

909
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,119
there are a lot of

910
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:22,880
companies that are

911
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,000
asking users to do side loading probably

912
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,240
you are aware about the

913
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,200
the discussion or the conflict between

914
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,440
epic and apple because of the site

915
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,440
loading or google because they want to

916
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,079
use site loading to load

917
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:39,040
games

918
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,000
and pay not to apple not to google but a

919
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
third party to do that

920
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,119
this is the

921
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,200
the controversy about side loading you

922
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,839
need to to allow site loading but if you

923
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:52,000
allow site loading

924
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,200
the app can get all information exactly

925
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,520
the same and become malicious so this is

926
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,720
an example

927
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,440
about a corporate app

928
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,320
acting as a gremlin app

929
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,400
and easy to understand and that's all so

930
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,480
what i would like you to take from this

931
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,040
stock is that every install app even

932
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,160
your even one from your company

933
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,880
can do in your device everything that

934
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,200
permissions allow it to do

935
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,920
and you need to always think the worst

936
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,480
i'm sorry you cannot make sure that it's

937
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,760
not doing anything but the worst if you

938
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,440
think that you are in a wrong mistake so

939
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,640
trust

940
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,480
i trust in the company i trust in the

941
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,800
developer i trust in the

942
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,040
in the enterprise behind this is not

943
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,280
enough you need to apply zero trust

944
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,480
especially if it's your personal device

945
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,079
so any app can become a gremlin map

946
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:52,720
because enable developer as we saw at

947
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,280
the beginning with the app that was

948
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,160
transforming into a fake game or a rogue

949
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,040
antivirus because there is a back in the

950
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,400
code which is very common today we see

951
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,720
we see a lot of example of this this

952
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,800
week one researcher

953
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,200
transformed an app into a

954
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,400
listening

955
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,320
spying device in your mobile phone

956
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,680
listening everything that you were

957
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,560
saying just because a back in one app

958
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,800
because the app is sold

959
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,599
and

960
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:25,359
using the prices is very cheap very

961
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:27,599
cheap it's a business case that makes

962
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,680
sense for cyber crime and

963
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,040
cyber crime

964
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,760
or because the app is stolen you are not

965
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,880
made

966
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,400
there are not

967
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,839
100 of certainty that the app is still

968
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,160
belonging to the developer that it was

969
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,920
at the at the beginning and remember the

970
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,560
last thing is that mom can i play a free

971
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,640
game in your device that my friends play

972
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,800
the answer is no

973
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,680
okay

974
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,280
thank you very much and enjoy hacking

975
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,040
the box

976
00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:00,040
[Applause]

977
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,560
well thank you very much are there any

978
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,759

985
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,599
about real madrid but that was a joke

986
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:28,560
sorry

987
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,799
ah

988
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,880
when you show all these numbers about

989
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,200
downloaded apps that some kids like

990
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,520
install because ask their parents and

991
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,119
things like that aren't

992
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,760
most of them like that and they are like

993
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,000
storing somewhere take the place and

994
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,560
actually parents will need to run them

995
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,800
in order to run this malicious code yeah

996
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,800
mostly they're sleeping ups

997
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,400
is that correct

998
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,800
yeah well in the installations

999
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,800
when we were showing the number that was

1000
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,960
installations which is not a active

1001
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,880
monthly active users

1002
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,200
later on you need to look for how many

1003
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,599
of them are used daily weekly monthly or

1004
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:09,599
whatever but that installations and one

1005
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,680
important thing is that if you get

1006
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,839
access to the developer console and

1007
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:16,800
there is automatic uh updating for then

1008
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,480
is going to update with the operating

1009
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,800
system normal behavior but it's true

1010
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,640
what you're saying you need to to

1011
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,560
measure that number but in any case the

1012
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,440
price of the apps i have you come see it

1013
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,839
is very cheap today and now apple is uh

1014
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:31,839
installing apps that are not used for a

1015
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:33,920
while yeah

1016
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,119
that's it

1017
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,520
any other question

1018
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,800

lot of

1031
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,359
not not a lot of them but most of the

1032
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:08,960
security companies are taking into

1033
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,040
account that kind of things

1034
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,200
they are looking for what is happening

1035
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,319
in the

1036
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:16,640
in the app store with the with the app

1037
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,319
that you have in your company and they

1038
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,079
are connecting to your mobile device

1039
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,200
management system if you have an sds mdm

1040
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,920
you can connect that threat that

1041
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,359
a stream of apps and alerts to your

1042
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:30,800
devices

1043
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,520
is

1044
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,240
today still is is very common to take

1045
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,839
care about about this in security in

1046
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:39,839
security companies but it's not very

1047
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:43,359
common today to the companies itself so

1048
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:44,880
if you go to your company i don't know

1049
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,960
if you work for a security company or in

1050
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,800
a in a company

1051
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,119
as a security professional it's very

1052
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:52,720
difficult to find companies that are

1053
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,240
taking into account what happened in

1054
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,280
their personal devices or

1055
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,880
bring your own devices or take your

1056
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,440
devices that employees have that's the

1057
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,520
that's the truth

1058
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,359
but there are companies with tools

1059
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:07,640
similar to tacit we created tacit in

1060
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,319
2014 and today there are a lot of

1061
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,240
companies doing something similar even

1062
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,040
you can use uh platforms like beerus

1063
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,440
total to try to do something similar

1064
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,680
okay

1065
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,079
any further questions

1066
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,640
