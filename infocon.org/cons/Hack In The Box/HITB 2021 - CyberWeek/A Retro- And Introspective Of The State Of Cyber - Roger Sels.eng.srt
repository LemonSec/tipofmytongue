1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,559
thank you so much thank you everybody um

2
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,080
sorry for the delay there due to

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,160
technical issues um i hope you will

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,639
enjoy this session um as announced we

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,480
will review um quickly the chaos that is

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,520
affecting us in the cyber landscape i've

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,760
tried to structure it but i know that

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,439
with these titles it is not going to

9
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,920
make any sense to you as of right now it

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,679
will become more clear once we go

11
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:30,640
through it

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,360
we will start with some light issues

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,320
about

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,800
the focus that we have in cyber security

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,680
how we tackle challenges how we solve

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,840
the wrong problems in my view and then

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,640
we will gradually move into slightly

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,440
more

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,680
advanced and technical matters

20
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,160
and finally i hope to be able to

21
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,920
show you an ai

22
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,960
demo

23
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,760
that

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,760
fixes a few of the issues that we've

25
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,039
discussed

26
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,039
i hope everyone can clearly hear me by

27
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,120
the way i didn't do a sound check i see

28
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,280
a couple of people nodding thank you

29
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,400
um yeah i'll skip the intro but

30
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,600
because we've already done that

31
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,920
now maybe you might wonder what is

32
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,799
blackberry doing today in cyber security

33
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,960
or why is somebody from blackberry here

34
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,080
on stage

35
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,560
we stopped manufacturing devices about

36
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,040
seven years ago but today have two

37
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,119
business units that are focused on cyber

38
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,759
security and on iot and obviously in the

39
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,000
future we see a convergence of these two

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,640
fields happening in our iot unit we have

41
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,880
an operating system a hypervisor

42
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,840
actually

43
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,640
for the vehicles the infotainment and

44
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,520
other systems are built on top of that

45
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,040
this hyper visor is also being used

46
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,040
in smart cities

47
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,040
and um well

48
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,200
we're we have 200 million cars on the

49
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,600
road with this system we announced a

50
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,680
partnership with aws to bring a kind of

51
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,600
app store for the connected vehicle of

52
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,600
the future because your experience is

53
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,680
going to change you will sit in the car

54
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,079
you will have screens you may decide

55
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,038
this week or this month i need xyz app

56
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,239
and we want to stimulate an ecosystem of

57
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,080
application development

58
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,920
around that so

59
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,560
from the cyber security perspective

60
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,200
we did an acquisition of silence

61
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,760
the leader in ai driven endpoint

62
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,520
security

63
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,120
there

64
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,000
we

65
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,599
converge the

66
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,959
mobile world protection with

67
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,040
let's say anywhere

68
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,480
working protection and hyper automation

69
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,120
driven by ai i'll clarify that as we

70
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,959
move forward

71
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,440
now as i said there's a lot of chaos

72
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,680
affecting our

73
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,680
our landscape and ultimately it's

74
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,760
leading to negative business outcomes

75
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,480
it's leading to too much cost and it's

76
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,280
driving even away talent from

77
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,959
this field

78
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,800
the chaos

79
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,400
has to be seen across multiple

80
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,040
dimensions the first one is the cyber

81
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,840
dimension we have more and more nation

82
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,400
states that are investing in offensive

83
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,480
cyber security capabilities

84
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,440
a recent report by the nsa showed that

85
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,080
according to them every nation on earth

86
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,319
is now investing in offensive security

87
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,599
capabilities

88
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,959
a second element there is that we're all

89
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,440
more connected and interconnected with

90
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,480
one another to cut costs we've

91
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,200
ensured that um

92
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,760
we work with more external parties we

93
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,120
have more data that is being shared more

94
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,280
critical business processes are being

95
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,680
supported by these external parties and

96
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,360
of course that leads to an ever

97
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,840
expanding attack surface and this has

98
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,480
led me in other presentations to say

99
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,360
today

100
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,000
and cyber no longer is a human skill

101
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,159
problem we have too many vulnerabilities

102
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,560
too much data and even too much input

103
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,200
from our security controls to actually

104
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,239
um give our our teams a chance to deal

105
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,840
with that

106
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,799
so next up um is

107
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,040
this slide and i think we could talk

108
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,799
about the data points that are there

109
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,720
just for the next hour but i want to

110
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,120
highlight a few and i will come back to

111
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,358
these during the presentation notice on

112
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,000
the left and upper side that we have

113
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,880
over 6 000 vendors in this landscape

114
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,800
that are creating solutions

115
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,560
the interoperability

116
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,639
of these solutions is becoming very

117
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,840
difficult um it's also becoming more and

118
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,919
more complex to

119
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,479
show the value and effectiveness of

120
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,880
these solutions because

121
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,040
um well

122
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,960
everybody has certain claims in the

123
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,880
market that they're making

124
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,040
but there is nobody that is actually

125
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,560
testing the validity of these claims

126
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,120
you will notice that the number of

127
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,160
malware samples that are submitted and

128
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,720
seen has grown exponentially over the

129
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,280
years so that means that certain

130
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,680
defenses that we had in the past will no

131
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,880
longer help us because this is a race

132
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,479
against time that um that we're losing

133
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,120
and that is contributing to the

134
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,240
widespread array of negative news that

135
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,840
we see

136
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,240
but then a lot of cyber attacks today

137
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,240
even go unreported

138
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,919
so we don't even have the correct

139
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,280
visibility on the scale of the problem

140
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,280
and so on and so forth i'll highlight a

141
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,320
few of these more later in the talk

142
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,199
but

143
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,759
another element that is plaguing us is

144
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,000
that whenever you want to make an

145
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,840
environment more secure ultimately you

146
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,120
are reducing the productivity of a team

147
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,680
and you are burdening again your

148
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,240
internal i.t and security teams with

149
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,960
extra workloads what does that mean if

150
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,680
you think of our security controls

151
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,479
the way we are applying them today

152
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,560
will require that we understand the

153
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,840
business use

154
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,639
we model that in our security controls

155
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,280
but then when the market circumstances

156
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,759
change the business has a new partner

157
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,240
the business wants to

158
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,720
expand into a new market we have to go

159
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,560
through this modeling phase all over

160
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,560
again so we introduce a delay and this

161
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,319
is something that you can really see in

162
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,880
startups they're really agile but

163
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,880
typically they have very low security

164
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,120
controls and as they mature and these

165
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,800
two levels kind of meet the art i guess

166
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,280
um lies in the fact that you find a

167
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,639
healthy medium between both where okay

168
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,880
the business can still function maybe

169
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,600
not at a speed that they want and

170
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,880
security is well not everybody is

171
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,120
quitting saying okay i cannot stay here

172
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,599
because um we are going right for the

173
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,199
precipice and there's nothing stopping

174
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,560
us

175
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,280
so this is one of the main challenges

176
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,120
that we have in the field how do we

177
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,680
break that tension and how do we get

178
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,000
security and productivity to move in

179
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,479
lockstep

180
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,759
then

181
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,720
i saw this tweet in 2016 and i very

182
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,919
often think back of it it's the doom and

183
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,479
gloom i would say of cyber security

184
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,319
where

185
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,800
you you might look at the news and think

186
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,520
is what we are doing impactful

187
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,479
and

188
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,400
the other flip side is

189
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,560
um that some people might say well i

190
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,400
still get paid and that might be a

191
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,080
vendor it might be a consultant might be

192
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,800
somebody deriving a salary but it's a

193
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,599
very pessimistic view i think since this

194
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,160
was published in 2016 actually the

195
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,360
situation has improved and we're not at

196
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,400
this stage anymore but it is something

197
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,879
that should be cause for reflection and

198
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,840
i often reflect about this one

199
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,599
and then um

200
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,120
just to highlight

201
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,720
how absurd the situation has become

202
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,840
we have

203
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,039
leaders cyber security leaders

204
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,599
that are in many cases the top paid

205
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,599
individuals in our field

206
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,479
burning out and leaving their their

207
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:13,759
appointments

208
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,560
within less than 26 months

209
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,759
on average

210
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,479
when you compare that with cios with

211
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,440
other leaders cfos they have a tenure

212
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,319
that is far longer five years six years

213
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,800
seven years is typically not unheard of

214
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,960
so this is indicative of a problem

215
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,440
between let's say executive leadership

216
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,080
the board and the cso to prioritize

217
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,159
adequately and to fund the program

218
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,559
adequately the second thing is and this

219
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,519
is not a surprise this spills over into

220
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,480
the workforce because if if the

221
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,279
attention of the board is not sufficient

222
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,240
that the program is viable people will

223
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,440
think okay i i don't really feel that

224
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,440
there is an improvement being made we

225
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,800
have no chance of fighting this year and

226
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,720
cyber security people are passionate

227
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,560
they don't want to just sit around wait

228
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,560
for an accident to happen and watch it

229
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,279
in slow motion and then say well um i

230
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,080
told you so that that doesn't help so a

231
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,320
lot of people are burning out what are

232
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,800
we going to do about this situation and

233
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,160
how can we

234
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,800
better stimulate certain conversations

235
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,640
i'll highlight a few

236
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,320
other problems that i think feed into

237
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,120
this

238
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,480
that

239
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,000
i hope will all help you change

240
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,880
some behaviors some ways of thinking of

241
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,519
these problems

242
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,279
we have today a headline obsession with

243
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,839
breaches and ransomware and in my view

244
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,600
and you can quote me on that

245
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,080
breach and ransomware headlines are the

246
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,880
kardashians of our day um you may not

247
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,200
follow them everybody will speak to you

248
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,800
about them and you will know everything

249
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,959
about them but the one thing is you

250
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,040
never learn anything you never really

251
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,040
learn anything there are no lessons

252
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,920
learned from that i i i dare you to go

253
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,160
back to any of the recent breaches to

254
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,079
review that and say well this is

255
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,000
actually contributing to my mission

256
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,959
internally i know what to do i can give

257
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,440
you one example of the top of my head

258
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,519
where actually we learned something and

259
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,279
that was equifax

260
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,440
the first thing is it was a gigantic

261
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,480
breach

262
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,560
more than i think 100 million records

263
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,120
were leaked and it led to

264
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,519
the ceo being replaced the cio being

265
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,839
replaced and the ciso being replaced

266
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,560
when new leadership came in they said we

267
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,240
need to be transparent about our

268
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,480
security program we need to show the

269
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,959
weaknesses and they publish the report

270
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,360
and you can read a number of failures

271
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,360
that happened ranging from technical

272
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,440
controls that failed

273
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,839
there was one solution that had to do

274
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,640
ssl interception that certificate that

275
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,600
had that was used was expired so they

276
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,320
didn't notice that and that tool wasn't

277
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,079
doing interception so they lost

278
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,160
monitoring capabilities but there is a

279
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,480
wide range of governance issues that

280
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,839
predate that

281
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,320
this is the type of information that we

282
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,120
need

283
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,480
think about

284
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,320
the airline industry

285
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,399
obviously it's world news if an airplane

286
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,440
crashes and goes down people like to

287
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,519
read that i guess

288
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,519
but if you look in the background what

289
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,000
will be happening is that there is a

290
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,560
body that is collecting information to

291
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,040
say what was the failure how did you

292
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,440
operate it were you within parameters

293
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,800
and then that information gets

294
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,760
disseminated to all involved parties or

295
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,480
all stakeholders to improve airline

296
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,680
safety

297
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,279
we have so much

298
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,839
ground to cover to get there in cyber

299
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,160
security and i see good initiatives

300
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,880
coming with sharing of threat

301
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,640
intelligence

302
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,880
my personal view threat intelligence

303
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,680
sharing is a great start but it's again

304
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,920
sharing the wrong type of information

305
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,720
you will be able to stop or prevent or

306
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,200
detect certain attacks but it doesn't

307
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,120
tell you anything about all that money

308
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,600
being spent on these controls well maybe

309
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,240
30 percent of them are not effective

310
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,240
maybe that's really something that needs

311
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,440
to be addressed

312
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,160
so

313
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,200
i think we can all start by stimulating

314
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,360
the right conversations if somebody

315
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,959
comes up to you and says well so-and-so

316
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,560
got got breached

317
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,519
unless

318
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,519
you want to have a discussion with their

319
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,480
board

320
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,680
or of

321
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,920
a similar company

322
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,160
that that doesn't really help us as

323
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,880
cyber professionals i agree that on a

324
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,680
board level discussion and if your main

325
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,880
competitor

326
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,440
has a big ransomware attack it will

327
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,440
drive some good questions with the board

328
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,360
and that has a bit of value well i mean

329
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,600
that has that can have tremendous value

330
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,880
but for us this should be a scientific

331
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,839
field we really need more data so that

332
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,160
we can evolve better security controls

333
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,639
then the second one is that and this is

334
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,160
a

335
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,800
a result often of these breaches you

336
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,200
will see people say well um we take your

337
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,399
privacy and security very uh seriously

338
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,519
we've now doubled our budget in security

339
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,160
it's like fantastic throw more money at

340
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,160
the problem but

341
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,560
you're maybe not taking away the legacy

342
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,760
systems

343
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,600
and i often have that discussion with

344
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,480
boards and csos where i say push back on

345
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,000
the new budget

346
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,440
give it to it

347
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,760
uh take a cut of 10 to 10 percent of the

348
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,399
increase give that to it replace the

349
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,480
systems that you're running from the 70s

350
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,199
the 80s the 90s and partner with the

351
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,320
business because in the new version

352
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,800
from 2022 almost

353
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,360
they will gain some benefits they will

354
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,440
be able to go to market faster they will

355
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,279
be able to serve their customers fast

356
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,440
faster they will be able to increase

357
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,600
productivity production line whatever

358
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,440
you name so they will be a strong

359
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,680
partner for that that money is better

360
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,560
spent on that because if you take the

361
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,680
increase but the legacy is not changed

362
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,600
within the company the only thing you

363
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,240
will do is eighty percent of your budget

364
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,880
will go to babysitting these separate

365
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,360
environments and

366
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,920
you still have a huge risk

367
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,959
so that

368
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,040
is another way of looking at it but it

369
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,560
requires active education both of cios

370
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,240
the the executives and the boards

371
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,360
then

372
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,760
we keep speaking about talent shortage

373
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,680
and i have to apologize to you all i

374
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,240
know that the slides are getting uh meme

375
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,360
worthy but um the past few days uh my my

376
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,079
son has had some health issues uh and

377
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,519
i've um had to decide to invest a bit

378
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,440
less time in my slides

379
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,839
but the point still stands

380
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,440
everybody complains about a talent

381
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,760
shortage but then when you look at it

382
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,240
well the pay might not be great and then

383
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,240
on the other hand everybody wants a

384
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,600
magical unicorn with certain abilities

385
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,440
but nobody's investing in certain

386
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,360
capabilities

387
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,720
i think it was

388
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,160
16 years ago i built one of emea's

389
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,880
largest stocks at that time

390
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,519
you couldn't find a security analyst

391
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,079
it's not about talent shortage the skill

392
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,199
didn't exist so we took curious people

393
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,680
that had a desire to learn we gave them

394
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,000
a six-month training program we said

395
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,760
we'll teach you everything there is

396
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,480
about networking well i mean within

397
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,600
reason we'll teach you os security we'll

398
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,720
teach you um exploitation techniques and

399
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,040
all of these things and then we'll pair

400
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,839
you with a senior and gradually these

401
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,800
people became highly effective

402
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,680
so

403
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,160
on this front on the talent shortage i

404
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,160
always want to push back to people

405
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,720
saying ah we can't find people

406
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,320
i've been looking for this role for

407
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,800
eight months eight months you could have

408
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,639
built them yourself

409
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,079
um

410
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,639
so that is a takeaway that i want to

411
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,360
share with you all if you are

412
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,920
in a more junior position

413
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,360
and there's no investment in your career

414
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,120
i think it falls on you

415
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,000
to

416
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,240
either have that discussion to push

417
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,639
forward in in a separate discussion or

418
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,480
to just say it's maybe not going to

419
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,399
happen within this organization

420
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,680
there are other organizations that will

421
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,720
help me and where i can grow and move to

422
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,320
those

423
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,240
but then the second part as well is

424
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,720
today you have conferences like this you

425
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,199
have access to people we have social

426
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,320
media

427
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,800
that has brought us many negative things

428
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,360
but one positive is you can almost reach

429
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,000
out to anyone in this room

430
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,519
with with two clicks

431
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,959
you have a name you find them on

432
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,639
linkedin on twitter and you have a

433
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,000
discussion

434
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,519
and if they have a somewhat normal

435
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,519
personality they will actually give you

436
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,519
good advice as well

437
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,480
so that's a first one i think the talent

438
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,680
shortage is is artificial it's also

439
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,240
reinforced remember that stat that we

440
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,199
discussed

441
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,199
6 000 vendors now every vendor comes in

442
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,000
with

443
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,880
i have a solution to this problem that

444
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,720
will require you to

445
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,319
operate my solution in a specific way

446
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,039
so you are solving a problem by having

447
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,760
to create a new team that has to work

448
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,919
with that solution in a particular way

449
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,960
and as that scales that team grows

450
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,280
do you see how we are feeding into this

451
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,240
problem

452
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,400
and that's um something that needs to be

453
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,880
changed as well of course

454
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,000
then

455
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,160
the serial construction is another

456
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,480
problem that i see what do i mean by

457
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,919
that is there are two things

458
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,000
if you look at career progression and

459
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,240
how that is measured if you build a

460
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,120
bigger team you can get to a bigger role

461
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,840
so everybody is incentivized to say

462
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,360
i had a stock of 200 people i had an i.t

463
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,840
uh department of uh 150 people say

464
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,679
and then in my next role i have 200

465
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:08,720
people

466
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,320
when i look at what i did with dark

467
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,520
matter um we started i started really as

468
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,320
the first employee we had three or four

469
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,080
people in it and i was the i.t security

470
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,320
guys like fiso

471
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,039
by the end of my tenure that team had

472
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,799
grown to 100 plus

473
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,120
if i compare to my my current

474
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,640
organization the combined it and

475
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,000
security team is 450 people plus

476
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,760
now i don't want to throw a stone at our

477
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,280
cio and our cso but i can tell you that

478
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,760
to achieve similar results as what this

479
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,480
team is doing we adopted hyper

480
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,919
automation

481
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,080
if we had to do a task more than once or

482
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:50,960
twice

483
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,440
it became something that was scripted

484
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,720
baked in

485
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,120
and we we had a lot of on-prem systems

486
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,400
but we really adopted a ci cd mentality

487
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,480
to say okay we have to continuously push

488
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,280
out uh new functions and then we can

489
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,480
automate testing and and validate that

490
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,679
so

491
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,039
another point on serial construction is

492
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,120
i think i could have made a career going

493
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,080
around

494
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,840
building sock

495
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,240
socks for everyone and that's the second

496
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,600
problem is that everybody offers you

497
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,360
a list a spec of well this is what you

498
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,679
need as capability but there's no

499
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,919
instantaneous

500
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,240
downloadable framework that you can just

501
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,880
implement what do i mean by that even if

502
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,360
you look at mitre attack it's a it's a

503
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,000
wonderful framework but you cannot go

504
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,320
and say you know what i use an open

505
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,440
source uh seam or even for the the most

506
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,160
common theme formats download a couple

507
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,640
of use cases that will tell me you need

508
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,679
to send these events and it's done

509
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,240
the typical way of doing it is you find

510
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,280
a few people that have done it before

511
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,159
they come in they analyze the sources

512
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,320
they have the knowledge on which attacks

513
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,240
are important for your environment and

514
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,559
they go through a tuning and and

515
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,440
planning phase and typically to gain

516
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,120
maturity in

517
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,520
the capability is a two to three year

518
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,720
journey

519
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,720
i personally don't understand

520
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,960
why you can't say okay somebody has done

521
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,240
it already download it i have 80

522
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,520
capability

523
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,960
especially

524
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,440
if you think outside of the cyber field

525
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,960
and you try to explain this to a ceo

526
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,960
let's say you're a mining company you're

527
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,520
a manufacturing company

528
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,159
why do i need such advanced capabilities

529
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,559
why do i need to build such teams to

530
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,720
build something that's been built 20

531
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,039
times before

532
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,520
it in my view makes no sense

533
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,480
but

534
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,880
coming back to our first

535
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,000
tweet

536
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,320
still dollar dollar dollar and that's

537
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,039
the point right

538
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,880
moving on talent retention uh a big big

539
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,880
point for me i already mentioned the um

540
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,880
the hyper automation

541
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,039
so we have also all of these events

542
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,840
coming in but we have

543
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,840
a tendency to go for tasks in the field

544
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,000
that are never ending

545
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,440
take the example of vulnerability

546
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,600
scanning how many organizations are

547
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,360
running vulnerability scans are running

548
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,919
penetration tests right everybody does

549
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:33,440
them but you have no end state where you

550
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,120
go i'm done

551
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,640
it never ends

552
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,159
i want to show you a different way i was

553
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,520
brought in

554
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,159
in a fortune 50 organization after let's

555
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,600
say a crisis in leadership had happened

556
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,400
and

557
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,559
when i started to review what is the

558
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,039
data that is being sent to the group cso

559
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,280
i noticed there was a two-month lag

560
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,840
between

561
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,480
data um being collected and actions and

562
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,120
intelligence being sent up so i started

563
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,679
looking into that it turned out okay we

564
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,760
we had a relatively large environment we

565
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,559
were scanning 500 000 endpoints on a

566
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,360
monthly basis 100 000 external ip

567
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,559
addresses and it was just so much effort

568
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,919
to even update the infrastructure

569
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,000
to collect all the information then

570
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,919
aggregate it that it took multiple teams

571
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,640
several teams just to to wrangle the

572
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,960
excel data and then assign it to the

573
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,679
business owners follow up with them and

574
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,280
all of these things

575
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,280
and i i sat down with the engineering

576
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,039
and architecture teams and said

577
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,640
isn't this nuts

578
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,760
so i mean

579
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,159
show me the growth on the graph of the

580
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,720
are the infrastructure the team

581
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,559
the work that's been happening and we

582
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,799
started looking into this and i mean it

583
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:54,080
was almost exponential right so i said

584
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,760
okay we need to redesign our approach

585
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,640
we

586
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,280
we took a golden image

587
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,840
baseline of all our systems

588
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,520
we put that in what we call the patching

589
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,440
cluster so our

590
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,720
000 systems were represented by 1250

591
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,600
systems we built a database that had all

592
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,760
the software packages of all the os's

593
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,240
and applications that were on there um

594
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,960
whether it was windows or linux

595
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,559
all the oss

596
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,720
then we downloaded all the cve

597
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,880
information in the database

598
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,720
and what we did is every night we ran a

599
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,840
file listing on our patching cluster and

600
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,679
we compared that to the information in

601
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,280
the database

602
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,919
we built our own little gui for that

603
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,400
and that instantly without network

604
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,640
traffic without license

605
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,679
showed us

606
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,760
hey this vulnerability that's in this

607
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,080
package can be patched with this it's a

608
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,559
high severity this machine maps to 22

609
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,120
000 servers and then okay we gradually

610
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,840
uh sophisticated a bit further

611
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,279
of the 22 000 1000 are used for online

612
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,480
banking that's a really key risk

613
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,600
then we said well that's great that we

614
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,159
have quicker information but the

615
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,400
patching itself is always being delayed

616
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,559
by the business going no no no no we're

617
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,679
running a a specific important process

618
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,919
don't touch it so you said

619
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,320
can we get them to sit down explain to

620
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,039
us

621
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,200
how they are doing their testing can we

622
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,279
automate the testing on the patch

623
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,600
cluster and then we'll just patch it

624
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,360
we'll run their tests

625
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,080
functional and otherwise will go back to

626
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,799
them share the results and say it looks

627
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,559
good your application has passed all

628
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,120
your tests we want to push the button

629
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,720
and do it in production

630
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,120
in the beginning there was some pushback

631
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,440
but ultimately we were able to achieve

632
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,559
it

633
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:49,440
we

634
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,840
saved i want to say

635
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,919
it's been a few years was 2015 but i

636
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,200
want to save more than 10 million

637
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,240
dollars annually just doing this

638
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,200
people in the team that were in my view

639
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,400
and i i

640
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,760
it's not a nice thing to say but i

641
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,600
called i i called them jokingly our

642
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,360
excel slaves

643
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,679
were now doing something nicer they

644
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,919
could actually dig into the data they

645
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,360
could actually have meaningful

646
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,279
conversations with the business to say

647
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,120
this is what we're doing to protect you

648
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,279
and a few people really came up and and

649
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,720
thanked me and other people on the team

650
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,120
to say hey this this was a great change

651
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,720
this is something that that's pushing us

652
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,080
forward

653
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,159
so um yeah i wanted to share that story

654
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,240
with you because if you give people a

655
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,960
never-ending task that is monotonous

656
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,480
repeated is always a repetition um they

657
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,120
are going to eventually burn out as we

658
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,360
saw in the stats

659
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,960
then you can see here how the industry

660
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,279
is really um

661
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:51,919
focused mostly on oh sorry mostly um

662
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,279
um

663
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,960
response so um after the fact and very

664
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,919
manual

665
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,480
and i think there are a number of of

666
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,799
things that feed into that the first one

667
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,520
is a lot of your vendors are american

668
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,600
there is a different culture when it

669
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,720
comes to

670
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,880
legal and compliance there

671
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,679
and i can imagine that for some here

672
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,320
they'd love to take the decision for you

673
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,679
but then the discussion with legal

674
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,679
becomes but what if the client gets

675
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,080
breached and you took a decision and we

676
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,480
didn't stop it they're going to sue us

677
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,600
so everybody is being very careful and

678
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,840
saying well i don't really know what's

679
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,480
happening here it looks like something

680
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,520
happened

681
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,440
can you go and investigate

682
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,720
the typical stack in an enterprise is 20

683
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,679
to 50 to 60 different vendors if

684
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,799
everybody just inundates you with well i

685
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,320
don't really know what's happening you

686
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,679
should investigate

687
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,640
all you do all day is investigate

688
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,200
so that becomes a problem and we need as

689
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,600
an industry to move

690
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,760
more into automated prevention

691
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,600
then let's talk about innovation in our

692
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,960
field right

693
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,200
and there's always this dual

694
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,159
view

695
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:08,960
of

696
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,440
any claim that a vendor has

697
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,720
has to be snakehole um it's marketing it

698
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,960
doesn't work um

699
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,360
it cannot apply to us

700
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,159
at the other side of the spectrum i do

701
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,039
think skepticism is healthy you cannot

702
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,200
just accept anything anyone is telling

703
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,000
you

704
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,840
but the key problem is that

705
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,279
we keep falling into discussions about

706
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:39,039
well is this now a new term that is more

707
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:42,720
hype than reality is this going to push

708
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,000
us forward and again we lack the data on

709
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,640
effective control testing

710
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,279
so that you can show the results

711
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,840
a secondary point there is that

712
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,200
obviously

713
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,279
because we don't test it

714
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,760
we don't have the habit of

715
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,880
really well defining the use cases

716
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,799
see if you can spot this pattern have

717
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,399
you ever had it that somebody talks to

718
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,120
you about oh i met with this vendor

719
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,120
they're doing something with zero trust

720
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,440
they explain what it is and then you go

721
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,840
yeah but that wouldn't work in this one

722
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,799
case

723
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,279
and that one case is enough to dismiss

724
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,120
it

725
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,559
on this side of the spectrum maybe it is

726
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,799
maybe you need to look at the 99 other

727
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,880
cases where it actually

728
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,279
helps you combat that

729
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,480
sisyphus rolling the ba the ball up the

730
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,039
hill without end and without means to

731
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,520
win because sure the one case won't work

732
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,000
and it may be a major case but you might

733
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,720
gain a really good benefit in 99 other

734
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,760
cases

735
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,200
so that is

736
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,600
i think something to um to be mindful as

737
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,919
well of

738
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,399
and then i'd like to go into a demo if

739
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,360
the demo gods are willing

740
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,840
let me see

741
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,399
oops

742
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,159
no

743
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,480
ah here it is can you yes you can see

744
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,440
the screen

745
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,080
so i will ah here is the mouse

746
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,799
i will open a victim machine

747
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,600
i'm going to

748
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,360
execute some ransomware on the machine

749
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,679
and we're going to see the machine being

750
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,880
locked by ransomware then afterwards i

751
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,720
will do the test again on a secondary

752
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,399
machine where

753
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,799
we're running an ai endpoint protection

754
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:38,480
solution and i'll show you a few things

755
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,559
that should be noteworthy

756
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,320
so here if i'm not mistaken

757
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,120
i can go to ah sorry i first need to

758
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,039
take it from here

759
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:49,640
um

760
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,600
[Music]

761
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,679
yeah i don't have the right mapping on

762
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,120
the other one

763
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,360
uh default staging

764
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,159
so i'll quickly copy it from here

765
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,679
just bear with me 20 seconds

766
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:25,360
now let's see if i can reach it

767
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,320
come on

768
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,360
just a second please

769
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,559
you know what i mean i'll skip the one

770
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:41,600
on the

771
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,000
victim machine because it's just locking

772
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,320
the machine and i guess you'll trust me

773
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,799
that the sample is is correct

774
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:52,080
um i need to find my

775
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,399
latest samples but i have some good

776
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,399
samples from ransomware that's been

777
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:57,760
affecting

778
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,720
organizations in 2021

779
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,840
let me just see

780
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,640
here

781
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,679
so what you have here is the ransomware

782
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,840
that's been making the headlines coming

783
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,600
back to these headlines

784
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,120
we have darkside and and compti which

785
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:19,760
shut down jbs meat producer and the

786
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,240
gas pipe in in the u.s

787
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,840
made the headlines

788
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,159
in a few other cases as well i'm going

789
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,399
to copy them to this machine

790
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,320
and

791
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,080
they should on execution be blocked uh

792
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,559
let me see

793
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,840
sorry since this is not my computer uh

794
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,039
i'm a bit

795
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,600
yeah there

796
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,080
come on

797
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,360
um okay

798
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,600
hang on

799
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,480
i'll just control v them

800
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,880
good they're on the desktop

801
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,080
i'll

802
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,480
open

803
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:13,360
the protection

804
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,840
console

805
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,720
hang on

806
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,120
come on

807
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,279
sorry

808
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:29,240
i'll close this window first

809
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:31,360
is it possible

810
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,279
okay it worked

811
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,399
let's click this once

812
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,080
there so you see it's already started to

813
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,600
quarantine some files now if i click

814
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,000
them i can make it go a little bit

815
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,240
faster

816
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,360
it

817
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,200
gives me an error message tells me hey

818
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,960
that you can't execute this file that's

819
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,919
fine

820
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,640
eventually you will see it delete all

821
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,840
the files

822
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,399
now that's not very impressive right

823
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:03,519
2021 malware from a few months ago being

824
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:06,240
stopped in in with an antivirus

825
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,720
what's so special about this well the

826
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,760
special thing is that this antivirus is

827
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,799
the version of our software from 2015

828
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:17,440
and i can show you that in the console

829
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,480
here

830
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,960
uh sorry the mouse is a bit no that's

831
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,360
not what i wanted

832
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,399
so you see this is the version from

833
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:33,760
2015. we do not use signatures

834
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,799
we

835
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,200
use artificial intelligence to detect

836
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,000
patterns to detect features and to say i

837
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,840
don't know what this file is but i know

838
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,679
it looks like something malicious that

839
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,559
i've seen in the past that should not

840
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,519
be executing i will quarantine it

841
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,480
and if you think of the site effects

842
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,519
that a solution like this has

843
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:57,840
once you know for sure that is up and

844
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,320
running on all of your estate

845
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,640
you don't need to collect stats on a

846
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,240
monthly basis saying okay 94 of my

847
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,960
signature updates have been performed um

848
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,918
and then next month compare it i have 94

849
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:14,960
i have 95 uh which are the business

850
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,040
units that are lagging behind which are

851
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,280
the ones that are really doing well and

852
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,159
so on and so forth so i think this is

853
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,639
how you regain some time within the

854
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,159
operations

855
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,079
both for the business because keep in

856
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,000
mind that typically in a larger

857
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,719
organization the business has to give

858
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:35,440
you approval to do some patching and all

859
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,079
of these things so you unload the the

860
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,480
business as well as the it team as well

861
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,879
as the security team so this is one way

862
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:46,159
i believe that ai and ml will have a

863
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,199
positive impact in the future on our

864
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:52,639
ability to withstand these attacks in a

865
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,359
smarter way

866
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:56,719
and then

867
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,480
just to close off

868
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,320
after the demo oh sorry

869
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,599
here we are

870
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,760
and i'll take this one

871
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,960
um

872
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,119
yeah that's not gonna come true sorry

873
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,880
two icons didn't come true sorry for

874
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,680
that but what we built is a platform

875
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,480
that

876
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,440
um i'm just showing this as an example

877
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,079
um to stimulate your thinking it's not

878
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,119
meant fully to be a plug for my employer

879
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:25,520
but just to show you how we are tackling

880
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,680
a few of these challenges is that we

881
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:32,000
have one platform that is multi-modular

882
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,040
where we ensure the interoperability

883
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,800
of these modules

884
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,079
if you have our desktop protection you

885
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,400
have our threat hunting you have the

886
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,480
endpoint management solution well if

887
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,960
this one gets updated this one will

888
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,040
still be able to talk to it which is not

889
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,119
guaranteed if you have 20 solutions from

890
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,800
20 different vendors

891
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,520
i believe the future is this and you are

892
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,839
seeing it with competitors in the market

893
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,800
as well they are moving to larger

894
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,440
platforms and maybe in the future even

895
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,079
platform as a service where you consume

896
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:08,560
capabilities um as and when you need

897
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,040
them maybe on a monthly basis or once a

898
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,160
year and so on and so forth

899
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,040
then

900
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,800
just to

901
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,839
come to zero trust as i mentioned it

902
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:21,520
one way that we then

903
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,520
have that is unique

904
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,359
by having everything combined in a

905
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:28,960
platform we generate data or we acquire

906
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,160
data from the state of the applications

907
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,880
the state of sessions

908
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,079
is peter now in finance all of a sudden

909
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,040
working at 4 a.m whereas typically he

910
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,280
works from i don't know seven till till

911
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,400
three um is he connecting from different

912
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,920
networks uh do we notice that um a

913
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,640
left-handed person is all of a sudden uh

914
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,680
typing sorry using a mouse with the

915
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,400
right hand all of these deviations from

916
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,839
a known standard baseline can lower a

917
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:03,599
trust score that is continuously

918
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:06,160
monitored and therefore i mean we used

919
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,320
to say zero trust but we're now evolving

920
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,480
in the company towards continuous trust

921
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,480
because zero trust is a bit negative

922
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,920
where we can offer a continuous overview

923
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,640
that yes you are in a safe environment

924
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:24,240
and if not we can dynamically adapt

925
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,880
policies based on what we're seeing um

926
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,280
that might be um

927
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,880
let's say that the network changes or

928
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,480
the the state of the application

929
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,760
security changes um if it's

930
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,599
a radical jump

931
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:41,200
down in a trust score we might actually

932
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,000
say

933
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,280
you know what

934
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,560
we limit the access to certain sensitive

935
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,839
applications

936
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:50,000
but as soon as you i don't know

937
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,119
reconnect to your approved home network

938
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,920
um you regain these rights you don't

939
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,480
have to go to it it doesn't need to

940
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,480
install something but you can just

941
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,079
seamlessly work

942
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,160
think back of that productivity and

943
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,960
security curve it's enabling people to

944
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,599
do their job while we try and secure it

945
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,760
as much as possible

946
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,839
i just want to show you that

947
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:16,160
uh i just wanted to show you this to say

948
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,839
okay i'm not just here

949
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:20,400
ranting about some some some problems

950
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,720
that we all are faced with we're

951
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,119
actively trying to solve them and i'm

952
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,280
not going to lie we're not the only ones

953
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,599
actively trying to solve them but try

954
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,760
and have that discussion within the

955
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,000
ecosystem if you are looking at

956
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,359
solutions

957
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:38,079
try and look at am i buying something

958
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,800
acquiring something that will

959
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,480
create all the problems that we talked

960
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,359
about

961
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:46,320
or is it actually going to allow me to

962
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,040
just

963
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,359
achieve a better level of security and

964
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:50,880
move forward

965
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,680
and then um just on the ai because i

966
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,040
showed it

967
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,520
maybe a few of you are curious on how

968
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,760
does it work within that one module that

969
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,359
we saw

970
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,839
we've built a database

971
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:04,720
of

972
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,440
tens of millions of files and

973
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,640
they are both malicious and

974
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,040
benign and you have to do that because

975
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,800
if you only train an ml model on

976
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,720
malicious software

977
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,760
anything that it encounters would be

978
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,920
blocked so you would have false

979
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,320
negatives sorry false positives and you

980
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,960
will impact the business

981
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,839
we extract features from these and i'll

982
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,160
explain that in a minute we then

983
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,280
vectorize these use them to train the

984
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,400
algorithm and ultimately that results in

985
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,839
a clustering of feature vectors and a

986
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,320
classification of future vectors now if

987
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,480
i walk you through what that looks like

988
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,079
with animals a characteristic might be

989
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,119
the shape of ears the position of the

990
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,920
ears all of these type of things

991
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,359
and if we compare two animals they will

992
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:04,560
have distinct characteristics and even

993
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,119
things that we as humans might interpret

994
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:09,680
as a big difference might be completely

995
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,119
different

996
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:12,480
with

997
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,599
an algorithm but here in this

998
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,400
sample case we see that the scoring that

999
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,720
we receive is

1000
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,960
to my surprise i would say well probably

1001
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,960
the ears are the most distinguishing

1002
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,160
feature

1003
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,720
here in our example we see that the

1004
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,000
nostrils

1005
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,480
i think is the biggest difference if i'm

1006
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,880
not mistaken

1007
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,599
so

1008
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,520
expressed as a feature vector you

1009
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,920
receive something like this then you can

1010
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,400
plot this in what in data science is

1011
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,280
called a t-sne

1012
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,240
space

1013
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,480
and representation and you can start

1014
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,200
clustering now

1015
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,480
this brings up a question about the data

1016
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,760
quality

1017
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,720
if

1018
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,640
if the clustering that i have here in

1019
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,040
front of you is to decide

1020
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,000
are these animals appropriate for my my

1021
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,599
son to play with

1022
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:07,599
well then maybe i really want to be sure

1023
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,520
that my group of cats doesn't contain

1024
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,400
panthers lions cheetahs and so on and so

1025
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,280
forth

1026
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,319
if it's just okay i want to separate

1027
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:18,480
dogs from cats then that might be fine

1028
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,440
that that's in there if i make the

1029
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,520
bridge to our malware and our business

1030
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,359
applications

1031
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:27,599
you get something like this

1032
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:29,680
the number of features that go into your

1033
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,280
model and into your representation will

1034
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,480
mean that

1035
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,119
a it's harder to bypass

1036
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:37,839
b

1037
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:40,800
that it will be more um

1038
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,200
robust towards the future and the

1039
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,680
efficacy will will improve

1040
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,480
now

1041
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,400
let's leave the disney representation

1042
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,480
and just walk you through that feature

1043
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,079
training so you start with the

1044
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:55,200
vectorized feature sets you then as i

1045
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,760
said start clustering them and you

1046
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,200
eventually will get a classification to

1047
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,520
say everything below sorry everything

1048
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,160
below a certain point is considered to

1049
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,280
be

1050
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,960
normal everything above are clusters of

1051
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,079
malicious

1052
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:13,280
things

1053
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,599
now something new comes in

1054
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,839
i don't know what it is

1055
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:20,800
but the algorithm knows that it looks a

1056
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,200
lot more like this due to where it's

1057
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,119
positioned than that

1058
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,760
i'm not going to let it run

1059
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,760
so if you look back at the demo i showed

1060
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,000
you that's exactly what happened the

1061
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,560
algorithm of course didn't know that

1062
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,960
malware that came out in i think in one

1063
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,079
of the cases it was 2019 that that would

1064
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:41,520
um

1065
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,640
would exist

1066
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,040
it's not that we're predicting malware

1067
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,000
but we have a set of characteristics

1068
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,680
features that show us that hey this is

1069
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,560
um

1070
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,560
a file that we don't want to execute on

1071
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,839
that machine

1072
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:59,280
and this i think is um a big evolution

1073
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,200
that we can take in a number of security

1074
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,359
controls to reduce some of these pain

1075
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:05,680
points that i talked to you about today

1076
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,040
um and

1077
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:10,160
yeah then i'll skip this one or uh

1078
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,440
i think we have time um the dod

1079
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,560
presented the model to say well actually

1080
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,280
there are different stages of

1081
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,760
maturity within ml

1082
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,880
and

1083
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,800
i know a few people might might say yeah

1084
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,800
but we've had machine learning we've had

1085
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,880
heuristics and all of these things and

1086
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,640
then you fall somewhat more on this

1087
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,880
spectrum where you have a small number

1088
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,040
of features being looked at

1089
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,520
you have small number of samples to work

1090
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,800
with and as you move towards here is

1091
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,119
where you get the deep learning and

1092
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:45,920
reinforced learning all of these things

1093
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,680
where it becomes

1094
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,560
even more autonomous less involvement

1095
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,839
from

1096
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:54,880
the human data scientists in creating

1097
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,200
the model and you can even get

1098
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,359
suggestions on new models that can be

1099
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,680
good um maybe for the

1100
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,240
completeness sake we train our

1101
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,560
algorithms in a cloud

1102
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,400
that cloud is

1103
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,480
um not the one that let's say it's

1104
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,720
executing the um the model so we we push

1105
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,280
the model to all the endpoints um in

1106
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,760
what is called edge computing and in

1107
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,000
edge computing the decision is being

1108
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,200
made on the edge because you have an

1109
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,839
actual representation of the model so if

1110
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:29,839
something comes in the features get

1111
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:32,720
extracted and it's then in real time

1112
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,200
that the decision is being made the good

1113
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,240
news is this also works without cloud

1114
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,720
connectivity if you have an air gap

1115
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,440
system you have particular needs you can

1116
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,240
still have that protection there and

1117
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,800
no need to update it so this is

1118
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,720
i think a nice benefit

1119
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,560
and then

1120
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,119
this is a slide that i've left in

1121
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:58,160
remember the slide on skepticism and the

1122
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,280
slides uh on snake oil if i had stars

1123
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,720
actually i should have tested it if i

1124
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,400
had started and said well we have

1125
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,160
something that we call a predictive

1126
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:09,119
advantage that means that well

1127
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:10,640
let's take

1128
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,319
darkside

1129
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,800
67 months ago we

1130
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,160
our products would have stopped darkseid

1131
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,200
that type of claim would have made your

1132
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,720
snake oil sensor buzz off you say well

1133
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,359
that's not possible i don't understand

1134
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:30,240
you're you're making up things now that

1135
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,720
you've seen it in action you can qualify

1136
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,800
it a little bit more and i know some

1137
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,560
people will still be skeptical and say

1138
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,119
but the sample might have been um

1139
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,040
specifically prepared or the solution

1140
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,200
prepared and i want to test it myself

1141
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,560
these are fair comments but again just

1142
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,599
want to

1143
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:48,960
come back to that point that i made

1144
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,720
earlier and that concludes the

1145
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,200
presentation i hope you enjoyed it and

1146
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,280
thank you everyone stay safe stay

1147
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,280
healthy
