1
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,200
it's uh it's been a long time since i

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,960
saw you folks it's been actually a long

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,080
time

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,040
i

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,800
saw you on the screen

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,880
at nullcon 2020

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,960
i was waiting for you

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,199
but you couldn't make it

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,279
for obvious reasons i saw you on the

10
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:20,640
screen

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,480
just before the pandemic closed the

12
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,920
world down

13
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,640
and then i saw you on the screen

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,840
at no had con in 2020 where you had me

15
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,279
do the keynote

16
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:32,399
so

17
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,120
we it's it's kind of weird

18
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,840
but wonderful connecting with you both

19
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,760
after the pandemic

20
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,360
well i mean let me not use the word

21
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,879
after the pandemic we know we don't know

22
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,480
if you're done yet or not

23
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,480
but it's great to connect with you folks

24
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,280
once again at hack in the box

25
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,640
i'm

26
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,559
glad that you honored me

27
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,280
to sit and chat with me about

28
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,039
well let's just talk about conferences

29
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,920
and conferences in general

30
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,879
and uh what does it feel like to be back

31
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,600
once again oh it feels great

32
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,520
uh it feels good to see so many people

33
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,040
uh it feels uh like we are connecting

34
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,479
socially again

35
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,600
and as you said yeah nulcon was actually

36
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,360
it's one of my big regrets because i

37
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,240
really really wanted to to go

38
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,280
and it was the first of many many events

39
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,439
that i had to either cancel or that

40
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,000
turned completely virtual

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,920
um and it was

42
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,040
very

43
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,640
you know

44
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,840
very strange that specific event

45
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,159
because it was the first time yeah that

46
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,240
it happened that you had to deliver a

47
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,600
keynote

48
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,000
not because something happened

49
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,560
or the conference was with or anything

50
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,840
by decision but because you could not

51
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,720
go yes and could not go and could not

52
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,240
meet the people that you that you like

53
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,640
uh and people that you have seen for

54
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,000
decades literal decades

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,600
um

56
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,038
and that has been the tune of the last

57
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,440
two years so yeah you are right we

58
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,840
cannot say this is after

59
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,319
because it's not yet after

60
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,040
but

61
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,680
it's it's great to be able to see once

62
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,560
again so many uh good friends

63
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,200
that we made over the decades and the

64
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,920
what the conferences have meant for me

65
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,879
over these years is that i connected

66
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,560
with people of all

67
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,800
uh of all continents

68
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,720
and i literally have

69
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,280
lifelong friends basically anywhere on

70
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,720
earth i may

71
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,480
go in the future

72
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,280
and

73
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,480
this has been a privilege of a lifetime

74
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,040
and i really look forward to this

75
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,040
starting to allow me again to connect

76
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,599
with these people what about humor yeah

77
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,879
for me a

78
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,599
good thing of being in the uh security

79
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,000
community is to be part of this

80
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,080
community in the sense as you say was

81
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,120
saying

82
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,640
it's not just a job right i mean it's

83
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,040
more like a passion that drives you

84
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,239
forward and

85
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:08,959
it

86
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,800
allows you to establish connection with

87
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,800
people all around the globe so thank you

88
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,879
guys and it's good to come to conference

89
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,440
like this not only for the con itself

90
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,040
but there's a chance to meet with people

91
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,560
that you have not

92
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,680
seen for almost two years and

93
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,400
for myself the last conference i had was

94
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,799
last year in general i was in florida at

95
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,040
the jewelry and i recall the time there

96
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,799
was one that was being closed right so

97
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,599
we were saying okay a cd with i want

98
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,440
i'll be like 30 minutes

99
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,120
people have been putting lock down

100
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,400
everybody was saying yeah i mean it's

101
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,879
not going to be as problematic but then

102
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,959
as soon as they come back i realized

103
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,360
that was actually my last event for

104
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,760
almost two years so very much happy to

105
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,239
be here with you and to talk about

106
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,159
confidence talk about the security

107
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,519
community

108
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,959
and the friendship that we bring across

109
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,920
it's been years when was your first uh i

110
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,480
see you have a hack in the box 2012

111
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,720
t-shirt on oh yeah just by seance

112
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,159

113
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,239
your first uh when was your first

114
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,879
conference that you you jumped into yeah

115
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,280
when it comes to hacking the box i guess

116
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,399
was probably 2011 or 2010. okay so at

117
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,680
the time the conference was still run in

118
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,040
ql like

119
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,040
yes yeah so

120
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,440
and i still remember

121
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,360
yeah i mean like

122
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,759
what i remember is the petronas tower so

123
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,800
we often had like our social event for

124
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,280
the last floor of patrolling hours and

125
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,520
once i was there you know having fun

126
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,720
with colleagues

127
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,960
and it turned out that my flight get

128
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,720
back to europe like something like at 3

129
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,720
pm 3 am the night

130
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,080
so some people came to me and said hey

131
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,000
dude it's like midnight remember that in

132
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
three hours your flight don't worry at

133
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,199
me

134
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,759
last ring right so and then after the

135
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,919
last ring there is one more last ring

136
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,280
yes and

137
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,800
you don't know that i just arrived to

138
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,120
the airport like last minute

139
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,960
and they board immediately like it could

140
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,280
be the plane after like a social event

141
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,080
so but it was my first time at hakeem

142
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,960
box

143
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,720
and i thought okay this is probably the

144
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,720
event they have to try this sound that

145
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,520
presents as a speaker like every every

146
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,759
year right i mean so it wasn't my check

147
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,759
mark i said okay done

148
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,759
so it was my first time at uh

149
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:26,880
what about you

150
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,440
yeah that sounds familiar um yeah my

151
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,360
first taking box was i think 2008

152
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,199
and in kuala lumpur

153
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,320
um

154
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,600
it was a

155
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,840
it was a blast it was a

156
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,440
as as it still is a a a very

157
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,160
passionate community of people uh from

158
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,039
the organizers the attendees were an

159
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,880
amazing crowd

160
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,840
of course at the time i think it was my

161
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,440
first conference in anywhere near asia

162
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,400
or southeast asia so it was a very

163
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,400
different environment

164
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,960
but you found the same uh spirit the

165
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,919
same peop the same type of like-minded

166
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,440
people so

167
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,520
language barrier but

168
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,759
a lot of things in common that allowed

169
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,720
you to

170
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,120
to walk all over it so

171

182
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,600
annual life so as to say

183
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,680
a certain time of the year where you

184
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,520
expect you're going to go to malaysia

185
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,560

186

191
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,759

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,639
they're always there they are busy as

213
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,240
heck right they're trying to put the

214
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,000
show together

215
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,520
but they still have time for you they

216
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,599
still you know make you feel welcome you

217
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:52,960
you're never

218
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,599
separated from the organizers then after

219
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,280
you had a chat you go

220
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,680
go sleep the next day they're there

221
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,560
everything is laid out a welcome package

222
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,680
everything

223
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,479
uh agenda printed on the kia on on the

224
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,280
cards yeah what what's really like was

225
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,319
that

226
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,400
even if vacuum box grow over the year no

227
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,479
i mean if you go nowadays to amsterdam

228
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,240
like before it could be time i mean

229
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,000
there were like free trucks in parallel

230
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,160
and people but still there is like

231
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,759
contact with the organizers right

232
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,000
this is what makes a difference between

233
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,080
one conference the other no so even if

234
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,560
you grow if you try to keep the spirit

235
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,719
of community and the contact both with

236
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,679
organizer as well as with other speakers

237
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,599
you know so it's good that they organize

238
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,919
like social events welcome deanna but

239
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,839
you get there alone it's the first time

240
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,679
i keep the box but through the chat to

241
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,000
connect already with the community all

242
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,839
the speakers and the organizers so

243
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,519
that's good and not all the conferences

244
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,160
that grow keep the same format so that's

245
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,160
good yeah i think it was a privilege for

246
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,200
many of us to um attend these events

247
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,760
when they were so small that could

248
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,160
really form bonds

249
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,000
i don't i i just hope that as a

250
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,720
community we can still welcome the new

251
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,040
people that are coming in

252
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,680
in order to allow them to form those

253
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,920
bonds because right now these events are

254
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,720
larger and you were very right in saying

255
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,440
that hacking the box in some way

256
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,040
has managed more than any other

257
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,200
conference to preserve

258
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,440
a lot of the spirit

259
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,920
of the early days

260
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,480
along with a serious and impressive

261
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,200
growth because i i look around here

262
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,640
walking in uh abu dhabi and uh it's uh i

263
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,440
am just impressed by by what these guys

264
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,160
have built this time just like every

265
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,480
previous time even if

266
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,959
we are still very much subject to covet

267
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,519
restrictions and difficulties

268
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,800
um

269
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,120
the event around here is is absolutely

270
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,080
great and it looks not one bit different

271
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,880
than

272
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,839
it

273
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,279
did

274
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,959
two years ago

275
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,399
last time we were

276
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,040
basically here not physically the same

277
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,600
place but in the same city for the same

278
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,279
event

279
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,000
um i

280
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,160
the the second or the third hack in the

281
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,320
box right that happened in dubai

282
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,800
coincided with that infamous ash cloud

283
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,079
from from iceland and i i remember i was

284
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,320
caught i was caught up in barcelona i

285
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,240
could not make my way to

286
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,079
to dubai i had to wait for a couple of

287
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,800
days to get to the flight but when we

288
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,720
got here right there's there's probably

289
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,640
eight people who showed up

290
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,800
and i was thinking like okay you know

291
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,640
hack in the box is

292
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,480
it it's over right what are we going to

293
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,360
do

294
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,760
well guess what there was an event

295
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,440
the tracks were

296
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,959
completed

297
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,959
those who could not attend physically

298
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,959
were brought in virtually i think that

299
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,880
was like the first

300
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,880
accidental hybrid conference that i

301
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,880
remember and it worked out very well

302
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,800
like we put a big screen and we put

303
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,720
people on the seats the grug was there

304
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,680
with me

305
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,640
um

306
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,720
and the show went on

307
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,720
including the after conference party

308
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,200
like i know the organizers spend no

309
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,200
effort to make sure even if there's

310
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,040
eight people they all must have a very

311
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,640
good time it was

312
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,360
it was that spirit that kept uh that you

313
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,640
can see all out all out over here

314
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,880
um i actually don't remember what my

315
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,800
first hack in the box was something

316
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,800
something like 2006

317
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,600
uh but i i do remember what your first

318
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,360
conference was that was at it

319
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,000

320
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,240
first conference but was by first by by

321

we met that's that's right yes

323
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,720
and in fact this time it's going to be a

324
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,600
nice it is a nice reunion because of

325

338
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,920
break the rules start from 2008 from the

339
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,760
first hack in the box

340
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,360
because since you mentioned the grag

341
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,639
that may or may not be watching us or

342
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,399
watching the recording we will direct

343
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,200
into the recording afterwards yeah um

344
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,160
i was uh saying 2008 as i said it was my

345
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,040
first conference in southeast asia so

346
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,760
getting eu's that

347
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,519
kuala lumpur

348
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,000
international airport is enormous it was

349
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,800
confusing i got on the train

350
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,440
and on the train there was

351
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,880
one other person

352
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,519
who was uh evidently a westerner right

353
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,360
and he said right in front of me because

354
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,440
that's what you do when you are like the

355
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,240
two people that look reasonably closer

356
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,480
to each other than anybody else around

357
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,440
you

358
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,120
and uh um is truck conversation you do

359
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,680
travelers conversation right why are you

360
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,959
in kuala lumpur i'm going to a

361
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,360
conference oh cool me too which

362
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,279
conference hacking the box it's a

363
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,240
conference on security oh cool i'm also

364
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,800
going to work in the box hi i'm the grug

365
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,680
and i was like holy

366
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,279
sleep

367
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,680
because it was the grunt yes there was

368
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,079
no one but it was the drug so um that

369
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,040
was the way i met the grind that's one

370
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,480
example of

371
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,399
serendipitous events that happen at

372
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,880
conferences conferences physical

373
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,680
conferences make these things happen you

374
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,519
meet casually

375
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,279
a friend that is there talking with

376
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,800
someone else that you don't know and you

377
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,760
get introduced this mechanism

378
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,920
just is not there

379
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,440
in non-physical conferences and so over

380
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,199
the past two years that's one of the

381
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,519
things i have accepted the most not

382
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,440
meeting by chance

383
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,920
the next person that i want to talk to

384
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,160
yes that's that's a big thing that i so

385
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,880
that's my story

386
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,120
marco do you have any exceptional uh

387
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,199
stories from

388
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,320
any of your past questions

389
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,160
many things

390
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,720
that came to my mind but

391
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,680
regarding with respect is that

392
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,360
one of the idea that came

393
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,519
talking with people was to organize a

394
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,760
conference in which there is no real

395
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,240
program yeah so basically you are going

396
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,480
to invite friends

397
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,560
or friends can invite can bring you also

398
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,720
friends so you create a community people

399
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,040
and you just meet there with error with

400
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,720
idea of just spend some time together

401
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,079
and then if you want to present

402
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,079
something then there is a whiteboard on

403
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,839
the whiteboard you write you know the

404
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,440
top you want to talk about that you

405
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,000
locate your time you just present

406
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,440
so that would be probably the next step

407
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,959
because as you said the confidence

408
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,519
itself is not only about the program to

409
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,519
me maine is more like connecting with

410
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,920
right well and his casualty of

411
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,760
connecting with people

412
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,720
you can

413
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,600
you have it at the event like this

414
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,360
right that's actually a fantastic point

415
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,079
i have been thinking see we've and you

416
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,920
two have been organizing conferences as

417
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,839
well for a while right

418
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,760
we've been doing the same format of

419
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,560
conferences for years now we've we've

420
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,800
have tracks we have talks which are one

421
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,959
hour or two hours we have trainings

422
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,199
before the conferences and workshops

423
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,399
parallel

424
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,959
the only kind of major innovation if you

425
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,959
think has happened in these past 20

426
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,839
years is the addition of villages and

427
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,880
exhibits all getting integrated with it

428
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,600
but we're at a saturation level like if

429
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,880
you were to reinvent

430
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,199
the next cyber security conference

431
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,240
format

432
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,079
like what you said right just just come

433
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:50,880
there

434
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,959
write what you want to talk about just

435
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,199
jump up and talk about it

436
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,880
i have also been toying with the idea

437
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,959
like why should there be an agenda or

438
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,560
can we reinvent the agenda can we

439
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,639
reinvent the format

440
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,360
can we bring an experience together yeah

441
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,399
what would you

442
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,959
if i mean

443
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,560
i mean one thing we are trying to do in

444
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,440
a conference we are in italy is uh to

445
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,759
also offer uh

446
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,079
kind of team building associated with

447
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,959
the conference no like uh like last last

448
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,519
week yes we had this event in italy and

449
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,480
on sunday we offer like a guided tour of

450
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,160
the city for example no that is the

451
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,800
offer to the speakers but as well as to

452
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,079
selected attendees we want to

453
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,800
participate so there is an event

454
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,639
which is uh connected to security and

455
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,560
there are other

456
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,920
side events like team building

457
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,839
activities for connecting people

458
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:42,959
together

459
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,920
but what i also saw is uh hardware io

460
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,800
it's conference partnered with box uh

461
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,440
they start vcr with uh i don't recall

462
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,399
the name but is a kind of uh uh system

463
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,000
in which you

464
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,720
you you sit in a table uh last year was

465
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,199
virtual but we served person so you sit

466
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,560
on the table with a bunch of other

467
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,000
people you don't know each other the

468
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
table is like circular table there are

469
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,839
eight people and you have like one or

470
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,079
two minutes to introduce each other

471
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,520
so you have a chance to meet with these

472
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,520
other guys eventually you switch table

473
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,119
and you also meet with other guys so

474
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,520
it's a pure networking uh speed dating

475
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,599
but for nerds wow

476
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,240
exciting

477
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:23,359
so

478
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,959
you can also you can also actually on

479
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,640
the line version there is actually this

480
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,240
kind of specifics where you add your

481
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,200
interest

482
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,320
so it says

483
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,840
yeah and the online version

484
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,080
does not really work that well but i can

485
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,679
see that that working

486
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,760
another format that i think is

487
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,840
interesting and it comes from an

488
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,240
academic format actually

489
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,440
uh in europe we have a an institution

490
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,600
that is called dutch

491
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,840
it's a castle uh

492
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,640
and uh basically they have built this

493
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,559
seminar center inside this is a small

494
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:57,679
castle

495
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,240
and the idea of dark stuff they run

496
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,400
these dark stool seminars

497
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,520
and the idea of daxter is that you spend

498
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,520
like three four days

499
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,240
sealed off from the outside world

500
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,559
in a place where yes you can work and

501
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,559
connect but you don't have all those

502
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,240
facilities to work and connect you don't

503
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,320
want to facilitate people to work on

504
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,919
their usual stuff

505
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,679
you facilitate people to talk to each

506
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:22,559
other

507
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,960
so you have communal meals you have

508
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,440
moments for socializing

509
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,679
but also all of the

510
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,200
all of the uh event which is handled by

511
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,679
the scientists themselves so that it's

512
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,240
usually structured around either short

513
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,200
presentations approach work

514
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,559
discussion

515
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,280
open topics that are guided so that you

516
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,520
can generate like consensus or build

517
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,440
some

518
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,799
build some

519
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,440
interest in areas that are growing and i

520
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,480
think that that's maybe not as separate

521
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,039
maybe as part of the team building

522
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,880
activities around another conference so

523
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,880
that's the format that i think

524
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,799
we should explore because the the casual

525
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,120
interaction with your peers is what

526
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,200
makes these events follow so actually

527
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,120
that is what gives flavor to each

528
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,280
individual event right talks you can get

529
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,280
anywhere right and these days what

530
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,840
happens with talks is most of them get

531
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,919
most of them get published on

532
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,559
on videos anyway so you may get them a

533
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,799
month late but they're there

534
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:27,600
so

535
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,840
if i were to go to a conference i want

536
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,320
to enjoy the local vibe that the

537
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,520
conference itself brings like i know 44

538
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,720
con had this amazing facilitation of

539
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,880
interacting with the sponsors

540
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,559
and they had a village pub in there but

541
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:43,679
if you want to get a drink you have to

542
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,760
talk to the sponsor they'll give you 44

543
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,640
coin

544
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,039
which you can exchange

545
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,200
so it just brought everybody together

546
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,280
and they stayed in the venue for 3 a.m

547
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,720
nobody left

548
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,640
to go outside it's not like you know

549
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,160
london is a miserable place and there's

550
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,039
nothing to do but it was great to be in

551
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,080
there

552
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,640
i also have now become a fan of

553
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,679
smaller talk durations like i have found

554
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,159
more value in lightning talks

555
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,320
than i have found in you know one hour

556
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,000
long discussion so

557
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,880
it's also like you said it's a great

558
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,679
uh

559
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,360
we need to think about yeah how can we

560
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,000
have several but shorter interactions

561
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,080
and presentations

562
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,120
serve a

563
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,039
different

564
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,760
purpose so a lightning talk

565
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,159
is a teaser for you to go and get

566
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,159
informed on subject and i also like

567
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,559
those but the reason is

568
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,520
uh we already have subjects that we know

569
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,480
and so we enjoy being exposed to a quick

570
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,240
introduction to the next thing that we

571
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,360
may want to learn right

572
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,080
a talk that is like 20 minutes is

573
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,320
probably enough to explore

574
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,039
any technical subject not

575
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,720
that not that is not

576
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,720
too terribly complicated i think that

577
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,840
most of the talks of conferences can be

578
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,000
reduced to 20 minutes i'll talk that is

579
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,080
one hour long which is the traditional

580
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,880
duration of slots at many conferences

581
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,280
is a lecture yes that's a lecture and

582
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,559
it's fine

583
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,880
and it's fine for another set of people

584
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,440
probably not me or you that

585
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,840
want to study something that is written

586
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,400
so we want the teaser here tells us and

587
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,799
then we go back and study but other

588
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:27,039
people prefer to have an entire lecture

589
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,039
and then that's uh that's a different

590
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,880
step but i agree with you that the two

591
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,720
formats need to be mixed

592
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,720
in order to cater to different crowds

593
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,440
yes so i mean i'm hoping that we'll see

594
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,480
some

595
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,799
some changes as the world reconnects

596
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,960
once again um

597
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,280
probably in 2022

598
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,919
we are actually trying something new for

599
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,520
next year okay

600
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,840
visit actually a conference called bimba

601
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,280
is an academic conference running in

602
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,960
europe okay we are trying to have um

603
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,640
an academic track and an industrial

604
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,840
tracker

605
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,640
where basically uh in one day people in

606
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,200
the industrial track present a problem

607
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:07,919
a

608
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,840
technical practical problem and

609
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,080
an ongoing discussion between uh

610
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,760
academics we try to solve such

611
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,400
challenges and uh presented by the

612
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,320
industrial track so you could have

613
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,760
something like this for example making

614
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,200
conference where you have like attacking

615
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,240
defense

616
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,720
so we have some of the attack uh that

617
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,480
might present for example a way to evade

618
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,320
system and then someone on the defense

619
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,480
that might come out out and propose

620
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,559
solutions no sorry interaction between

621
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,120
two communities but see the problem from

622
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,479
one side from the other side

623
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,919
that's actually a great idea i was

624
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,840
actually thinking of uh

625
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,200
doing uh safari con where

626
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,720
we finish the talks and then we go to

627
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,480
the forests of india and watch tigers in

628
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,679
the wild

629
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,840
well

630
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,039
foreign did it in south africa they had

631
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,200
it webb and then we all went to a game

632
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,120
drive it was i think one of the best

633
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,760
experiences we have ever had i think

634
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,000
in one i went to just one conference in

635
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,360
south africa it was an academic

636
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,360
conference and they also had

637
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,520
something like that so yeah that's uh

638
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,080
that was actually a great experience

639
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,520
that's awesome

640
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,280

yes

717
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,760
but i wanted to just ask you one uh

718
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,919
one thing like uh exactly what would

719
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,960
your big take away be from any of the

720
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,840
boxes that you've participated

721
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,840
most memorable or most highlight other

722
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,400
than this birthday of course

723
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,520
i was just going to say it's the

724
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,640
birthdays

725
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,520
so that we can save for the next session

726
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,400
yeah up until now up until now

727
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,720
so i've only been to hack in the box

728
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,440
cyber week 2019

729
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,960
and

730
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,760
i think one of the biggest things that i

731
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,400
experienced over there was the sense of

732
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,039
community is usually when we go to ctf

733
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,320
competitions

734
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,679
they're very disconnected from the

735
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:10,720
community

736
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,080
and it's

737
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,799
usually some pr thing you know or

738
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:15,919
half the people there don't know what's

739
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,039
going on but with dylan

740
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,960
this great guy to have and he was down

741
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,760
there with us in the ctf it wasn't like

742
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,640
it was

743
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,080
hard to understand that the ceo or a

744
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,000
founder of a company was down with us in

745
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,480
the ctf you know shaking our hands and

746
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,399
telling us good job guys talking to us

747
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,080
about the the challenges and talking

748
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,520
about talking to us about the tech and

749
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,279
everything

750
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,039
and not just that but the staff all the

751
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,919
staff at hack in the box in 2019 it was

752
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,080
such a refreshing experience than any

753
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,120
other ctf we've had

754
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,360
the effort that went in with so many

755
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,880
different people to talk to so many

756
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,399
different things to learn some different

757
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,080
things to see

758
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,039
i think

759
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,279
it was hands down the best security

760
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,200
event i've been to

761
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,720
that's that's what resonates with us

762
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,600
we're just sharing our memories from uh

763
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,360
heck in the box when you're probably a

764
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,240
little baby i guess

765
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,760
2004 five six yeah wow yeah back back

766
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,919
then right and it's been exactly the

767
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:18,240
same thing the hospitality the warmth

768
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,960
this feeling of family the the community

769
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,520
spirit and stefano marco and i were just

770
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,279
missing that this was one of those

771
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,279
things that we took for granted annually

772
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,360
in our life you know rock up we'll meet

773
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,520
we'll have a chat a chat that we never

774
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,600
expected to have before

775
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,600
connect with friends that we knew

776
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,159
make friends that we never knew existed

777
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,559
and in a way i'm like personally so glad

778
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,440
we're back at hack in the box again

779
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,279
with folks

780
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:46,880
not so young

781
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,360
and young

782
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,000
of course we are yeah

783
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,159
yeah we are young and spirited actually

784
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,760
uh back in the time there was visa uh

785
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,640
you know

786
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,640
conference where

787
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,279
oh thank you

788
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,240
i mean you

789
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,559
back in the time the the conference and

790
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,440
the event was running around the space

791
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,440
so there was this hacking arraign you

792
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,240
know where you'd have brought your

793
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,440
computer with your crt monitor

794
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,360
you'd go there and basically you were

795
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,279
basically coding your open source

796
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,120
projects and acting with the rest of the

797
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,120
people so you could go alone you would

798
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,279
have meet like 100 200 people everybody

799
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,039
with his own computer there were these

800
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,720
long tables

801
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,399
you know you switch you connect i mean

802
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,159
like a neck space right but within a

803
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,240
conference so can you mention something

804
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,559
so there was no ctf no talks but was

805
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,360
just mainly basically this

806
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,640
arena right

807
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,399
so that was the best way to connect with

808
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:49,840
people and doing what you really have

809
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,799
i mean that sounds that sounds amazing

810
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,640
even right now i think i think there's

811
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,480
no better way to

812
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,240
learn and communicate with people than

813
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,279
just

814
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,000
monitor and pc especially because of the

815
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,480
time internet was not as prevalent as

816
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,120
nowadays right so there are not many

817
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,200
opportunities to uh to connect with

818
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,000
people right so that was this

819
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,480
conference or we call it echo party or

820
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,240
whatever you want to call them uh was

821
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,279
basically

822
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,039
yeah a chance for you to connect with

823
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:20,559
the community see

824
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,399
i mean it makes me kind of sad that i'll

825
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,240
never be able to share like a hacker

826
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,399
tool on a floppy disk and be like i just

827
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,000
finished coding this yesterday and just

828
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,520
hanging out

829
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,360
well hey never say never it's just not

830
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,720
going to be a floppy disk but it's going

831
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,880
to be a spi flash chip yeah

832
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,320
the more things change the more they

833
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,919
remain the same so

834
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,480
it's just going to be repackaging

835
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,120
every 10 years the circle comes back

836
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,399
right there at least that's what we've

837
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,000
seen for the past

838
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,039
20 years you can say that and this is

839
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,480
more of the same to come but in

840
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,399
different shape and form the important

841
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,159
thing is you carry that spirit forward
