1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,520
thank you very much for bringing us here

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,639
i'm really honored to meet yusuf here

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,559
it turns out that

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,280
long time ago about five six years ago

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,520
we started the cyber quest in uae it is

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,480
a challenge a competition that

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,039
aimed toward enhancing the ability of

8
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,400
cyber security across many of the new

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,320
generations from those grade 9 10 11 12

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,280
and up

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,920
and this is where yusuf really clicked

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,120
with the whole ecosystem so please

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,360
yousef tell us how it started and where

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,440
we at today

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,120
um so

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,960
around five to six years ago i

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,360
participated in my first cyber quest in

18
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,039
2017

19
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,600
and since then i found a passion in

20
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,719
cyber security and so i stayed close and

21
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,640
i followed the cyberquest program all

22
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,120
the way until 2019 where i also

23
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,280
participated in the cyber battle of the

24
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,319
earth

25
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,040
and that kicked off my career in which

26
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,439
me and a friend of mine started ctfa

27
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,760
this brought him to number one actually

28
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,960
on that

29
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,159
passionate towards cyber security and

30
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,400
this is a great model that we always

31
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,560
encourage many of our students to

32
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,400
actually uh follow and really follow

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,720
their dreams follow many of those

34
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,040
passions that they have

35
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,240
ctf

36
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,159
tell us about that

37
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,799
how you came across that and where you

38
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,720
started it and how it's

39
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,880
reached today

40
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,320
so ctf is a type of competition for

41
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,920
security experts stands for capture

42
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,240
deflect i was introduced to the concept

43
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,119
of a ctf when cyberquest came over to my

44
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,920
school and they talked to us about ctfs

45
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,759
and how they are run

46
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,719
and i found a great passion in figuring

47
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,200
out the vulnerabilities and whole

48
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,520
securities configurations and things

49
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,560
because

50
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,200
ctf is more than just a game it's in a

51
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,119
way an art

52
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,440
there's no one solution to a specific

53
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,080
challenge you can spend 15 minutes or

54
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,080
even spend an hour on the same challenge

55
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,080
depending on your ability to think

56
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,160
critically communicate with your other

57
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,480
team members and most importantly think

58
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,080
outside of the box

59
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,720
and this this is the key word there

60
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,640
again thinking out that

61
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,000
outside that box and teamwork teamwork

62
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,360
is what really matters cyber security is

63
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,239
never been a role of one single person

64
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,239
at all of one single entity a role of

65
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,720
one entity or government entity it's a

66
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,440
collaborative matters and this is where

67
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,120
really the team here with yusuf and the

68
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,440
engagement he they've been doing across

69
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,760
all of those aspects built this

70
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,840
community and this is what we really

71
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,720
actually would love to really uh a

72
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,599
biggie bag on because they are the first

73
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,200
line of defense of our security here

74
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,519
tell us about that first line of defense

75
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,920
learning about those vulnerabilities be

76
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,920
it in an application and a website in a

77
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,800
system

78
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,519
and and securing them

79
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,040
please

80
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,120
so it is important for

81
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,120
not just security experts to have

82
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,080
knowledge about security i think as a

83
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,720
country as a community it is everyone's

84
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,159
role in the community to be

85
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,680
knowledgeable on how to protect

86
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,440
themselves and the applications around

87
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,400
them

88
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,440
and it starts with being that first line

89
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,360
of defense the first line of defense

90
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,840
should not be your antivirus software or

91
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,680
a company it should be you yourself and

92
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,440
your family members and i think

93
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,599
everybody in the community plays a role

94
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,760
in not just educating themselves but

95
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,760
educating the people around them so that

96
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,440
to spread that information of how to

97
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,200
protect yourself and protect the people

98
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,840
around you exactly and this is where

99
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,000
we from a government perspective when we

100
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,680
try to build this culture of cyber

101
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,640
security we try to go not only in those

102
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,200
curriculums and those educations

103
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,319
on those systems or let's call it even

104
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,120
employment type of entities but also

105
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,439
really go to the public we try to

106
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,560
outreach our and upscales many of those

107
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,759
activities we do towards these new

108
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,639
generations public as well as even

109
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,720
parents who could help us doing a lot of

110
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,440
job for enlightening their kids how to

111
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,199
use many of these

112
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,960
gadgets that they use it in their homes

113
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,080
breaches are everywhere data have been

114
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,720
spread across different aspects having

115
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,720
this single line of defense to really

116
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,960
build up and many of those

117
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,440
kids culture that's our goal and this is

118
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,680
where yusuf is really

119
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,639
symbolizing our great efforts and these

120
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,880
aspects and how we actually came long

121
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,840
way through many of those

122
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,560
aspects what about the future

123
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,000
what is next

124
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,360
how you can

125
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,800
really

126
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,840
help us

127
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,039
to go to that level of securing many of

128
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,520
those systems spreading many of this

129
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,400
culture aspects we have

130
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,479
i think as technology becomes more and

131
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,400
more intertwined with our lives

132
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,240
especially in a very fast growing

133
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,639
country like the uae

134
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,440
it becomes important if not critical to

135
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,320
make sure that the next generation of

136
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,759
students the next generation of young

137
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:28,800
people

138
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,520
not only are interested in passionate

139
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,400
security but have are very well

140
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,759
knowledged so it's our job at

141
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,680
and of course in cooperation with the

142
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,720
government

143
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,000
to ensure that we do raise and sort of

144
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,759
take care of

145
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,759
this next generation of potential cyber

146
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,160
security experts because there are many

147
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,320
people out there who want to harm us and

148
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,560
harm our communities and the only way to

149
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,720
fight back against them is to fight with

150
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,520
an army of educational and smart and

151
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,639
creative thinkers

152
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,240
that's a great

153
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,560
ambitions and definitely we are aligned

154
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,639
in many of those lines and working

155
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,039
together and securing the nation and

156
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,039
even the region and even the world from

157
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,919
many of those again harmful

158
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,639
adversaries who could again

159
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,199
affect and impact our sectors critical

160
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,120
infrastructure financial sectors and

161
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,120
many of those aspects so

162
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,160
only together we can do that

163
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,600
thank you very much thank you for

164
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,360
everything thank you thank you
