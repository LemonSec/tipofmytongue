stephanie

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,119
aka nemo

11
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:24,720
and tim

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,720
two extremely passionate individuals who

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,519
have had the pleasure of knowing for

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,558
longer and shorter durations of time

15
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:36,399
who focus their energies on bringing

16
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,960
out of box thinking problem solving

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,280
cyber security digital safety

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,120
to younger minds

19
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,800
they both started out

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,640
their individual journeys in the

21
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,440
netherlands and it is time that they

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,440
bring this worldwide

23
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,840
i've been fortunate to be friends and

24
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,000
also to get

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,559
a view behind the scenes of what they've

26
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,440
done

27
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,879
and um

28
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,120
welcome to the studio stephanie at the

29
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,760
studio tim you think he is really glad

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,960
to have you here

31
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,000
and

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,320
it's glad to actually see you in person

33
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,960
finally yes finally

34
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,479
we've been i know we've been having

35
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,640
calls every week just

36
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,600
i mean two things it was nice to

37
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,280
keep thinking about

38
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,119
cyber security education and hack in the

39
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,000
class

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,920
but honestly it was a little therapeutic

41
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,360
for me that

42
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,680
real life still exists yeah my friends

43
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,640
still exist yeah and it was just nice to

44
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,920
even say hi

45
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,439
like it kept

46
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,079
it kept those weeks going yeah it was

47
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,320
quite a lot of fun it's a nice change in

48
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,439
the

49
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,439
weeks it just kept going it was a nice

50
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,479
change yes yes indeed

51
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,439
i think the last we met here was here in

52
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,040
the uae

53
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,799
at uh

54
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,719
heck dubai yeah where i got the

55
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,759
best opportunity to volunteer for

56
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,079
an in-person class session

57
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,399
and i have the certificate signed by

58
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,000
yesterday which is a prized possession

59
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,679
and to me actually that was an

60
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,959
eye-opener it was an eye-opener

61
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,400
of what

62
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,239
it takes to engage and excite young

63
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,680
minds

64
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,599
i've been a cyber security trainer but

65
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,280
i've always trained people who have been

66
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,200
in the field who've been

67
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,640
practicing it

68
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,120
and after looking at what

69
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,519
what these folks have done

70
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,000
it seems like my job is too easy

71
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,959
so

72
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,959
how did you imagine heck in the class

73
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,519
what was what was the genesis

74
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,720
um of both your journeys if you just uh

75
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,959
share with the audience yeah of course

76
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,519
so for economics i find it very very

77
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:48,959
important this

78
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,480
knowledge should be free

79
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,599
especially for the people who are

80
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,720
looking for it

81
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,640
especially for kids nowadays there's so

82
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,879
much information there's so much going

83
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,120
on so much distractions

84
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,319
it's also very difficult to find

85
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,040
sufficient good information

86
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,280
information you can trust that's correct

87
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,120
that

88
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,760
it just brings you further so one of the

89
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,560
things would happen in class is

90
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,879
to bring that to the kids make sure that

91
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,800
the kids have proper knowledge whatever

92
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,200
is going on in the digital world

93
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,599
may be what the the right or wrong is

94
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,280
from hacking when

95
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,920
you are doing illegal stuff or you're

96
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,920
staying on the legal side but also

97
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,560
things like phishing your passwords or

98
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,920
cyberbullying

99
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,920
are going on we all know it

100
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,080
especially parents say they know that

101
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,239
this is going on they experience it with

102
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,319
the kids but there is

103
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,840
no entity that

104
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,080
teaches to them and they don't know what

105
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,159
to do with it and you know if you're in

106
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,799
it what resources exist to help what's

107
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,040
the path to take yeah how do you get out

108
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,360
of such a such a situation yeah what do

109
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,840
you do as a parent if your kid is you

110
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,760
know behind the computer all day what do

111
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,359
you do do you trust your kids

112
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,760
when i was a kid fortunately my computer

113
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,439
was not connected to the internet yeah i

114
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,439
was just connected to my tv

115
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,519
and i put the plug everything went with

116
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,519
it yeah yeah we hack in the class we

117
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,519
just we bring the knowledge to the kids

118
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,120
we make sure that the kids have the

119
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,199
education that they need no matter where

120
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,400
they are

121
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,919
not not only to the netherlands but also

122
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,000
the whole of europe

123
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,400
the asia america and africa every kids

124
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,000
around the world should have the basic

125
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,960
knowledge how to protect themselves

126
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,000
that's that's the main drive for me

127
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,680
education is i can see that and

128
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,560
i actually saw that in amsterdam when i

129
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,240
was volunteering to be a photographer

130
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,320
when i get a box and i was taking

131
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,240
pictures of hacking the class

132
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,240
and that's the first i saw you in action

133
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,880
i thought that

134
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,720
so

135
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,680
that proved to me that yes age is not a

136
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,600
barrier at all right

137
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,600
we always say

138
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,960
we can start

139
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,800
at a reasonable age but i think starting

140
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,280
early is the most part is the most

141
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,639
important thing

142
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,120
uh tim uh would you love to tell the

143
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,280
audience about your journey with hack

144
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,160
shield

145
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,680
and i've only gotten to know you a

146
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,199
little bit uh recently but it's like the

147
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,560
more i've seen

148
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,560
heard of hack shield it's like

149
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,680
wow straight away right here

150
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,400
yeah so uh actually it started five

151
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,000
years ago i guess

152
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,800
um and it started because

153
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,800
we a lot of different

154
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,280
like game developers creatives not

155
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,520
really cyber security experts really

156
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,680
creatives designers

157
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,080
filmmakers we were having a conversation

158
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,080
and we were really wondering why we are

159
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,479
not getting this is the education

160
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,720
there's no digital education for kids

161
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,000
and and

162
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,479
there were also a lot of um

163
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:07,600
programmers

164
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,000
game developers and we asked them do you

165
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,319
transfer your knowledge to yes i said no

166
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,720
no no not really so we should do that

167
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,840
yeah schools i think i'm gonna do it

168
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,639
so maybe we should do something about it

169
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,240
and then we really

170
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,319
dived into the subject

171
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,960
and what i personally find very

172
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,160
interesting

173
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,280
is that

174
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,560
the whole

175
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,039
system like educational system in

176
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,520
society is a little bit broken

177
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,479
because

178
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,080
technology is

179
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,080
innovating

180
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,759
so fast

181
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,000
that we cannot keep up

182
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,600
i i realize that i mean it's it's we we

183
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,759
say it's broken but i think it has just

184
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,319
reached a saturation point where

185
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,080
they have too much to do

186
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,919
too many expectations

187
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,440
too few resources and they stretch thin

188
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,680
like water over too much breath will go

189
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,680
baggage

190
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,479
but

191
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,319
what the point you brought about is a

192
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,759
tremendous point it's a point about

193
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,599
knowledge transfer yeah like i have it

194
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,599
in my head you have it in your head

195
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,440
she has it in her head

196
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,520
but we always think it's somebody else's

197
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,639
responsibility to transfer it to

198
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,720
the generation saying

199
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,400
partly because we have no idea how to do

200
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,280
it

201
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,520
yeah and maybe the focus i'm curious

202
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,120
what do you think but sometimes i think

203
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,479
the focus is is not right so

204
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,039
there's a lot of pressure on

205
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,720
trying to transfer a lot of knowledge

206
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,720
about a lot of facts yes also in

207
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,440
cybersecurity also means

208
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,160
new subjects new worlds so it's about

209
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,879
okay what is relevant now what should i

210
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,039
get what i should what should i learn

211
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,720
now about fishing for instance what kind

212
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,800
of fishing is relevant now but if you

213
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,240
want to keep up

214
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,759
then you're completely stressed out

215
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,680
because there's too many details and

216
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,639
they're constantly changed so you know

217
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,879
for sure that you're not able to educate

218
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,240
them for the world they will be

219
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,680
grown-ups

220
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,479
so

221
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,440
you should i think put a lot more effort

222
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,280
in trying to

223
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,039
really let them understand the

224
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,039
underlying systems

225
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,039
because then you have a lot more time

226
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,440
and there will be more future truth

227
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,639
to

228
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,960
in their lives constantly find

229
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,199
themselves all the details and effects

230
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,039
they need at that specific moment

231
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,400
i think you're right

232
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,560
you need to develop a trait

233
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,120
yeah my sense it's a mindset it's a

234
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,919
trait it's a way of thinking it's a way

235
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,958
of

236
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,320
behaving

237
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,599
and

238
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,279
this is

239
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,679
this is what's going to last

240
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,679
techniques will fail they'll be

241
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,240
superseded they'll be over very fast

242
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,240
very very fast i mean probably you know

243
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,320
new things will be invented before we

244
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,680
wrap up the session

245
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,200
so

246
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,839
yes it's that trait if it gets in there

247
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,120
first yeah teach the mindsets show them

248
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,240
how to

249
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,399
you know respond to things or

250
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,959
please do some research yes make sure

251
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,120
that you know i've not seen this before

252
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,959
but maybe you know

253
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,560
should i trust this should not trust

254
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,160
this just give them the tools they need

255
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,440
in order to

256
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,600
make a decision themselves

257
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,680
this has been a better thinking topic of

258
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,360
my own

259
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,200
research right and original research

260
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,320
not

261
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,240
believing something they just read on

262
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,360
the internet

263
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,279
or got forwarded by whatsapp yeah

264
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,120
how do you validate

265
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,200
fact from fiction

266
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,120
and you can do it yourself you can't say

267
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,360
that oh my friend said so

268
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,839
or or you know this has been forwarded

269
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,800
80 000 times ergo it must be true

270
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,560
because if a lie is told a thousand

271
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,200
times it becomes truth yeah and that is

272
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,030
actually the

273
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,519
[Music]

274
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,720
the growing worry i personally have yeah

275
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,959
this is where this information starts

276
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,839
yeah and also i think the there is like

277
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,720
this feeling we have to know the truth

278
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,440
we have to know it and at some point

279
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,839
quite often there is not a real truth

280
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,600
yeah there's a range of different

281
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,880
perspectives

282
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,640
you should really have the

283
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,920
time and

284
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,120
trust this is really wonderful to me

285
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,760
about trust and that you have to

286
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,920
find your own opinion and it's always a

287
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,000
choice and you should really take more

288
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,959
time about okay if i choose for this

289
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:27,839
truth

290
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,000
what is the impact for instance in my

291
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,320
life or for the people around me

292
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,560
but the point i find very interesting

293
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,279
about trump's is that at some point

294
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,600
we realized that the

295
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,040
thing on the other side of secure

296
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,480
a lot of times now is on safety uh i'm

297
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,720
sorry so in the in the cyber security

298
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,279
world yeah as being new in this world

299
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,440
you have security and if you're not

300
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,560
secure it's unsafe i think so for me it

301
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,000
was more about

302
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,480
you have security and have insecured

303
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,120
and what i see with youngsters but also

304
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,120
with grown-ups is that they feel really

305
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,519
insecure they they even they give up

306
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,040
they don't they don't have the feeling

307
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,000
that they are able to catch up so if you

308
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,480
don't do anything about this insecurity

309
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,399
it's the biggest it's the biggest

310
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,640
problem you have and you stop learning

311
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,959
yes i mean you're first of all you're

312
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,839
afraid yeah because there's the big bad

313
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,200
world out there

314
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,480
you realize that you don't have the

315
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,200
tools to cope with it and this brings on

316
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,600
despair yeah and when you're in despair

317
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,040
mode you just like

318
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,959
you surrender you give up yes you feel

319
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,240
so helpless

320
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,480
it's like i can't fight this anymore one

321
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,480
of the most important things here is to

322
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,399
make sure that whatever information is

323
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,440
given it's simple it's clear it's

324
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,040
i mean

325
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,800
we have you know when you try to explain

326
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,279
to be technical that you say and yannick

327
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,440
which are like very childish

328
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,959
characters from a

329
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,839
comic book and also a movie

330
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,399
and we it's dumb it down as much as you

331
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,519
can your mom your dad your grandparents

332
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,600
you should be able to understand it and

333
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,000
i truly believe that if we can explain a

334
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,480
technical subject or if you can explain

335
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,160
you know phishing or scamming or

336
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,079
ransomware or whatever is going on in a

337
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,519
simple way to a kid yes a kid can also

338
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,519
help to

339
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,079
teach the parents teach the

340
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,000
teachers as well and make sure that you

341
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,880
know the whole circle around them is

342
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,200
yeah educated as well to change the

343
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,560
culture

344
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,160
and to actually be

345
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,360
you know

346
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,600
help your health the circle around you

347
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,000
yeah be the champion you know

348
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,240
be the be the guy or girl who has your

349
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,959
back yeah yeah this is the reason that

350
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,160
shield is called

351
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,200
future cyber heroes so so we never saw

352
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,519
kids as potential victims but we saw

353
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,200
them as the potential heroes that are

354
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,440
gonna save the world and

355
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,800
something really interesting happens

356
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,360
when you do this because kids they start

357
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,920
smiling even if they don't know a lot

358
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,800
they think they know enough to start

359
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,880
exploring difficult

360
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,279
maybe even dark areas

361
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,560
while keeping

362
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,000
this like

363
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,959
alert

364
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,519
mindset because they know i know it but

365
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,760
i also don't know it and

366
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,959
and if you

367
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,720
let them transfer their knowledge to

368
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,959
grown-ups grown-ups will applaud for

369
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,440
them hey wow you know more than i do so

370
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,240
you give them trust so if you have the

371
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,639
idea that this is the upside opposite of

372
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,560
securities insecurity you give them a

373
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,839
secure feeling

374
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,079
then suddenly they start like having a

375
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,040
learning mode they are curious so once i

376
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,120
heard a metaphor it's brilliant

377
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,600
i thought it was good about a dark dark

378
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,120
garden so there are like people in the

379
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,360
house they're sitting and outside it's

380
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,240
black

381
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,120
black

382
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,320
pitch star

383
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,480
96 black business

384
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,839
so so

385
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,000
like the whole family is afraid of the

386
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,959
dark and

387
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,880
um the parents are constantly telling

388
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,480
the kids yeah there are like alligators

389
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,240
outside so if you go outside they will

390
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,680
probably eat you

391
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,959
and if they don't need to hurt people

392
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,360
they're shooting around and imagine

393
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,519
every day okay so this is crazy they

394
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,480
won't go

395
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,199
outside properly but at some point

396
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,839
somebody will say the house is on fire

397
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,240
so what will they do they will just run

398
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,720
outside they close their eyes yeah this

399
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,560
is what we're doing now we're telling

400
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,360
everybody every day how

401
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,600
unsafe the digital world is and

402
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,279
everybody's like okay

403
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,199
don't go there and at the same time our

404
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,199
whole industry our whole life is

405
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,760
digitalized yeah so every time there is

406
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,000
a trigger little trigger the house on

407
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,920
fire have to go i have to order this i

408
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,800
have to

409
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,079
have my online degree i have so people

410
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,560
really should stop the house on fair is

411
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,160
called the guru my bias yeah for

412
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,839
instance you know what it did i mean i

413
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,519
am a penetration tester as an

414
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,959
entrepreneur

415
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,120
we used to do pet tests for uh

416
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,959
organizations we have to do an internal

417
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,120
pet test we always like said hey why

418
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,959
don't you vote us on site just just give

419
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,440
us a video oh no no we can't trust you

420
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,199
we can't like you know getting a vpn

421
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,600
approval takes months and

422
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,120
corona virus

423
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,040
vpn approvals in 30 minutes

424
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,720
what happened it's the same thing you

425
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,639
didn't suddenly become secure a switch

426
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:15,519
right now

427
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,240
and and they're now they're blind so

428
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,839
it's really a missed opportunity because

429
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,519
if you go outside

430
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,480
and then you will notice in some time

431
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,920
first you don't you don't run you just

432
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,680
stand your eyes are getting used to the

433
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,519
dark and suddenly you see oh i see a

434
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,519
little bit so you can start walking

435
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,839
around explore the garden know where the

436
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,160
water is there are no crocodiles but

437
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,519
there is like this

438
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,360
yet to be a little bit you know

439
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,519
so this whole feeling of giving people

440
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,920
the feeling that they can really

441
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,959
learn

442
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,800
to to get to know the digital world and

443
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,920
they can survive this is really we have

444
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,480
to be teaching every day instead of you

445
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,959
know what

446
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,320
every time i go to an internet site it

447
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,800
says you're going to give away all your

448
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,079
privacy

449
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,680
every day i don't know if it's

450
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,440
everywhere but in our country yeah every

451
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,120
side is my thing yeah we want your

452
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,759
cookies oh i feel messed up every day i

453
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,560
value your privacy

454
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,079
i gave up

455
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,759
at some point and a lot of people gave

456
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,519
up they just click them away because i

457
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,959
don't want to read it all

458
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,800
this is a very interesting one i want to

459
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,040
ask

460
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,079
what are your thoughts on

461
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,079
countering this information i mean of

462
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,079
course one of them is to do your

463
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,480
original research right but that's not

464
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,320
enough because that's now going to be an

465
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,880
individual's function and i see this

466
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,520
information is going to grow

467
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,400
we saw it in action of the u.s elections

468
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,520
it's

469
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,000
in action now with the corona virus

470
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,640
we've heard everything you know my 5g

471
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,559
signal is active and you know bill gates

472
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,400
is controlling her but whatever right

473
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,400
corona beer gives you corona virus you

474
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,000
heard it all and then people believe

475
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,520
this

476
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,039
reality is distorted you know

477
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,840
beyond black hole

478
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,760
this is going to grow

479
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,080
the research alone

480
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,120
isn't good

481
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,120
isn't going to cut it no

482
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,640
i know you two are the folks who can

483
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,919
make it scale

484
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,200
yeah we just released an ar quest so in

485
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,520
our in our game kids walk to a

486
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,760
completely gamified world it's like a

487
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,679
metaphor the internet they can

488
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:52,960
make all the mistakes that you don't

489
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,760
want to make in reality because of you

490
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,039
know getting used to the darkness of the

491
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,840
garden

492
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,240
sorry um so we just released the quest

493
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,559
with ar elements and kids walk in the

494
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,919
library and they have to find

495
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,880
this that information spreading ex they

496
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,200
often find them and then they have to

497
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,960
search for the right information in the

498
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,240
library it doesn't matter what they use

499
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,320
books computers whatever and then they

500
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,960
have to destroy it with facts

501
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,600
and the the thing that we concentrated

502
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,240
on to declare them how to

503
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,320
handle this information is that we're

504
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,280
really trying to explain them

505
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,320
every

506
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,440
information has a source and behind

507
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,000
every source there's an author and every

508
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,640
author has a perspective or

509
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,039
even

510
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,440
so

511
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,840
if you read different kind of

512
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,240
information about one subject

513
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,960
can you then try to understand why

514
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,960
somebody is writing something from out

515
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,720
of what perspective what's the goal for

516
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,840
that person

517
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,240
this is really again the mindset

518
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,039
so

519
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,200
yeah i think this is the most important

520
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,160
constantly trying to grab this

521
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,880
how would you uh

522
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,200
how do you do your life checking

523
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,960
well i think one of the most important

524
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,960
things is to show kids that

525
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,360
you know don't take things for granted

526
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,720
make sure that you

527
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,880
double check make sure that okay if the

528
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,400
elephant is gray

529
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,919
make sure to also check that it's not

530
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,679
purple or green or

531
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,960
you know rainbow colors yeah

532
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,960
yeah check the negative so if you think

533
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,440
a also check b c and d make sure that

534
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,600
you know you have all the possible

535
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,760
iterations of

536
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,000
whatever you're looking for because this

537
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,760
is how you

538
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,280
factor things or that you decide that

539
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,120
whatever information you just found this

540
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,960
may actually not be what you truly

541
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,679
believed was

542
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,240
this can be a very difficult subject i

543
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,160
mean right now with all media that's

544
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,600
it's

545
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,200
more and more difficult with search

546
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,200
engines that are you know

547
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,480
giving you a certain

548
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,600
yeah

549
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,400
they are excellent so they're which is

550
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,320
super annoying because

551
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,159
it's not the way

552
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,240
i mean it just limits us

553
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,960
it programs your mind a certain way well

554
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,200
that's not the same way we have to go

555
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,559
there's

556
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,440
one thousand other routes we can take

557
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,799
but that's not i mean we're being guided

558
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,880
by technology well we should start

559
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,960
thinking again for ourselves

560
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,960
that's one of the things that we also

561
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,840
want

562
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,280
to teach the kids like think for

563
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,280
yourself don't that's technology thing

564
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,640
for you right

565
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,640
think for yourself is this really what

566
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,000
you want was this really what you were

567
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,120
looking for

568
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,320
have you

569
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,600
checked the negatives yes yeah go go

570
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,880
have a conversation with people who

571
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,120
disagree with you because it's very easy

572
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,919
to be like oh tim he always agrees with

573
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,760
me i mean it's nice we have a nice

574
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,960
conversation

575
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,280
but what if tim has a very different

576
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,000
perspective well you know how to teach

577
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,919
kids for example but

578
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,720
it it also shifts my mind it changes the

579
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,880
way i see things it makes me

580
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,880
go take a step further or take a few

581
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,440
steps back and you know think is this

582
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,919
was this the right path or we have to go

583
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,200
take a different direction i think

584
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,200
there's no real right path it's just

585
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,440
your ability to keep changing yeah the

586
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,280
moment you stop

587
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,440
you lose the ability to you know predict

588
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,960
yourself well

589
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,720
there's maybe one thing that we should

590
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,559
see as a wrong direction and that's

591
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,360
creating fear yes because even the

592
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,280
people i really like

593
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,440
and very very smart

594
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,880
without even being aware of it use fear

595
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,559
they spread fair they say

596
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,360
you cannot trust things on that and

597
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,760
i think this is very you should say hey

598
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,039
listen speaker is there are people that

599
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,760
are doing things and they want to

600
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,919
have they have a goal and it's your job

601
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,679
to find out what they're trying to just

602
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,919
respect how smart then you just

603
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,440
described me

604
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,039
in the first 10 years of my cyber

605
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,640
security career

606
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,559
i was that fair mover

607
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,679
and i didn't know it and because i saw

608
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,159
the threats i found it

609
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,240
very compelling to go and tell the world

610
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,039
that

611
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,720
it's all out there

612
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,120
don't do it but then i realized that i

613
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,600
was giving the wrong message and that's

614
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,320
not what the messenger will give i have

615
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,880
personally been guilty along with a lot

616
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,240
of members of the cyber security

617
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,600
community

618
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,960
we ended up

619
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,360
calling we ended up blaming the user for

620
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,880
everything that is not the way to do it

621
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,159
if you look under the covers it's only a

622
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,960
fourth of the typical users

623
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,320
who really

624
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,880
just don't get it but the vast majority

625
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,320
do get it

626
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,080
i have a very good point on this so

627
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,159
let's assume we have a phishing email

628
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,559
right we all tell the users or our

629
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,120
parents or crackers don't click the link

630
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,520
right and people are like now afraid of

631
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,799
clicking

632
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,559
anything you don't click anything no i

633
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:05,919
didn't do it

634
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,159
which makes sense we're requesting to

635
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,480
fear but what if we show them like you

636
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,400
know click the link

637
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,000
see what happens

638
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,440
and especially if you do this in a

639
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,840
trusted environment show them the traits

640
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,679
that you know the criminals are

641
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,919
using to take our information steal your

642
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,640
money you know see your passwords show

643
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,720
them how they're thinking and then next

644
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,159
time they'll be like

645
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,679
oh

646
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,559
if i kicked zig oh it's asking me to log

647
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,320
in yeah and you will spread the news and

648
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,720
tell your peers like i know i do how

649
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,120
they do you become you become secure

650
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,279
you engage with people to think one step

651
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,279
further instead of

652
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,520
just remain in the shared moments

653
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,600
walk out of the house into the dark

654
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,720
garden yeah

655
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,720
and the alligator is not there but yeah

656
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,960
they may be asleep yeah

657
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,480
that's the alligator

658
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,400
yeah but and then i i heard a cyber

659
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,880
security guy

660
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,520
he said that

661
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,360
i asked him why do you like actually

662
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,799
because i wanted to know

663
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,400
and he said well what i like is that i

664
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,760
now have the feeling that i have

665
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,080
something that i can fight criminals

666
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,640
with with the same creativity as they

667
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,200
have because i'm always jealous because

668
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,840
i am just responding and they have all

669
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,480
the fun in trying new ways to come in

670
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,720
and with hackshield i have the feeling

671
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,240
that i can

672
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,240
use creativity

673
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,159
and curiosity

674
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:31,440
to fight back

675
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,600
yeah that's awesome

676
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,480
um

677
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,960
i have one

678
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,919
one concluding thought

679
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,960
and that thought is about privacy i mean

680
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,159
we

681
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,000
we have tasted privacy because we have

682
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,760
bought into it

683
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,440
i know for a fact

684
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,440
that going ahead

685
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,000
how long will generations be able to

686
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,200
even

687
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,520
experience privacy or will they even be

688
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,200
born into privacy or not and

689
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,760
with this fleeting

690
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,919
window or a

691
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,760
seating concept of privacy because

692
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,919
everything everything is dated the data

693
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,480
is not being owned on your device it's

694
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,720
on somebody else's computer

695
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,159
i mean

696
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,159
we're never going to get out of google

697
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,960
a few of us can we'll be permits and

698
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,200
we'll be okay but society won't be able

699
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,120
to

700
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,720
you have to learn to live in this

701
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,320
situation

702
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,639
what would your thoughts be on

703
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,559
trying to live

704
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,919
in a world where privacy is really

705
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,520
so i think one of the most important

706
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,559
things

707
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,559
to educate people make sure that they

708
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,120
know all the facts know the implications

709
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,320
of you know

710
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,799
if i sign up for war and or instagram or

711
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,960
whatever you know

712
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,120
service you can use nowadays

713
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,440
make them understand what implications

714
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,600
could be like posting a video liking a

715
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,840
message

716
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,080
and you know maybe even taking a step

717
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,440
further like do we really want this

718
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,679
can we also say no to the government

719
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,200
making governments change actually

720
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,440
listen to us this is very i'm not saying

721
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,039
this is easy not at all

722
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,600
because we need a whole society to get a

723
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,080
different mindset to

724
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,400
also educate on these subjects it's a

725
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,240
very difficult and delicate subject for

726
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,159
everybody but it's different competing

727
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:25,600
which is fine

728
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,919
um but that could be one of the ways

729
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,520
where we can

730
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,200
it's also a good point you brought about

731
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,440
consumption do you need this

732
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,159
i

733
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,080
i haven't posted pictures on my

734
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,960
instagram account for over five months

735
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,480
i thought i'd post them but now i just

736
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,240
don't feel like posting it anymore and

737
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,159
maybe you know what if it stays stagnant

738
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,200
like just

739
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,919
in web shows

740
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
what applications do you use

741
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,080
facebook instagram twitter you know

742
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,360
whatever

743
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,679
oh yeah i always review platforms every

744
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,200
single class

745
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,120
it just keeps developing so that's fine

746
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,400
i asked it

747
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,480
do you need it

748
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,039
i mean what if you don't install it yet

749
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,039
what if you don't sign up for the

750
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,960
account what if you actually remove your

751
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,279
accounts yeah you should

752
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,200
but then i'm left out but then you tell

753
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,520
all your classmates to open the install

754
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,520
you remove the app the activator

755
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,840
accounts and

756
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,919
love that feeling it's like a

757
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,360
short circuit in their brains they're

758
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,080
like oh this is an option

759
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,919
that was actually how i was when the

760
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,480
pandemic hit you know i used to travel a

761
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,799
lot i mean we all

762
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,159
see each other at different hacker

763
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:35,520
events and

764
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,799
i was thinking

765
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:37,919
i'm not going to be able to travel

766
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,200
anymore

767
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,919
my family thought that this guy's going

768
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,960
to go nuts he's usually on a plane

769
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,799
every three or four weeks and if he

770
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,720
doesn't do that he'll go he'll go nuts

771
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,120
and then he'll drive us nuts

772
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,600
surprisingly nothing like that happened

773
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,600
i think because i realized that nobody

774
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,120
else is traveling

775
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:02,439
if i was being left out i would go nuts

776
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,320
nobody dies nobody dies but i don't know

777
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,840
what it's going to be like now when i go

778
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,120
i've

779
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,880
tasted it again

780
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,640
