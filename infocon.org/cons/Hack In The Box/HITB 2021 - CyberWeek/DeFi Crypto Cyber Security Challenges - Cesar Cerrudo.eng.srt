00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:04,480
hello

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,720
i'm cesar sarullo

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,480
i'm presenting to the crypto cyber

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,360
security challenges on d5

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,400
so let's start with uh what's defined

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,720
so d5 is short for decentralized finance

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,640
which means that

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,080
on launch a

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:22,720
you can

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,920
[Music]

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,680
access

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,000
financial services similar to

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,160
traditional financial services in a

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,280
decentralized way that means that it not

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,000
depends on a central authority

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,480
and also you keep custody of your

17
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,040
cryptocurrency all the time

18
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,879
so with d5 you can implement the

19
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,200
centralized exchanges where you can

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,719
exchange

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,960
one cryptocurrency for another you can

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,440
do lending and whirlwind you can get

23
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,640
this double coins etc

24
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,840
this is all possible because of small

25
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,480
contracts smart contracts that are

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,760
we see later are basically computer code

27
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,920
that is in charge of implementing all

28
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,159
these defy solutions

29
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,119
the most

30
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,400
popular blockchain technology for d5

31
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,880
right now is ethereum but other

32
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,880
technologies that are getting popular

33
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,080
i'm starting to see some adoption

34
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,080
right now there are

35
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,960
billions of dollars locked on

36
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,000
defy solutions because when you interact

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,240
with defy your

38
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,200
your

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,759
cryptocurrencies are temporary locked so

40
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,680
you get custody all the time and you can

41
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,560
unlock the when certain conditions are

42
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,960
met certain rules

43
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,079
but right now is very very popular and

44
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,240
still growing in popularity and are many

45
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,119
union tours a lot

46
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,759
so like i said d5 works with smart

47
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,600
contracts what are smart contra like i

48
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,479
said computer code runs on a blockchain

49
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,920
so think about

50
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,759
a piece of code that

51
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,079
is is like a computer code

52
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,840
like a cell phone

53
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,920
application but in this case it's

54
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,959
software that we run on blockchain it

55
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,878
gets some

56
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,840
inputs you get some external information

57
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,599
so it has some rules

58
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,640
um based on how it's programmed it

59
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,120
performs certain actions and provide a

60
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,360
result so it's automatically executed

61
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,400
and is it's not possible to to change it

62
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,800
to edit it once in the blockchain it

63
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,400
can't be altered

64
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,280
but there are new technologies that

65
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,000
allow smart contract to be updated

66
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,120
basically what you do is like the smart

67
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,120
contract is a specific address on the

68
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,360
blockchain and then you

69
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,519
when you want to update it you generate

70
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,480
a new smart contract and the other one

71
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,640
the old one is not valid anymore

72
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,760
this is public code because it's on the

73
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,319
blockchain so anyone can take a look at

74
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,560
small contracts see how they work and

75
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,959
play with them so

76
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,120
this allow people to

77
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,959
if you want to understand what's going

78
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,840
on how it works what it does and just go

79
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,319
and take a look at the code and you can

80
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,040
even interact with it of course

81
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,920
and

82
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,080
also once something important small

83
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,120
contracts are oracle oracle are external

84
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,040
source of information

85
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,799
that allow smart contract to take

86
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,040
decision for instance if you have a

87
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,480
smart contract

88
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,640
for a centralized exchange you need to

89
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,920
get access

90
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,159
um to prices of the different

91
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,120
cryptocurrencies in order to do that the

92
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,120
smart contract will take it from oracle

93
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,080
that will provide the pricing for some

94
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,319
cryptocurrency or could be any other

95
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,760
data

96
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,840
depending on on the smart contract but

97
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,040
these are external

98
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,280
source information where the smart

99
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,640
contract get the information from

100
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,040
so what are the common security problems

101
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,080
because they are computer code so

102
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,120
the one of the common problems are

103
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,599
uh coding errors right so people make

104
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,959
mistakes they don't do proper validation

105
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,519
they will have logic error business

106
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,478
servers different kind of coding errors

107
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,560
that as we see later they can be

108
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,880
exploited

109
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,840
in order to steal

110
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,120
cryptocurrencies another common security

111
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,520
problem is the private key compromise

112
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,639
you know on cryptocurrency on blockchain

113
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,199
the private keys allow you to perform

114
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,680
the transactions to sign the transaction

115
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,960
to

116
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,199
to transfer your your coin to interact

117
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,160
with the

118
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,160
smart contract and also to publish the

119
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,520
smart contract um you need to write okay

120
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,000
sorry private keys so if the keys are

121
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,080
compromised then

122
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,600
all the

123
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,199
cryptocurrencies that the bands are

124
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,199
related with a private key or smart

125
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,520
contract can be compromised too so these

126
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,720
are some of the most common problems on

127
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,720
smart contracts

128
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,199
in order to to give you a visual

129
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,600
overview of how smart contract

130
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,120
works and

131
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,680
also what could be the some possible

132
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,120
hacks let's see this very simple example

133
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,360
where we have bob and alex there is a

134
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,280
smart contract in place that says that

135
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,680
when alice get the cryptocurrency

136
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,039
payment in

137
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,400
her wallet

138
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,840
he will transfer the the property

139
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,240
to above in this case it's a house but

140
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,560
it could be anything any any property

141
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,360
digital or material

142
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,919
and all this is called in smart contract

143
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,400
so this small contract will monitor at

144
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,320
this wallet address

145
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,440
and

146
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,160
once the smart counter that the money

147
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,880
already arrived to the wallet the smart

148
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,120
contract would transfer ownership of the

149
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,919
property to bob

150
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,080
so here is a little animation so money

151
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,160
cryptocurrency arrives smart contract

152
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,400
detected and transferred the ownership

153
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,080
to vote

154
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,600
but what happens if bob knows that the

155
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,000
smart contract have a

156
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,280
security

157
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,000
issue and he also knows how to exploit

158
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,720
it

159
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,880
he could make uh

160
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,280
for instance believe make the contra

161
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,199
small country believe that the money

162
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,759
arrived but the money didn't really

163
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,560
arrive it's just a hack and there is

164
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,800
more counter because it thinks the money

165
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,199
is already there in and it's wallet it

166
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,440
will transfer the ownership

167
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,680
so we can see here in the animation

168
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,039
so the smart controller believes the

169
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,639
money is there but it's not it's just a

170
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,960
hack from bob but the smart contract is

171
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,440
automatically executed and transferred

172
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,080
the ownership to vote so bob end up with

173
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,560
the ownership or in this case a house

174
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,680
but alice end up with anything

175
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,360
in another case

176
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,199
um mr hub

177
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,639
analysis

178
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,280
but we have a third party a hacker about

179
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,240
one

180
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,199
that knows the smart contract have a

181
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,360
vulnerability a problem so he can

182
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,120
exploit it

183
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,360
in order to get the

184
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,240
the house property so in this case bob

185
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,639
will transfer the money to alice smart

186
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,240
contract will detect that but because

187
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,360
the the hacker hacked the smart contract

188
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,759
so it makes the smart contract to send

189
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,840
the property to him and not to bob in

190
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,840
this case the hacker can walk away with

191
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,000
the property and bob doesn't have

192
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,759
anything and lost the money because he

193
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,160
was transferred to alice so this is a

194
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,120
very

195
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,400
easy way to visualize how smart contract

196
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,400
was and what could be

197
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,840
some possible hacks

198
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,199
and

199
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,280
right now there are 1.5 billion dollars

200
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,440
approximately

201
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,680
of lost phones so far on defy technology

202
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,639
and this is information from cryptosec

203
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,400
dot info where they have a compilation

204
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,800
of all the hacks from

205
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,479
years ago

206
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,199
right now is a lot of money that have

207
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,639
been lost because of hacks on d5

208
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,080
solutions right now we have 20

209
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,400
sorry 72 d5s plots exploit mostly on the

210
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,759
ethereal network also on

211
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,919
binance smart chain which is a clone of

212
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,759
stereo network

213
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,320
and then a few ones on avalanche and

214
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,760
polygon

215
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,120
networks

216
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,279
but you can see there is a lot of money

217
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,159
that being lost there's a lot of exploit

218
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,040
on d5 projects so this is not something

219
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,240
that

220
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,519
is uh

221
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,200
it's not something they say okay better

222
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,120
security problem but who cares now there

223
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,880
are security problems and there are a

224
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,920
lot of money being lost

225
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,000
so let's see some of the

226
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,640
attacks on d5

227
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,279
so one of the default functionality are

228
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,080
flash loans where

229
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,120
where our flash loans are loans that you

230
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,320
can

231
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,440
get money in this case cryptocurrency

232
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,440
without any collateral that means that

233
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,959
you don't have to

234
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,279
um

235
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,360
you have to lock any other

236
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,680
cryptocurrency in order to get the loan

237
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,920
so you can get a flashlight not

238
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,160
collateral but the

239
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,000
the point is that you have to return it

240
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,080
in the same transaction so when you

241
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,519
interact with the

242
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,160
d5 smart contract you get the loan and

243
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,200
you can perform other actions but return

244
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,399
the loan in the same transaction

245
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,040
and if you don't do that any everything

246
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,640
is rolled back

247
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,600
so

248
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,519
this flash law and attacks usually

249
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,120
involve

250
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,160
a hacker identifying

251
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,880
a vulnerable smart counter in a defy

252
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,519
solution so he will make a huge loan a

253
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,480
lot of money in cryptocurrency and use

254
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,200
that money to put in another smart

255
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,399
contract um where he can influence the

256
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,160
pricing of foreign centralization change

257
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,399
or other device solution that will make

258
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,200
that the the price of in a pair of

259
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,240
cryptocurrency can go up or down

260
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,240
and the hacker will

261
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,640
exploit that in order to acquire

262
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,360
cryptocurrency for for very cheap

263
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,519
so after he acquired cryptocurrency very

264
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,680
cheap because he used a lot of money

265
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,480
that he got from the loan and influenced

266
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,920
the pricing

267
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,880
then he can return the money and he

268
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,360
walked away with cryptocurrency he could

269
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,680
walk very cheap because he used the

270
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,880
launch to influence the the pricings

271
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,959
these are some of the attacks that are

272
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,279
related with flash loans

273
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,519
then we have

274
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,200
reentrancy attacks this is related with

275
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,519
the way some smart contract works where

276
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,800
one smart counter function can call

277
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,640
an another function from another

278
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,480
contract

279
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,279
and this external uh call

280
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,800
control call

281
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,240
can call back the the calling contract

282
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,800
and this can cause problems because

283
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,320
when the

284
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,279
caller

285
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,720
contract function call back again the

286
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,959
calling contract it can't this is the

287
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,440
bet sorry

288
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,000
detablize

289
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,720
the the state of the calling

290
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,440
contract for instance let's say that you

291
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,560
have a function that you come in a small

292
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,279
contact you can call to extract uh

293
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,079
cryptocurrency and after you extract the

294
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,320
cryptocurrency of course the balance

295
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,040
your balance has to be adjust

296
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,600
by subtracting the the amount of

297
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,920
cryptocurrency you are extracting

298
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,320
so let's say that

299
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,680
when you are extracting the that a small

300
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,440
contract will call a

301
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,120
external

302
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,519
function in another contract

303
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,680
and this function will call back again

304
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,560
to draw money and when they go back

305
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,120
the the balance hasn't been updated yet

306
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,480
because it's after in the code is after

307
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,079
after destruction

308
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,200
so

309
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,760
this uh external contract can call back

310
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,639
again to withdraw money and the balance

311
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,120
isn't updated and this can copy again

312
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,839
and again and again and so you can

313
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,240
by exploiting this you can withdraw a

314
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,399
lot of cryptocurrency

315
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,360
and then

316
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,360
at the end the balance will be added

317
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,000
because you are entering the state of

318
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,399
the calling contract this seems

319
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,320
a little bit

320
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,760
complex to understand but it's basically

321
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,639
how

322
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,959
you transfer the control to another

323
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,040
contract function

324
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,360
and then it can call back so it will

325
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,000
alter the state and that means many

326
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,240
variables won't be updated or will be

327
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,720
updated later and this can be exploited

328
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,440
too

329
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,200
to get cryptocurrency to see

330
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,000
cryptocurrency

331
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,360
another kind of attack is uh

332
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,839
oracle manipulation like i say oracle

333
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,560
like external entities

334
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,920
where

335
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,800
smart contract can get information from

336
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,320
so the smart contract will take

337
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,639
decisions actions based on that

338
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,680
information so if you can manipulate if

339
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,000
you can hack

340
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,440
an oracle

341
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,639
then you can influence how the smart

342
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,800
contract take decisions

343
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,279
and based on that you could

344
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,320
steal

345
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,199
cryptocurrency by influencing the smart

346
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,519
contract with fake information from the

347
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,560
oracle for instance

348
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,120
then another popular attack is called

349
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,519
rock ball

350
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,240
which is basically a scam where you know

351
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,639
people

352
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,800
they they say okay we have this cool

353
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,199
project this cool defy project that we

354
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,240
run an ethereum or another hot

355
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,920
blockchain technology so we are locking

356
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,079
we are raising money we are locking the

357
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,600
cryptocurrency and we pay a lot of

358
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,839
uh interest and people can make a lot of

359
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,000
money with this so basically they

360
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,320
people lock the cryptocurrency in the

361
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,720
smart contract and the guys that are

362
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,279
running the project then just

363
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,680
walk away with everything and people get

364
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,279
without anything

365
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,600
this is very common and it's basically a

366
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,240
scam where people is convinced to put

367
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,720
their money in a small contract and then

368
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,720
the owners of the most contract because

369
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,120
small contract

370
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,920
can be accessed by the the creator

371
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,440
because they have the private key so

372
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,519
they could modify it or they can access

373
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,160
to some other functionality so after

374
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,880
people put the money and if enough money

375
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,480
they can walk away with all the

376
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,920
cryptocurrency from the people

377
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,440
another common attack is due with

378
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,839
private key compromise

379
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,160
because once you compromise the key then

380
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,320
you can access the smart contract in

381
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,399
different ways for instance like i said

382
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,440
at the beginning you could update

383
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,079
the smart contract and change it to for

384
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,040
instance

385
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,920
send the cryptocurrency to another

386
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,360
wallet another

387
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,079
place and steal the cryptocurrency or

388
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,360
you can access some specific

389
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,160
functionality that is restricted for

390
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,920
only if you have the private key for

391
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,479
instance

392
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:44,800
so

393
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,759
why this um

394
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,240
all these hacks and attacks happen what

395
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,079
are the problems well the problems are

396
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,240
reality because small contracts are very

397
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,519
complex

398
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,240
so this is new technology that is being

399
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,279
improved and and also new functionality

400
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,959
is being added all the time and also

401
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,360
new blockchain technologies

402
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,880
are coming up

403
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,480
very often

404
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,880
so this makes smart contract very

405
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,320
complex you have many lines of codes

406
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,519
you have also sometime blockchain

407
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,839
cross blockchain functionality where you

408
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,360
have the smart control running in a

409
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,920
blockchain that we call another

410
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,160
blockchain and interact with it so we

411
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,720
have many cryptocurrency protocols etc

412
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,680
that makes very complex smart contracts

413
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,839
so when the

414
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,600
developers uh code the smart contract

415
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,839
they have to have a very

416
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,680
clear understanding of what they are

417
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,279
coding what are the technologies the

418
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,600
related technology and it is difficult

419
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,360
because like i said you have new

420
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,639
technology coming up all the time and

421
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,240
new functionality and also

422
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,240
people want to release code fast

423
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,560
which is this point right

424
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,279
there is clear incentive where

425
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,559
d5 prices want to be released to get

426
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,559
money fast because the faster you

427
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,119
release the code the defy solution the

428
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,359
faster you will be able to get money for

429
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,480
from people

430
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,839
and then of course if it is

431
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:20,799
a a good project not not a scam

432
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:21,599
uh

433
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,359
also you have competition with other

434
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,079
solutions so you want to get your device

435
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,520
uh functionality project out and get the

436
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,760
money for people and produce the you

437
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,960
know the

438
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,039
income based on that

439
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:35,919
um

440
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,440
some of the different products are

441
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,760
similar with the icos in the past maybe

442
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,039
you remember

443
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,000
you know for three years ago

444
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,679
icos were very popular where people

445
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,320
think about you know some solutions some

446
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,160
functionality and they will create a

447
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,120
token a cryptocurrency and they will do

448
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,440
a lot of marketing get money from people

449
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,360
promote something

450
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,360
and and also this

451
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,200
and this

452
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,440
was done very fast right

453
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,600
which has a marketing campaign get money

454
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,919
from people release the code or what

455
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,120
solution

456
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,360
um usually you get a lot of security

457
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,200
problem with icos in the past a lot of

458
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,120
scams and

459
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,120
similar now you have a lot of d5

460
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,360
projects coming up and most of them

461
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,280
don't have very good security it's just

462
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,960
going to really fast and get money

463
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,799
um of course

464
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,559
very few projects has sdl

465
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,600
program in place so they just you know

466
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,780
program the

467
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,240
[Music]

468
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,039
the smart contract um sometimes will

469
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,039
have incremental audits so they are

470
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,600
adding functionality audit it

471
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,840
then add more functionality of it again

472
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,679
but sometimes they wish us

473
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,720
updated and release it after doing some

474
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,360
changes which is not good and very few

475
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,799
project has

476
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,640
google security practices in place right

477
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:00,940
um

478
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,400
[Music]

479
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,960
and another huge problem i would say is

480
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,400
that the develop and team behind the

481
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,080
device solution behind the smart

482
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,919
contract they have the keys they have

483
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,600
the private key so

484
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,720
basically

485
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,039
when you are dealing with a defy project

486
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,799
you're trusting your money to the

487
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,280
developers to the person having the keys

488
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,360
because they are the ones that can

489
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,840
access specific functionality or as they

490
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,320
updated smart content so

491
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,559
um there have been cases where some

492
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,080
teams get

493
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,000
some members of the team get angry with

494
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,240
each others and they just steal the

495
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,480
money or they do something bad

496
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,840
so this is something that

497
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,919
is is a big problem you know because you

498
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,240
are trusting people with the keys to to

499
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,000
do dangerous things sometimes

500
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,840
um and on top of the problems you have a

501
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,640
lot of bad practices by people behind

502
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,720
the d5 project because

503
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,760
i can say you want to release code fast

504
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,440
and then get money from people there is

505
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,000
a strong incentive for that and i forgot

506
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,440
to mention that

507
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,600
people are not very conscious about the

508
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,159
danger of putting money on d5 probably

509
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,400
they or maybe they are conscious but

510
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,760
they don't really care they are

511
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,960
basically

512
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,080
throwing more any so it's throwing money

513
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,799
to

514
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,120
all new defy project without caring

515
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,280
about who is behind if it is something

516
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,520
trusted or not now people just throw the

517
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,120
money to the nif employee um and that's

518
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,760
a broad incentive right because they the

519
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,520
people behind the d5 project they know

520
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,679
that people don't care about anything so

521
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,760
they wish us if the project is

522
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,520
attractive people will just throw the

523
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,880
money

524
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,360
uh and this also isn't very much bad

525
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,200
practices like

526
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,080
very security audience sometimes

527
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,960
uh

528
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,000
most trusted uh project defined projects

529
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,520
they will do security updates they will

530
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,480
once the code is is ready they will make

531
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,880
a security of it and then they will fix

532
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,280
the problems and they will publish the

533
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,679
the result of the security update that

534
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,600
is in order to

535
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,760
to make people trust that they do the

536
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,320
things in a good way they care about

537
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,440
security but other the five project just

538
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,559
will

539
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,720
uh build a fake security audience saying

540
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,720
okay we found this and this it was fixed

541
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,080
and that's it or you would say no we

542
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,600
didn't find anything and it was

543
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,960
everything perfect

544
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,000
i don't

545
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,760
think the guilty of this so people is

546
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,960
cheated believing that the defy project

547
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,280
is safe but it's just not

548
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,320
uh another bad practice is that

549
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,000
some project will audit

550
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,280
version one

551
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,280
but then after the version one is

552
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,039
updated and the problems are fixed they

553
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,120
will add some functionality sometime

554
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,640
mean functionality sometimes more

555
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,000
functionality

556
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,600
but the new version with more

557
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,640
functionality is never updated so

558
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,760
they have the report that

559
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,000
they'll did from the version one but not

560
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
for the the version that is finally

561
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,360
released

562
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,200
uh so this is not good

563
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,480
um

564
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,880
another but practice is that they will

565
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,240
do audits

566
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,320
maybe we'll hire one company then we

567
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,039
have another company or some guys that

568
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,799
work on security

569
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:17,679
and

570
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,159
once they get the nicer report being the

571
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,159
report with the

572
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,280
less vulnerabilities or maybe they find

573
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,280
a company of a guy

574
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,320
that

575
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,280
can

576
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,919
say that they didn't find anything but

577
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,840
maybe they find something but and then

578
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,120
they get fixed but then they will just

579
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,840
change the report to make it look nicer

580
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,120
and another

581
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,280
this is maybe not a bad prices but it

582
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,640
could be but incentive is that

583
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,120
sometime they will pay the audit or the

584
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,720
the companies or the guys are leading

585
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,799
the smart contract if i probably be

586
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,480
talking so

587
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,919
this is uh

588
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,679
because this is not real money and

589
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,080
sometimes the tokens depends on the b5

590
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,720
project how popular or how well it

591
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,240
performs

592
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,640
then it could be a conflict on interest

593
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,039
with this right because you know paying

594
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,280
with tokens so the the company are doing

595
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,360
that they get the tokens they they want

596
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,559
to talk and get

597
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,440
more value um so it could be some

598
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,080
conflict of interest so this is it's not

599
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,320
that i would it couldn't be a good

600
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,520
practice

601
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,840
if done in an improper way

602
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,360
so what are the

603
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,400
possible

604
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,880
solutions to avoid all these problems

605
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,880
and improve the

606
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,159
practices

607
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,080
of course first is

608
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,120
don't be

609
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,440
greedy because

610
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,200
you know like i said people just

611
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,640
throwing money to defy project the guys

612
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,120
behind the default price they they know

613
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,279
about this so they are being greedy they

614
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,440
just want to push the approach project

615
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,240
out

616
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,240
and don't care about cyber security or

617
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,080
they will just you know if they get

618
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,240
hacked they don't lose anything because

619
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,159
it's money from it's not from then it's

620
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:05,200
from the

621
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,720
people trusting them

622
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,200
so there is a lot of greed right now uh

623
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,799
people shouldn't be

624
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,120
so greedy and also think about

625
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,720
the the people that are putting the

626
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,039
money into those projects

627
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,880
and of course this is a very basic

628
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,559
recommendation you have to invest on

629
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,559
cyber security from day one you don't

630
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,000
have to wait

631
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,760
after the project is in a late stage uh

632
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,400
you have to start from day one implement

633
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,919
the sdl

634
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,120
proper cyber security practices and make

635
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,880
your make sure your your project is

636
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,039
secure

637
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,400
like i said

638
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,360
sdl implemented

639
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,400
this is

640
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,799
um for some projects are more mature

641
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,000
usually the

642
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,600
the projects that have

643
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,679
good funding from trusting and

644
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,440
well-known bcs or companies

645
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,679
they are more mature about cyber

646
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,600
security they they care more so they

647
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,159
implement sdl they

648
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,159
they do proper audits

649
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,880
but many other default projections don't

650
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,559
care about security or maybe they don't

651
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,000
know about the importance of cyber

652
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,440
security solutions produce

653
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,440
reduce the solution and they will kill

654
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,840
later

655
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,600
and finally

656
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,080
it's very important to audit everything

657
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,320
before any release and not like i said

658
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,960
before that you update version one but

659
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,200
then version

660
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,440
1.1 is not updated or

661
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,360
there are changes that are not updated

662
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,760
but it's also important to audit all the

663
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,039
ecosystems or the infraction

664
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,159
because once is the

665
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,039
one thing is the smart contract or smart

666
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,799
contracts on the d5 project but then you

667
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,480
have a lot of interaction with other

668
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,120
blockchains you have the infracturing

669
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,799
you have a

670
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:57,760
a big technology stack and everything

671
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,440
should be updated not just the smart

672
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,320
contract is related you should audit

673
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,880
everything that participates in the d5

674
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,840
project

675
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,720
uh in that way you can guarantee they

676
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,279
will have a high level of cyber security

677
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,120
okay that's it i hope you like it it was

678
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,080
kind of a short presentation

679
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,039
i just wanted to to give a good overview

680
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,919
of dfi and other problems and possible

681
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,440
solutions so

682
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,000
if you have any questions or whatever

683
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,240
you can send me an email and we'll be

684
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,919
glad to answer you

685
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,720
thank you goodbye
