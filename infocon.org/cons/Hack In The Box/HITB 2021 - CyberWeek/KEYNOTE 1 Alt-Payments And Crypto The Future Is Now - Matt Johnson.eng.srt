21
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,440
and make the uh the best of that's time

22
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,440

can get this moment back

24
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,000
but before i get into my agenda i'd like

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
to take a moment to frame why it is that

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,520
we're actually here

27
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,239
we're here for the people we're here for

28
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,480
our customers we're here for our future

29
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,800
customers and we're here for any person

30
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,040
or institution who is willing to take

31
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,600
that leap of faith towards web3 and

32
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,720
crypto

33
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,240
but i'll get into all of that a little

34
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,680
bit later

35
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,439
what i'd like to do today is to help set

36
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,680
the scene for the next couple of days of

37
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,799
presentation speakers training events

38
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,799
breakout sessions and with a view to

39
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,159
some of the challenges we're seeing

40
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,759
across the market

41
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,159
i'm going to be talking about ledger

42
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,240
where i'm from and what ledger's reason

43
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,439
to be is

44
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,280
talk about blockchain technology and how

45
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,520
it's actually changing the world

46
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,840
the global adoption for crypto and how

47
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,600
it is emerging and the pace at which

48
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,159
it's moving i'll then touch briefly upon

49
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,360
some of the things that we're actually

50
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,759
seeing in the market and then moving in

51
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,439
to build upon some of the comments that

52
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,720
his excellency uh dr muhammad al kuwaiti

53
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,360
made around the need for education

54
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,399
awareness security

55
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,399
talk a little bit about how ledger helps

56
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,759
but then i also want to do a piece and

57
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,640
focusing on why developers are key the

58
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,960
developers are our future and we need to

59
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,640
remember that and make things as easy as

60
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,280
possible and the challenges in our world

61
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,080
so

62
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,640
what is ledger's reason to be why do we

63
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,280
exist and how do we fit into the future

64
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,720
is now for the payments ecosystem

65
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,160
i'm going to give a little bit away

66
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,640
about my age here and what i'd like to

67
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,720
do is just to ask for a short show of

68
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,520
hands for anybody who actually remembers

69
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,959
this advert

70
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,319
so can you put your hand up if you

71
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,720
remember this advert

72
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,480
okay i'm not surprised i'm probably one

73
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,400
of the older ones in the group here

74
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,440
so this was an advert that was run by

75
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,120
apple back in 1984.

76
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,000
when apple began they ran this advert

77
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,760
directly to target and against ibm

78
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,200
important to remember that where they

79
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,080
came from they were the very little fish

80
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,640
in a much much bigger pond

81
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,080
and they were trying to push something

82
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,400
better for the people that was 38 years

83
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,440
ago

84
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,760
you've got to remember that human choice

85
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,720
is historically constrained by power

86
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,879
think of all the moments in history

87
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,800
where we as people are repeating

88
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,920
ourselves

89
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,680
time and again pushing with the same

90
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,680
altruistic or at times hateful

91
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,760
intentions where we're gathering people

92
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,519
to our cause creating these new

93
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,080
paradigms and then think of ledger

94
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,000
ledger is a french company and the

95
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,159
french have a history of a people is to

96
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,359
create revolution

97
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,959
and as i said we've been in this moment

98
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,560
before apple revolt just take a moment

99
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,159
to look around the world where we are

100
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,519
today

101
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,000
we are in this moment again

102
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,400
we're an incredible period of transition

103
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,159
when the world where it comes to how we

104
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,959
connect with things like crypto d5 and

105
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,040
how we close ourselves off we see some

106
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,640
governments are actually focusing more

107
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,799
towards wanting to censor some

108
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,319
governments are focusing towards wanting

109
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,879
to ban crypto and how we change the way

110
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,560
that we value life we're in the middle

111
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,120
of a horrifying pandemic that's changed

112
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,720
the way that we've all had to interact

113
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,000
with one another

114
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,159
looking out upon you all today seeing

115
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,760
masks everywhere

116
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,680
seeing everybody having to be split far

117
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,760
apart keeping our distance just think of

118
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,120
all of the changes that have happened in

119
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,918
our society over the last two years and

120
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,238
indeed what we had to go through just to

121
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,839
be here today

122
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,520
flying traveling airport pcr tests we

123
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,840
are having to make all of these changes

124
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,080
so the revolutionaries have become the

125
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,440
monopolies

126
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,880
throughout time historically the

127
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,240
revolutionaries have become those

128
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,080
monopolies while they try to stay

129
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,680
altruistic

130
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,160
to their needs of serving the people

131
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,479
business often takes over and at times

132
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,479
the desire for revenue may eventually

133
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:47,840
conflict with

134
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,120
or even trump morality and intention

135
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,720
if we think of facebook we've now

136
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,199
rebranded to meta and if we think about

137
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,199
cambridge analytica and the data scandal

138
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,199
that was involved between the two

139
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,280
the duopoly that facebook and google

140
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,440
have currently reached with advertising

141
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,199
and how that's changed how information

142
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,280
is learned and shared and trusted around

143
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,639
the world

144
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,240
amazon has changed the meaning of small

145
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,240
business and automation and these are

146
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,919
challenges that will only continue to

147
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,360
scale

148
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,360
we've moved from a technical and

149
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,320
information revolution into a revolution

150
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,880
of value

151
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,520
human inventions change humanity and

152
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,680
co-figure it's what they do but every

153
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,000
invention has its good and it's bad

154
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,400
fire as an invention is it good or is it

155
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,199
bad

156
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,919
plastics are they good or are they bad

157
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,320
they can be used regardless if it's good

158
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,280
or if it's bad it drives change

159
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,440
the printing press started a revolution

160
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,680
and it just didn't make books available

161
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,840
it changed who could read

162
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,600
once people started reading they had the

163
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,600
ability to share ideas and that impacted

164
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,320
profound social religious scientific and

165
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,840
cultural impacts

166
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,759
the internet was a revolution of

167
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,840
information we are now faced with that

168
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,400
revolution of value

169
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,639
here's a prediction from me

170
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,520
everyone will end up owning

171
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,800
crypto

172
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,360
everyone will end up interacting with

173
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,600
systems or services that use the

174
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,560
fundamental underlying technologies as

175
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,560
they go about their daily lives that are

176
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,400
currently used today to enable crypto

177
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,400
and alternative payments

178
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,680
in fact

179
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,440
many of you may not actually know this

180
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,520
you already do

181
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,880
global trade is currently worth about 19

182
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,360
trillion usd per year

183
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,319
and the vast majority of goods that are

184
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,000
shipped in steel shipping containers and

185
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,600
go around the world

186
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,560
currently used a permissioned blockchain

187
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,759
system

188
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,000
to do that it's completely transformed

189
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,280
the way that the shipping industry is

190
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,919
done using blockchain technology it's a

191
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,479
joint venture between maersk and ibm

192
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,000
and it's revolutionized the way that

193
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,280
they did it

194
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,479
in 1998 there were people who thought

195
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,400
they wouldn't needs to have an email

196
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,319
address

197
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,319
just think about that for a moment

198
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,919
likewise we're going to see a shift in

199
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,319
the financial services coming and in 10

200
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,280
years you will be able to buy apples at

201
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,599
a farmers market using the same

202
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:16,479
technology

203
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,520
that i just described crypto blockchain

204
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,039
we're going to have that revolution of

205
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,960
the redistribution of value

206
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,919
now legend was founded more than three

207
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,639
decades after microsoft and apple

208
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,840
they became the hardware firmware

209
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,440
software leaders working to create

210
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,360
change in the space and that's

211
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,639
ultimately created these new issues

212
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,000
security

213
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,080
financial literacy once again going back

214
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,080
to the education piece that is

215
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,919
excellency uh dr kuwaiti mentioned

216
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,639
autonomy and privacy that led seeds the

217
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,960
grounds for our own revolution

218
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,960
i use these slides here

219
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,440
from a an endlemon trust survey because

220
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,759
they showcase just how deeply

221
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,560
individuals are starting to not trust

222
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,000
government or even more the media they

223
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,160
believe the businesses must step in and

224
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,800
lead the way to create change

225
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,560
i'd like to call out the three top

226
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,319
priority shifts

227
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,879
in here and we're seeing a shift really

228
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,560
too personal

229
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,879
we're seeing people prioritizing family

230
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,160
and their needs

231
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,919
increasing my media and information

232
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,240
literacy and increasing my scientific

233
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,319
scientific literacy

234
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,680
these themes are playing to the new

235
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,159
revolution i need to maintain financial

236
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,799
independence and security as trust in

237
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,799
these major institutions is being seen

238
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,679
to wane it's also a need for increased

239
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,039
literacy and understanding but i'll

240
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,320
touch on more on that a little bit later

241
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,240
so the new revolutionary period is among

242
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,680
us amongst us

243
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,360
a number of other speakers over the next

244
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,800
couple of days are going to touch on

245
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,959
these topics innovation revolution

246
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,160
education security pace of change so

247
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,600
this is just setting the scene and the

248
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,160
groundwork for all of those so we must

249
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,399
help rise up and frame that for how we

250
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,800
go forward

251
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,959
so ledge is the global platform for

252
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,040
crypto and web 3.

253
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,240
it was founded in 2014 and i'd just like

254
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,080
to remind you that bitcoin didn't come

255
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,720
about in 2000 until after the economic

256
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,120
collapse of 2008.

257
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,519
after that economic collapse in 2008 it

258
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,279
became abundantly clear to people that

259
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,680
there was a need for a new financial

260
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,480
system a decentralized one where the

261
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,519
person alone has control and freedom

262
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,839
over their finances and that began the

263
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,959
revolution we see today which is crypto

264
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,119
so

265
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,120
hopefully many of you are familiar with

266
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,800
ledger know it and know about its

267
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,440
products i'm not going to go into a

268
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,160
speech on different sorts of custody

269
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,839
different wallets types all the rest of

270
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,440
it but i will just touch on these things

271
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,240
that

272
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,839
ledge is the global leader for securing

273
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,079
digital assets and i talk about digital

274
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,399
assets here not just cryptocurrencies so

275
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,240
that could be nfts we're working through

276
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,120
identity things like securing deeds

277
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,120
title beads to houses this is all pieces

278
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,480
that are coming

279
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,480
but ledger we currently secure more than

280
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,920
15 of the total crypto assets

281
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,279
around the world

282
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,720
we've got more than 4 million of our

283
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,040
units are out there we've got 60

284
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,720
financial more than 60 financial

285
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,480
institutions using our ledger enterprise

286
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,320
services so we've got the business to

287
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,720
consumer business where we sell the nano

288
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,120
hardware device so it keeps your keys

289
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,959
secure offline never exposed to the

290
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,440
internet and we've also got the b2b the

291
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,040
business to business which is our ledger

292
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,640
enterprise vault which is where all of

293
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,720
our financial institutions

294
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,519
and large organizations use

295
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,680
what's key within all of those offerings

296
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,440
is that they've been built on the single

297
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,880
single premise

298
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,760
you are in control of your own assets

299
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,839
if you don't hold your keys if you don't

300
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,040
protect those you do not have control

301
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,360
there's a saying within the crypto space

302
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,079
not your keys not your assets

303
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,640
so if you hold an account on an exchange

304
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,480
guess what they actually still have

305
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,560
access and you are not in control you

306
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,880
must maintain those keys and manage them

307
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,640
on yourself

308
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,360
so why it actually matters

309
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,800
we're going to touch on and once again

310
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,399
the speakers around here today are going

311
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,519
to be talking about why devices are

312
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,760
insecure we've got a room full of people

313
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,480
who know how to hack how to break how to

314
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,000
compromise

315
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,839
we know that that's going to happen and

316
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,079
the the devices that we rely upon on a

317
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,160
day-to-day basis you know the the phones

318
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,680
the laptops all of those things in your

319
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,200
hotel room they will be broken we can't

320
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,200
rely upon those so we need to move to

321
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,760
the web 3 the secure technology and

322
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,399
ledger actually provides that device so

323
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,320
you'll be able to maintain the ultimate

324
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,440
control of your hard earned finances and

325
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,000
assets

326
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,320
alongside that ledger has uh four

327
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,839
pillars that we work on we want to look

328
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,480
at discovery connectivity safety and

329
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,279
security and that's the basis of the

330
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,600
platform that we're building for web3

331
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,480
helping

332
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,040
helping users find the right services

333
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,959
connectivity inside and out we've got

334
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,200
the companion ledger live app

335
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,240
safety

336
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,720
we've got a secure channel so that you

337
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,399
will actually see the address that

338
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,839
you're actually signing and physically

339
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,279
confirm it on a a non-connected device

340
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,399
on the nano itself or on the psd for the

341
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,720
ledger vault so you can't have that

342
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,160
address spoofed you know that when

343
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,079
you're actually signing and saying yes

344
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,600
that that is the address that it is

345
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,639
going to

346
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,480
and also that your keys are always

347
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,480
offline they are never exposed to the

348
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,000
internet they're never exposed to that

349
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,240
point of compromise so going back to

350
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,920
that then the only other way if you're

351
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,760
becoming the bank yourself it means

352
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,519
you've got to do that security piece

353
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,480
yourself

354
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,639
so my only reminder will be please never

355
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,680
ever ever expose your 24 words

356
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,000
okay

357
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,800
blockchain technology is changing the

358
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,760
world

359
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,200
so let's have a little quick little

360
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,800
history lesson as i skip down there

361
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,440
story about the internet web one open

362
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,320
protocols decentralized so

363
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,360
once again who remembers sort of myspace

364
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,639
anybody in the audience remember

365
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,320
actually my spade yeah okay so i'm

366
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,839
starting to come into the age bracket

367
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,680
now with uh with the rest of the group

368
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,720
so myspace founded back in 2003 very

369
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,760
much a a a web one service and i'll talk

370
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,200
a little bit more about that web 2

371
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,120
centralized services run by the

372
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,200
corporations if

373
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,959
when it was free you were the product so

374
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,560
what they wanted to do was to collect

375
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,800
all of the data about you and then

376
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,480
actually serve you back content that

377
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,839
meant that they could actually drive the

378
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,199
ad revenue

379
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,120
web 3 this is where we're stepping into

380
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,240
now this is our future

381
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,000
decentralized driven by the community

382
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,839
you know there's a shift in the

383
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,440
incentive model the incentive isn't

384
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,360
about how much i can reward you for

385
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,880
collecting and retaining all of this

386
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,279
information yourself it's by the work

387
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,800
that you do and what you can actually

388
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,360
push back out there so and that's all

389
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,040
enabled by blockchain technology

390
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,279
web one

391
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,279
nobody knew how big this thing the

392
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:18,000
internet was going to be yeah it was

393
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,760
you just couldn't imagine it

394
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,360
so you used to have a modem it would

395
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,199
make these weird noises i remember my

396
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:24,800
mum would pick up the phone to call her

397
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,199
friend would get the static hiss in her

398
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,760
ear i'd get screamed at i'd then get

399
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,000
upset because my download had failed you

400
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,360
know all of these challenges that were

401
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,360
going on there were very few services

402
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,079
that weren't worldwide web-based very

403
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,680
static content you had the likes of

404
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,320
napster and icq

405
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,760
in terms of adoption blockchain is at

406
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,079
1998.

407
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,680
that is where we are so if we take the

408
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,519
history of the internet and look at the

409
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,360
pace of growth that occurred from web

410
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,760
one through to where we are now our

411
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,160
adoption period we are at 1998

412
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,839
but we're actually growing even faster

413
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,480
than what we did because we're building

414
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,839
upon

415
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,600
the internet and how that worked and how

416
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,600
that grew so

417
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,720
if we hit web 2 how fast is it going to

418
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,440
be and what's it going to be

419
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,920
so that leads me into security

420
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,600
so a little bit of a history about

421
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,240
security

422
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,480
if i quite isaac newton and hopefully

423
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,079
many of you will have heard this if i've

424
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,320
seen further it is by standing on the

425
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,160
shoulders of giants

426
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,600
he said this in 1675 and it still holds

427
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,199
true today

428
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,040
our view on approach to security has

429
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,199
been built upon furthering what has come

430
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,680
before to make it more secure and

431
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,160
continue to build on those themes

432
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,839
it's also interesting to note the pace

433
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,199
of vulnerability discovery and

434
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,600
disclosure has increased

435
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,560
we have more researchers and coming into

436
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,880
the space and our technical literacy is

437
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,399
increasing

438
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,320
so this leads me to where we are with

439
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,199
blockchain today

440
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,800
blockchain

441
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,639
it shifts the security challenge onto

442
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,000
the endpoints

443
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
okay it provides us with these four

444
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,079
points decentralization it's not in one

445
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,560
location fully transparent when you push

446
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,160
it out there and it's on the chain it

447
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,680
can be seen

448
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,399
we know that it's there self-custody we

449
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,639
have to learn to trust ourselves

450
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,360
self-sovereignty we have that control

451
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,519
and the empowerment we choose how and

452
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,880
when

453
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,480
so it provides us with those four

454
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,320
pillars and we must remember that

455
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,680
so when i talk about the shift in

456
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,680
security challenge from you know let's

457
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,160
capture all of the network to let's hack

458
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,120
all of the end points um i also mean

459
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,639
we're seeing these changes the protocol

460
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,079
levels themselves already we're in the

461
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,399
1998 we've just seen a major release

462
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,320
with tap root for blockchain

463
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,199
okay

464
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,360
so we're repeating the process the cycle

465
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,079
is beginning and tap root is just start

466
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,800
there's you know bitcoin is the bitcoin

467
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,400
network is only one of many chains so

468
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,240
you're going to see this repeated smart

469
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,640
contract construction validation coin

470
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,319
integration it just continues

471
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,839
so if we're in the 1998 as we know it

472
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,919
today we're incredibly early and we're

473
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,160
already moving faster than before

474
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,480
so crypto adoption is emerging and we

475
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,439
are still very very early

476
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,559
mainstream curiosity is here

477
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,880
now i say curiosity because what we're

478
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,720
seeing across the market is a lot of

479
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,000
people are still taking bets

480
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,320
every week we're seeing a new project

481
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,000
we're seeing a new coin we're seeing a

482
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,559
new chain there are literally hundreds

483
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,039
and thousands of them out there we're

484
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,799
seeing these new projects standing up

485
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,320
and people are starting to take their

486
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,960
bets on where will this go where will it

487
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,000
do

488
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,799
so

489
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,200
we're not getting the mass adoption

490
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,760
but we are in the mass curiosity

491
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,600
and we need to continue to drive the

492
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,039
secure adoption following all of this

493
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,720
looking around the room i can see a lot

494
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,120
of people and i can safely say that by

495
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,120
being here you're part of the highly

496
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,320
educated technology literate group of

497
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,200
people are part of the early adopters

498
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,400
however we as a group still make up a

499
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,520
tiny fraction of those who have access

500
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,679
to traditional financial services let

501
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,080
alone alternative financial services and

502
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,440
we're an even smaller fraction of the

503
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,280
global population

504
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,360
so we need to move from mainstream

505
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,799
curiosity to mainstream adoption

506
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,799
so curiosity applies not only to

507
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,080
individuals but also to governments

508
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,679
we've seen

509
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:42,880
governments dipping their toe in the

510
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,559
water and

511
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:45,600
some other governments have actually

512
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,919
been wholeheartedly embracing it

513
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,559
but there are some choppy waters ahead

514
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,080
regulation

515
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,000
regulation and other barriers to entry

516
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,880
remain

517
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,200
china has banned cryptocurrency and it

518
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,120
has impacted the market

519
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,919
india is trying to ban it as a payment

520
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,160
but at the same time regulating it as an

521
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,120
asset

522
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,520
the uie is opening doors for creative

523
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,440
futures and once again we've just

524
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,840
touched on the embrace of the uae moving

525
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,720
from a uh an e-government to an m

526
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,799
government to a smart government you

527
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,559
know so we have this technology playing

528
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:19,919
it before

529
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,320
so if that's what's come before

530
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,120
what's next what else are we seeing in

531
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,678
the market

532
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,720
in the context of crypto you've got to

533
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,799
remember that it is a global

534
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,240
conversation

535
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,240
one of the top three cities for digital

536
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,240
asset adoption is actually lagos in

537
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,600
nigeria

538
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,440
the first country to become a bitcoin

539
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,840
country was el salvador

540
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,039
where there are different needs from

541
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,200
inflation more challenging access to

542
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,520
resources and challenging government and

543
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,360
setups this is where the individuals are

544
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,600
starting to take that bet

545
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,760
on trusting themselves and using crypto

546
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,520
alternative payments

547
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,360
we're having to become the bank

548
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,440
ourselves it means we need to take the

549
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,960
security view

550
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,200
for us to trust ourselves it means we

551
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,520
must secure ourselves we also must

552
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,120
accept that we're operating in a global

553
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,199
ecosystem and not a local one

554
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,039
most crypto users are in rising

555
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,960
economies at this stage

556
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,240
as i mentioned before it's not the

557
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,679
traditionally dominant countries who are

558
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,159
leading the charge china's banned the g8

559
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,159
is debating stable coins in in the

560
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,679
united states they've just signed the

561
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,640
infrastructure bill which adds taxation

562
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,720
into crypto and we're seeing further

563
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,679
looming regulation ahead

564
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:36,720
to those

565
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,039
where there is need state is allowing

566
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,480
for risk

567
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,840
think of the risk the individuals who

568
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,679
came to the united states before it was

569
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:44,880
called the u.s

570
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,039
in the uae where we are today with less

571
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,280
than 100 years old and it's already

572
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,240
becoming a global financial market and

573
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,240
hub in the region and it will only just

574
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,440
continue

575
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,159
so

576
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,120
what's happening next

577
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,520
crypto's overtaking market on a country

578
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,000
by country basis

579
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,280
in the new world order we don't just

580
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,039
think about large amounts of money we

581
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,960
think about the increased value of small

582
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,120
transactions we're at the beginning and

583
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,280
we experiment in the beginning you buy a

584
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,440
cup of coffee not a car

585
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,960
you test the boundaries and comfort

586
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,880
zones in the use cases and this is how

587
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,480
we should think about individuals using

588
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,320
crypto around the globe

589
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,760
but business institutions and

590
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,280
governments don't just buy cups of

591
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,240
coffee

592
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,919
they are already taking larger steps

593
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:30,960
because they want to remain at the

594
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,520
forefront and seize this where they can

595
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,840
but remember back to my early slide

596
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,880
people have a distrust of governments

597
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,360
and media at this moment

598
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,159
so

599
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,400
there's a dichotomy being played out

600
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,000
here between the market and the market

601
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,159
forces and the market pressures

602
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:49,840
you can now actually buy a car with

603
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,000
crypto and you can buy a house

604
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,400
but mainstream means being able to make

605
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,440
your everyday purchases every day

606
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,360
at a country level countries can do

607
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,880
whatever they please we can have a

608
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,880
country that bans crypto

609
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,039
country beside it will then open up and

610
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,360
become a safe haven for it if one locks

611
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,360
down the other opens

612
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,679
china while blocking crypto

613
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,280
is moving full speed ahead with its

614
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,080
digital yarn or its e1

615
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,200
with the backing of the chinese

616
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,720
government i'm sure it's going to be a

617
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,200
success in meeting what they set it out

618
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,200
to do

619
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,039
if we look at el salvador it's moved

620
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,080
forward with the adoption of

621
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,240
cryptocurrency but how was it actually

622
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,080
able to thrive there

623
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,720
the ground for this adoption was ripe

624
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,240
approximately 80 percent of the

625
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,480
population in el salvador did not have

626
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,600
access

627
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,720
to traditional financial services

628
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,200
but more than 80 percent had access to a

629
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,960
mobile phone

630
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,360
so if we'd seen perhaps greater market

631
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,200
penetration of the likes of paypal and

632
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,600
venmo you know would we have actually

633
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,000
seen el salvador do this adoption of of

634
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,520
bitcoin as it has

635
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,840
i believe yes but i believe that the

636
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,280
time frame may have been slightly

637
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,720
different

638
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,600
money is technology money is no longer

639
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,679
just money it's value

640
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:06,960
and the one thing that i'd really like

641
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,919
to highlight on this slide here is this

642
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,720
that here that 80 of the transactions

643
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,120
are actually being across border so what

644
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,840
we're seeing is more than 80 of people

645
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,000
who are buying it investing crypto are

646
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,159
actually having to do so across a border

647
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,000
to get onto an exchange so they may not

648
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,520
have a local exchange will be able to

649
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,440
buy it locally they are actually buying

650
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,360
it across that border cross border

651
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,760
serves

652
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,080
okay market's accelerating i've spoken

653
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,760
on number of occasions about pace of

654
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,520
change speed of pains that we're in the

655
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,240
1998 and it's just rocketing but what

656
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,240
i'd like to do is to just highlight you

657
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,880
know how much we've seen a 400 increase

658
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,159
in the crypto market cap and the

659
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:51,600
year-on-year growth

660
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,480
okay

661
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,080
um

662
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,240
i just can't state how

663
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,760
fast rapid and huge this growth has been

664
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,559
but on the flip side of that 71 of the

665
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,039
individual survey feel that cyber

666
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,240
security is the primary barrier of entry

667
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,559
into the digital markets

668
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,159
so if people don't feel safe and secure

669
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,840
why are they then going to take the step

670
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,200
forward and take that leap into web 3

671
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,159
into the crypto economy and once again

672
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,760
going back to

673
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,799
uh dr mohamed al kuwaiti's opening

674
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,360
remarks uh where he said about the need

675
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,919
for education the need for awareness in

676
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,080
each community we needs to make sure

677
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,559
that this happens so that we can reduce

678
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,919
that 71 percent of individuals who feel

679
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,919
that uh cyber security is the primary

680
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,440
barrier

681
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,520
in 2021 so far there's been more than

682
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,480
two million bitcoin transactions worth

683
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,679
over

684
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,080
worth more than one million in value

685
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,240
each so that's across the entire bitcoin

686
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,279
network

687
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,360
so that's a lot

688
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,760
for ledger enterprise the average size

689
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,679
of trend uh transaction that we're

690
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,360
seeing is ranging from between two and

691
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,600
four million that's just the average

692
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,080
the number of high value transactions on

693
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,919
the blockchain is just increasing and

694
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,159
growing rapidly and the industry needs

695
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:13,840
to keep moving and make sure that it is

696
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,760
securing those values

697
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,000
so this plays back to my previous points

698
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
so we need to make sure that it's secure

699
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,520
what you see is what you sign and you

700
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,520
retain control of your keys

701
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,760
so as i've just highlighted the security

702
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,879
risk is unprecedented

703
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,240
i'd like to do another show of hands if

704
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,520
i may

705
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,679
this website actually it's a software

706
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,679
wallet integration and it's asking you

707
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,159
to you know join if you hold multiple

708
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,000
wallets but once again this is another

709
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,200
challenge that we're seeing in the

710
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,039
industry where

711
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,640
coin support

712
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,640
is very challenged by who offers that

713
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,120
coin support and integration so you find

714
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,880
people who are taking their early bets

715
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,000
who are adopting might not hold just one

716
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,760
type of hardware wallet or indeed

717
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,520
software wallet or indeed have an

718
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,919
account on exchange they have multiple

719
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,600
in fact it is much more likely that if

720
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,360
you hold one that you will hold three or

721
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,320
more

722
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,520
okay

723
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,880
this

724
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,200
site is actually here to try and say hey

725
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,400
we can actually bring all of those

726
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,760
together so instead of you having to

727
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,840
manage three different devices four

728
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,679
different exchanges three different

729
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,919
software wallets we can combine all of

730
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:22,799
those

731
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,200
is this real or is this fake

732
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,960
so can i just ask for a show of hands

733
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,480
for people who think that this might be

734
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,720
real

735
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,400
okay so we've got a few people who

736
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,360
thinks that this is fake

737
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,840
so another show of hands okay so the

738
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,440
answer is this one is actually fake this

739
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,159
is a scam website and what it is

740
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,960
actually doing it it is playing

741
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,520
on the need for simplicity

742
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,600
okay and we're seeing an awful lot of

743
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,080
this out in the market space so with

744
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,080
those services not being universally

745
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,000
supported we're getting this sort of

746
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,480
thing all the time so once again it goes

747
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,320
to my earlier comment about developers

748
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,720
need for simplification and we need to

749
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,880
keep working to make it

750
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,799
more secure

751
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,039
security risks are only growing

752
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,640
this year will be the worst year for

753
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,320
cybercrime

754
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,240
i actually said that last year and i was

755
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,520
right last year when i said that that

756
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,279
last year would be the worst year and it

757
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,679
was and i can use exactly the same

758
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,840
comment and say that next year and i

759
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,559
will still be correct too

760
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:27,919
i look forward to the day when this

761
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,520
trend stops but the more people who

762
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,200
adopt it means the more targets that are

763
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,039
out there for the scammers

764
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,480
later today um caesar the cto from i o

765
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,159
active labs will be doing a presentation

766
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,520
specifically on d5 cyber challenges with

767
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,039
the opportunity to go into a lot more

768
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,279
detail in this space we've got a number

769
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:46,880
of other presentations who touch on

770
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,679
these

771
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,440
and address it as well as the technical

772
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,279
uh tracks

773
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,159
ledger has invested thousands of person

774
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:55,679
days efforts

775
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,080
over the last year targeting cyber

776
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,279
criminals

777
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,399
working to close down scamming websites

778
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,320
and working to remove some of these

779
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,880
threats now we're tackling this across

780
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,960
not just websites such as i showed you

781
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,640
earlier

782
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,720
not just websites like this but where

783
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,679
we're seeing it on telegram twitter

784
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,720
reddit facebook social media we're not

785
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,000
just targeting the scammers that are

786
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,919
doing this we're actually targeting

787
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:23,840
individuals that are selling counterfeit

788
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,799
goods

789
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,480
pre-seeded devices that are going out

790
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,039
into the market now i'm hoping that i'll

791
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,559
have another opportunity to be able to

792
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,559
come back and actually deep dive into

793
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,559
detail on just what we've been doing

794
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:37,600
around protecting the ecosystem but what

795
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,159
i would do is i would put a call to a

796
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,559
rallying call to everyone in this room

797
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,279
every organization in every country we

798
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,840
need to work together to help target and

799
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,480
make the ecosystem safer for one and for

800
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,200
all

801
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,120
only until we do that will we see the

802
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,520
drop in that 71 of people who see crypto

803
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,080
current cyber security as a barrier of

804
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,600
entry into the crypto ecosystem

805
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,120
the majority of these attacks are

806
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,799
launched from a very small number of

807
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,039
providers more than half of the sites

808
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,240
have been uh registered via namecheap

809
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,919
and i'll actually call out namecheap

810
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:14,080
here i know many people in the cyber

811
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,720
industry using them uh may have had

812
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,240
similar challenges when dealing with

813
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,399
them and i would call on namecheap to

814
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,720
actually try and improve their way of

815
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,320
working what it is they do their

816
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,799
verification and to help stop some of

817
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,159
the things that are actually being run

818
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:29,600
through their platforms and being shut

819
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,120
down

820
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,720
so we've closed down more than 500

821
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,520
websites um we've got major initiatives

822
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,919
underway with etherscan.io and bitcoin

823
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,159
abuse so we're actually flagging scam

824
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:41,520
wallets and making sure that they're

825
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,559
aware

826
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,799
on average it takes us four days from

827
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,720
reports to shut down a website i'm

828
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,480
wanting to get that down to about four

829
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,080
hours but obviously there are a lot of

830
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,399
challenges with that i'm asking for the

831
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,799
community's help in reporting this and

832
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,200
obviously working with the the partners

833
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,159
to secure the ecosystem

834
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,440
so how do we protect ourselves

835
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,240
and we protect ourselves with education

836
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,480
coming back to financial literacy

837
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,480
security awareness

838
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,279
education is essential for the future of

839
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,320
secure alternative payment systems

840
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,760
otherwise we're going to continue to be

841
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,000
looked at as the wild west we're going

842
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,520
to have people who are coming in

843
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,240
receiving advice bad advice being

844
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,520
scammed losing money losing out

845
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,200
and therefore they'll be forever burnt

846
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,480
and then they will walk away and they

847
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,399
will tell all of their friends don't go

848
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:35,440
and do that thing it's bad so the only

849
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,520
way that we can secure around this is

850
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,080
through education we've got a target

851
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,279
literacy

852
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:44,000
ledger is part with finance in this case

853
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,840
and we're actually doing a number of

854
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,520
things going out to market to increase

855
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,080
education but i'd actually ask everybody

856
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,360
you know to make sure that you're

857
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,600
getting your information from reliable

858
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,320
sources so ledger.com we've got ledger

859
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,880
academy we've got the school of block

860
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,640
great resources there if you want to go

861
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,080
and actually educate yourself and your

862
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,000
family about crypto and alternative

863
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,360
payments there are some other really

864
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,760
good resources out there crypto casey is

865
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,919
another one of my favorites you know so

866
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,240
please make sure that you get that

867
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,640
because what we're also seeing is a rise

868
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,960
in fake education

869
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,679
we're seeing a rise in scam education

870
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,840
sites that once again are playing to the

871
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,679
scammers so make sure that you do the

872
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,600
right research and you get it from the

873
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,760
reputable resource

874
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,519
i remember in the old days when atms

875
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,840
first came about before atms i couldn't

876
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,399
withdraw cash unless i went to a brick

877
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,559
and mortar bank when it was open they

878
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,559
weren't open on weekends they shut for

879
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,200
an hour over lunch and i i could not get

880
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,279
access to my cash

881
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,519
atms with this revolution allowing me

882
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,760
financial freedom to access this thing

883
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,000
that i needed this cash

884
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,840
but with that we had a pin and there was

885
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,440
a large educational piece that went

886
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,840
around about never reveal your pin don't

887
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,360
give it out to anywhere don't write it

888
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,880
on your card don't keep it in your

889
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,200
wallet and we're in that same stage now

890
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,360
with cryptocurrency we're having to do

891
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,960
that education piece to make sure

892
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,440
everybody doesn't

893
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,240
so curiosity is okay if you're educated

894
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,799
but education must be spread

895
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:15,120
well highly tech educated technical

896
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,200
individuals here but that's not enough

897
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,480
for us to address for the regular

898
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,519
adopters

899
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,480
curiosity isn't enough to move from this

900
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,360
we need to ensure ongoing education and

901
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,799
that's something that's been spoken

902
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,519
about here for mass adoption we need

903
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,640
mass education

904
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,960
so back to ledger and a little bit more

905
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,320
about that

906
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,480
we're an industry and security first

907
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,279
organization we believe in open source

908
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,519
and we believe in events such as hack in

909
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,840
the box where we are today and we sure

910
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,440
we share all of our

911
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,840
information and our findings uh on our

912
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,840
website so anything that's security

913
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,320
relevant security finding uh if you go

914
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,640
to thedonjon.ledger.com you will find

915
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,960
the reports published there we regularly

916
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,600
present at black hats with new

917
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,159
vulnerabilities we share our open source

918
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:06,559
tools and you know we also do our own

919
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,840
capture the flag

920
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,440
component we also have a principle of

921
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,240
don't trust verify we verify our own

922
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,480
products we put them through independent

923
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,679
assessment

924
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,279
and certification

925
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,519
and we also don't trust

926
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,240
our competitors products you know so

927
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,679
legend was the first company that was

928
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:28,000
able to actually break hardware wallets

929
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,519
it was the first company that was able

930
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,559
to actually break blockchain phones

931
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,240
we also don't trust our suppliers so

932
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,480
where we rely upon hsms we're actually

933
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,960
the organization that did the first full

934
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,320
ownage of a hsm and once again these are

935
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,840
all individual you know i could come

936
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,320
back and do an entire presentation just

937
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,799
around that component once again great

938
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,559
publications pieces being put there on

939
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,399
our website if you'd like that

940
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,080
so the next challenge is the security

941
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,919
model of the exchanges how they actually

942
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,919
work and i've touched on that briefly as

943
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,519
well about if you're using an exchange

944
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,120
that they still actually hold the keys

945
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,279
not yourself you hold an account and

946
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:07,000
smart contract security

947
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,440
so here's another example about how

948
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,480
ledger is trying to help um nfts i

949
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,199
haven't spoken a great deal about nfts

950
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,520
but it's a a billion-dollar business at

951
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,760
this time we're seeing through it um

952
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,599
open c there are billions of dollars

953
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,040
worth of transactions that are going

954
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,079
through them

955
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,760
they're still using a model where it's

956
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,079
being blind signed so you're not

957
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,760
actually doing the verification of it

958
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,839
and we're working with a plug-in so that

959
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,440
we're able to actually secure that and

960
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,359
you'll be able to use the ledger device

961
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,520
for that so we're trying to survive

962
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,839
solve the challenges of today

963
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:45,599
this is also something that gets touched

964
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,520
on quite regularly here at hack in the

965
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,239
box improving our product security you

966
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,719
know offensive approach vulnerabilities

967
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,480
should be researched

968
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,000
um disclosed responsibly follow the

969
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,079
follow the right way to announce those

970
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:01,920
defense in depth you know once again we

971
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,520
spoke about earlier and we heard about

972
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,359
the example of well do you do your

973
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,440
backups well no i didn't do the backups

974
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,800
therefore when you had the ransomware

975
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,640
event you were left with fewer

976
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,720
opportunities on what you could actually

977
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,680
do to respond so manage defense in code

978
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,480
reviews and new security layers to make

979
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,480
the hackers lives harder

980
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,040
the bug bounty program ledger runs and a

981
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,280
bug bounty program so we actually do bug

982
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,359
bounty not only for our products but

983
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,160
actually i run a scheme on phishing

984
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,480
bounties where i'm asking for people to

985
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,240
provide information around scammers

986
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,760
scamming sites

987
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,760
and if that actually comes through to us

988
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,920
being able to do material impacts

989
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,920
against the scammers themselves there is

990
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,839
actually a bounty available for that

991
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,720
don't forget

992
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,399
developers are key

993
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,119
excuse me

994
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,960
a secure experience begins with the

995
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,520
developer developers are the customer

996
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,000
and the entry point for almost all new

997
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,839
customers over time

998
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:07,040
we've got to leverage the growing

999
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,320
ecosystem

1000
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,960
and make the stacks more friendly

1001
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,720
developers want more freedom and open

1002
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,400
source sharing with web 3 and that's

1003
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,320
exactly what we're doing and now is the

1004
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,480
time to build tools that show security

1005
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,079
is an essential part of that process

1006
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,160
complexity now i've touched on this

1007
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,920
three or four times through the uh

1008
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,160
through the presentation and complexity

1009
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,079
is the enemy of security

1010
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:31,599
we've got to build tools that shorten

1011
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:32,880
the distance between the web 3

1012
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,040
application and security we've got

1013
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,680
thousands of tokens and 140 apps created

1014
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,640
by developers but the the key essentials

1015
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,320
are the same things you know and yet

1016
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,599
i've spoken about this you've got to

1017
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,680
protect the private keys and what you

1018
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,480
see is what you sign

1019
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,320
we also believe in making the developers

1020
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,599
live easier and don't over complicate it

1021
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,520
so we keep on hearing security is

1022
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,359
getting in the way slowing us down and

1023
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:59,040
we need to push this featured production

1024
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,560
you know their biggest fears we don't

1025
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,000
want to keep hearing those things we've

1026
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,240
got to make life easier so bring the

1027
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,560
security tools to the developers so we

1028
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,040
do automated code evaluation during

1029
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,160
development

1030
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,760
training make sure the developers know

1031
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,480
how to write good and secure code

1032
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,480
integrate the standard tools and embed

1033
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,720
the world and we've got to get rid of

1034
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,720
hardware during development so a lot

1035
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,560
more time building emulators it makes it

1036
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,400
a lot easier and a lot faster

1037
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,040
so whether you like it or not the world

1038
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,880
is changing

1039
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,640
you cannot pretend that this trend is

1040
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,880
going away but you do have the power to

1041
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,800
make it more secure

1042
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,240
we have more opportunities on the

1043
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,160
horizon things like identity

1044
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,200
verification services securing trust and

1045
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,560
title deeds the future of banking itself

1046
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,040
is one of these opportunities we need to

1047
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,560
bank the unbanked

1048
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,359
so i'm going to leave you with a couple

1049
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:56,960
of thoughts and these are a couple of

1050
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,640
the questions that i'm starting to ask

1051
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,000
myself

1052
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
now and if we can all just have a

1053
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,839
thought and take away as we go here

1054
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,480
we can't pretend that it's going away

1055
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,400
but i'd like to ask you know what

1056
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,520
relevance

1057
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,839
do banks have in our future if we're

1058
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:16,079
becoming the bank ourselves how are the

1059
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,079
banks going to transform to provide

1060
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:21,520
those additional services or value to us

1061
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,800
if we have a shift of value itself

1062
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,119
what's the impact of a digital or public

1063
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,040
deed have on security

1064
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,760
so if we're looking to secure things

1065
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,680
that we see as holding real world value

1066
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,440
things like title deeds at the moment

1067
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,400
how is that going to change

1068
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,640
with a device like ledger and the

1069
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,400
potential of identity verification

1070
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,200
services will borders exist in the

1071
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,440
future themselves

1072
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,200
and how do we stay on the precipice of

1073
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,320
innovation without removing security at

1074
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,599
its core

1075
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,280
so i'll just leave you with those couple

1076
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,160
of thoughts to take away and ponder on

1077
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,280
and before i go i just like to

1078
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,560
open up the floor and see if there are

1079
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,640
any questions that anybody has for me or

1080
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,560
if not i will be around for the next two

1081
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,119
days and feel free to come and tap me on

1082
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,440
the shoulder and have a conversation but

1083
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,040
i very much hope to have the opportunity

1084
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,560
to come back again and then do a deep

1085
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,280
dive into some of the technical areas

1086
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,119
around the actual products themselves

1087
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:20,800
what we're doing around the education

1088
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,320
awareness and also what we're seeing

1089
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,960
about the scams and the uh the cyber

1090
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,280
crime effect so i'd like to do that so

1091
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,040
i'll pause there any questions

1092
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,440
you're very generous in the gentle

1093
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,880
crowds to me if you're going to let me

1094
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,520
off without any questions

1095
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:45,920
in which case i would just say thank you

1096
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,680
and once again i very much appreciate

1097
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,520
the opportunity to be here and present

1098
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,520
to you all and i have a great day and i

1099
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,200
hope to see you and speak with you also

1100
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,670
thank you

1101
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:57,280
[Applause]

1102
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,359
you
