1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,480
hi this class is non-standard like me

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,840
let me tell you the seven reasons why

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,600
you should take this osd2 all you can

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,279
learn buffet class instead of a normal

5
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,519
one one in this class the instructor's

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,679
whole job is to answer your questions in

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,200
a normal class the instructor spends a

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,360
lot of their time just talking

9
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,199
in this class you watch the talking in

10
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,080
cyberspace not meat space this leaves

11
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,160
the instructor with way way more time in

12
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,840
order to answer your questions work with

13
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,240
you on labs and just talk with you just

14
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,519
like with red hat linux you're not

15
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,279
paying for the content you're paying for

16
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,720
the support and if you're the kind of

17
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,640
student who in a normal meat space class

18
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,800
isn't exactly inclined to ask a question

19
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,120
for whatever reason well there's no fear

20
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,360
here two everyone learns at their own

21
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,200
pace everyone's coming into this class

22
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,360
with a different background one size

23
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,440
does not fit all why should everyone go

24
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,120
through the class in lockstep in this

25
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,600
class you can speed up or slow

26
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,840
down the lectures as much as you want

27
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,800
three

28
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,480
three three

29
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,800
this class isn't just one class it's all

30
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,719
the classes from this particular

31
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,559
instructor if you finish the class early

32
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,159
you can move on to the next class in the

33
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,680
learning tree if you don't finish the

34
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,600
class in a given time you can still move

35
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,680
on to the next class after class because

36
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,000
we want you to take all the classes from

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
ost2 remember you're still going to have

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,600
support from the instructor after the

39
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,360
in-person class you'll get an instructor

40
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,840
who will answer up to 20 more questions

41
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,280
after the class because that's what

42
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,439
you're paying for support

43
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,119
it's literally like a cheat code for

44
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,759
getting unstuck in the game of life four

45
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,439
unlike a live lecture here you get

46
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,520
captions so if english isn't your first

47
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,280
language it makes it that much easier to

48
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,040
understand what the instructor just said

49
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,880
five unlike a live lecture where the

50
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,640
instructor might make a mistake and take

51
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,320
a while wasting your time as they try to

52
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,399
figure it out here through the magic of

53
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,880
video editing the mistakes are beaten

54
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,680
out of it quickly six

55
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,520
in a normal class you gotta wait for the

56
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,280
instructor's permission to get up and

57
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,439
take a break in this class it's after

58
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,119
lunch if you're feeling sleepy just get

59
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,880
up stretch your legs have some coffee

60
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,280
walk around give yourself the old

61
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,920
and no one's gonna bat an eye

62
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,840
seven as someone who's taught a lot of

63
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,600
live lecture classes i really do think

64
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,360
this hybrid format is going to lead to

65
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,959
the best student outcomes but if you

66
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,639
need one more reason to take a class

67
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,200
like this it's this by taking this class

68
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,959
you're directly supporting ost2

69
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,120
instructors who can then go off and make

70
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,360
more classes on more material so you can

71
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,879
just keep skilling up it's win win win

72
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,840
where the other winner is everyone

73
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,480
so don't delay sign up today and gorge

74
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,560
yourself at the ost2 all you can learn

75
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,560
buffet

76
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,480
you
