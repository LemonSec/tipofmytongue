1
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,359
a very good afternoon good morning or

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,600
evening wherever you are fellow cyber

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,160
security enthusiasts my name is lois i'm

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,759
here to talk about harmony

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,680
emotion so

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,160
harmony motion is actually talking about

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,720
the harmony mobile systems that huawei

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,119
has developed as an ecosystem and one of

9
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,840
the things that uh you know why prove us

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,720
towards developing this entire ecosystem

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,159
is because of

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,280
the explosion of

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,000
adoption of iot devices

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,760
as a result of

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,840
the digital transformation

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,239
we are seeing that it has become an

17
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,640
engine of growth for the mobile internet

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,600
status

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,000
and the forecast of global iot devices

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,160
and smart smartphone

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,800
shipments is expected to skyrocket in

22
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,079
the next three to five years

23
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,440
so by 2025 they're going to be more than

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,358
9 smart devices per person

25
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,720
so there is a need to build a mobile

26
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,200
device ecosystems from smartphones to

27
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,040
multi-devices because it's not just

28
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,280
about the the mobile phone that you have

29
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,159
in your pocket but the smart watches and

30
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,600
many other

31
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,520
mirrors of devices that you can put on

32
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,840
your own body right so today you're

33
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,240
talking about biohacking but before

34
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,840
biohacking you're talking about things

35
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,280
like you know simple things like hard

36
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,280
paces and these are considered iot

37
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,040
devices and this will be part of the

38
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,840
nine devices that will be on the body

39
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,119
so it is a complex

40
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:40,560
multi-device collaboration that we're

41
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,320
dealing with which is a constant

42
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,040
challenge for consumers and development

43
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,520
worldwide

44
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,479
the complex connection

45
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,360
the isolated ecosystems

46
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,360
the difficulty in managing data sharing

47
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,719
as well as

48
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,159
the difficulty in collaborations is all

49
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,560
causing us a lot of headaches as we

50
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,280
tackle this problem when we talk about

51
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,598
digital transformation and adopting the

52
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,319
digital lifestyle in the new digital era

53
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,959
right so there's a whole charm full of

54
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,200
digital down here and that's one maybe

55
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,560
one of the reason

56
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,520
why mark zuckerberg is renaming facebook

57
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,599
into meta right to represent the

58
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,000
metaphors that we are all moving towards

59
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,680
so this fragmented operating system is

60
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,560
making device collaboration extremely

61
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,599
difficult it is difficult because of

62
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,760
repeated development for different

63
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,560
devices types which you have to make the

64
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,760
effort to develop for the various os's

65
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,840
and sometimes it means developing the

66
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,560
app all over again and it's also

67
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,000
difficult to adapt for different screens

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,480
and interaction i mean you look at the

69
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,080
different screen type they have for your

70
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,239
phone the small one the big one to the

71
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,080
tablets they are holding your hand to

72
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,640
even that you know uh

73
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,640
devices that you have in your car

74
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,200
whether is it a tesla or any vehicles

75
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,640
they outcome with different shape and

76
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,000
sizes

77
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,680
and not to mention that there is also

78
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,200
the lack of efficient development

79
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,080
environment and tools that is available

80
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,560
at your disposal to address all these

81
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,080
requirements

82
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,480
so in short there is a lack of a

83
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,239
harmonized app ecosystem that is easy to

84
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,519
use that doesn't have any entry or

85
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:32,959
barrier entries

86
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,879
that you don't have to reinstall the app

87
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,440
or over get extremely when you need it

88
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,920
the most

89
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,400
so the connected were

90
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,720
calls out and back for the need of a

91
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,040
universal language that can be

92
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,760
understood by different kinds of devices

93
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,480
or endpoints so as to harness the

94
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,720
potential of iot

95
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,519
enabled by 5g cloud and ai

96
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,000
and that is where we try to tackle the

97
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,360
problem by looking at a huawei seamless

98
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,720
ai life strategy that can be addressed

99
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,319
by the far away

100
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,799
harmony os ecosystem

101
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,640
right so down here when we talk about

102
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,079
the ecosystem we're talking about the

103
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,959
ecosystem from the apps perspective the

104
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,040
various applications that you can find

105
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,440
to be installed in your phones and in

106
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,040
whatever applications they're writing

107
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,880
even your mobile uh

108
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,440
your mobile devices like your laptop to

109
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,560
the hardware itself right from the the

110
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,479
printers to the phones

111
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,520
uh to even the smart car says you know

112
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,280
that you you are dreaming to own one of

113
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,479
these days

114
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,320
right that will drive you from point a

115
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,080
to point b without you even lifting a

116
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,400
single finger so this is

117
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,320
where we see the opportunity uh you know

118
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,880
in in developing this harmony

119
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,080
mobile system ecosystem as well as you

120
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,600
know where we need to address the

121
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,960
problem from a problem statement

122
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,320
perspective if we really want to

123
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,560
transit to the digital era and fully

124
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,199
maximize you know the potentials that it

125
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,280
can bring us you know and help our life

126
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,759
so in harmony os we are looking at one

127
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,639
os the mean ordinance okay to me or the

128
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,199
need of the future one plus a plus n

129
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,560
ecosystem

130
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,759
which

131
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,600
we are talking about all scenarios smart

132
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,560
line so earlier we talked about by 2025

133
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,479
every person should have very nice

134
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,600
devices on their body so you know

135
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,240
this is the next generation smart device

136
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,080
operating systems that you need to

137
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,720
provide a uniform language

138
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,880
for different devices to

139
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,880
intelligence right they should be able

140
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,120
to intelligence and interconnect and

141
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,600
talk to each other collaborate to share

142
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,680
the information and bring simple

143
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,840
smooth and continuous and secure all

144
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,440
scenario experience right moving from

145
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,160
your phone if you are editing your your

146
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,280
your messages your your sms or your

147
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,600
whatsapp to you know typing it on your

148
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,960
laptop to even continue the message on

149
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,840
on the card itself or you know as you go

150
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,120
to the fridge you open the fridge you

151
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,039
can continue to edit that message or

152
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,800
write that report you know this is a

153
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,880
kind of seamless experience that we are

154
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,360
now envisioning and saw in all the anime

155
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,520
series you know all the tv series all

156
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,520
the futuristic star trek this is

157
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,039
something that is happening right now

158
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,960
and we need to

159
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,919
enable all this transition

160
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:30,720
but

161
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,880
you know at the end of day now every

162
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,560
good thing always comes at the cost and

163
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,160
one of the cost is

164
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,639
data privacy how do we ensure data

165
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,160
security protection throughout the

166
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,080
entire data lifecycle

167
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,479
by looking at whether are you the right

168
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,600
person

169
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,919
you know that owns the data that uses

170
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:48,960
the data

171
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,280
and use it in the right way and on the

172
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,520
right devices right it doesn't make

173
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,599
sense if these devices that this this

174
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,280
data that you are using

175
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,520
for example is specific to one

176
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,960
application scenario it shouldn't be

177
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,440
made available to another you know type

178
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,599
of applications you know online devices

179
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:06,960
because it means it will means that

180
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,280
there's a significant data leakage on

181
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,599
that right take for example right your

182
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:12,880
when you're moving

183
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,639
and transiting from point point b in a

184
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,520
smart vehicle will you probably need

185
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,759
that you know in other smart devices

186
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,160
like a smart toilet probably no right

187
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,199
but that that also means vice versa

188
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,599
right the kind of sensitive data that's

189
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,000
related to your personal health that is

190
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,160
from the smart toilet the smart washroom

191
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,319
it shouldn't be also available out

192
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,759
outside of the toilet it should stay

193
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,599
whatever happened in the toilet

194
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,720
just stay in the toilet

195
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,319
so when we talk about the right person

196
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,879
we're looking at user and identity

197
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,400
authentication

198
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,000
where you know you can provide greater

199
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,160
security and convenience by

200
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,840
harnessing the power of facial

201
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,280
recognition

202
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,440
by using facial recognition as a way to

203
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,680
authenticate yourself or the fingerprint

204
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,440
or the password right so there must be

205
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,759
multiple ways that you could do

206
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,120
identity

207
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,080
uh identification and authentication so

208
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,160
that means that you know your voice your

209
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,199
voice your your facial and your trusted

210
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,319
devices you know and fingerprint it all

211
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,000
come together in the collaborative

212
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,639
authentication you know that is secure

213
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,080
but yet convenient

214
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,919
so the right person okay stop i mean

215
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,919
addressing the the issue of whether you

216
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,000
know each device have a unique identity

217
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,840
with a trusted connection between user

218
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,839
device and services

219
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,640
so each device have a unique id and the

220
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,640
device user service there must be a

221
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,240
trusted connection that allows you okay

222
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,440
to be able to you know stretch uh

223
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,360
contacts from device to device but at

224
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,040
the same time you are the right person

225
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,120
to access all this data right for

226
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,640
example you know your doctor or or even

227
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,480
your closest you know relatives your

228
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,360
friends or your your parents your wife

229
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,800
you know you do not want them to access

230
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,399
certain data that could be sensitive to

231
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,640
you but especially it's a private data

232
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,720
so you probably would not you know want

233
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,680
this to be shared and and and the

234
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,959
or or

235
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,040
or the other case if you drop your phone

236
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,720
in the park right while you're jogging

237
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,480
or you drop your watch you know in the

238
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,399
past and when somebody pick up they will

239
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,760
not be able to access your sensitive

240
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,680
data

241
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,760
anyway so to make sure that you are not

242
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,760
only the right person but you also have

243
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,440
the right devices because when we talk

244
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,880
about hardware you have to talk about

245
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,800
the hardware route of trust ensuring

246
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,399
comprehensive device security from

247
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,560
bottom up so that means you know talking

248
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,720
about having a rich executive

249
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,959
execution environment

250
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,519
that you can build based on the trusted

251
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,399
exec

252
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,120
execution environment where the formal

253
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,399
verification

254
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,600
and a micro kernel in harmony will be

255
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,720
able to

256
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,680
allow you to have this level of

257
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,040
assurance

258
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,800
and mind you right now that this

259
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,959
microkernel that we have built is the

260
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,160
only

261
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,800
only micro kernel that is available in

262
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,040
mobile phones that have achieved the

263
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,000
common criteria eal5 plus

264
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,800
security certification and making it the

265
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,920
most secure micro kernel

266
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,720
os micro kernel for for phones device

267
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,760
today

268
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,519
right so there are

269
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,640
several

270
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,880
security capabilities that can be

271
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,720
enabled by this

272
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,519
micro kernel and you know

273
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,279
uh the important thing is that you are

274
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,279
able to build trust bottoms up

275
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,279
so that comes to you know once you build

276
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,959
the trust you use the data in the right

277
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,959
way hierarchical and greater data

278
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,360
protection is the way to go right

279
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,440
depending on what is data classification

280
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,279
and what kind of usage it is you can

281
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,480
build multi-layer protection for more

282
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,839
important data

283
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,680
and i would not say that this is

284
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,200
something that you know

285
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,040
we what huawei could provide but this is

286
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,959
something that is also on the wish list

287
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,040
of everybody you know

288
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,440
that's sitting in this room because at

289
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,839
the end of the day you will be concerned

290
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,640
about your own personal data especially

291
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,200
you know things that you know uh

292
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,680
surrounds uh surrounding

293
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,079
applications that may have some

294
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,160
sensitive outcomes like you know your

295
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,640
banking information your

296
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,920
mobile wallet to some of the

297
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,000
personal information like healthcare

298
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,680
information that you know you will

299
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,399
probably want to have a multi-level

300
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,240
protection because depending on who you

301
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,079
want to share this data with and who

302
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,480
probably would see what kind of data

303
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,920
so you need to have this multi-level

304
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,680
protection you need to ensure that the

305
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,920
phones got locked and and

306
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,079
opened by the right people not

307
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,839
especially not by anybody that you can

308
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,079
see in the lock picking vanish here at

309
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,640
the you know here in the box

310
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,839
and

311
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,440
you need to ensure that even if these

312
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,320
things are

313
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,560
i mean lost or stolen

314
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,959
the data remains protected through

315
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,519
encryption

316
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,279
so three layers of encryption for

317
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,440
trusted interconnection achieving full

318
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,600
senior security and trustworthiness are

319
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
something that we have built in

320
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,920
that is different from the conventional

321
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,639
solution where smart devices start

322
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,440
directly connected to internet exposing

323
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,160
the ip addresses of these devices

324
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,920
what we did down here is to add an

325
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,120
additional layer that create a new field

326
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,000
trust trusted connection that is not on

327
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,240
the cloud that allows smart devices to

328
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,920
connect to the internet through a

329
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,600
central hub

330
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,320
that doesn't expose your ip addresses

331
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,760
therefore reducing the attack surface

332
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,279
so just a summary of some of the

333
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,600
professional private uh privacy and

334
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,120
security certification that we have

335
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,600
obtained from privacy perspective from

336
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,279
iso 27

337
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,040
701 to e privacy seo of gdpr

338
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,000
and the european privacy sale to 27018

339
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,920
from iso

340
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,600
these are some of the

341
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,120
professional certification that we

342
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,320
obtained for example the harmony mobile

343
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,480
systems that we have done is among one

344
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,000
of the world's best first special

345
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,160
products that have ever been certified

346
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,880
by

347
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,320
27 701

348
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,639
and these are the certifications and

349
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,480
looking from the security perspective i

350
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,360
mentioned earlier eal5 plus for the

351
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,639
microkernel and we also have

352
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:29,760
eal4 plus

353
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,120
that is

354
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,000
uh

355
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,720
addressing the security of our tee os

356
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,360
and there's also at the end of the css

357
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,600
star that we have obtained for the

358
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,839
hallway mobile services that is built on

359
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,160
the cloud so this is just a summary of

360
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,680
some of the security certification

361
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,519
that's obtained

362
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,560
right

363
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,079
so

364
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,440
pci

365
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,279
okay for payment fido for authentication

366
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,160
so

367
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,720
this is a nutshell okay of some of the

368
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,399
things that you know will further

369
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,639
reassure you that

370
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,800
what we have built

371
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,680
uh

372
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,079
attached to the highest stringent and

373
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,320
most stringent cyber security and

374
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,760
privacy requirement globally

375
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,040
so at the end only we can build a secure

376
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,040
and resilient intelligent connected

377
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,560
world with harmony

378
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,920
in motion using our harmony awares and

379
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,560
our harmony mobile services to connect

380
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,839
all the different devices together and

381
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,959
that also means that it will break the

382
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,040
barrier where

383
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,720
you will not

384
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,120
no longer be restricted just to install

385
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,440
one os for one particular

386
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,760
devices but you can use harmony os that

387
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,320
will be able to allow you to use an app

388
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,320
theoretically from any other kind of

389
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,199
operating systems so

390
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,199
we breaking we are breaking the barrier

391
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,800
that you know that you are not

392
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,760
restricted you know to install just one

393
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,920
particular operating system for your

394
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,160
phone or for your applications um you

395
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,399
know your iot application but you can

396
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,199
use harmony right they'll be able to

397
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,440
provide the bridging that's required to

398
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,079
use the app from an operating system so

399
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,199
this is what we call by building an open

400
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,680
and collaborative

401
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,560
ecosystem with harmony as the baseline

402
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,160
that will be able to

403
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,839
provide the

404
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,800
the the

405
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,040
baseline virtual machine interpretation

406
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,880
that you can actually you know use

407
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,639
another application

408
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,320
that's developed for an os with no

409
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,079
problem so at the end of the day as a

410
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,000
user i'm not limited by my choice

411
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,839
whether you know if i buy a certain

412
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,880
brand or phone you know i'm limited by

413
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,120
the capability of a phone by because i

414
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,360
have to install that os but right now

415
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,600
i'm we have this choice and this choice

416
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,480
is a secure and reasoned choice that you

417
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,160
know at the end of the day we'll see the

418
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,800
transition of far away you know putting

419
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,519
that os not only in our phone but also

420
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,480
in the future smartpass that is built on

421
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,399
our mobile

422
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,720
our trusted mobile platform powered by

423
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,000
harmony

424
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,360
thank you very much that's what i got to

425
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,519
share today
