1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,440
good afternoon once again folks uh

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,879
welcome to

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,960
hack outside the box

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,400
studio on the go

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,759
we are live

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,759
remotely on site

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:14,799
with

8
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,480
a very dear friend of mine very very

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,039
captain perry welcome to hack in the box

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,880
studio on the wall unplugged it's really

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,279
good to be here it's great to be here

12
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,320
i have uh at first

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,080
first got to know you playing around

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,840
with our doing a

15
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,479
you are the person who inspired me

16
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,640
on the maker track honestly we made the

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,239
knight rider

18
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,760
led life

19
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,040
i learned what it was to

20
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,960
work with microcontrollers

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,039
and before then my background was all

22
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,120
about like microcontrollers are a thing

23
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,039
that circuit designers do and we just

24
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,399
programmed them

25
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,480
and after that after that i walked out i

26
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,800
discussed with my father and we came to

27
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,960
a realization that the microprocessor is

28
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,640
the new transistor that opened up a

29
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,520
whole

30
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,600
world of make for me

31
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,600
and then i've heard this across many

32
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,119
times with different ideas with hector

33
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,520
class with your thoughts on

34
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,520
brilliant children

35
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,000
and now you're you're doing something

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,240
completely different in the same space

37
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,080
so what's uh

38
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,640
what have you uh what's your throat

39
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,640
it's nice for mentioning that my first

40
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,200
arduino classes i gave

41
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,439
were a start of something new

42
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,520
and i see it as a journey actually so

43
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,079
what i do now is also still part of that

44
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,040
journey

45
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,079
when

46
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,320
i first found my arduino my

47
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,960
microcontroller program i came up with

48
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,280
the idea hey listen this is a technical

49
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,320
thing we can use in a broader way so we

50
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,320
can also use this virgo example two

51
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,720
classes and teach kids right how to use

52
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,040
this arduino because it's it's really

53
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,119
simple and easy to start with

54
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,520
um where shouldering was still a bridge

55
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,600
too far sometimes actually yes you know

56
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,719
what uh soldering was oh we can't do

57
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,560
this with the kids because they'll burn

58
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,920
and it's burnt my finger it's

59
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,840
permanently burnt over here

60
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,560
remember it smells like chicken you're

61
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,280
holding it wrong

62
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,959
but in this journey um and especially

63
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,800
with hacking the box

64
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,599
we we made some steps over there and and

65
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,200
the steps over there

66
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,840
in my opinion were always to educate

67
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,400
people and now young people

68
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,599
to to

69
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,640
to have knowledge about techniques about

70
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,440
about i.t skills and about security

71
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,560
and

72
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,879
i always started finding a way to to

73
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,800
have this discussion and this is this

74
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,959
thought how can we take this to the next

75
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:41,840
level

76
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,879
and uh so hacking a class was there uh

77
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,680
where we were uh not only using the

78
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,680
arduinos but also using a capture the

79
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,680
flag competition in a way yes or they

80
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,879
were able to hack and uh later on we uh

81
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,360
this was growing growing and growing

82
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,920
but i came up with with some ideas

83
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,080
during this journey this is not scalable

84
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,680
in a way for example

85
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,959
and

86
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,000
we i think also we as as professionals

87
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,680
we are responsible

88
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,480
for

89
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,760
keeping our next generation safe

90
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,519
and give them the luggage to

91
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,360
to be sure that they have a future which

92
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,680
is cyber safe

93
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,400
and so um about two years ago

94
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,360
one of actually my hacker friends

95
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,959
she was working at the dutch national

96
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,760
police she came to me and said hey barry

97
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,680
listen

98
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,640
i want to set up a prevent team

99
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,760
offender preventing to be exec to be

100
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,720
sure that we are able to um

101
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,120
to gain that are coming less great goals

102
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,640
instead of we are going to catch more

103
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,920
criminals

104
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,159
yeah exactly why why don't we reduce the

105
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,159
supply yeah

106
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,480
and in that way the cyber offender

107
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,640
prevention squad in the dutch

108
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,360
police system was being born

109
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,120
it's all together cops which is the kind

110
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,280
of funny

111
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,480
shortness of

112
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,400
the whole thing

113
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,519
and

114
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,280
within these cops

115
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,760
i'm one of the digital specialists and

116
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,478
you create the bridge between

117
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:19,759
the technique

118
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,358
and the criminals in

119
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,880
in a way and these criminals can be

120
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,440
young they can be old in a way

121
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,759
but especially because we were doing

122
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,759
this hacking the class lessons etc i am

123
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,840
very focused on youngsters it's also my

124
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,800
personal motivation yes

125
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,360
and during uh the past two years we were

126
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,520
working on that we gained a lot

127
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,440
we uh we worked together with other law

128
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,520
enforcements for example with the ncaa

129
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,919
in the uk uh they were also doing

130
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,479
offender prevention and they found out

131
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,880
that if you are a gamer for example the

132
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,240
chance that you're becoming a cyber

133
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,600
criminal is much larger than you're

134
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,479
playing uh dominoes at home for example

135
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,560
i know that's an interesting point

136
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,880
i totally get what you're saying the

137
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,520
problem is when this type of statement

138
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,800
gets out

139
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,440
the media projects it's like gaming is

140
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,680
bad and that is the completely incorrect

141
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,880
conclusion

142
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,840
totally agree with you we uh and i know

143
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,919
what what folks want like even what

144
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,160
folks like me want we want excitement

145
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,680
and what challenge

146
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,000
games give us that challenge yes but if

147
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,639
you don't have that ability to

148
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,520
use these skills in real life

149
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,960
we may end up using them for the wrong

150
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,639
purposes but all you're doing is just

151
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,720
tagging on challenges but i see it as a

152
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,560
positive challenge in a way because if

153
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,320
we are able to work for example with the

154
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,880
gaming industry which we do uh you know

155
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,400
i don't know if you know isle gaming

156
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,800
which is a quite large gaming my gaming

157
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,280
stuff with batman and tech chris okay

158
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,679
there are no competitions

159
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,120
is it possible that we are uh

160
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,960
going to educate people who are going

161
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,400
the wrong way

162
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,400
so check gaming

163
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,840
it's um

164
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,120
it's a risk

165
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,840
but it's also an opportunity

166
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,280
if you're going to cheat with the game

167
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,800
why is the game not showing you hey the

168
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,800
thing what you're doing is not allowed

169
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,919
yeah

170
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,319
so but if i'm taking that pathway of

171
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,400
gaming for example

172
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,680
also cyber criminals are are using that

173
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,160
path to

174
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,080
put you in their system

175
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,240
and

176
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,000
so on that pathway um we

177
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,759
came at what the ide not only this

178
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,160
pathway but multiple pathway why can't

179
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,960
we

180
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,039
create interventions that these

181
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,240
offenders

182
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,360
are having a better future instead of

183
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,800
behind bars

184
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,680
right

185
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,720
and um so we have a it's called a 4d

186
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,919
approach and the first d is 50

187
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,160
so if we don't deter these these

188
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,080
youngsters for example that hey this is

189
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,880
allowed and this is not allowed

190
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,400
you know that also be honest if we don't

191
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,400
tell them

192
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,479
yeah yeah it's also our own fault

193
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:09,680
exactly

194
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,479
and uh especially on schools this is uh

195
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,880
working very well like energy as i as

196
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,240
hack shield they they are

197
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,759
focusing on the primary school where

198
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,080
kids are very young and to motivate

199
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,680
their cyber skills

200
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,080
to in a positive way but also their

201
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,520
protection skills like hey you have to

202
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,759
use two-factor authentication or you

203
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,080
have to use a strong password

204
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,560
which is it might be very important that

205
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,479
important to start very early because if

206
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,159
you get it into the system of these kids

207
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,080
they will follow up in the future

208
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,400
in fact it is i think it is now the

209
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,879
necessary survival scene yeah

210
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,599
digital age we in school were always

211
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,039
told

212
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,720
that uh

213
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,800
there's norms of safety right when i

214
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,080
went to school

215
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,360
this was the early 80s we could walk out

216
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,560
of school

217
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,680
catch a catch a red shirt and go home no

218
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,240
problems or we could bicycle that

219
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,479
things change i mean 90s you you have to

220
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,479
make sure that you're the right person

221
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,960
to pick you

222
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,560
it's a known thing it's

223
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,919
societal education true and we it's now

224
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,160
we need to bring that societal education

225
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,000
the digital space

226
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,160
right now those things are moving too

227
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,039
fast too rapidly agree and

228
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,640
technology is also getting more and more

229
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,559
involved in our lay in our life so the

230
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,120
impact of technology goes wrong it's

231
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,440
also much higher yes so

232
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,080
but the educational part is uh for

233
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,760
prevention authentic prevention is

234
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,680
really important and we approached it on

235
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,760
multiple levels uh primary school but

236
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,399
also secondary school uh we developed a

237
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,399
game with the dutch national police it's

238
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,680
called frank

239
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,440
where

240
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,120
possible offenders they're going to be

241
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,279
confronted by playing a

242
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,120
a game on their phone they're going to

243
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,600
be tricked to commit sudden crime

244
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,160
and in the end they it's a platform they

245
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,080
get a warning by the police hey the

246
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,680
thing you did is not allowed by law xyz

247
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,399
or they even are virtually are coming

248
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,640
behind bars and into jail

249
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,800
so they they say okay

250
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,120
there's a fine on this and somebody will

251
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,800
be informed but this is the secondary

252
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,880
school but this is or the answers

253
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,760
um

254
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,000
what i personally also like if we are

255
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,720
informing the youngsters uh in these

256
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,600
ways

257
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,760
why should we also educate

258
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,760
the old the elder yes the moms and the

259
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,519
daddies indeed

260
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,839
and this is one of my favorite why i

261
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,760
really like actuals a lot because there

262
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,519
are quests there

263
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,480
who are

264
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,839
helping the kids to talk with their

265
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:46,880
parents

266
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,279
because in all this offender prevention

267
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,480
i've seen

268
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,560
there is usually always a gap between

269
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,560
the parents and the kids where it goes

270
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,480
wrong later in this stage where they

271
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,040
become a criminal there's there's

272
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,200
at least 75

273
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,040
an issue over there it's a communication

274
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,360
guide yeah yes that's communication and

275
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,560
a generation

276
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,160
yeah so

277
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,399
information is important

278
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,079
another thing which is important we have

279
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,320
a lot of youngsters who are very

280
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,600
interested

281
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,480
in this

282
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,360
this profession and

283
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,880
i see it as the pearls of our world

284
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,760
and

285
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,920
but they don't have alternatives

286
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,079
and i want to talk about alternatives

287
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,320
when we were young um it was still

288
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,959
possible to uh use a whistle and blow in

289
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,320
his phone and and uh with 2600

290
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,200
heads

291
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,839
you get the operator yeah and the the

292
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,279
thing we did with that was yeah um was

293
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,720
firmly not allowed

294
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,760
but the damage was was smaller

295
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,160
but nowadays you're just one click away

296
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,279
from hiring data yeah you just fill in

297
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,360
your credit card number and your school

298
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,519
will be down for four minutes or hours

299
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,480
if you want

300
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,640
so the the the chance that you are

301
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,040
taking this one steps are also getting

302
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,079
higher

303
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,160
and um i think it's also important that

304
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,000
we give them an alternative so by

305
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,800
playing playing or online war games or

306
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,360
playing with ctfs

307
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,440
getting the right education already from

308
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,880
young level

309
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,920
actually ctfs are the ultimate challenge

310
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,000
it's a great generalization of energy

311
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,360
and i see that happening with

312
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,880
all the initiatives that you've been

313
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,040
involved with since i've known you

314
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,200
it's you're right i want to i have a

315
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,640
question so what type of uh

316
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,040
what type of paths

317
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,760
are

318
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,040
hooks to cyber crime like what is it you

319
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,519
mentioned ddos as one thing like okay

320
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,200
i really had a background school and i

321
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,120
want to just you know

322
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,639
give it back at them i'm going to hire

323
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,079
this ddos

324
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,360
service and

325
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,880
blast their electrons out of space

326
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,680
um

327
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,240
what else like what else gets it i know

328
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,480
back in the day it was like party and

329
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,639
password tracking but there were many

330
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,320
yes now um

331
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,320
one of the things which it happens a lot

332
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,480
which is more on the gaming part i spoke

333
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,560
about is that

334
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,639
kids are into gaming and they want to

335
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,200
find cheats and from cheats they are

336
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,440
maybe taking the step uh on developing

337
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,320
cheats

338
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,480
and this will make the cheats yeah and

339
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,360
this will be will be uh communicated

340
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,760
through gaming forums but on these

341
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,399
gaming forums uh organized crime is also

342
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,519
available

343
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,880
oh yes and so

344
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,880
it's already closing to each other and

345
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,639
they see that some kids are developing

346
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,320
really nice code for example it will be

347
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,480
contacted by hey

348
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,720
i see you're coding very well

349
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,959
can you make me a payment module because

350
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,839
i have this website and

351
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,279
you know those kids are really good in

352
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,519
decoding they won't make this step like

353
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,760
this this is a criminal activity because

354
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,440
it feels like hey this is a normal thing

355
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,760
he needs a payment module for us

356
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,040
and the next thing you know it's

357
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,639
extinguished

358
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,880
yeah you know it's taking in steps over

359
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,040
there and on my personal side i uh we

360
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,440
have friends and uh their son he's

361
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,200
really brilliant to cody you know and um

362
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,519
he was acting in that direction and i'm

363
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,680
happy that i was in in his surrounding

364
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,839
and his parents were talking about it

365
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,000
see this like i never do that right this

366
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,639
is i always tell myself that i come to

367
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,320
conferences to learn today i learned

368
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,600
something new

369
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,279
and never seen that this would be a

370
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,519
possible path

371
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,560
if one of the powers totally makes sense

372
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,519
another path which is very trusting is

373
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,160
uh more

374
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,320
the cyber enabled crime rules it's

375
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,000
really easy to make money sometimes

376
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,399
through uh for away and i know they

377
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,839
don't always if

378
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,440
it means that okay i'm protecting you

379
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,920
you're saying hey mom my phone number

380
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,199
has been changed

381
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,360
because i lost my phone and uh this is

382
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,160
my new name i see yeah the classic uh

383
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,800
i'm stranded in uh i'm stranded in the

384
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,040
uk and i ran out of cash

385
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,480
can you like

386
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,760
yeah

387
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,040
question you need me the money

388
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,680
but the new thing on there is that

389
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,480
this is still real cry but but how does

390
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,079
let's say i'm a student

391
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,320
how do i get involved with whatsapp well

392
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,320
what's the pathway the path there is

393
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,760
that it's not in the initial opening of

394
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,560
the criminal activity it's more on uh on

395
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,959
the ends so um in the netherlands it

396
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,240
happens a lot

397
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,959
that they become

398
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,160
a way to make from money transfers real

399
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,040
cash money so some youngsters who are

400
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,320
not thinking about it they are

401
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,839
lending out their their their credit

402
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,279
card uh because somebody's paying their

403
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,600
100 euros so hey can i use your uh your

404
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,440
banking card or your credit card for uh

405
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,519
for a week and i think hey i can make

406
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,279
easy money for that

407
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,480
um

408
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,320
main thing over there is that in the end

409
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,600
of the part of this cyber-enabled crime

410
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,120
you also see that youngsters are being

411
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,760
evolved yeah i think also if you're

412
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,519
going to take a look on

413
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,279
cybercrime or cyber-enabled crime i

414
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,040
think this is a part where education is

415
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,360
also really important definitely in fact

416
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,360
yeah if you know what you're getting

417
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,800
into it what

418
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,440
the terminal head contains what monsters

419
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,680
like there you you'd probably make a

420
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,160
choice and not do that yeah i see what

421
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,079
you say you just lured it because it's

422
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,480
unknown it's exciting at first then

423
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,920
then it's like too late

424
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,680
but it actually is a kind of form of

425
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,839
fishing where you treat people and uh

426
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,639
i didn't expect it but in the past year

427
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,120
we have found a few fishing panel

428
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,120
builders oh or underage actually

429
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,279
yeah and and you have to think about

430
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,399
okay

431
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,040
what what how did this happen

432
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,360
and if you're going to talk to them and

433
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,720
they were talking about yeah i didn't

434
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,560
knew they were real victims uh they

435
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,560
don't make the real world it was just a

436
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,399
game it was a virtual world you know

437
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,240
what can i never happen

438
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,320
and and it's like it's like ender's game

439
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,079
right yeah it's it's exactly like

440
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,079
ender's game yeah

441
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,040
so

442
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,839
i think it's really important to put

443
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,759
at least the educational part again in

444
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,320
there and if they don't catch the

445
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,560
alternative to have this challenge

446
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,399
um it's really important to take the

447
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,480
next steps over there

448
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,120
so it's degrade and disrupt where we

449
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,199
were first talking about the two d's

450
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,279
where or a little bit more hey we treat

451
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,680
you nice we tell you and if we give you

452
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,759
alternatives um

453
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,240
now if we're talking about okay

454
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,720
i'm really stepped into uh criminal

455
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,279
activities because i choose

456
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,160
and

457
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,160
there it's coming interesting

458
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,839
and there are a lot of operations there

459
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,240
i cannot talk about but

460
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,560
things we can talk about is okay

461
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,160
if we are talking about um online image

462
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,599
this is very important uh for uh

463
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,439
for the discriminant world

464
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,839
so if we decrease their reputation for

465
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:14,959
example

466
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,119
like hey i'm not first of all or i

467
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,400
didn't do this

468
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,480
you know right it's really important

469
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,839
that and they're going to think about

470
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,839
okay

471
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,760
my credits are going down

472
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,280
also if you're going to take a look on

473
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,799
the profit if we can degrade the profit

474
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:31,919
yeah

475
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,080
if we put the costs off

476
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,559
and the revenue down and they're going

477
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,679
up in the end they're going to think

478
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,360
yeah you know better to do something

479
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,039
else because

480
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,000
that's better to make money on um

481
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,240
yes so we're coming back down to the

482
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,840
alternatives

483
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,320
and in the end we still have the the the

484
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,760
lovely which is

485
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,520
which is disrupt

486
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,840
pull the plug of of of large ddos

487
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,039
websites

488
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,640
i don't know if you remember the

489
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,400
webstressor.org

490
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,799
activity i i think they do i think they

491
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,600
do yes which was one of the largest uh

492
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,080
ddos platforms and a lot of law

493
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,760
enforcement internationally worked

494
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,080
together to find these guys

495
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,080
which was actually one of the guys who

496
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,720
was running was a 14 year old

497
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,840
boy

498
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,360
and he was already involved for three

499
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,960
years wow

500
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,720
so think about it clearly he wouldn't

501
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,480
know what he was getting right it

502
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,080
couldn't be just for the laws at that

503
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,400
point i know his personal situation

504
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,720
and his spiritual personal situation was

505
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,400
that this this

506
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,400
boy was um

507
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,320
from a family and his parents were

508
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,760
working very hard

509
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,320
and uh he was just such a nice boy

510
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,160
because he was behind his computer and

511
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,320
what could go wrong

512
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,039
and when we spoke to him it came really

513
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,679
to his launch if i have knew this before

514
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,960
this was not my permanent buff

515
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,160
and

516
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,720
my personally it motivates me to help

517
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,320
also those kids

518
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,760
who went wrong

519
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,760
and the international police started

520
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,840
with a project called white

521
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,760
i think three four years ago

522
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,840
where we came up with the idea if you

523
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,080
are on the wrong path and you have to be

524
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,080
catched by us

525
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,480
we can put you behind bars because it's

526
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,120
real money you know it's just wrong

527
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,360
but does it make sense to put the 14

528
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,200
year old behind bars

529
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,520
first of all some are doing very good

530
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,760
true and it's also not very cost

531
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,200
effective because

532
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,240
um

533
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,320
put somebody behind bars

534
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,320
is is really

535
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,400
a very expensive solution there and

536
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,400
there's the next thing we have is

537
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,760
specialty

538
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,960
behind bars we can't use his knowledge

539
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,240
give him a positive alternative

540
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,799
let him protect the world instead of

541
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,240
attacking the world

542
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,559
and we have seen even

543
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,039
in other cases where they also were also

544
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,440
building indigo's website by the way um

545
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,360
this this guy has now

546
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,600
uh changed from attacking people with

547
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,919
ddoses by building a ddos mitigation

548
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,039
service

549
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,799
that's nice and this is what you can

550
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,480
gain if you just give them an

551
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,559
alternative way you educate them and you

552
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,480
give them the positive alternatives you

553
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,559
want them to have

554
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,760
and for me personally it motivates me a

555
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,080
lot these stories and that's the reason

556
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,679
why i'm shining that much and i'm really

557
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,360
proud of them on

558
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,360
the ability to do this

559
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,679
very i know you've made a difference at

560
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,880
several levels in

561
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,799
many people myself included and

562
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,480
i learned a lot of new things speaking

563
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,000
with you i never had glimpsed into this

564
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,559
area of cyber crime books

565
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,000
and what cyber enabled crime was and how

566
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,600
the path led there

567
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,200
it is i think

568
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,640
i had a very

569
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,120
naive viewer honestly

570
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,960
and

571
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,880
while you were narrating things to me i

572
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,640
was trying to project this

573
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,120
what would it be like in other societies

574
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,640
in the world where the economics are

575
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,799
different backgrounds are different

576
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,720
there would be you know greater or

577
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,919
lesser susceptibility to it

578
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,559
how would this appear in different

579
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,480
different regimes

580
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,679
it's a big

581
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,520
it's definitely the time is now we need

582
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,600
to think about it i'm

583
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,840
i'm glad you're in there because i know

584
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,440
you can make a difference

585
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,039
you've always done that

586
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,320
and uh

587
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,480
well thanks for being you thanks this is

588
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,919
thanks

589
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,520
the thing you're mentioning is also an

590
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,440
important thing for me when we started

591
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,280
hacking the class for example we said

592
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,120
okay we want this video available for

593
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,799
free yes and then

594
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,039
and and open source so if everybody

595
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,280
wants to use it please use it

596
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,080
and

597
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,960
we

598
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,600
we see other authoritatives also working

599
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,400
in this direction um again actually

600
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,440
we're going to talk uh about it

601
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,360
they they also have this motivation you

602
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,320
know let's feed the world yes and

603
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,880
from my personal perspective but also i

604
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,799
think from a police perspective it's

605
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,120
really important to take this as a world

606
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,280
problem because cyber crime doesn't have

607
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,320
borders

608
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,760
and that's also the reason why we work

609
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,919
together with with other parties also on

610
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,480
law enforcement to see if we can can do

611
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,960
this on a higher level but prevent is

612
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,320
still a very

613
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,559
very young

614
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,280
way of thinking for law enforcement

615
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,039
because we we are used to catch

616
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,360
criminals put them behind bars see this

617
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,960
is the thing even in cyber security

618
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,280
right it's always been reactive yeah you

619
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,480
wait for the attack you know the

620
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,840
signature you're the filter you're

621
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,799
catching it but why not prevent it yes

622
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,400
you know we've all heard the same

623
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,159
amounts of prevention is better than a

624
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,360
pound of cure

625
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,080
i think uh glad you're putting that into

626
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,280
practice

627
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,039
uh that's awesome

628
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,440
but thank you mary thank you for uh

629
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,520
joining me once again

630
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,320
at yet another box as we've always made

631
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,520
us friends

632
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,200
well for sure and we don't know what's

633
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,200
uh what our prevention will be in five

634
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,200
years but we don't know but i know i

635
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,520
know we will be there this is of course

636
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,760
a very endearing moment for me as well

637
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,640
to see you folks okay
