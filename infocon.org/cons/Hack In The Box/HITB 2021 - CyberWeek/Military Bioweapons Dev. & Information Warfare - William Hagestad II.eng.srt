1
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,120
and again welcome good afternoon good

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,920
morning around the world from abu dhabi

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,920
just a data classification today what

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,359
i'm going to be talking about is traffic

5
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,119
electrical red

6
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,480
please don't share it outside of this

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,160
conference although this is global so

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,320
let's observe chatham house rules thus

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,080
no attribution to me as we go through

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:26,960
this

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,359
what i would like to remind everyone is

12
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,238
certainly to thank the members of the

13
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,719
abu dhabi cyber security council the

14
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,640
dubai electronic security center and

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,399
hack in the box for putting on this

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,320
cyber week thank you all very much for

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,559
bringing me over to talk about this very

18
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,840
complex subject so chakra

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,160
so let's talk about chemical nuclear and

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,039
biological weapons first then we'll talk

21
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,280
about really as it relates to the gulf

22
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,840
cooperation council the combined effect

23
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,559
of both cyber and bio weapons affecting

24
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,120
future conflict i will put my contact

25
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,039
information up at the end of this slide

26
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,559
and i encourage people to reach out if

27
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,400
they have questions about the material i

28
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,080
have made the slides available already

29
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,240
to the organizer so those should be

30
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,760
available through download or however

31
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,920
they get those out to you so let's talk

32
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,360
about where we are in the earth right

33
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,920
now we're within the gulf cooperation

34
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,119
council

35
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,119
a region that i grew up in i actually

36
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,759
grew up in the islamic republic of iran

37
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,159
before the shah was deposed so you can

38
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,680
imagine that i have a fondness for this

39
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,759
region of the world i've worked here in

40
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:30,560
many

41
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,720
capacities and certainly i have a

42
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,560
fondness for the region

43
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,560
here's a geographical outlay of the area

44
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,000
of operations that we're going to talk

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,560
about today specifically focused on the

46
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,119
countries not only within the gcc but

47
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,520
also around the countries that perhaps

48
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,520
may have a desire to destabilize the

49
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,560
region

50
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,960
so let's talk about it um really the

51
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,920
cyber landscape within the gcc is one of

52
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,119
a very

53
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,119
difficult and increasingly attack

54
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,000
surface

55
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,880
there's no one dominant cyber actor

56
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,240
everybody has their motivations their

57
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,479
capabilities and of course there are

58
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,320
different targets of opportunity or

59
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,399
aggression based on motivations

60
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,318
one that comes to mind most recently was

61
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:11,599
last week

62
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,840
when the moses group essentially went

63
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,800
after

64
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,599
israel what's interesting about this is

65
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,160
they went after with ransomless

66
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,920
malware which means they were not

67
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,280
looking to extract and extort but rather

68
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,280
destroy through the basically the

69
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,640
discussion of information that they

70
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,480
gathered

71
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,160
now they didn't use any sort of combined

72
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,319
arms necessarily but it's interesting

73
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,720
because what they did do is without

74
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,800
attribution of course for the israelis

75
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,200
is they focus specifically on critical

76
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,480
infrastructure

77
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,120
areas including power grid

78
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,879
maybe some maps

79
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,640
certainly the traffic and all of the

80
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,920
infrastructure that makes the country of

81
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,480
israel run what is dangerous about this

82
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,560
is there was no one really given direct

83
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,560
attribution speaking to some of my

84
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,080
colleagues here that are from israel of

85
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,360
course they will give you a laugh and a

86
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,519
wink and say we know who it was but i

87
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:02,480
don't think there's any solid

88
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,800
attribution about that

89
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,720
of course within the gcc as you can see

90
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,480
on this map this shows where this

91
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,720
conference is coming from my second home

92
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,159
the middle east

93
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,920
now as we talk about the moses group

94
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,159
it's interesting with that ransom

95
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,000
ransomless malware they were able to

96
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,560
essentially extract a variety of types

97
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,480
of information as i mentioned maps but

98
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,840
more importantly

99
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,720
they were able to extract the personnel

100
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,120
records of the israeli defense force now

101
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,120
this in and of itself may be benign but

102
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,560
i can tell you what having served in the

103
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,560
u.s marine corps if my information were

104
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,000
out on the web from a nefarious threat

105
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,640
actor i'd be a little bit concerned

106
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,239
so let's continue to talk about this

107
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,480
this gives you a graphic representation

108
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,000
of some of the critical infrastructure

109
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,440
and certainly the graphic of the israeli

110
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,599
defense force now it is no surprise

111
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,239
perhaps that i put up the irgc this

112
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,879
ramek republic guard corps perhaps as a

113
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,400
reference to those that would want to do

114
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,959
harm to israel with the ransomless wear

115
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,159
attacks

116
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,159
now our agenda today is of course we're

117
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,680
going to talk about the chemical and

118
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,239
bioweapons within the gcc we'll talk

119
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,640
about history terms the development of

120
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,239
those and then most importantly i'm

121
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,720
going to talk to you about cyber warfare

122
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,640
and the combined use of biological

123
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,560
chemical and nuclear weapons from the

124
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,320
various nation-states that surround the

125
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,798
gcc

126
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,478
but i do also want to mention that in

127
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,800
the islamic republic of iran all roughly

128
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,080
three weeks ago

129
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,600
their critical infrastructure was

130
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,759
attacked some would say perhaps that the

131
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,240
moses hacks were in retribution or

132
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,639
rendition acts for what had been taken

133
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,199
place in their country not too long ago

134
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,600
because the iranians felt the wrath of

135
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,919
having gasoline not being able to

136
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,080
dispense imagine critical infrastructure

137
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,000
where you cannot get around and conduct

138
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,520
your daily duties this is perhaps the

139
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,840
nightmare of any nation and certainly

140
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,759
for iran it was destabilizing for a

141
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,120
while

142
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,919
now

143
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,759
as we've entered the arab world again i

144
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,199
want to reemphasize that we are in the

145
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,160
gulf cooperation council now the gcc in

146
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,400
and of itself has made its

147
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,560
presence known on a very peaceful

148
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,919
cooperative

149
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,600
achieving coordination with member

150
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,039
states

151
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,960
really establishing sectors of

152
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,280
technological engineering and

153
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,360
administrative affairs thus

154
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,120
the hack in the box event sponsored here

155
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,120
by the government they also wanted to

156
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,800
promote scientific and technical

157
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,880
exchange through progress

158
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,800
really encouraging the private sector to

159
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,800
come forward and help stabilize the

160
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,520
infrastructure of the gcc members

161
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,600
and of course that includes the military

162
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,120
what you can understand here is that you

163
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,759
have six countries as noted up here i

164
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,919
won't read them to you other than to say

165
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,680
they make up a majority of the

166
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,240
geographic area of the arabian peninsula

167
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,680
and of course they wanted to focus on

168
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,280
cooperating with each other including

169
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,440
those military activities what this

170
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,199
means in terms of i should have told you

171
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,280
is the bottom line up front is that you

172
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,800
have six armies that are working

173
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,240
together with the latest military

174
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,560
technology to defend themselves with a

175
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,120
rather significant annual investment

176
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,039
now of course that military readiness

177
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,120
includes ensuring that they are

178
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,120
protected from a variety of threat

179
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,080
actors from the lowest form of kinetic

180
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,759
types of attacks such as improvised

181
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,319
explosive devices perhaps even an errand

182
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,400
missile strike but really it's important

183
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,560
to understand that with all of these

184
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,880
tasks and capabilities the gcc from a

185
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,280
military perspective want to protect its

186
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,120
history and of course the monarchy that

187
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,039
is established within that but let's

188
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,919
talk about some of the more interesting

189
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,000
biological and chemical aspects of the

190
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,520
presentation today

191
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,120
namely

192
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,280
chemical weapons within the gcc history

193
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,120
is important because in the 1980s and

194
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,080
iran

195
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,520
it's interesting because during that

196
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,039
iraq around war

197
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,919
then the former regime holder of iraq

198
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,080
used nerve gas including sarin and

199
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,880
mustard gas to kill opposing soldiers of

200
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,800
the iranian army it's interesting

201
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,080
because according to released

202
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,720
unclassified cia documents that perhaps

203
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,080
even the united states may have been

204
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,840
complicit in providing these types of

205
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,319
chemical weapons to the then

206
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,240
leader of iraq

207
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,120
then in the middle of the 80s in halawa

208
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,919
you have the regime basically unleashing

209
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,479
mustard gas against kurdish rebels

210
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,120
unfortunately within that example there

211
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,599
were significant civilian

212
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,599
casualties which is quite unforge as you

213
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,680
can see here now not necessarily within

214
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,840
the gcc but tubeless georgia is another

215
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,759
example of chemical weapons used by a

216
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,880
military

217
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,560
uh really against protesters and

218
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,479
certainly this is no

219
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,080
news to anyone but that is certainly

220
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,759
something when you talk about oleoresin

221
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,840
capsium or oc spray used from a law

222
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,520
enforcement perspective

223
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,479
and then most notably in 2018 in syria

224
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,800
we have the assam regime using chemical

225
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,039
weapons against civilian targets with a

226
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,960
devastating catastrophic effect we'll

227
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,639
get to that here in a little bit

228
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,840
what i would like to do though is

229
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,520
introduce you to the military leaders of

230
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,039
the gcc

231
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,240
they have come together from a

232
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,160
cooperative protect perspective to

233
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,759
protect the various monarchies that they

234
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,919
represent this is important because it

235
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,520
lends itself to the chain of command in

236
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,039
terms of military conflict of which

237
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,680
we're talking about this afternoon

238
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,840
now part and parcel of that of course is

239
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,080
really chemical and biological weapons

240
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,440
and it's important to understand from a

241
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,039
military perspective the history

242
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,639
associated with this

243
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,599
because if you have served in the

244
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,360
military you've had training in with

245
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,800
regard to nuclear

246
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,479
biological and chemical weapons as

247
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,560
distasteful as that is that's what the

248
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,160
modern battlefield represents as a

249
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,759
threat surface to those of us that have

250
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,720
served

251
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,400
part and parcel of that of course is

252
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,360
world war one the us army had created

253
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,240
edgewood which essentially weaponized a

254
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,840
variety of different types of gas

255
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,080
including chlorine and mustard and they

256
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,000
deployed this with devastating effects

257
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,679
during the trench warfare in europe

258
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,000
during world war one a german scientist

259
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,080
fritz haber actually pioneered the use

260
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,880
and rise of chemical weapons basically

261
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,040
saying in future wars the military will

262
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,680
not be able to ignore these poison gases

263
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,360
it is essentially a higher form of

264
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,600
killing perhaps that was a foreshadowing

265
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,160
of what would happen during world war ii

266
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,399
with the jewish population

267
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,399
and then of course chemical warfare

268
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,800
during world war one of course included

269
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,160
tear gases that i mentioned earlier

270
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,959
resin capsion chlorine-based

271
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,279
phosgene and of course diophosgene and

272
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,800
of course mustard gas

273
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,800
all of these can have catastrophic

274
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,440
devastating effects on the military

275
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,120
population that is fighting in a trench

276
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,680
warfare you can imagine that gas will

277
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,680
sink to the lowest level within those

278
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,320
trenches where the occupants are hiding

279
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,200
from the incoming kinetic ammunition the

280
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,680
bombs

281
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,399
and of course there are chemical warfare

282
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,880
nerve agents as well such as tabin

283
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,640
sarin which we've heard historically

284
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,920
used in asia

285
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,000
soman and cyclocera these are all

286
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,680
devastating nerve agents that if

287
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,800
unleashed

288
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,800
in a combined arms with military actions

289
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,600
could yield a very catastrophic effect

290
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,440
on a civilian population i would not

291
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,200
want to be there if this happened

292
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,080
now

293
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,760
poisons such as

294
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,200
sarin vx mustard gas and hydrosonic acid

295
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,959
are really these are the weapons grade

296
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,440
the military-grade chemical weapons

297
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,440
specifically toxic agents within the

298
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,880
military that could be used within the

299
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,880
gcc

300
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,720
now of course those development terms

301
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,160
that i would like you to be aware for

302
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,440
aware of include everything for

303
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,360
biological warfare

304
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,720
through the strategic information

305
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,040
warfare research capabilities and the

306
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,440
use of missiles including dual chemical

307
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,600
weapons with kinetic devices

308
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,040
and then of course at the bottom wrong

309
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,560
of course are those irritating riot

310
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,560
weapons that oc gas that i keep

311
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,640
mentioning

312
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,440
now weaponized military biologics and

313
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,040
chemicals include a variety of things

314
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,959
from bacterial biological agents as you

315
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,519
see on the screen to viral biological

316
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,079
agents as such as ricocidia

317
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,320
chlamydia and of course toxin-like

318
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,079
warfare all of these

319
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,720
can yield such things as fungal

320
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,120
biological warfare agents which if

321
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,600
unleashed on a military action could

322
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,399
render the opposing enemy basically

323
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,040
ineffective from a combat perspective

324
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,480
now the types of weapons that i'd like

325
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,560
to also mention of course include drug

326
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,120
resistant microorganisms perhaps even

327
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,680
the injection of animals such as in this

328
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,920
case in this region chemical

329
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,720
camels as animal soldiers and then of

330
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,040
course you have ethnic bombs anthrax and

331
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,279
even biological viruses these are the

332
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,519
types of readiness for defense that the

333
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,680
gcc militaries must prepare themselves

334
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,200
for

335
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,640
and of course the types of typical

336
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,600
warfighting uses include area denial of

337
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,240
adversaries essentially spreading or

338
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,279
spraying vx through rockets over an area

339
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,279
and you can see from this chart

340
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,720
based on the delivery method that you

341
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,640
can essentially focus on an area for the

342
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,240
delivery of this or you could

343
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,880
essentially focus on a denial of service

344
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,480
for a particular military

345
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,680
pardon me it's a little warm here and

346
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,360
i'm from a cold region of the world

347
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,720
minnesota

348
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,240
all right

349
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,600
so

350
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,440
when it comes to warfare being used by

351
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,959
militaries it's important to understand

352
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,040
that some of these delivery methods

353
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,440
of weaponization include as i mentioned

354
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,839
a wide area by bomb or missile

355
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,839
imagine spraying this poison over a city

356
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:02,959
such as

357
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,200
uh somewhere in syria or from a

358
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,440
helicopter or another type of aircraft

359
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,240
imagine in the streets of any city

360
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,800
within the gcc a truck racing through

361
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,959
the streets spreading this type of gas

362
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,279
the enemy in this case

363
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,880
may be someone that is simply driving a

364
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,399
delivery truck that weaponizes that

365
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,000
delivery method

366
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,519
the victims unfortunately would be

367
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,959
civilians because these would be the

368
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,480
populated areas that they would be

369
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,399
targeting

370
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,760
and of course i mentioned the use of

371
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,160
chlorine gas in eastern eastern ghouta

372
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,600
during 2018 by the assad regime in syria

373
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,279
unfortunately a child was killed and of

374
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,279
course 11 other civilians but it's

375
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,279
important to note that this assad regime

376
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,519
had no compunction about delivering this

377
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,880
type of warfare method as diabolical as

378
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,040
it was they did it with no compunction

379
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,360
for civilians

380
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,279
that is not what militaries do we do not

381
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,440
target civilian populations

382
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,839
absolutely not

383
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,079
types of nuclear biological and weapons

384
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,600
types of course as i mentioned include

385
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,320
some of those hazardous substances

386
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,320
they're intended to cause severe injury

387
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,480
those chemicals and poisons really

388
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,279
destabilize the biochemical makeup of a

389
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,360
human being and if you're used on

390
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,040
untrained civilians they can be very

391
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,320
fatal dangerous and can be destabilizing

392
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,720
in and of themselves not including the

393
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,000
cyber which we'll talk about here

394
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,279
shortly

395
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,800
a variety of different agents that i've

396
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,720
talked about already include those that

397
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,480
you see here but it's important that the

398
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,079
classification of these biological

399
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,800
weapons are being discovered not only by

400
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,720
gcc countries in terms of preparation

401
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,720
for defensive measures but also

402
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,320
offensively against some of the

403
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,240
countries within the region that are not

404
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,240
part of the gcc

405
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,480
now there are top 10 deadly toxic agents

406
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,320
within these chemical weapons you can

407
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,000
see on this ie chart that you see up

408
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,680
here what really is important to

409
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,760
understand that each one of these has

410
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,399
the capability to deliver be delivered

411
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,160
through a military military rocket

412
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,720
system or perhaps even a ground mortar

413
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,800
system it's very important to understand

414
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,199
that from a kinetic perspective all you

415
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:04,880
are doing is changing the composition of

416
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,880
the military around from explosive

417
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,279
device to nuclear biological or chemical

418
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,560
depending on the targeting that you're

419
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,800
using

420
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,560
now those weapons capabilities are very

421
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,079
interesting and this is where it gets

422
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,079
very very curious because what i'm going

423
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,600
to do is i'm going to talk about some of

424
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,199
the nation states that are not part of

425
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,079
the gcc we'll talk about their nuclear

426
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,560
biological and chemical

427
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,399
development of weapon systems in

428
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,320
conjunction with the likely courses of

429
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,720
action when using cyber warfare

430
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,560
impromisation if you will from a chinese

431
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,560
perspective

432
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,639
now in algeria of course they have

433
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,880
developed chemical weapons

434
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,120
they're in the early stages i would say

435
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,519
from an unclassified perspective they

436
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,040
are certainly looking at biological

437
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,680
weapons as well as nuclear weapons

438
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,040
this will equate

439
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,800
rather interestingly to correspond to

440
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,519
their cyber capabilities it's a nascent

441
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,680
developing capability that they are not

442
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,839
willing to publicize although you should

443
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,920
be aware that this is indeed happening

444
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,839
egypt on the other hand they've had

445
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,399
certainly the direct use of oleoresin

446
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,720
capsian against civilian protesters

447
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,639
during the arab spring and they have

448
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,079
considered using other types of

449
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,240
biological weapons

450
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,680
it is important to understand that from

451
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,399
a

452
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,399
military perspective they are very aware

453
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,040
that if they use those weapons too

454
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,120
grandiosely or grandly against the

455
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,279
civilian population then you can imagine

456
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,880
that that could have a destabilizing

457
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,839
effect on the civilian population

458
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,600
the money slide for these two countries

459
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,000
is their likely courses of cyber warfare

460
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,279
action for algeria and egypt algeria of

461
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,959
course they have the opportunity to

462
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,959
learn from their neighbor nations not

463
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,720
only from the nuclear biological and

464
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,800
chemical capability but also from a

465
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,279
cyber capability many conferences that

466
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,519
i've attended over the past decade or so

467
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,360
i've met a variety of hackers and that

468
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,040
is exactly where they learn from each

469
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,120
other they don't do it from a malicious

470
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,720
perspective that's what the military is

471
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,639
used for so needless to say they're

472
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,199
developing that cyber muscle memory

473
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,720
and i believe that their third course of

474
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,000
action is that they will begin to

475
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,839
develop cyber activities including

476
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,040
offensive

477
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,519
and defensive cyber warfare capabilities

478
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,839
not only against neighbors for fear of

479
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,920
destabilizing themselves but also

480
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,079
against their civilian population

481
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,920
egypt is another story

482
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,759
they have exported offensive hackers to

483
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,560
support military capabilities of nations

484
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,160
throughout the gcc this should be no

485
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,920
surprise to anyone

486
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,839
they do indeed have an organic civilian

487
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,079
hacking capability what's really unique

488
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,000
about this is while they are primarily

489
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,920
offensive in their nature they will

490
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,680
replace the defensive measures to

491
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,639
support and continue regime continuity

492
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,000
basically maintaining the chain of

493
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,160
command within egypt that third course

494
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,240
of action of course is to realize

495
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,839
foreign support from both the people's

496
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,279
republic of china

497
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,000
and the russian federation to supplement

498
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,160
developing and really

499
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,160
organically creating an offensive and

500
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,079
defensive military hacking capability

501
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,360
that surpasses their neighbors

502
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,160
of course israel no stranger to chemical

503
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,199
weapons

504
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,119
i apologize for the insensitivity of

505
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,280
this graphic but it details their arch

506
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,679
enemy during world war ii remember i

507
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,679
mentioned uh professor haber as a

508
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,039
foreshadowing

509
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,039
the israelis will make sure beyond a

510
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,240
shadow of a doubt that they are not

511
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,919
subject to that same sort of chemical

512
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,079
treatment of their civilian population

513
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,400
they learned the hard way

514
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,400
and certainly those biological weapons

515
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,760
it's interesting they have not signed

516
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,400
the bioweapons convention the bwc

517
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,080
and while they've conducted extensive

518
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,000
research into these capabilities and

519
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,400
they have a dedicated research facility

520
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,039
regarding biological research they are

521
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,400
intent on ensuring that they have a

522
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,960
defensive capability but make no mistake

523
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,640
ladies and gentlemen they will use it if

524
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,880
they feel threatened

525
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,160
and then from a nuclear weapons

526
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,840
perspective certainly they don't want

527
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,240
the anyone of their neighbors uh perhaps

528
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,840
specifically the islamic republic of

529
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,080
iran to develop weapons that could harm

530
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,320
them so from a defensive perspective

531
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,240
they need to be prepared in order to

532
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,760
repel those types of

533
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,840
activities and threats from countries

534
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,200
that would want to develop nuclear

535
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,840
weapons to destroy them it is very much

536
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,559
a

537
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,200
rocky road no pun intended

538
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,840
now the likely cyber warfare courses of

539
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,400
action for the israel israeli nation

540
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,039
of course number one the number one koa

541
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,799
in response to aggression from neighbors

542
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,960
most likely to operationalize the use of

543
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,320
combined arms

544
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,240
in a traditional sense such as kinetic

545
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,039
attacks standard military and focus on

546
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,880
direct military action on high value

547
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,640
targets of opportunity

548
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,640
think about a low-level attack such as

549
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,559
destabilizing the critical

550
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,799
infrastructure of iran and if they got

551
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,799
angry enough perhaps they would use

552
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,880
chemical weapons to destabilize a region

553
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,240
of that particular country for their

554
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,480
offensive aims again that's statecraft

555
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,760
at its finest

556
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,200
their second call of course is

557
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,679
preemptive physical attacks on adversary

558
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,000
nation states think of stuxnet and the

559
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,400
operation olympic games prevent further

560
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,080
development of nuclear biological and

561
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,080
chemical weapons if you can have that

562
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,760
first mover advantage from a military

563
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,840
perspective you own the battlefield you

564
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,360
will be victorious this would be the

565
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,000
mantra of the israeli defense forces

566
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,520
the third course of action of course

567
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,520
would be that combined use

568
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,679
of military operations

569
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,679
by cyber preparation of the battlefield

570
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,280
specifically

571
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,039
creating further soft targets for

572
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,039
destruction and the degrading the

573
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,039
critical infrastructure making it

574
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,200
unusable through both kinetic means as

575
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,600
well as potentially chemical weapons to

576
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,240
essentially render the adversary useless

577
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,320
destabilize demoralize the civilian

578
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,679
population

579
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,120
if you do that ladies and gentlemen

580
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,559
successfully

581
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,080
you have achieved your operation of

582
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,400
using combined arms from a cyber

583
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,240
and a nuclear biological chemical

584
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,840
perspective

585
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,919
of course libya bottom up line up front

586
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,600
here is of course from a u.s

587
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,400
unclassified perspective is that they

588
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,559
essentially are more than likely

589
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,400
successful in judging how

590
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,520
they could

591
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,919
adopt this type of delivery mention it's

592
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,080
interesting to note that in 82

593
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,480
they did ratify the bwc and in 2 4 2004

594
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,039
they actually declared metric tons of

595
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,200
nuclear biological and chemical weapons

596
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,760
for destruction by opw's opcw

597
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,600
of course libya has had a history of

598
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,000
developing chemical and biological

599
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,919
weapons for its purposes it's

600
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,320
interesting to note that under the omar

601
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,400
qaddafi regime this certainly would have

602
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,400
been one of those major

603
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,559
military initiatives from his

604
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,320
perspective again forgive me for wiping

605
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,840
my brow it is a little warm here under

606
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,960
these lights

607
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,240
the likely courses of action

608
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,559
for libya include the following they

609
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,480
will continue to use propaganda and

610
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,919
disinformation

611
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,000
against the government of national

612
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,559
accord supported by militias from across

613
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,159
western libya and of course they will go

614
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,919
do so in support of the khalifa hafer's

615
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,559
libyan armed forces the laaf

616
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:53,840
combined with the foreign hackers that

617
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,760
they will seek to employ they're going

618
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,120
to shape public opinion to their

619
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,559
advantage through this information

620
00:20:58,559 --> 00:20:59,760
campaign

621
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,880
so they're not going to necessarily

622
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,159
attack the critical infrastructure

623
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,559
because unless it becomes necessary for

624
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,240
them to deny the use of infrastructure

625
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,600
by civilians

626
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,200
course of action number two is of course

627
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,200
the increased use of chinese-made drones

628
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,200
and surveillance capabilities

629
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,400
also conducting long-range strikes on

630
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,640
arms depots and facilities such as

631
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,720
airports it's really important because

632
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,880
they will use this for close air support

633
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,720
for units of the military and bashed in

634
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,559
military operations on urban terrain

635
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,840
mount

636
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,440
and then that third action is they're

637
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,360
going to attempt to move beyond

638
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,080
entry-level cyber operations and focus

639
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,640
on more network-based types of offensive

640
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,400
and defensive attacks

641
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,400
if they are successful at this i predict

642
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,400
that they will use that in conjunction

643
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,480
with a chemical

644
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,679
store in order to deny areas of

645
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,520
rebels so that they can fix them in

646
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,960
place and destroy them with these

647
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,360
chinese drones

648
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,440
and then of course syria

649
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,039
i've already mentioned them but needless

650
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,880
to say they certainly have the

651
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,799
capability from a very distinct

652
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,000
perspective

653
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,039
of developing bio weapons programs it's

654
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,480
interesting to note that they have a

655
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,960
significant capability not only for

656
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,280
ground-based attacks but certainly from

657
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,600
air delivery mechanisms and that is what

658
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,440
has happened in throughout syria

659
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,520
historically

660
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,840
what's interesting in 2020

661
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,600
they were responsible for a total of

662
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,520
three chemical attacks

663
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,559
targeting the civilian population

664
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,000
and then of course that happened again

665
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,400
in three days in 2017

666
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,919
what's interesting is that this was

667
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,240
delivered by a russian military aircraft

668
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,000
su-22

669
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,679
and it's interesting that the syrian air

670
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,360
force was responsible for delivering

671
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,679
these weaponized chemical agents it's

672
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,840
unfortunate because the dense civilian

673
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,159
population was the one that realized

674
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,039
this

675
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,200
kinetic attack from both a chemical

676
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,120
perspective as well as the incendiary

677
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,280
devices that were dropped on them

678
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,520
now what's really very disturbing is

679
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,600
that they being the syrian regime

680
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,799
possess between 600 and 1 000 metric

681
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,400
tons of nerve gas

682
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,120
so they are not afraid or unwilling to

683
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,960
unleash this kind of combined arms

684
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,799
capability they have done so

685
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,960
historically and have demonstrated that

686
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,120
their success in this area is something

687
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,280
that they believe will control the

688
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,520
rebels who seek to destabilize this

689
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,320
assad regime

690
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,960
and of course important part of this is

691
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,400
the damascus area of influence

692
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,200
which realized a mass casualty event i

693
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,039
don't mean to put up the child in

694
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,400
jeopardy there but it underscores the

695
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,400
necessity for understanding the military

696
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,520
resolve

697
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,520
of a regime that will use chemical

698
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,919
weapons on its own population

699
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,440
imagine if they were essentially

700
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,120
promoting the idea of moving to a

701
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,279
particular area of a

702
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,960
a town or a city

703
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,640
through disinformation campaigns and

704
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,080
then struck them

705
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,880
with both kinetic weapons bombs as well

706
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,480
as chemical weapons you can imagine that

707
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,080
it would have a devastating effect not

708
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,480
only on the civilian population but

709
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,919
certainly on the military fighters

710
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,200
attempting to destabilize the regime

711
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,279
some of the chemical intakes as you can

712
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,520
see from this map are numerous

713
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,799
to go through each one of these would

714
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,400
take eight hours but i do want you to

715
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,000
understand that they used a variety of

716
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,279
things from phosphorus munitions

717
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,960
sarin gas

718
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,120
chlorine types of gas

719
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,120
mustard gas and other unknown agents

720
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,880
more than likely vx gas on the

721
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,320
populations

722
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,000
certainly you've seen reports on this on

723
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,559
the internet international news

724
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,159
it is really disturbing to see that this

725
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,039
type of activity is taking place from a

726
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,559
regime a nation-state against the

727
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,880
civilian population

728
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,960
what is more unique about this is the

729
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,039
activity or the capability that syria is

730
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,919
developing is rather unique it's unique

731
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,279
in the region because they don't

732
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,440
necessarily have a reason to have this

733
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,240
much chemical biological weapons

734
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,640
capability they already have the support

735
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,400
of the russians certainly they can

736
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,080
deliver militarily from a kinetic

737
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,000
perspective these types of weapon

738
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,240
systems when they start to combine this

739
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,400
with cyber operations which are enabled

740
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,400
from an offensive and defensive

741
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,400
capability you might imagine that the

742
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,799
courses of action will look like this

743
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,200
number one they will continue to operate

744
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,640
operationalize civilian hacking cadre

745
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,880
as a direct fire weapon against targets

746
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,440
of civilian opportunity even going so

747
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,679
far as to attempt to destabilize and

748
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:24,720
destroy

749
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,880
cyber targets overseas

750
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,480
the any one of those that oppose the

751
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,799
assad regime and the vulnerable civilian

752
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,520
infrastructure will be the targets

753
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,520
if you are a country within the gcc that

754
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,640
is not an ally of perhaps the syrians

755
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,080
and you speak about this opal and you

756
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,919
can imagine that you will start to reap

757
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,240
some of the cyber enabled activities if

758
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,799
you're in closer proximity however then

759
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,640
course of action number two comes into

760
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,760
play

761
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,679
syria will start to rely more and more

762
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,520
on military electronic warfare

763
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,480
capabilities from the russian federation

764
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,960
including elector electronic warfare and

765
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,720
jamming types of systems from the

766
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,480
kranushka platform

767
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,240
which will enable the ground forces to

768
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,840
target rebel communications both

769
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,039
domestically

770
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,760
in a place and time of their choosing so

771
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,120
they can destroy them with kinetic

772
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,440
weapons that's the true form of kinetic

773
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,520
and cyber what's interesting is when

774
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,640
they start to

775
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,559
lace that together with nuclear chemical

776
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,799
and biological weapons you can imagine

777
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,240
that the devastating effect on those

778
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,640
rebel forces will be untenable

779
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,320
certainly the civilian population has

780
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,880
faced the wrath of this type of activity

781
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,120
and then course of action number three

782
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,120
as the continued global international

783
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,320
pressure on the assad regime starts to

784
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,640
put its pressure on them the assad

785
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,200
regime will start to turn to attacking

786
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,760
destructively opposing nations as i just

787
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,679
mentioned and attacks on infrastructure

788
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,520
and the civilian populations nearest to

789
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,039
them will be their targets of

790
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,320
opportunity

791
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,159
it is unfortunately something that is

792
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,120
quite serious in this part of the world

793
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,120
and then the islamic republic of iran of

794
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,200
course bottom line up front

795
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,880
they have developed active chemical

796
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,400
weapons programs

797
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,640
and during the iran-iraq war under the

798
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,559
facing the scrutiny of saddam hussein

799
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:07,760
for example

800
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,440
they felt

801
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,360
the effects of both sarin and mustard

802
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,919
gas during their own version of a middle

803
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,320
eastern trench warfare it's estimated

804
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,960
that in excess of 20 000

805
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,039
iranian soldiers paid them the price for

806
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,960
this during this eight year conflict

807
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,360
this is just unbelievable if you've ever

808
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,640
fought in battle or been on a

809
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,200
battlefield it's hard enough

810
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,039
without having to think about the impact

811
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,799
and effect of nuclear biological and

812
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,120
chemical weapons i can't begin to even

813
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,720
describe how horrifying that might

814
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,799
possibly be

815
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,399
and then of course the iranians have a

816
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,480
very developed cyber capability i've

817
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,880
spoken about this at conferences around

818
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,960
the world needless to say i will tell

819
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,720
you that they have a developing and

820
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,760
burgeoning

821
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,840
hacking community that if used by the

822
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,520
islamic guard

823
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,080
republican guard corps the igrc

824
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,760
it will have a devastating effect

825
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,279
combine that with their experiences

826
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,760
learned during the iraq iran war you can

827
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,360
imagine that that could have a very

828
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,360
destabilizing effect against enemies of

829
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,159
the

830
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,960
islamic republic of iran state

831
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,480
make no mistake ladies and gentlemen

832
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,880
they will turn and unleash that fury if

833
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,720
they feel that they are threatened you

834
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,120
must remember historically that they are

835
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,799
and still believe that they are the

836
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,200
grandest nation within the middle east

837
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,919
in my history and experience they used

838
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,240
to run the world before perhaps even the

839
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,640
chinese did so they want to maintain

840
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,240
and re-establish that leadership and

841
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,440
they have started to do that through

842
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,399
their hacking capability

843
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:37,039
the three most likely cyber warfare

844
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,039
courses of action of course

845
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,200
include that they will operationalize

846
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,760
their civilian hacking cadre as they

847
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,840
direct fire weapon against targets of

848
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,240
opportunity internationally starting

849
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,480
originally of course as we began this

850
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,159
presentation giving the moses group

851
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:53,840
hacking israel

852
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,440
not saying that the iranians did it but

853
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,120
that's the most likely adversary in this

854
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,440
particular case

855
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,000
the current regime is very much

856
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,440
looking for vulnerable civilian

857
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,200
infrastructures within the gcc and

858
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,520
globally certainly my country the united

859
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,080
states of america has faced not only

860
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,760
threats to health care

861
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,360
thus my involvement in the biohacking

862
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,679
village at defcon but also against

863
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,000
financial institutions a number of my

864
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,600
colleagues at some of the largest banks

865
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,600
in the united states have felt the wrath

866
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,000
of the iranian hackers already

867
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,679
course of action number two is their

868
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,440
nationalistic sense of pride that they

869
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,840
just talked about will indeed manifest

870
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,559
itself against known historical allies

871
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,000
in the region

872
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,840
and it will include a form of enduring

873
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,320
hacking campaigns directed against

874
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,880
specific critical infrastructures i just

875
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,960
mentioned the experience from hacking by

876
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,679
iran in on my country you can expect

877
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,039
that that will happen here in this

878
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,000
region

879
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,640
what remains to be seen however is if

880
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,880
the iranians hack health care banking

881
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,279
and nuclear energy development as a

882
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,120
response to their country being taken

883
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,279
down they will most certainly use a

884
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,520
chemical or a biological weapon to

885
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,159
destabilize the civilian population with

886
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:05,520
the end game

887
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,720
of achieving victory at all costs

888
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,240
course of action number three and i say

889
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,320
this with respect they will remain the

890
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,919
poster child country of malware

891
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,000
weaponization

892
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,919
and infections throughout the gcc

893
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,240
certainly with the beginning of stuxnet

894
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,720
in 2007 traditional governance

895
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,480
and other types of initiatives of the

896
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,360
nation states will continue to fall fail

897
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,480
which will cause

898
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,279
unending embarrassment and unfulfilled

899
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,679
rage by the leadership of iran if they

900
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,080
cannot realize that re-establishment is

901
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,520
the

902
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,279
basic powerful nation that they once

903
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:42,000
were

904
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,640
they will start to act out as a petulant

905
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,200
child it's a very curious developing

906
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,039
situation

907
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,399
and of course you can see from this

908
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,559
graphic that the develop of nuclear

909
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,399
weapons capabilities remain something

910
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,240
that they are indeed focused on not only

911
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,600
from a nation-state leadership

912
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,840
perspective but also from a military

913
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,320
perspective the two work hand in hand

914
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,000
in order to ensure that nations around

915
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,679
them realize that there is the

916
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:08,080
capability that is being developed to

917
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,080
unleash nuclear weapons in conjunction

918
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,039
with cyber warfare

919
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,799
and of course the weaponization of

920
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:17,200
malware as you can see on this chart is

921
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,559
very curious and it's a little bit

922
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,480
disturbing because the impact and effect

923
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,279
is direct against the gcc nations and of

924
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,760
course my country the u.s you'll notice

925
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,279
from stuxnet in 2007 through dooku

926
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,720
flame goss and batch wiper for example

927
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,559
while it started out from a military

928
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,440
denial of area operations with stuxnet

929
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,840
it has started to move from original

930
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,559
purpose of cyber physical destruction to

931
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,840
cyber espionage cyber

932
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,960
reconnaissance targets of opportunity

933
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,640
have of course included industrial

934
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,000
control systems computer systems

935
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,840
you can imagine the headlines are full

936
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,000
of these banks here in the middle east

937
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,840
and of course iranian oil infrastructure

938
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,879
whoops that was unfortunate

939
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,559
hit the wrong button during a live

940
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,799
presentation and all heck

941
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:10,000
bear with me i'm going to recover

942
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,080
almost to the end forgive me here

943
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,799
there we go whoops

944
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,159
yeah don't try this at home ladies and

945
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:19,840
gentlemen

946
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,679
gotta be cool under pressure i was

947
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:23,840
talking about weaponized malware it's

948
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,440
very important to understand that indeed

949
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,440
this has happened and has exploded

950
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,600
outside of the gcc region again forgive

951
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,679
me for that misstep fat fingers on a

952
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,039
keyboard no good during a live

953
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,240
presentation

954
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,360
and of course the nuclear

955
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,200
destabilization of iran is something

956
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,519
that they being the islamic republic do

957
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,679
not want to have happen

958
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,159
what's unique about iran's soft war

959
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,000
is that their probability of a cyber

960
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,039
attack impacting the physical world

961
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,279
has increased rapidly certainly my

962
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:54,000
mention of the moses hacks last week

963
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,679
against the israeli defense force and

964
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,600
the critical infrastructure of israel

965
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,279
bears true that this fact is absolutely

966
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,159
true about iran's soft war

967
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,080
they believe for example that cyber

968
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,640
warfare and the weapons such as malware

969
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,559
and i mentioned ransomless malware at

970
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,760
the beginning of this will indeed

971
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,760
deliver software written and designed by

972
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,039
hackers

973
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,960
which are really relatively inexpensive

974
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,559
anyone with a keyboard and a mouse

975
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,960
sitting anywhere within iran can unleash

976
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,799
that type of attack against a country of

977
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,840
their choosing

978
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,159
and of course their ability to conduct

979
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,000
cyber attacks on america's electric

980
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
power systems uh certainly goes without

981
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,679
without any sort of mention of

982
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:37,679
compunction here

983
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:38,960
and then of course from iran's

984
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,159
perspective

985
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:41,679
it's very important to understand what

986
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,679
they're developing when it comes to

987
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,360
defeating other countries in the region

988
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,360
and then i put this up to help you

989
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,200
understand from a asian perspective

990
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,720
specifically the people's republic of

991
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,600
china

992
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,519
they too have had their issues with

993
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:57,600
cyber weapons how does this tie to the

994
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,240
gcc i would suggest that you use it as

995
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,919
an exemplar

996
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,519
look at the way that the japanese and

997
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:04,960
the chinese forces fought each other

998
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,640
during world war ii

999
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,320
and you'll see the chemical weapons were

1000
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,639
used without abandon against civilian

1001
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,040
populations i would beg you to not let

1002
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,159
that happen within the gcc

1003
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,918
and of course within iran the

1004
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:19,440
inventories are down but that risk

1005
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,199
remains quite the same

1006
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:24,000
those weapons of mass destruction wmds

1007
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,440
as they're called

1008
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,800
have decreased but the size of those

1009
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,719
stockpiles for readily

1010
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,879
deployable military weaponization of the

1011
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:33,280
same still remain quite a serious

1012
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,440
concern for you within the gcc

1013
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,280
specifically biological weapons

1014
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,359
and then of course

1015
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,839
cyber warfare without

1016
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:45,599
a solution is nothing at all as you

1017
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:48,399
might imagine

1018
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,560
and then of course my conclusions for

1019
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,440
you

1020
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,079
regarding the combined arms use of cyber

1021
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,040
weapons

1022
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,040
and biochemical weapons includes the

1023
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,040
following conclusions

1024
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,119
militant gulf region countries pose the

1025
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,960
greatest threat to your countries here

1026
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,640
in the gcc

1027
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,520
the use of bio weapons militarily

1028
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,599
against civilian populations while of

1029
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:10,720
fact

1030
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,119
but my request and to know is that how

1031
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:14,640
long before this becomes a regional

1032
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,200
impact as nations become frustrated

1033
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,200
and destabilization is something they

1034
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,960
want to promote as a statecraft

1035
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,480
initiative

1036
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,160
terrorist activities are going to occur

1037
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,920
with emphasis on bioweapons this has

1038
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,599
occurred throughout the world

1039
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,440
you can imagine the terrorist activities

1040
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,720
using bio

1041
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,640
chemical and nuclear weapons will happen

1042
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,440
in the gcc i hope that's not the case

1043
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,720
and of course i've been accused of

1044
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,920
predicting things that happened and i

1045
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,760
hope that doesn't happen here

1046
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,760
the military use of bioweapons is in

1047
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,200
fact

1048
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,040
something that has occurred in the gulf

1049
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:45,920
region

1050
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,000
during wartime specifically during

1051
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,800
conflict if the country remains the

1052
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,440
region remains peaceful the likelihood

1053
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,640
of this actually occurring remains low

1054
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,359
gcc nation neighbors are more interested

1055
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:01,520
and focused on the use of

1056
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,040
military bioweapons that doesn't mean

1057
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,640
they're going to deploy them it just

1058
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,400
means that they need to prepare for

1059
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,880
success should they be unleashed

1060
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,400
number six there is a distinct

1061
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,359
correlation between nuclear biological

1062
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:15,520
and chemical weapons within militant

1063
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,720
regional nation states thank algeria

1064
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,119
thank libya think iran

1065
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:22,880
and certainly other countries that would

1066
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,880
have a desire and a reason to deploy

1067
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,200
those types of weapon systems

1068
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,040
with the departure of my country the

1069
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,079
united states from the gcc region

1070
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,680
unfortunately the increased use of

1071
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,520
bioweapons is probably going to take

1072
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,800
place

1073
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,680
terrorist activity will run unabated

1074
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,000
because they now see that there is no

1075
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,160
threat from the west to destabilize a

1076
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,240
terrorist network

1077
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,760
economic development by the people's

1078
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,000
republic of china is going to increase

1079
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,839
and the adaptation of these chinese

1080
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,200
manufactured

1081
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,440
red bio-weapons capabilities will

1082
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,960
increase for some of these nation states

1083
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,520
that pose a threat to the gcc

1084
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,040
cooperation communication and

1085
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,280
collaboration is necessary from a cyber

1086
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,400
information

1087
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,560
a military cyber operations perspective

1088
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,119
to defeat degrade and destroy the

1089
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,760
asymmetric bioweapons threats posed to

1090
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,160
all gcc nations

1091
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,240
to sum it up you've got a long road

1092
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,800
ahead of you but it can be accomplished

1093
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,200
that concludes my presentation today

1094
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,520
again this is how you get a hold of me i

1095
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,359
will be here at hack in the box in abu

1096
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,599
dhabi again thank you to the sponsors

1097
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,520

1098
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,520
you the united arab emirates and the

1099
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,200
monarchy for allowing me to speak on

1100
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,200
this sensitive subject thank you very
