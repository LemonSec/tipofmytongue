1
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,160
my right

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,519
your left is nina she is the executive

3
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,480
director of the biohacking village

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,880
she's a clinician with decades of

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,880
experience in the healthcare industry

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,800
and she's also a hacker

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,160
to her left your right is sharka

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,039
who is an open source social engineering

9
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,279
expert who does red teaming for a

10
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,040
variety of industries

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,200
and is also a hacker and a friend of

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,840
mine so my right your left

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,040
is yelena a physician's assistant and

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,680
clinician for over three decades today

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,960
we're going to be talking about

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,640
healthcare in crisis as you heard from

17
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,039
my opening line my first question to the

18
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,440
panelists is what do you think is the

19
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,559
largest issue facing clinicians today

20
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,480
from your perspective and experience

21
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,160
elena why don't you kick it off for us

22
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,199
please ma'am

23
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,800
so i just want to make a

24
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,760
small

25
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,720
i'm a children a pediatric nurse i'm not

26
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,280
physician assistant even i sometimes did

27
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,960
work like that

28
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,400
but in my opinion the most the biggest

29
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,840
issues is uh

30
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,360
communication and

31
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,880
understanding each other between

32
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,880
healthcare professionals and security

33
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,200
professionals so they can

34
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,200
understand

35
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,479
the needs of each other and they can

36
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,280
make things working good and working

37
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,400
better than that we have now if we get

38
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,200
that that we can make a lot of

39
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,119
much better security and much better

40
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,479
healthcare thank you elena sharka what

41
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,560
say you from your hacker perspective

42
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,840
tell us what you think is the greatest

43
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,840
challenge to healthcare in the 21st

44
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,799
century

45
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,680
well i mean i come from the operational

46
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,640
technology and ics space so for me what

47
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,960
i'm seeing the

48
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,960
actually the issues are

49
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,079
very similar to the ot and or ics space

50
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,000
so it's all the

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,959
legacy systems it's actually the the the

52
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,239
issues with um the technology

53
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,520
and specifics of these systems and the

54
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,520
lack of security

55
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,080
and how we are behind so i think that

56
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,920
something that we should work on

57
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,720
together when in these two fields in

58
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,920
terms of uh

59
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,920
characteristics and the blueprints of

60
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,760
how we are approaching the cyber

61
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,760
security thank you sharka and nina what

62
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,519
do you say you're a unique individual on

63
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:36,959
this panel i mean as the executive

64
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,720
director of the biohacking village

65
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,480
you've got that clinical experience

66
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,160
you've got that hacking you've just

67
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,840
heard from a clinician you've heard from

68
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,239
a hacker what do you believe is the

69
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:47,680
greatest threat to health care today in

70
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,360
the 21st century i think it's a

71
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,360
combination of both of those comments

72
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,560
it's that the healthcare industry has

73
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,640
basically been in a silo of its own and

74
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,720
it hasn't reached out to learn from the

75
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,040
other industries that it works with

76
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,400
so if we looked at ics or finance

77
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,360
or

78
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,200
how the legislature is working or not

79
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,800
working and started having better

80
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,879
communication with healthcare and with

81
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,200
the other industries and said

82
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,360
this is how we are performing how can we

83
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,480
perform better and then put that into

84
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,239
real

85
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,959
working ability that i think would be

86
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,480
super helpful because it would create a

87
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,680
very different dynamic in what is

88
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,440
currently happening because it would

89
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,400
create

90
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,720
more universal laws rules regulations

91
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,959
standard metrics and audits

92
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,480
excellent sharokina you said something

93
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,799
interesting that brings up a thought to

94
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,720
me you know what is the threat service i

95
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,080
mean obviously you're looking at

96
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,400
communication reports on devices

97
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,159
you mentioned something at the very

98
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,040
technical level uh from your perspective

99
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,720
further expanding on what you mentioned

100
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,720
as far as the

101
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,159
adversary that might be out there that

102
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,280
would want to target who do you think

103
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,799
that adversary is for health care and

104
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,560
how would they gain access to a health

105
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,840
care system it seems uh

106
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,599
difficult is it

107
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,760
i think that what we've seen i really

108
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,920
love talking to people here because

109
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,519
we've seen lots of people coming to our

110
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,519
booth where we are speaking to them

111
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,560
about different attack vectors but some

112
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,720
of them are as simple as

113
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,000
as we are uh showcasing on devices that

114
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,399
we bought here in the pharmacy uh it's

115
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,680
everything from uh ports uh a bluetooth

116
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,639
um the applications all the way to the

117
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,280
human side of things so it's the who are

118
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,759
the people that are most likely going to

119
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,919
use these devices so that it would be a

120
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,440
senior citizens that are not um

121
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,600
tech savvy or their

122
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,560
social

123
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,199
media literacy is not high so whatever

124
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,919
they are reading online it might not be

125
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,560
correct so the different attack vectors

126
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,479
that we've been talking about are not

127
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,759
exactly that hard or are as we're saying

128
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,199
advanced

129
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,560
wow and you bring up some interesting

130
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,080
points i mean you mentioned a lot of

131
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,080
thread vectors as well

132
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,759
elena from your perspective i'm hearing

133
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,440
a lot of

134
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,400
patient data a lot of privacy issues and

135
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,919
what shark had just said and it kind of

136
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,919
makes my blood boil but i'm the

137
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,440
moderator so i'm not going to comment

138
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,560
what do you think about this from a

139
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,960
clinician perspective is data privacy

140
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,280
really that important from a hacker

141
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,759
perspective given you're a clinician

142
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,039
um i think that the protection of that

143
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,440
data in healthcare are really important

144
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,600
because we talk about

145
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,800
information about someone privately and

146
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,240
they need to

147
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,240
know that that everything what they say

148
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,440
to clinician to nurse or doctor is a

149
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,600
safe and is

150
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,400
not going everywhere else

151
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,719
and if we uh with that we build trust

152
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,440
and if they

153
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,919
if we lose trust we cannot work so the

154
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,919
protection of data in the healthcare

155
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,600
from

156
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,520
perspective of patient but also from

157
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,280
clinician is very important to say

158
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,319
[Music]

159
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,160
your experience i mean what i'm hearing

160
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,160
is that you've got a porous environment

161
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,240
in the clinical world that someone of

162
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,160
your skill and experience could easily

163
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,319
take advantage of and why would you do

164
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,479
that

165
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,240
the classic question of who wants to

166
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,759
hurt a patient because the answer is

167
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,120
really nobody um

168
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
i premise it with this when i go in to

169
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,720
do work to do things i don't look at it

170
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,000
as

171
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,840
what is saving life or what isn't i look

172
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,600
at everything as a machine everything is

173
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,960
just sending me data everything is

174
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,639
sending me some sort of modified

175
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,759
information

176
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,080
um

177
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,280
to

178
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,400
to have the

179
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,080
the interactive conversation of the data

180
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,440
and the pushing of the i want to go back

181
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,360
to what charcot was saying before please

182
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,080
um and i want to uh i want to understand

183
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,120
that i want to talk conversation

184
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,319
so

185
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,319
so we were talking about the

186
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,199
the

187
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,960
you were talking about ics

188
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,560
but to counter you

189
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,199
um healthcare does work in the silo the

190
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,199
problem is that it works in a silo

191
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,400
because if you think about how

192
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,639
healthcare is it uses water it uses

193
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,639
electricity it uses the

194
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,240
air pressure situation right we need

195
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,960
sterility and other things like this so

196
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,520
the attack vector is not just the silo

197
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,199
of healthcare it's the

198
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,599
the whole range of everything you hit

199
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,599
one you can get you know nina it's

200
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:24,880
interesting you should say that and

201
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,319
we'll get to hearing a second shark and

202
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,400
i can see you levitating elena

203
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,400
critical infrastructure i mean there are

204
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,080
16 areas of critical infrastructure in

205
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,720
the u.s yeah the uk has 10 australia has

206
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,960
12. i mean healthcare is not really

207
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,280
regarded as a critical infrastructure is

208
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:39,919
it

209
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,280
what i'm hearing here you're telling me

210
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,080
it's a silo so help demystify that so it

211
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,479
is in the us it is the problem with that

212
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,440
situation is that pharma is not bio is

213
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,440
not so you're missing a lot of the

214
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,000
components to make healthcare medical

215
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,039
whole

216
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,599
but isn't it about patient safety though

217
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:58,639
yes

218
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:59,440
but

219
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,879
what part of those are not part of

220
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,680
patient safety if pharma is manipulated

221
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,520
in any sort of way creates a patient

222
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,360
issue if agriculture

223
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,879
as we saw during the pandemic foods

224
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,280
started becoming scarce that's a problem

225
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,160
agriculture is part of the

226
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,080
bigger infrastructure and sharka you

227
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,199
were going to say something you were

228
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,879
levitating as well this is exciting i'm

229
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,680
ready to go no i really no i i really

230
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,840
liked your question from before yes that

231
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,599
was who would attack these devices and i

232
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,440
got that question from the attendees

233
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,520
here a lot because they they hear me

234
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,839
speak and they're like who is crazy

235
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,399
enough who would want to attack this

236
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,679
and

237
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,760
same thing no one that's what would you

238
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,279
think but let's look at the the

239
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,839
beginning of the pandemic where even the

240
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,080
cyber gangs they were saying we will not

241
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,080
attack with ransomware your your

242
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,080
hospitals and if it's gonna happen we're

243
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,000
gonna give you decryption keys that

244
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,760
lasted about three months

245
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,000
we all know how it how they were

246
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,519
attacking and how they are attacking

247
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,200
hospitals and

248
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,200
ics and critical rational health well

249
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,320
sure

250
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,000
hold on one second we'll get to you

251
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,040
later

252
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,920
so

253
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,920
what are the motivations for somebody to

254
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,279
look for

255
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,519
vulnerabilities in these these connected

256
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,959
environments what are the motivations of

257
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,640
a hacker

258
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,320
are you talking a hacker or a cyber

259
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,839
criminal

260
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,279
or researcher

261
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,680
or researcher because another question i

262
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,519
got there are lots of people who are ho

263
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,680
so what happened if i find a

264
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,080
vulnerability in these devices

265
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,760
that's where we coming is biohacking

266
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,839
village we help with a

267
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,320
coordinated vulnerability disclosure

268
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,800
as a malicious attacker or a cyber

269
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,519
criminal as i mentioned the cyber gangs

270
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,000
unfortunately it's money it's because

271
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,600
it's something that needs to be up and

272
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,760
running so unfortunately they will have

273
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,440
to pay

274
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,800
excellent elena you were gonna say

275
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,120
something please so what's the clinician

276
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,680
in you saying the thing is that a lot of

277
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,000
people think about uh hacker

278
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,720
cyber criminal but the cyber criminal is

279
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,279
in at this moment just part of bigger

280
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,279
so you have criminals everyone in the

281
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,680
world and they want to attack and they

282
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,680
will use from many different reasons to

283
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,320
attack hospital or one someone one in a

284
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,040
hospital and then

285
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,320
find the reason to do another things too

286
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,240
they want to get data so they will

287
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,320
attack hospital not to kill someone but

288
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,640
to get data because at the medical

289
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,720
record everyone is thinking about

290
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,519
medical records and medical data but you

291
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,279
have every

292
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,200
all data of yourself your name your

293
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,240
birth where you're leaving your

294
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,120
account number everything social number

295
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,959
number so you can

296
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,040
get also the data

297
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,720
and in that attack to get data of the

298
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,920
professionals or the the patient

299
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,399
you can damage another thing so the the

300
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,800
attack and the device can be like

301
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,480
cultural damage

302
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,839
so they uh

303
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,440
then you can damage

304
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,040
patient without

305
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,640
intention to do it because you want

306
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,800
something else

307
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,440
that's so big issue yes so let's pause

308
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,880
you there for a second

309
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,800
it's interesting i i want you ladies to

310
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,160
take the gloves off because i'm feeling

311
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,440
like you're just a little bit too milk

312
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,959
toast about this

313
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,480
i'm sensing that you've got a little bit

314
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,079
more you started to talk about elena

315
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,519
which is good you know what is the

316
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,440
impact of the patient let's hear from

317
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,519
nina in terms of from a clinical

318
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,120
perspective all right

319
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,720
you know let's let's get right down to

320
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,160
brass

321
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,160
yeah i'm going back to her comment from

322
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,279
earlier because that's where this is

323
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,760
going to start you were talking about

324
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,440
how um

325
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,120
something about patients and an older

326
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,640
generation and i don't necessarily think

327
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,399
that's true because

328
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,720
everyone is a patient regardless right

329
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,640
as soon as you're born you have an emr

330
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,079
record electronic medical record you

331
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,720
have a number fingers are in there

332
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,440
we are bypassing a learning curve

333
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,160
for no real reason we have different

334
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,000
generations that we are building for and

335
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,920
into and we're like

336
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,120
you know what a smartphone is you know

337
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,320
how to use a smartphone you can use

338
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,360
everything else and that is not

339
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,760
necessarily true as we know

340
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,720
um

341
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,440
so so taking that into consideration not

342
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,680
that we need dumb devices but we need to

343
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,720
make it easier for people to to tangibly

344
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,639
hold on to the items to make use of the

345
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,399
items to do the things that they need to

346
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,200
do

347
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,279
with the trust that they are investing

348
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,040
in these devices

349
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,200
and the humans behind it

350
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,959
well nina when i hear you say make it

351
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,720
easier for the patients

352
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,639
uh naturally you're making it easier for

353
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,320
someone with sharpest skill set and

354
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,920
experience so how do you get that

355
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,800
delicate balance sharper

356
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,200
again i'm ready i might

357
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,639
i would not necessarily easier i would

358
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,560
say that the technology that we are

359
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,639
giving them and the applications not

360
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,399
only should be easier but it should be

361
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,560
built with security in mind

362
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,200
by default so whatever they are using

363
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,079
it's already secure and easy for them to

364
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:54,959
use

365
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,800
i think that's not always the case ease

366
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,120
of use does not negate security

367
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,079
wow interesting so elena

368
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,839
in your experience with clinical what

369
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,440
i'm hearing from these ladies is that

370
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,800
every device that comes into a

371
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,800
healthcare environment is insecure by

372
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,639
design uh something like that but also

373
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,639
but oh no

374
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,279
gloves of by the thing even even they

375
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,440
are also secure then you come at the

376
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,839
hospital they are not like what they

377
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,880
hear in abu dhabi then they have

378
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,120
everything on their own network so

379
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,320
that should not be a problem i mean

380
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,600
everything in my home is connected on

381
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,519
one network i got use the same password

382
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,639
isn't that what they do in a healthcare

383
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:33,920
environment i mean nina you're about

384
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,160
ready to explode let's talk let's talk

385
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,360
about your house

386
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,040
um

387
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,800
what kind of what kind of refrigerator

388
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,040
do you have let's say samsung what kind

389
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,480
of stove do you have i don't know who

390
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,160
makes stove ge all these other things

391
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,440
but they're all on your network because

392
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,040
they're smart now so you have to

393
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,079
integrate all of these different

394
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,079
security parameters on the same network

395
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,720
which is the same premise as a hospital

396
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,880
and they communicate with each other

397
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,720
i don't i don't have anything smart i i

398
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,440
had a i saw presentation from two guys

399
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,079
from israel they came and they did use

400
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,040
some

401
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,079
cooling machine from the

402
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,720
drink tanks at the hospital and using

403
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,399
that they did came in the system of the

404
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,240
hospital so that's

405
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,040
really crazy that you think you have

406
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,279
secure a device like monitors of

407
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,279
respirators or mri

408
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,519
and then because one thing is on the

409
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,519
same network you destroy some another

410
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,480
thing and that's that's the thing what

411
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,360
we need to be also aware

412
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,199
yeah that's a unique perspective elena

413
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,120
you know taking off what nina said in

414
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,920
terms of equating with the home network

415
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,519
now when you look at it from shark's

416
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,519
perspective you see it all on one

417
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,880
network does that mean that it's a

418
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,600
threat surface that is a you know porous

419
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,600
and ready for compromise i mean i'm i'm

420
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,720
feeling like i shouldn't go to a

421
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,800
hospital perhaps you're making my blood

422
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,920
boil

423
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,040
am i oh my gosh obviously flat surface

424
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,199
is the basic of it's a it's a flat

425
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,240
network i can do anything so it comes

426
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,120
again i come from ot security

427
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,880
compartmentalize segmentation that is

428
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,959
part well one of the many steps that you

429
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,680
can do to protect it but that requires

430
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,000
understanding asean assess whatever you

431
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,560
have on the network okay do i have

432
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,880
machines that are not connected perhaps

433
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,959
put them in one segment of your networks

434
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,440
then you have something else and that

435
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,560
that

436
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,480
requires the knowledge yeah but you're

437
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,320
hitting on the juxtaposition of

438
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,440
confusion

439
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,560
because she is a healthcare professional

440
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,240
you are a hacker

441
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,120
and she has information technology staff

442
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,120
that are through clinical procurement

443
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,040
bringing these devices in

444
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,959
because they need to to serve patients

445
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,880
that's a purpose for a hospital but

446
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,000
you're telling me that there are

447
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,399
actually parameters for good

448
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,720
science regarding the cyber security of

449
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,399
the hospital and this is possible to

450
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,800
coexist

451
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,000
it's not for her to do the segmentation

452
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,880
it's the id stuff that should be trained

453
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,680
how to do the architecture how do you

454
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,320
apply all these security controls she

455
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,360
should be

456
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,480
trained on awareness that how to use

457
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,880
these devices what is a secure way we

458
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,720
know don't click on this don't click on

459
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,040
that this this this works like this this

460
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,120
is wireless what are the what are the

461
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,480
threats and i hear nina

462
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,240
that's impressive because i heard you

463
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,519
use a key word awareness now nina isn't

464
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,199
that the purpose for the biohacking

465
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,360
village i mean isn't defcon to bring

466
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,480
together clinicians like elena hackers

467
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,880
like sharka and come to a common ground

468
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,480
i mean who's missing in that equation

469
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,600
your segways are amazing yes that is the

470
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,600
purpose of the biohacking village do you

471
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,959
want me to talk about it do you want to

472
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,639
talk about it i think you better brief

473
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,320
us young lady okay

474
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,120
so

475
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,519
this is a seven year village at defcon

476
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,800
we have grown it to nine to nine five

477
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,959
different labs we have a speaker lab

478
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,560
people come in talking about the new

479
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,799
emerging technologies we have a catalyst

480
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,480
lab people come and do the hands-on

481
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,280
workshops tabletop exercises which bill

482
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,359
runs they are very machiavellian we go

483
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,839
to failure because too often

484
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,679
people are afraid of what the outcomes

485
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:16,559
will be

486
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,799
and we make sure that that you feel the

487
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,400
things that you need to feel

488
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,319
um we have captured the flag which

489
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,039
sharker runs and it's starting from how

490
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,559
to learn how to google

491
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,720
all the way into our our own version of

492
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,160
the dark net

493
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,720
um and then the last one is the medical

494
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,200
device lab where we have medical devices

495
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,360
reported vulnerability disclosures and

496
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,799
the medical device manufacturers are

497
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,720
there on hand to have those reported so

498
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,480
nina what i'm hearing is an industry

499
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,720
education now i've been with you for

500
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,400
four years at the village yes and it

501
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,160
seems sometimes like it's an automatic

502
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,799
reset for not only the manufacturers the

503
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,960
healthcare delivery organizations the

504
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,120
independent security research world why

505
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,120
is there not a continuity of operations

506
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,200
in space clinically why isn't that

507
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,640
taking place

508
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,880
rising taking place what education in

509
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,720
the biohacking village

510
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,280
do you go every year elena

511
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,679
i'm from europe please

512
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,520
i did i went three times i think

513
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,679
something like that and i'm following if

514
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,360
i'm not there i'm following what is

515
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,400
going on and so you find value in it

516
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,559
yes but you

517
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,200
cannot uh expect from every healthcare

518
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,520
workers to have some passion about

519
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,960
security and

520
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,840
to

521
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,640
like

522
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,360
technology because usually healthcare

523
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,760
people don't like technology a lot right

524
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,520
right because they choose working with

525
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,679
people not with machines

526
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,160
but we need to to understand each other

527
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,919
that is what i i told

528
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,000
when security people or some people

529
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,640
comment when you i can when i do this i

530
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,640
can do that by you whatever and they're

531
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,600
like sure and they're going away and

532
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,520
they don't trust them because you have

533
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,280
also innovation that they are coming and

534
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,679
telling interests i will do that for you

535
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,280
so elena when you look at somebody and

536
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,720
you meet someone like sharka i mean

537
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,320
what's your automatic reaction is it a

538
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,400
visceral hatred or do you want to learn

539
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,080
no no no no no no tell us

540
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,880
[Music]

541
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,559
security people i'm all the time

542
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,799
interesting and can you do that and i'm

543
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,960
happy when they find out that they don't

544
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,120
know exactly what they can do

545
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,720
because that will damage a lot of

546
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,520
patients but i like to know but a lot of

547
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,559
people uh healthcare people when they

548
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,640
talk and talk with security people they

549
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,320
talk a lot of they hear a lot of

550
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,520
technical

551
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,200
sound and they are like

552
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,919
what and they expect they must know all

553
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,320
of those things to understand and to

554
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,640
protect to be safe well what hearing

555
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,720
then is you're talking past each other

556
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,240
because if i were to ask sharka the same

557
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,160
question when you meet a clinician who

558
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,360
doesn't understand what you're saying

559
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,679
what do you say to them

560
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,000
it's not just about doing awareness you

561
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,280
need to do uh i'm i'm telling always

562
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,360
wherever i go it doesn't

563
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,080
it's not just healthcare you need to

564
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,080
make the awareness

565
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,280
fit to the people so it relates to them

566
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,600
and i find this like a click-through

567
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,440
cyber security cl

568
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,240
course there you go uh next next next

569
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,080
next take you're done horrible

570
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,400
what i want to say we need to talk each

571
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,120
other yeah and uh the security people

572
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,400
needs to know what we need for a work

573
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,440
and we need to know uh that's something

574
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,960
what is not safe and to understand beat

575
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,280
not go deep technology but understand

576
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,520
that it's something is not safe and it

577
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,880
can damage my patient and myself too

578
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,760
so

579
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,000
when you start to talk like what are you

580
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,080
doing what are you needing and then when

581
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,720
we talk and you show me but look i can

582
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,559
come here and i can

583
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,840
change some data some information

584
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,720
then

585
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,720
then i understand and i'm like oh i

586
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,799
don't want

587
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,880
someone to change information because

588
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,280
that information are really important to

589
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,400
make the agnostic or to make uh elena

590
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,080
you're frightening me i in fact i don't

591
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,360
go to the doctor i'm never going to go

592
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,440
to a hospital again you know what can

593
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,799
you weigh in on this because i mean i

594
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,640
need to be brought down so many things

595
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,360
you've kept me out so now i'm here

596
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,360
the one industry that is based on trust

597
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,280
is healthcare right

598
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,200
so you have to walk in and have that

599
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,320
trusting relationship with your

600
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,760
physician but you also have to trust

601
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,039
that they know what they're doing and

602
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,960
the conversation is open and that

603
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,760
whatever um reaction to your diagnosis

604
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,799
that they're going to give you that they

605
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,240
know the background of it well enough

606
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,120
that they're not going to put you in a

607
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,400
place of danger because they have a

608
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,640
headache oh decided that they are going

609
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,520
to do no harm right so going back to a

610
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,080
comment you said um we are when it comes

611
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,840
to the devices and the the situation

612
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,360
that all of the hospitals live in the

613
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,159
ambulatory it's a situation of adding

614
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,960
complexity to already convoluted you are

615
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,640
adding you have the legacy devices

616
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,559
because they cost too much to replace

617
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,080
um or the code is just there but you

618
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,520
need it to work and then you're adding

619
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,600
in all of these cool new things that are

620
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,559
already secure privacy risk or averted

621
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,000
things like that but we're not talking

622
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,600
about the contracts

623
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,720
how to do upgrades updates

624
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,640
figuring out um what how do these things

625
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,600
parallel the conversation i did a lot of

626
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,480
medical stuff before i did the hospital

627
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,360
stuff

628
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,960
i can have a conversation with you i can

629
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,320
tell you what a virus is i can tell you

630
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,159
molecular energy i understand all of

631
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,080
that when i talk to doctors the

632
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,760
conversation is much smoother because i

633
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,600
can go from whatever area you need me to

634
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,520
to make it easy and we don't do that

635
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,320
generically in security we do not make

636
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,720
it a simple conversation okay that's

637
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,320
interesting so you're not talking about

638
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,240
simplicity i'm going to ask sharka this

639
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,720
question so if you you're an independent

640
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,720
secure researcher hacker and you find a

641
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,600
device on ebay for example that you know

642
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,600
is in a clinical environment represented

643
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,760
or operated by elena or nina in her

644
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,360
experience what do you do with that i

645
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,240
mean what do you do if you find

646
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,919
vulnerabilities you just go out on

647
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,440
twitter sphere and

648
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,760
meta and say hey look what i found what

649
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,400
do you do i go to biohacking village

650
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,360
okay

651
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,440
and then tell us what happens next

652
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,360
obviously because we also help with a

653
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,280
coordinated vulnerable disclosure for

654
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,840
example during defcon we have medical

655
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,080
device makers and their devices because

656
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,640
they trust us and we have our hacker

657
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,679
oath

658
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,320
that our researchers are signing when

659
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,159
they are doing this research for us

660
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,480
during the def con and they're finding

661
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,440
that oath if they do find something

662
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,799
if they find a vulnerability what do you

663
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,039
what do you ladies do do you say hey go

664
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,880
over there and yell it out loud or what

665
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,400
how do you control that information flow

666
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,760
i think that would scare patients more

667
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,280
than anything

668
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,039
that to me okay

669
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,559
so when we were online this year um

670
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,679
they had to click on the hacker hacker

671
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,440
people credit both for hackers read it

672
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,279
make sure that they agreed and by

673
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,120
sending an email over to jay who runs

674
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,480
the medical device lab it was their

675
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,159
agreement that they were going to adhere

676
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,840
by it then they got a different ip

677
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,120
address so that they could ping into the

678
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,720
mango device that we had set up for the

679
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,799
devices

680
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,880
by that point if they had found anything

681
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,880
they were they had to adhere to we will

682
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,480
discuss it with whoever the manufacturer

683
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,320
is so we had separate channels set up

684
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,919
they would say i found something and go

685
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,440
into a private channel to have that

686
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,679
discussion about whatever that was and

687
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,159
the manufacturer took ownership of it so

688
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,400
that they could work through it with the

689
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,000
hacker i'm hearing this i'm going to

690
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,679
have to apologize if you have a

691
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,200
vulnerability in a medical device

692
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,720
wouldn't you want the clinical world and

693
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,159
the patients to know about it so they

694
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,039
wouldn't use that multiple device

695
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,559
i mean it sounds like there's a lot of

696
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,240
shadow games going on here what tell us

697
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,159
about how this actually works that's a

698
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,440
great question

699
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,200
here's the problem what if some of those

700
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,279
things are life-saving and they're

701
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,360
already in a person because

702
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,960
because of pacemakers or insulin

703
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,640
machines right or

704
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,480
in a critical care situation

705
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,559
um i believe there's a 30 day grace

706
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,720
period for when you a 90 day sorry so

707
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,080
when you tell them

708
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,080
the manufacturer till they have to fix

709
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,240
it and be very open about what happened

710
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,679
so you're giving that grace period so

711
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,600
that people aren't actively attacking

712
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,159
the device well who's holding these rig

713
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,240
you know they i almost spit it out

714
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,320
the answer i mean who's who's holding

715
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,159
the medical device manufacturers

716
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,360
accountable

717
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,279
is it the patients is it the care

718
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,960
delivery organizations is it the

719
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,279
biohacking village who keeps them in

720
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,559
check

721
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:21,520
no pun intended chart

722
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,400
you're asking me no no

723
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,440
um

724
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,960
so

725
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,520
there are 23 entities that run

726
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,080
medical devices in the united states

727
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,240
yet another convoluted situation that's

728
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,760
just the united states and then all the

729
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,720
other countries have their own

730
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,240
situations happening

731
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,440
so

732
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,760
there's a lot of lawsuits regulations

733
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,279
that happen the fda is who's the fda for

734
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,000
their

735
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,039
foreign administration um under hhs

736
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,480
health and hospital admission health and

737
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,400
human services oh that's what i said

738
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,760
and

739
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,760
they run all of the medical devices they

740
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,679
make the regulations for it they control

741
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,760
how that situation goes

742
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,440
interesting so they're actually able to

743
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,520
hold these manufacturers accountable if

744
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,919
sharka or one of her tribe discover

745
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,120
vulnerability is that correct is that

746
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,400
what i'm hearing

747
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,559
so it works uh perfectly so elena you

748
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,320
hear this and you've got the hacking

749
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,840
world you've got the biohacking village

750
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,120
you're a clinician you hear about a

751
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,960
vulnerability in a device that you're

752
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,559
using to save patients do you hear about

753
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,480
it instantaneously or what's the what's

754
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,960
the communication uh issue here it

755
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,600
sounds like it's a perfect world

756
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,120
which communication you mean you tell me

757
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,520
i don't have to tell it

758
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,080
the problem is that the clinicians and

759
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,600
the healthcare professionals have no

760
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,679
idea about it interesting are you

761
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,159
hearing this circle oh my god no i can't

762
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,159
sorry the the usual healthcare

763
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,400
professionals have no idea because when

764
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,640
i talk with my police right

765
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,600
what

766
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,440
when they say that to them

767
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,200
what do you mean

768
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,320
whatever

769
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,679
it doesn't because they don't know

770
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:56,880
technology

771
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,120
and uh you can explain that as someone

772
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,360
control device and they are like it's

773
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,600
not possible because a lot of healthcare

774
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,240
professionals are aware and i think for

775
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,960
sure that we have the best security and

776
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,840
hospitals because you should have a best

777
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,919
security and a hospital elena let me

778
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,520
stop you when you say security what do

779
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,120
you mean do you mean cyber do you mean

780
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,120
physical do you mean patient everything

781
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,520
everything interesting because when we

782
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,440
talk about digital about

783
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,520
cyber security they think that when we

784
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,720
get device that device is good first for

785
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,279
a patient and then

786
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,440
that is safe that no one can attack that

787
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,840
we can trust that device well it's

788
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,039
interesting you should say that because

789
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,120
nina just brought up the regulatory

790
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,360
bodies in the united states and correct

791
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,679
me if i'm wrong and again if a medical

792
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,440
device manufacturer brings something for

793
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,960
approval for use in a clinical

794
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,279
environment has it not passed the muster

795
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,840
of the fda shouldn't it be ready good to

796
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,880
go

797
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,720
because if your answer is no i'm never

798
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,399
going to a hospital help me understand

799
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,600
this it passes in a silo it it passes in

800
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,960
a silo

801
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,960
really so

802
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,360
it's not entirely trusted against

803
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,679
someone like sharka with her experience

804
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,760
it's just meant for a clinical world

805
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,320
surprise superhero is trusted because

806
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,159
she will not

807
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,480
of course not her personally but her

808
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,919
tribe

809
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,480
i mean the i believe the opinion is

810
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,399
changing into how

811
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:25,760
the world sees hackers you still need to

812
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,159
whenever i say i'm a hacker they're like

813
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,880
you say ethical one another bad one

814
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,960
that's i think that's where we should

815
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,279
differentiate between a cyber criminal

816
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,840
and the hacker uh but i think what you

817
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,880
were saying about the fact if a

818
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,000
clinician finds vulnerability i wonder

819
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,039
it would be a good tabletop exercise

820
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,559
which is another thing that we are doing

821
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,520
in prior to english but um that our red

822
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,640
dragon is is uh taken care of but

823
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,880
i would say if someone comes to doctor

824
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,360
and says i believe this is there is a

825
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,520
security issue with this he would be

826
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,279
saying that's too bad i don't think that

827
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,679
there is they know how to report these

828
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,039
issues and that's part of

829
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,720
well it's interesting you should say

830
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,200
that sharka from a hacker perspective

831
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,200
because i also heard you use the term

832
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,039
coordinated vulnerability disclosure

833
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,799
nina helped distill us down i mean

834
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,880
you've got hackers who are helping from

835
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,399
a white hat perspective but they're

836
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:25,440
viewed as being at the adversary and the

837
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,440
adversary is viewed

838
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,320
by what perspective clinicians or is it

839
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,000
healthcare delivery organizations i mean

840
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,440
who is it who am i missing in this

841
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,440
equation so we jumped i just thought

842
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,720
about all of our conversations for the

843
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,320
last half hour we jumped

844
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,799
so let's start from a basic premise

845
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,960
about 20 years ago

846
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,880
emrs did not exist

847
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,200
it was an emr right electronic medical

848
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,799
record they were brand new nobody was

849
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,240
doing anything with them

850
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,559
and then they started being created per

851
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,640
service per specialty so cardiology had

852
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,440
one

853
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,960
endocrinology

854
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,960
obstetrics things like this and then

855
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,480
they started to come together and

856
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,000
because they were coming together from

857
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,440
different areas they were just stitched

858
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,360
together with bubble gum and tape hoping

859
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,440
that it would work and then the um

860
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,360
there's a technical clinical term bubble

861
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,159
gum and tape yes it is in my day it was

862
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,360
i'm old um and then layering on that the

863
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,200
apis that were created were we're just

864
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,480
like we just need the information and

865
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,399
what again is an api sorry that's all

866
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:23,520
right access point interface so

867
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,799
the

868
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,159
the information was flowing through from

869
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,480
one to the other and we were like it

870
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,720
works we did our job we are amazing

871
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,320
thank you you're welcome

872
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,520
awesome

873
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,080
and then the laws started coming down

874
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,520
because people realized things needed to

875
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,520
be protected and when the laws came down

876
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,039
there was money that was given to the

877
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,600
people to start fixing the things but it

878
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,600
had already been implemented

879
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,360
so now people were backtracking and

880
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,559
people were trying to figure out what

881
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,480
was going on security was not

882
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,640
progressing with healthcare it did it

883
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,760
around it so

884
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,640
healthcare is still very convoluted

885
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,799
um finance had their

886
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,640
crisis i don't remember what year was

887
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,200
maybe twenty 2008

888
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,360
um and they had to conform right they

889
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,960
had to change everything because it was

890
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,840
not sustainable this is our crisis

891
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,679
i've had the same conversation for about

892
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,519
seven years with people we need to fix

893
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:18,559
this this isn't working how can we help

894
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,480
and now we're here well and it's

895
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,919
interesting you should mention how can

896
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:23,919
we help how can we fix it i mean i'll

897
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:25,440
have to turn to shark and ask her and

898
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,360
then i'll come to you elena how from a

899
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,760
engineering a cyber perspective can we

900
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,919
help fix this dilemma and i'll you know

901
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:33,679
i mean how would you advise a hospital

902
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,120
how would you advise a medical device

903
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,200
manufacturer how to come to common

904
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,640
ground to you know solve these

905
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,399
situations and statement from the

906
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:41,840
elena's perspective is always going to

907
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,440
be the patient i hope i'm never one but

908
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,880
that would seem to be the logical

909
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,039
premise that we're operating from so

910
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,480
help us out here

911
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,320
i believe it's also partially the fact

912
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,799
that for us because we're

913
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,039
coming from cyber security we're always

914
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,360
thinking about security but we need to

915
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,120
think about the fact that when we are

916
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,640
talking about hospitals and healthcare

917
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,919
it's a safety

918
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,080
so the the the focus becomes a little

919
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,840
bit different but i what i think that

920
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,880
would really help and i'm seeing it um

921
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,200
in ot you have this automation what is

922
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,880
ot again for those of us operational

923
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,960
technology thank you uh or industrial

924
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,200
control systems we have this automation

925
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,799
period or um pyramid sorry uh and that

926
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:24,399
is uh or purdue model so that tells you

927
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,559
it's a little bit outdated it's from 90s

928
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:28,720
we are talking about changing it but it

929
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,480
sort of tells you how you should be

930
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,360
applying a different security controls

931
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,679
and i think we should do something like

932
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,480
this blueprint or architecture how we

933
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,200
should apply these controls and

934
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,640
healthcare too

935
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,320
okay so i'm hearing you say that we

936
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,720
should apply industry controls from

937
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,240
industrial control systems and

938
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,240
operational technology to the medical

939
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,240
field elena how does that resonate with

940
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,960
you i mean is a is a process logic

941
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,440
controller for a nuclear plant the same

942
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,919
as an mri machine in some regard or an

943
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,320
infusion pump i mean is it i really

944
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,159
don't want to be a patient hearing this

945
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:05,440
i'm going to run out here with my hair

946
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,200
on fire with a little i have left now

947
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,039
you can be happy today

948
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,880
most of criminals have no idea what they

949
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,799
can do and what they should do so tell

950
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:15,200
us exactly no i wouldn't

951
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,919
but what i what i just don't listen to

952
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:19,200
those of

953
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,799
those two girls and

954
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,840
they are not talking so high technical

955
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,360
uh language

956
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,200
i was like if i'm healthcare

957
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,519
professional i will be lost and i will

958
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,399
be like what they are talking about even

959
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:33,600
you mentioned

960
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,399
what is that and everybody

961
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,880
really so the thing is that healthcare

962
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,159
professionals

963
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:41,279
lose them

964
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,919
well so what would you recommend as a

965
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,240
course of action how to solve this i

966
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,919
mean do you want more education from a

967
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,919
cyber professional you want to learn how

968
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,519
to hack tell me where what was your

969
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:54,240
level that's my my level and my

970
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,399
interesting is something else i would

971
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,320
like if i have a time but i don't have

972
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,799
it i would like to learn also technical

973
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,240
kind of things

974
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,159
but uh you would know the exception in

975
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:07,120
your field then yes oh yes wow few

976
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,119
people that i know that there are also

977
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,918
doctors or nurses that are included in a

978
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:14,320
security field and some of them

979
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,480
can also hack and that's wonderful to

980
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,359
see

981
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,280
but the thing is with and i think i must

982
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,839
think like uh someone from healthcare

983
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,320
perspective the thing is that my

984
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,320
colleagues need to be aware that it

985
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,480
isn't safe

986
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,280
to be to know that we working with the

987
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,520
things that are uh

988
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,520
dangerous and can be dangerous for a

989
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,679
patient when people when healthcare

990
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,239
professionals realize it you will get

991
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:43,040
movement that they will say to the board

992
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,520
or whatever hey listen i want to have a

993
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,560
good secure device i must trust because

994
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,119
i make decisions based on that

995
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,960
result that i get from that

996
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,239
device

997
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,239
you're scaring me even more you just

998
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,400
mentioned something in terms of you know

999
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,400
clinicians kind of having a

1000
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,079
gorilla warfare of bringing the

1001
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:04,480
awareness to the board and the board is

1002
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,240
not taking it seriously i mean that's

1003
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,079
the that's the basis for this panel

1004
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,920
health care and crisis i'm hearing

1005
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,040
nothing but

1006
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,440
the world is falling down around us

1007
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,640
uh it is

1008
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,800
what did you just say it is yes okay

1009
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,800
let's pause you for a second nina tell

1010
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,480
us from your perspective

1011
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,640
you get to meet with everybody with your

1012
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,400
experience as a hacker

1013
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,720
as a clinician i mean who's not paying

1014
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,759
attention here and why not

1015
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,599
that is loaded

1016
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,280
there was a comment earlier about who

1017
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,119
the person that we're we're doing stuff

1018
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,760
for and it was shin i think you said

1019
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,760
um i think there are multiple people in

1020
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,400
the triad right it's clinician

1021
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,200
it's

1022
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,359
patient but we also need to bring the

1023
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:49,040
software developer into it

1024
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,800
did you say software developer so a

1025
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,599
technical person yes interesting

1026
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:54,480
um

1027
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,800
because if one is creating

1028
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,400
then the other one needs to have that

1029
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,320
conversation of what they need and how

1030
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,640
to do ease of use for the patient

1031
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,000
because they have to be the ones to

1032
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,359
describe it to the patient to take it

1033
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,599
home and use it anyway well i understand

1034
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,200
though that some of these manufacturers

1035
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,599
devices have human factors engineers

1036
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,359
yeah that focus specifically on that in

1037
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:14,960
your experience is this always the case

1038
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,040
so pause you for a second and then shark

1039
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,119
i'd like you to think about in terms of

1040
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:20,800
the way that a patient interfaces with a

1041
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,720
device how would you violate so let's

1042
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,119
ask elena first are these devices

1043
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:27,119
patient friendly or are they clinician

1044
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,400
friendly or where's the where am i

1045
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,599
missing it um

1046
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,240
you have devices and you have devices

1047
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,960
and you have uh innovation

1048
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,960
so you have a lot of things that the big

1049
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,000
fac

1050
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,920
manufacturer they are making and they

1051
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,680
are doing their best to

1052
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,280
uh have

1053
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,680
all things together so what the patient

1054
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,000
needs what the physician needs what the

1055
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,640
medical staff needs what the security

1056
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,520
there so they try to build it

1057
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,800
build it their play also money so that's

1058
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,200
the the inside organization of the

1059
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,720
manufacturer

1060
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,599
pr and that board and all the goals

1061
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,760
let's bring it all on the table also

1062
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,440
legal things

1063
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,440
but you have also some small devices

1064
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,280
some innovation they are

1065
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,880
brought

1066
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,079
many times really we told we can help

1067
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,800
but there is lack of communication what

1068
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,200
the patient really need what

1069
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,240
uh the medical side of the that need

1070
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,280
real is yes so you have a lot of

1071
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,640
um software things application that

1072
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,480
patients use that they connect with the

1073
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,359
hospital whatever and you have big house

1074
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:39,839
and everything on our network

1075
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:41,040
all right so let me pause it because

1076
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,960
what you're describing for me

1077
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,359
sounds like is shark is playground

1078
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,040
you've got medical devices in a

1079
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,640
patient's home that are connecting to a

1080
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,480
hospital there can't be anything that

1081
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,240
could possibly go wrong in that scenario

1082
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,640
correct

1083
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,960
you're totally wrong and you know that

1084
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,079
what

1085
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,400
i mean oh my god it's like we are trying

1086
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,960
to run before we start to

1087
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,400
learning to walk

1088
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,720
and we are trading so i'm hearing some

1089
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,480
common ground between you two ladies is

1090
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,440
that right

1091
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,240
i'm gonna go buy a lottery ticket wow

1092
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,960
we made it there we did

1093
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,200
please continue sorry i believe it's uh

1094
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,400
it's a trade-off between ease of use

1095
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,320
uh for the patient or or for the

1096
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,240
hospital and the

1097
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,520
security

1098
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,200
and safety because what i think the

1099
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,040
staff and the people that creating those

1100
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,680
devices and the hospitals needs to

1101
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,000
understand that the security that we are

1102
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
talking about that they are not too

1103
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,560
familiar with it's tied to the safety of

1104
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,040
the patient and then the whole hospital

1105
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,480
very important point okay so i'm going

1106
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,720
to take the gloves off

1107
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,400
can i take your gloves off and comment

1108
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,800
on this yes please of course absolutely

1109
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,760
so

1110
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,359
before defcon

1111
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,280
uh there's a tradition in my family

1112
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,920
where something medically goes wrong so

1113
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,160
this year it was that my father was

1114
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,079
overdosed by um

1115
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:05,440
fentanyl during a surgical procedure

1116
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,960
you didn't know that

1117
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,640
no i didn't know so the normal um

1118
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,920
dosage

1119
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,720
for his procedure was 25 milligrams they

1120
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,480
gave him 100 milligrams of fentanyl so

1121
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,079
if you don't know what fentanyl is you

1122
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,240
can take i have very small hands and i'm

1123
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,160
not good at measurements so pretty much

1124
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,960
just a dusting of fentanyl and after

1125
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,240
that you're overdosed it's a pain

1126
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,119
medication it's a pain relief medication

1127
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:32,079
and i could not i was i was mental and i

1128
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:33,920
had to go home and take care of him

1129
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,440
because i had to teach my father how to

1130
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,560
walk again

1131
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,880
because that's how bad this was

1132
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,160
he's fine

1133
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,640
and all i kept thinking was the doctor

1134
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,720
messed up this is outrageous i used to

1135
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,480
work at that hospital i called people i

1136
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,040
was very upset and during

1137
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:49,920
um

1138
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,880
bill's

1139
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,040
tabletop exercise the revelation

1140
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,440
occurred to me that it wasn't the doctor

1141
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,800
it was the machine

1142
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,680
wow didn't that that stopped me and i

1143
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,880
called the hospital back and i said i

1144
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,320
think you need to check your machine i

1145
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,599
don't know if it's an update or what's

1146
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,440
going on because i got all their notes

1147
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,400
and everybody was like we don't know

1148
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,760
what happened we're not quite sure and i

1149
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,640
was like

1150
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,680
okay

1151
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,640
so

1152
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,480
this kind of situation is also rare

1153
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,839
because i worked at that hospital

1154
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:15,359
because i could call people because i

1155
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,280
understand what fentanyl is and the

1156
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,960
after effects and the issues

1157
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,160
whereas other people would have just

1158
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,920
been upset and you know whatever would

1159
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,720
happen

1160
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,240
so when we think about the medication

1161
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,280
and we

1162
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,400
the patients your comment it's it's i

1163
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,000
don't think it's a trade-off i think we

1164
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
have to build both in simultaneously

1165
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,960
with advocacy on both sides and having

1166
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,599
both sides saying yes i agree no i don't

1167
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,839
until there is a point of not perfection

1168
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:41,520
but at least

1169
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,720
good usage

1170
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,000
all right let's take a deep breath here

1171
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,920
because that was like so serious

1172
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,560
he's fine i know but my mom i as you all

1173
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,480
know had a stroke when i was on a plane

1174
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,040
to dublin and i had to go home so having

1175
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,160
been through that experience just

1176
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,520
terrified me so this is kind of bringing

1177
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,880
me back so let's take a deep breath

1178
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,119
shall we let's talk strategic

1179
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:00,560
what kind of

1180
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,960
lessons can be learned for the gulf

1181
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,200
cooperation council the middle east

1182
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,720
with regard to the way that the

1183
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,200
americans have either figured it out or

1184
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,240
not from a regulatory perspective

1185
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,640
so shark can put on your your hacker hat

1186
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,160
i am switzerland so actually okay no i'm

1187
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,640
not sure but

1188
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,359
so

1189
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:24,079
i

1190
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:26,640
there it might be different uh because

1191
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,280
again when i do research it's mostly

1192
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,880
european uh it's very

1193
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,240
compartmentalized in terms of us having

1194
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,440
different controls so there is a lot of

1195
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,359
i would say miscommunication and

1196
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,599
communication is being cut off

1197
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,200
luckily i don't have that much

1198
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,560
experience of being patient in

1199
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,200
switzerland so i think the better

1200
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,160
uh person to answer

1201
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,520
well let's pause there for a second

1202
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,960
you're not going to get off so easy

1203
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,359
being checked working in switzerland oh

1204
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,200
no no

1205
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,000
well

1206
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
hold on young stand by just joking just

1207
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,720
stand by so are there regulations

1208
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,800
regarding the hacking world that you

1209
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,680
have to abide by

1210
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,720
switzerland uh tends to be a little bit

1211
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,000
more advanced so uh i believe that

1212
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,280
we do work

1213
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,319
with swiss army and they are more um

1214
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,720
open to talk about these issues so i

1215
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,200
believe i believe that in terms of uh

1216
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,359
also everything is medical devices

1217
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:28,800
so you would you would term it as

1218
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,480
success then yeah

1219
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,480
okay nina you know i'm going to ask you

1220
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,839
this question you're just glaring at me

1221
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:35,760
so has the us

1222
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,440
been a success or a failure in the

1223
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,119
regulatory environment

1224
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:40,640
from a cyber security perspective tell

1225
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,680
us what your thoughts are

1226
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,800
but it depends on aspect of review right

1227
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,240
yes um

1228
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,520
there's there's a really good effort

1229
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,800
being done

1230
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,680
um

1231
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,839
there there could be

1232
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:03,440
there are guidances

1233
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,520
guidances are not regulations

1234
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,400
or nor are they the law right guidances

1235
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,400
are please do it rather than do it now

1236
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,200
right

1237
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,200
um so

1238
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,160
the

1239
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,839
the current administration of the united

1240
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,920
states has done a lot more to make

1241
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,720
regulatory things happen um has put some

1242
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,800
teeth into everything to make it work

1243
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,480
well tell us about some of these these

1244
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,640
things what are some of these so they're

1245
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,560
what are they have they included the

1246
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,400
independent security researcher world in

1247
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,520
these these

1248
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,000
codified guidances for making patients

1249
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
safer or not not codified they're not

1250
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,839
necessarily bringing hackers in to do it

1251
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:40,000
but there's an executive order that's

1252
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,760
that said we have to have an s-bomb for

1253
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,640
everything

1254
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,599
what's an s-bomb a soft software bill of

1255
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:47,599
materials so essentially the uh if you

1256
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:50,160
look at the nutrition brand on your food

1257
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,160
but is that not a road map for someone

1258
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,079
like sharkus to basically go and hack

1259
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:55,520
these devices i love when you ask good

1260
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,920
questions so going forward with that um

1261
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,400
so fda has also worked with mitre and

1262
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,200
there who's miter uh federally funded

1263
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,160
research

1264
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:08,400
and development center um

1265
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,160
thank you threw me off so

1266
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,839
they worked with them to do a threat

1267
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:14,240
model for healthcare which still needs

1268
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,119
help

1269
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,200
for devices because it's just device

1270
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,720
it's not hospital

1271
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:19,920
um

1272
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,079
no one is documenting workflows when i

1273
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:23,839
worked in the hospital one physician had

1274
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:25,680
19 workflows for established patients we

1275
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,359
got her down to seven

1276
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:28,240
um

1277
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,520
things like that

1278
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,200
is it is it working

1279
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,280
there are efforts being made is there

1280
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,800
progress yes is it final no well and

1281
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,800
certainly you're familiar with the jsp

1282
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,319
the joint security plan that came out a

1283
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,680
couple of years ago what are your

1284
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,960
thoughts on that because i understand

1285
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,440
that it was a coordinated effort between

1286
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,720
healthcare

1287
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,359
hackers and medical device manufacturers

1288
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:51,119
do you think that's a success they're

1289
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:52,240
still working on it there's an updated

1290
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,240
version so yeah revision's coming out

1291
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,599
what do you think about its base form

1292
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:57,839
though

1293
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,280
remember this is an international

1294
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,880
audience yeah

1295
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:01,839
um

1296
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:03,119
give me a minute let me let me

1297
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:04,960
contemplate life shark up please we'll

1298
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,960
get to you in a second um

1299
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,359
i was doing a research on and what i

1300
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:12,079
think that was done right in the u.s is

1301
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:16,319
that their uh ics cert is also releasing

1302
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:18,640
advisories on medical devices uh there

1303
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,079
was an issue

1304
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:20,960
within

1305
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,880
daikon which is one of the protocols

1306
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,440
that we are using for uh imaging so

1307
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,160
that's all your x-rays and mris

1308
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,839
that was done right because i couldn't

1309
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:31,920
find the same thing i did research i

1310
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,520
asked in cert

1311
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,079
connections inserts around asia and in

1312
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:37,839
europe and we don't have anything like

1313
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:39,280
that interesting

1314
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,040
my in my experience though i believe

1315
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,800
that the computer emergency response

1316
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,160
teams the search that you're talking

1317
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,240
about they do collaborate on an

1318
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,680
international level what i'm hearing you

1319
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,440
say though is that the information is

1320
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,240
not readily available and why

1321
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,040
not not anything that is i was looking

1322
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,160
specifically for ics or medical devices

1323
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,880
and i haven't find those um being

1324
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,280
released so why would a medical device

1325
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,119
be in an industrial control system

1326
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:06,880
computer emergency response team

1327
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,440
advisory

1328
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,720
should you be in a medical advisor

1329
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,960
i wish it was a good idea if there is

1330
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,680
anyone out there because

1331
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,520
one at a time ladies

1332
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,280
elena is ready to answer

1333
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,560
please go ahead

1334
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,640
so let me rephrase the question

1335
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,520
why are not these vulnerabilities that

1336
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,920
sharka researches why are they being put

1337
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,520
out in a technical bulletin when they

1338
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,880
impact patients from a clinical

1339
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,720
perspective it seems like it's again the

1340
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,160
hands are going away from each other

1341
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,560
rather than across the sea together why

1342
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,000
is this

1343
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,760
i don't want to go to a hospital aren't

1344
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,480
it

1345
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,280
because uh yes the thing is the medical

1346
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,960
device is in just industrial products

1347
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,000
you know it's manufacturing

1348
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,960
it isn't and we don't have any uh

1349
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,800
anything in this world where you are uh

1350
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,160
reporting only uh uh problems with the

1351
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,280
medical things device software whatever

1352
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,520
okay let me stop there for a second if a

1353
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,359
medical device does not operate in the

1354
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:11,680
intended use that it was designed what

1355
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,440
do you do you just throw it out and get

1356
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,839
another one

1357
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,040
oh i've seen it

1358
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,760
the big things yeah like like

1359
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,319
the machine it doesn't happen but that

1360
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:27,280
happened with a lot of softwares it has

1361
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,599
innovation it happens all the time for

1362
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:31,680
years that you get what do you do from a

1363
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:32,720
clinical perspective you've got a

1364
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,640
patient on a table and you're telling me

1365
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,839
a device you're about to do something

1366
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:37,599
with them doesn't work what do you do no

1367
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:39,599
no no you hit the panic button

1368
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:41,599
yes wow

1369
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:43,520
the thing is the thing is that the big

1370
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,880
devices are much more um

1371
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,440
from medical perspective

1372
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,079
safe shape they are doing what they need

1373
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:53,920
to do so the intended use is being

1374
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,000
accomplished yes you have it uh the

1375
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,119
security issues

1376
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,079
uh the medical awards need to be more

1377
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:03,839
aware about that because they don't

1378
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,400
still not aware back

1379
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,000
about that

1380
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,480
what all those devices can do that

1381
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,680
someone can control the device uh

1382
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:17,200
and do what they want as they say yes

1383
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,440
doctors and nurses don't know that right

1384
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:20,400
right

1385
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,680
or should they be

1386
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,920
right exactly they don't expect that but

1387
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,160
what i told you about the problems any

1388
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,240
kind of problems from the small devices

1389
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,160
from innovation they are coming all the

1390
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,960
time yes in a health

1391
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,839
institutions yes you have that that they

1392
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,920
are not checked that this implant files

1393
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,480
was uh on the big affair yeah you were

1394
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,359
able to talk about that earlier yes um

1395
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:45,440
if you look implant files on internet

1396
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,599
you can find local things that they were

1397
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:50,079
journalists from so many countries that

1398
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:53,440
they are looking about implant files

1399
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,520
about implant things

1400
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,240
that you put in a body i did talk with

1401
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,160
them and they they talk also that they

1402
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,400
need look also uh

1403
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,240
pacemaker and digital things but that's

1404
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,119
a small part from all it was so much

1405
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:09,839
yeah so they didn't put a lot uh talk

1406
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:11,119
about that

1407
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:13,760
because they did another where

1408
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:14,960
yeah

1409
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,480
more

1410
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,319
from from implant things that you put in

1411
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:19,359
a body

1412
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,040
like breast implants and everything so

1413
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,760
you don't have any regulation that

1414
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,800
divide like you are do you know that if

1415
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,440
you put medicament

1416
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,319
to use that you have some approval for

1417
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:33,440
that

1418
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,880
but for medical

1419
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:39,599
devices you don't have that regulation

1420
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:42,160
you don't have anything that you you

1421
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,880
have fda yeah but um

1422
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,599
not everything go to fda to approve and

1423
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:49,760
that's what you talk about safety and

1424
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,760
security there are two different staff

1425
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,559
and uh fda cannot approve both of them

1426
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:56,240
right right if you look implant fires

1427
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:57,599
you can see what they are doing

1428
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:00,240
especially with so many innovation new

1429
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,960
things that they are also bringing uh

1430
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,960
cows in the mediterranean sure

1431
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,200
yep let me pause you for a second later

1432
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,880
nina i'm going to redirect this question

1433
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,400
to you as well from your perspective

1434
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,200
with a combined hacking clinical

1435
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,800
perspective getting back to the original

1436
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,720
point that sharko was making thank you

1437
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,720
by the way elena and sharka

1438
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,040
why is it that you have the computer

1439
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,839
infrastructure security agency cisa

1440
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:25,440
who's part of the u.s department of

1441
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,760
homeland security dhs

1442
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,240
adjudicating engineering vulnerabilities

1443
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:33,040
on medical devices without clinical

1444
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,119
input it just doesn't make any sense to

1445
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:38,559
me why is this tell me

1446
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,319
i don't know why it isn't tell you what

1447
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:41,520
i think

1448
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,520
um

1449
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,839
operation warp speed yes

1450
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:48,400
what is that

1451
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,760
it was it started during the pandemic

1452
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,760
to understand supply chain to understand

1453
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,040
the healthcare issues all the other

1454
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:55,839
things

1455
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:58,240
when the administration's changed cisa

1456
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,920
sisa sissa

1457
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,160
picked it up and they they took it under

1458
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,720
their wing why are they implementing the

1459
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,400
the warnings

1460
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,800
i think they're trying to take on a

1461
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,280
bigger force within the agencies they

1462
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,359
also i believe they also have

1463
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:15,359
legalities to do such a thing where the

1464
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:17,920
fda maybe doesn't have those right right

1465
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,680
what i'm observing what i'm hearing is

1466
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,800
the fda is clinical patient safety what

1467
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,119
i'm hearing from sharkus perspective is

1468
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:27,119
that the ics cert is the engineering

1469
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:29,280
side from a cyber perspective and so

1470
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,319
that you're telling what what i'm

1471
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:32,640
hearing nina is that's the most likely

1472
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:33,920
government agency to release

1473
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,280
vulnerabilities and medical devices

1474
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,520
that's the best we can do

1475
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,359
wow

1476
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:41,440
why is this i mean there are what are

1477
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,440
called information sharing analysis

1478
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,880
centers aren't there where they're

1479
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,359
supposed to be sharing vulnerabilities i

1480
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:49,599
mean why aren't they doing it they are

1481
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:52,319
so hi sec is sports who's hisa

1482
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:53,359
healthcare

1483
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:55,359
information security and analysis center

1484
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:56,720
okay all right

1485
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:59,040
and there's a newly instantiated bio

1486
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,400
isac

1487
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,559
um that is starting to do more for

1488
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:04,880
what's on

1489
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,960
it's starting to do more for

1490
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,559
pharmaceuticals

1491
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:12,800
reaching into um agriculture at some

1492
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,359
point not current state that has found

1493
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:16,079
um

1494
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:18,960
a bit of a virus that's going rampant

1495
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,000
right now

1496
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:20,720
um

1497
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,119
and putting those advisories out

1498
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:25,760
interesting so sharka what she just said

1499
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,520
for you and i if we put on our hacker

1500
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,280
hats not that i would ever pretend to be

1501
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,000
one is she just described a huge threat

1502
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,079
surface which sounds porous

1503
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:35,760
she used a variety of different terms

1504
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,440
that we could shoot through could please

1505
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,119
need you know what else is the larger

1506
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:40,640
threat surface yeah that so many

1507
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,000
different advisories are coming from so

1508
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,280
many different places and you have to go

1509
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,640
through your email and siphon through

1510
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,960
everything

1511
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:49,119
tell us about it she's about ready to

1512
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:51,280
levitate again get in there no no i i

1513
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,079
think what it is really is go it goes

1514
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:57,440
back to yelling our clinician

1515
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,079
where do you go when you find something

1516
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:03,280
i am more savvy and i know how to use

1517
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,839
google.go whatever is your preference

1518
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:08,480
and i can find things for me uh it's

1519
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:12,400
easier i think it's more of a for elena

1520
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,040
or people on this side that it needs to

1521
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:18,319
be clear where they go if something like

1522
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:20,319
this happens again there's more than

1523
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:22,720
people it's easier for me to find ways

1524
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,880
by the way i don't i think it's an

1525
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,240
advancement

1526
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,200
to do it for doing this uh to have a

1527
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,119
place where you can report things where

1528
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:32,880
someone is going to be talking to you

1529
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,240
well and nina then i'm going to ask you

1530
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,240
the same question elena so

1531
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,760
vulnerabilities are being reported do

1532
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,280
you feel that they're being channeled

1533
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,559
are you being reported not being

1534
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:42,880
recorded either one you pick are they or

1535
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,559
are they not and if they are being

1536
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:46,160
reported are they being dealt with in a

1537
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,559
timely fashion from your perspective in

1538
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:49,839
the biohacking village and then i'm

1539
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:52,319
going to ask you the same question

1540
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:53,440
are they being reported yes

1541
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,119
vulnerabilities are being reported are

1542
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:56,800
they being dealt with in a in a manner

1543
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,200
that is timely um

1544
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,200
i don't have an answer for that wow

1545
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,040
because

1546
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,720
what is timely

1547
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,160
what is it patient safety i'm going to

1548
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,839
turn over to elena i mean

1549
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:08,960
i've already

1550
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,240
determined i'm never going to go to a

1551
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,480
hospital i'll die in my you know bed

1552
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,160
because i really don't care not that i

1553
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,359
don't trust you from a clinical

1554
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:17,200
perspective but if you vulnerabilities

1555
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,640
in these devices i mean that you've

1556
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,119
discovered i mean how does this work sum

1557
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:22,960
it up for us and then i'm going to give

1558
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,280
each of you a chance to give us the last

1559
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,359
word in terms of what you think this is

1560
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:29,280
all coming down to healthcare and crisis

1561
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,240
uh the the problem by uh healthcare

1562
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,200
professionals is that they don't know

1563
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:39,118
that it can be cyber security

1564
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,880
right educational awareness then or yeah

1565
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,240
yes and no because

1566
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,680
healthcare

1567
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,599
professionals are so busy with

1568
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:52,880
everything they

1569
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,440
you don't know administration

1570
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,799
take like 40 of our time or more

1571
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:01,119
and we want to work with the patient

1572
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,240
so a lot of things you cannot put

1573
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,160
everything on a healthcare professionals

1574
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,559
but they should have some

1575
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:10,720
place

1576
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:13,119
at a hospital where they can report and

1577
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:15,839
not just put this device doesn't work or

1578
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:17,599
something happen

1579
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:20,319
most of the time we doubt ourselves we

1580
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:23,200
do miss make mistakes sure not that much

1581
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,480
technology

1582
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,760
i have a

1583
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,079
just small story one pacemaker

1584
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:30,559
technicals get patient and he said i did

1585
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:33,280
hack my pacemaker he was like what

1586
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,839
luckily that guy was like wait a minute

1587
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:38,240
and he did find but it was in that time

1588
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,760
only i.t

1589
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,880
department not security so you need to

1590
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:46,720
make i will make for my side last word

1591
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,680
we need to make some connection

1592
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,640
inside of the hospital from security and

1593
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,680
um healthcare professionals that they

1594
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,160
understand and hear each other got it

1595
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,359
i'm going to pause you there because i

1596
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:00,559
want to make sure these other ladies get

1597
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:01,680
a chance

1598
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:02,960
sharka

1599
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,640
what would you give as a last takeaway

1600
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,960
for our international audience here in

1601
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,440
hack in the box abu dhabi

1602
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:12,319
so i think that we need to look at it as

1603
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:14,720
if we talk about cyber physical systems

1604
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,119
cyber physical systems are any systems

1605
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:18,880
where if the change is done in a

1606
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,440
cyberspace there is a change in physical

1607
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:22,480
space

1608
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,240
so we need to approach it the same way

1609
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,839
that's why i've been talking about the

1610
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:28,839
connection between the otor or

1611
00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:31,839
isis world and the health care and i

1612
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:33,520
think because they are old

1613
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,920
kind of old systems like asset systems

1614
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,520
and they have this pretty much the same

1615
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,280
issue so i think that we should approach

1616
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:40,400
them the same

1617
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,559
but i also agree with yelena i see this

1618
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:44,960
as a consultant that goes to hospitals

1619
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,640
where you have a hospital's clinician

1620
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,480
doctors

1621
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,720
and then there is that i.t

1622
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,480
department that it's not within the

1623
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,119
hospitals it's usually a third party so

1624
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:57,280
i think that is also a little bit of an

1625
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,280
issue where there's a gap between the

1626
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,160
hospital it's it's clinicians and

1627
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,720
cyber security in it

1628
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:07,040
nina last thoughts sum it up for us from

1629
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,599
a clinical cyber security perspective

1630
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:11,839
what is the greatest takeaway that you

1631
00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:14,000
would give for the audience

1632
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,520
you have the last word young lady oh

1633
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:16,480
great

1634
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,000
um

1635
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,359
i i love research it's my happy place i

1636
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:23,200
love comparing the laws and seeing where

1637
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,559
things are where they aren't where's the

1638
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:27,280
gap analysis where can things be fixed

1639
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,079
um i i went to university and i did

1640
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:32,079
translational medicine and i built

1641
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:33,599
devices

1642
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:35,760
and one of the people on my team to your

1643
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:36,559
point

1644
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:38,559
did not talk to anyone about the device

1645
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:40,000
he just was like this is going to work

1646
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,520
and it's going to be amazing and i

1647
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,599
punched holes in his whole story and he

1648
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:45,440
was devastated and he felt his feelings

1649
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:46,400
and i was like you didn't talk to

1650
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,319
anybody you created no surveys you

1651
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:50,319
didn't try

1652
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:51,440
um

1653
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:52,880
same university

1654
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,480
they said that uh security wasn't

1655
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,559
important

1656
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:58,960
i will be teaching for them security in

1657
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,680
medical research because of this

1658
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,440
when we look at patients

1659
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:04,960
how are we

1660
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:06,799
how are we getting to help them decide

1661
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:08,559
what's best for them how are we getting

1662
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:10,000
the clinicians to help decide what's

1663
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,280
best for them

1664
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,440
um i don't know i think there needs to

1665
