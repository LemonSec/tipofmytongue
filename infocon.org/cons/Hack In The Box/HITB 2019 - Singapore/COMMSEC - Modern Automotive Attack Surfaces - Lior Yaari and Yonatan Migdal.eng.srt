1
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:21,820
hi everyone very happy to be here today

2
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,430
we're gonna tell you a few things about

3
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:27,340
automotive industry and the modern tack

4
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:31,240
surfaces on it but first let me

5
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:32,890
introduce Leo Leo is a wonderful partner

6
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,690
of mine we both work at sigh motive

7
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:37,180
industries in Israel it's a small

8
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:40,989
start-up based in Tel Aviv and we do

9
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:43,680
automotive cybersecurity Lior here by my

10
00:00:40,989 --> 00:00:47,080
side is an amazing person he is a

11
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,550
robotics geek geek he is studying German

12
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,140
on his free time because we have a lot

13
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:52,959
of German clients and he likes doing

14
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:55,690
things all the way and also a secure

15
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:59,140
development consultant if you happen to

16
00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:01,420
ever need that ok

17
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:05,860
I want to thank Jonathan for presenting

18
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:07,780
me you know tanya is a great guy he

19
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:11,020
likes to do bug bounties on his free

20
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:13,090
time he's doing a AcroYoga

21
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:15,310
so he's an acro yoga stand if you wonder

22
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:17,860
what it is touch it up it's pretty

23
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:21,130
impressive and it's also moving to Italy

24
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:24,220
next week so he came all the way here

25
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:27,600
and never going back to Israel well at

26
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:30,100
least at least until next year we guess

27
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,130
we both work force force emotive

28
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:35,080
technologies Sumati technologies is a

29
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:38,289
startup co-founded we fought with false

30
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:40,270
bargain based in Israel we developed

31
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:44,409
security solutions for the automotive

32
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:46,899
industry so and provide managed services

33
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:49,509
we're both part of the penetration

34
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:51,729
testing team we do a vehicle security

35
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:53,860
research and passing passing issue

36
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:57,220
protections basically we find

37
00:01:53,860 --> 00:02:00,250
vulnerabilities in car computers and we

38
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:02,950
hack them for the vehicle suppliers to

39
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:04,780
be able to fix such vulnerabilities the

40
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:08,739
other part of the company which is the

41
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:12,959
R&D section is doing development for

42
00:02:08,739 --> 00:02:16,299
security solutions so from from the

43
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:19,090
findings that we find in the PT team we

44
00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:21,250
come up with ideas of how we can better

45
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:23,739
protect vehicles around the world and

46
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:25,629
they take that implement that and

47
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:28,490
hopefully we will be the first

48
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:31,880
automotive security company to

49
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:33,650
embed ideas and solutions inside the car

50
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,480
when I say hopefully it's going to

51
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:38,450
happen pretty soon and we're going to be

52
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:42,079
the first and we have other solution

53
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:43,489
like automotive sock and more yeah so

54
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,910
with that just a little disclaimer

55
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:49,160
before we continue unfortunately most of

56
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:51,200
the impressive things that we find are

57
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:53,780
protected by non-disclosure agreements

58
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,929
and as such we can tell you but then

59
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:58,610
we'll have to kill you so that's not

60
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:01,360
gonna happen today what is gonna happen

61
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:05,150
today is a lot of ideas and a lot of

62
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,370
thoughts that we have and some progress

63
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:09,290
that we see in the industry to kind of

64
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:11,660
tickle your minds a little bit so you

65
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:13,510
can understand what's going on with your

66
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:16,250
cars and why do they need cyber security

67
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:19,370
so with that okay you know who we are

68
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:22,580
and this is the agenda for today let's

69
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:25,340
get started ok so if you've not been

70
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:26,900
living in a bubble in the past few years

71
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:30,650
then you probably know that there are

72
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:32,390
two maybe three main trends that are

73
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:36,050
currently happening in the automotive

74
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:38,989
world the first one is connecting cars

75
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:41,090
to things okay so we have this concept

76
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:43,580
of a connected car this is a direct

77
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:45,680
continuation to connecting all other

78
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:48,200
things in our lives due to the internet

79
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,940
and to things around them so you have

80
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,850
refrigerators communicating and you have

81
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:55,520
cars communicating the other main trend

82
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:58,130
is autonomous cars so by leveraging

83
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,350
multiple technologies that have recently

84
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:03,470
ripened and became available on the

85
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:05,840
market the industry aims to have cars

86
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:07,940
that are self-driving now this is

87
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,100
obviously quite a hard task to do and

88
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:12,770
it's going to take a few years and there

89
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:15,290
are a few steps to take before your car

90
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:17,269
can drive itself completely on its own

91
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:19,039
so we have progress and we have assisted

92
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:21,380
driving in the middle but eventually

93
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,470
this is going to be a big thing and here

94
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:26,090
you can see a bunch of protocols or

95
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:27,380
technologies that are involved in this

96
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:30,830
process and you can see that they

97
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:33,140
correspond and these two trends did not

98
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:35,479
have to happen at the same time it just

99
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:37,430
happens to be so that the technology is

100
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,860
relevant for these two things became

101
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:41,820
available around the same time which is

102
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:45,110
about now and we

103
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:48,210
expect to see and the not so far future

104
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:51,540
connected autonomous cars or autonomous

105
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:53,909
connected cars which is kind of the idea

106
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:57,990
that you have from sci-fi music movies

107
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:59,880
of a car that can connect to everything

108
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:03,930
around it and is also driving on its own

109
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:05,880
it's very futuristic and impressive okay

110
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:08,220
now who talks to my car if we go back

111
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:12,020
pretty much 15 years ago to the Year

112
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:14,310
2015 there was not much in terms of

113
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:18,359
advanced technology as we know it today

114
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:22,080
so the luckier of us probably had Nokia

115
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,670
smartphones that had the resistive touch

116
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,210
screens that you had to press really

117
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,520
hard

118
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:28,590
iPhone was not invented yet this whole

119
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,659
revolution of having a full-featured

120
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:33,150
device in your pocket did not exist and

121
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:36,600
maybe you probably had an iPod so the

122
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:38,789
car mainly for your entertainment maybe

123
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,560
the more expensive cars had auxiliary

124
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:42,840
connections to be able to play some

125
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,710
music and if you were lucky you would

126
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:49,409
also have a USB connection to have your

127
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:51,870
mp3 songs played somehow and this was

128
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:54,630
pretty much it 15 around 15 years ago

129
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:56,970
now if we hop ten years into the future

130
00:05:54,630 --> 00:06:00,900
- around the Year 2015

131
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:03,660
now this entertainment had enlarged and

132
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:06,539
the car manufacturers realized that in

133
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:08,730
order to satisfy us the the Y generation

134
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:11,400
the the techies that were born almost

135
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:13,140
with phones in our hands they need to

136
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,659
advance a little bit into the future and

137
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:18,450
so they start embedding technologies

138
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:21,240
that at this point existed in probably

139
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:24,450
all of the mobile phones into the car

140
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,250
now this is much more fun for the driver

141
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:28,680
because you have a larger screen and

142
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:31,470
it's a part of your system but it's

143
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:34,200
still not majorly different from just

144
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:36,240
placing your phone on the windshield and

145
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:40,349
driving with your navigation system for

146
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,690
example on and if we look a little bit

147
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:47,570
more into the future into probably the

148
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:51,000
year 2025 then we can expect many more

149
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:53,790
connectivity options and external inputs

150
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,849
that our cars are going to have to

151
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:57,550
process

152
00:06:54,849 --> 00:07:00,748
act accordingly now here are just a few

153
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:03,429
examples probably most of the these

154
00:07:00,749 --> 00:07:07,149
three-letter abbreviations are Chinese

155
00:07:03,429 --> 00:07:10,539
to you maybe you you don't even know

156
00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:13,479
what they mean they are kind of odd to

157
00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:17,199
most people but we will get into some of

158
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:19,688
them in the next slides now what does

159
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,669
this imply so the first thing that you

160
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:24,789
have to understand is that car companies

161
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:28,539
are giants these are huge companies that

162
00:07:24,789 --> 00:07:32,459
were built entirely around processes for

163
00:07:28,539 --> 00:07:35,199
creating cars now originally they were

164
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:37,719
usually companies of Mechanical

165
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:41,019
Engineers which created either

166
00:07:37,719 --> 00:07:43,300
completely mechanical devices or semi

167
00:07:41,019 --> 00:07:47,169
electronic devices and when I say that I

168
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:49,659
mean things devices that are comparable

169
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:51,429
to an Arduino that you can buy in the

170
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:53,259
internet they have some inputs and

171
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:56,049
outputs but they don't really have any

172
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:58,559
operating system or advanced

173
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:00,939
multitasking or process management

174
00:07:58,559 --> 00:08:02,889
capabilities and they can receive basic

175
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:04,959
inputs and process them and act

176
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:07,589
accordingly and these things usually

177
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:11,589
communicate it between them in about a

178
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:14,800
twenty year old technology named can bus

179
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:17,019
can bus there's not much to know about

180
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,300
it you should know that it's old that

181
00:08:17,019 --> 00:08:21,209
it's very fast in terms of response

182
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:24,459
times but it does not allow you to

183
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:28,269
deliver so much information and that it

184
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:29,889
has zero attention to security when it

185
00:08:28,269 --> 00:08:32,500
was designed so it's alright it's it's

186
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:34,630
really hard to secure such old

187
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,568
technologies when we're going to the

188
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:40,870
future the demand for fast speeds is

189
00:08:37,568 --> 00:08:44,889
growing and so the communicating devices

190
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:47,620
of the future have to leverage the new

191
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:49,509
Ethernet protocol that is now over 30

192
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:51,689
years old but obviously the car industry

193
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:54,759
is way behind the other industries and

194
00:08:51,689 --> 00:08:57,389
also these mechanical or semi electronic

195
00:08:54,759 --> 00:09:00,220
devices have transitioned into

196
00:08:57,389 --> 00:09:03,040
full-fledged Linux systems that are very

197
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:06,399
much alike the systems that you know and

198
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,569
love or hate from the IT industry and

199
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:11,870
the third thing that happened is

200
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:14,120
these car manufacturers Giants had to

201
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:16,970
transition from being companies of only

202
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:20,270
mechanical engineers into companies who

203
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:23,780
also have software developers this is a

204
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:26,660
big thing for them now this change also

205
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:29,180
created new demands for once there is

206
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:31,490
the connectivity issue and centralized

207
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:35,020
management issue that we will speak

208
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:38,300
about more later in this discussion and

209
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:41,420
there are growing IT departments that no

210
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:43,699
longer are responsible only for managing

211
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:46,310
the office network or the production

212
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:49,130
network like they used to but there are

213
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:51,979
actually now IT experts like the old

214
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:54,140
school IT and networking experts that

215
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:55,820
have to deal with things that are put

216
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:57,920
into the car because we're thinking

217
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:00,470
about Linux systems and ethanol

218
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,900
connections and that's being put into

219
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:05,080
cars and the third thing which is really

220
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:08,000
nice for us because it pays the bills is

221
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,890
just a whole lot of more information

222
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,750
security business around the car

223
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:15,260
industry and we're not the only company

224
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:18,170
that does this not even in Israel and

225
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:20,990
the most beautiful thing is that cars

226
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:25,339
are now much more hackable than they

227
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:26,870
were ever before in the past okay so

228
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,940
let's have some terminology I spoke

229
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:32,510
about manufacturers these are really

230
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:34,700
usually referred to as OMS and here are

231
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:37,930
just four examples out of the probably

232
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:42,050
over 100 OEMs that exist in the world

233
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:44,060
we have ECU's electronic control units

234
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:45,890
which basically what you should know

235
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:49,099
about them is that they are car

236
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:52,970
computers in a modern car there are over

237
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:55,790
100 ECU's so if you even try to imagine

238
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:57,020
how many components build your car then

239
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:59,930
you can understand that almost

240
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:03,170
everything nowadays is controlled or

241
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:06,800
assisted by some ECU some of them

242
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:11,270
smarter than others but still very much

243
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:12,800
electronic ID okay and the last thing

244
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:16,760
that you should know is infotainment

245
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,890
which is kind of a weird Ward it's a mix

246
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:21,110
of information and entertainment and

247
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:22,310
this is essentially a nickname for the

248
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:27,200
multimedia system the

249
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:28,279
you see in every car nowadays okay so

250
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,740
you know a little bit about the

251
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:32,960
automotive past in the future

252
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:36,860
now let's start talking about some fun

253
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:40,790
stuff a new fashion in the vehicle

254
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:43,339
industry are I o T devices so you've all

255
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:45,920
heard of IOT Internet of Things I

256
00:11:43,339 --> 00:11:48,920
mentioned it as connecting things to the

257
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,229
Internet and this is actually already

258
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:54,560
not such a new trend it's been around

259
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:57,110
for probably around five years but the

260
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,150
car manufacturers five years ago because

261
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:02,720
of them being such giants with slow

262
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:05,990
processes were not ready to have I Oh T

263
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:09,200
solutions connected car solutions back

264
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:12,350
then but companies who were ready were

265
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,540
smaller companies maybe startups that

266
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:19,640
don't really have to comply with the

267
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:21,500
huge massive regulation and processes

268
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,390
that have to go through when you want to

269
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,910
do something as a car manufacturer and

270
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:28,939
they could already supply solutions to

271
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:32,270
the market now here are two examples of

272
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:35,720
such solutions on the left you can see

273
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:38,660
obd dongles obd is the on-board

274
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:41,660
diagnostics which is essentially a

275
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:47,079
technician port I had mentioned canvas

276
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:50,540
before obd is perhaps the only external

277
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:52,850
canvas connector in the car so when you

278
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:55,069
take your car to the garage you can see

279
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:57,710
that the technician in the garage brings

280
00:12:55,070 --> 00:13:00,080
this computer along and connects a cable

281
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:03,170
between the computer and the OBD port

282
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:05,750
and that can be used to query the

283
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:08,500
internal ECU's and to gain information

284
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:11,600
about what was happening in the car and

285
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:13,640
about I guess five years ago companies

286
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,750
realized that why should only

287
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:20,150
technicians be able to do this right and

288
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:23,060
we can create obd dongles that connect

289
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:26,089
via bluetooth or Wi-Fi or even sometimes

290
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:28,760
cellular networking and then the

291
00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:31,720
customer the user can have an app on his

292
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:34,310
phone and able to extract the messages

293
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,850
understand the messages and perhaps

294
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:38,520
identify problems

295
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:40,680
in the car without even being able to

296
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,689
see them physically or without the need

297
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,120
to go to the garage so there are a lot

298
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:49,340
of examples for these and on the other

299
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:52,230
right side you can see remote start

300
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:54,450
applications this is a concept that is

301
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:57,300
maybe familiar for for people from

302
00:13:54,450 --> 00:14:00,030
colder countries because it was mainly

303
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:02,550
facilitated using radio frequencies so

304
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:04,410
just remote controls to maybe heat up

305
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,510
your car because it's a freezing morning

306
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:09,240
and it needs 10 minutes before you can

307
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:12,330
actually go out of the garage and drive

308
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,910
outside but with the advancement in

309
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:17,190
technologies companies realize that this

310
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:19,560
can happen over the internet so what

311
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:22,680
happens is you have an app on your phone

312
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:24,239
and you're able to install a third-party

313
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:27,390
thing in your car one of the three

314
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:30,420
options and this thing can allow you to

315
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:33,030
either unlock or even start your car

316
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:35,310
using your phone now these systems are

317
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:39,000
usually referred to as keyless entry and

318
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:41,699
now they are becoming more popular even

319
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,830
by the car manufacturers but back in the

320
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:46,320
day the only option was third-party

321
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:49,800
solutions and they are still pretty big

322
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,480
in the markets now what happens with

323
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,670
these things and which is really

324
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,070
problematic is that what you've

325
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:59,099
essentially done is in order to gain

326
00:14:56,070 --> 00:15:02,310
some comfort and the ability to have

327
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:04,830
information extracted from your car you

328
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:07,619
are connecting to the car not only to

329
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:10,140
your phone but also many times to some

330
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:12,510
internet facing server and this internet

331
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:15,030
facing server was developed by a company

332
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:16,860
that what it had in mind is where small

333
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:19,709
start-up and we have to get this going

334
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:22,890
as fast as possible and maybe was not so

335
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:29,000
much about security but this is opening

336
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:32,010
your car through the external world now

337
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:36,600
how many of you actually have one of

338
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:38,430
these in your car okay one person to two

339
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,620
people in the audience and which is not

340
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:42,839
surprising to me because as information

341
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:44,880
security experts you will be very

342
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,740
hesitant before putting something that

343
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,450
can remotely start your car in your car

344
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:51,300
right

345
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:55,230
but this solution is actually really

346
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:57,780
widespread with keyless entry for the

347
00:15:55,230 --> 00:16:00,570
car sharing business car sharing is a

348
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:03,030
growing trend in the automotive world

349
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:05,700
because we are Millennials and we don't

350
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:08,970
like paying a lot for our things and if

351
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:12,060
I can pay just a little bit to use a car

352
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:14,820
then I will prepare that and on top of

353
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:17,790
that you have companies managing fleets

354
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:21,270
and they will be very happy to not have

355
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:24,089
to manage a huge closet with car keys

356
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:26,040
and an inventory and instead just be

357
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:27,990
able to use applications on their phone

358
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:32,189
so this is actually much more widespread

359
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:37,290
than you would expect but let's watch a

360
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:40,590
small video about this energy technology

361
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:43,709
a virtual key is stored in the drivers

362
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:46,140
smart phone smart access technology

363
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:48,420
offers secure access by transmitting

364
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:51,330
this information from the smart phone to

365
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:53,910
the car which recognizes the valid key

366
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:57,510
and will unlock the car doors of born

367
00:16:53,910 --> 00:17:00,390
approached with a valid virtual key

368
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:03,900
inside the car the smart access system

369
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:05,609
gives authorization to stop first I want

370
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:08,520
to thank a continental for uploading

371
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:14,458
this video to YouTube this looks nice

372
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:17,879
right but I just took two media articles

373
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:20,280
from last year the first one is for the

374
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,949
micro app that we saw before a

375
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,690
researcher named dejay max maybe some of

376
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:25,650
you who know him he presented it in

377
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:28,490
black as well

378
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:31,650
found vulnerabilities for the my app

379
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:35,700
application and device which essentially

380
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:38,430
resulted in him able to still any my car

381
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:42,630
connected app on the street which is

382
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:43,910
crucial and also and the car to go

383
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:47,190
company which is a car sharing company

384
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:50,040
had one hand more than 100 high-end cars

385
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:52,140
stolen in Chicago now I was noted then

386
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:57,560
when I showed this presentation to a

387
00:17:52,140 --> 00:18:00,390
friend a few days ago that the the

388
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:02,669
thief's were caught and apparently the

389
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:04,980
the issue was for the not cybersecurity

390
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:07,380
or at least the reported issue was fraud

391
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,960
but for massage when we say that in

392
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:11,250
those solution you can see

393
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,520
vulnerabilities that will allow you to

394
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:17,790
open the car using your phone or an ice

395
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:20,850
outside connection so all of these

396
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:24,720
solutions make your car more vulnerable

397
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:26,520
and we shown both for dongles and

398
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,190
keyless entry is and infotainment

399
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:31,350
systems that they are Bluetooth

400
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:33,300
connected I call it the Bluetooth

401
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:35,820
problem because on the other side of the

402
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:37,710
screen we have vulnerabilities from last

403
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:40,710
year we have bleeding beat by army slabs

404
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:43,350
k knob which is a was published by

405
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:46,020
University s UT D and held to cup which

406
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:50,370
is a vulnerability found by a caste of

407
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:52,020
say motive those vulnerabilities could

408
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:54,989
and all of those are just from last year

409
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:57,990
and Bluetooth vulnerabilities pre

410
00:18:54,990 --> 00:19:00,210
authenticated would allow you using your

411
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:02,660
phone or a bluetooth dongle to attack

412
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:05,850
any device that is Bluetooth connected

413
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:07,380
now I have the technical slides for how

414
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:10,199
to cap maybe will show them at the end

415
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:12,810
if we'll have time I hope we will but

416
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:15,360
the problem with Bluetooth is that it is

417
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:18,210
not the only problem our cars today are

418
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:20,729
being connected with various new

419
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:24,210
technologies some of them you know NFC

420
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:26,850
Wi-Fi USB and some of them are new not

421
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:29,370
all of them are listed here but the new

422
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:33,600
a big one that is going to change your

423
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:36,300
life is called v2x vehicle 2x x is a

424
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,820
thing and it's a family of new

425
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:41,070
technologies including vehicle to

426
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:43,800
infrastructure vehicle to home vehicle

427
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:45,419
to person and vehicle to vehicle all of

428
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:50,340
these technologies are supposed to

429
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:52,530
assist cars to communicate with

430
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:55,020
everything around them this is a key

431
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:57,840
technology for autonomous vehicles but

432
00:19:55,020 --> 00:20:00,690
it's also very useful for the aguilar

433
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:04,199
driver now I have a video example by

434
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:05,830
Auto talks which is a v2x manufacture

435
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,110
chips manufacturers

436
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:10,989
public expects error-free autonomous

437
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:15,340
vehicle operation sensors should operate

438
00:20:10,989 --> 00:20:17,710
flawlessly in any condition v2x enhances

439
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:19,040
the perception of other sensors and a

440
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:20,290
fraction of the cost

441
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,780
[Music]

442
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:25,149
word nation possible only with

443
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:30,970
communication improves traffic

444
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:33,070
efficiency deadlocked scenarios are

445
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:35,550
avoided by synchronization between all

446
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:53,830
vehicles both autonomous and man

447
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:57,520
precious time is safe Auto Taj is the

448
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:59,500
v2x chipset market pioneer I gave them

449
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,170
like two seconds of advertisement

450
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:05,050
because they make such cool videos and I

451
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:07,950
think they worth it this looks very good

452
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:10,960
and it will be very useful this is about

453
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:14,710
10% of what v2x technology would enable

454
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:17,710
us to do it will also enable us to have

455
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:19,540
less car accidents if you as a driver

456
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:23,410
gets stuck on the side of the load or

457
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:25,210
the v2x v2v safety protocol would

458
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:26,740
publish to the other cars that you are

459
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:28,810
around so when they're approaching you

460
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:33,480
if they don't see you all of the drivers

461
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:35,830
will have an alert v2x is used to help

462
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:38,970
chain accidents so if you do an

463
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:41,110
emergency break instead of every driver

464
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:43,420
seeing it with their eyes and

465
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:47,020
understanding that those could be an

466
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:52,660
accident a pop-up will alert them in the

467
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:54,879
car which is cool but of course for

468
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:57,540
every new connected technology we have

469
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:01,660
the fear of new buffer overflows

470
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:04,600
payloads that could hack the car and I

471
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:07,180
don't want to focus on that but for an

472
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:10,240
example v2x payload is s in one based

473
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:12,760
and here I took a picture from the CVE

474
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:16,000
list searching for s in one pass sells

475
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:18,940
more than 120 CBS 4s and one Power Cells

476
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,370
which is a lot and since embedded

477
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:24,940
developers have the tendency to develop

478
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:27,820
the own parser each time you can be sure

479
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:29,590
that we will see new power cells with

480
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:32,139
new vulnerabilities that will add up to

481
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:35,549
this list but

482
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:38,470
since all of the data being sent around

483
00:22:35,549 --> 00:22:42,070
is the data the cows will use in

484
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:45,390
decision-making and should trust what

485
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:48,399
we'll see that having a fake v2x model

486
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:51,400
even by building one or hacking to the

487
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,530
v2x model in my car I as a hacker would

488
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:56,410
be able to do a lot of bad thing without

489
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:59,710
a memory corruptions or buffer overflows

490
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:02,260
for example I could create false traffic

491
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:04,540
we saw in the video there was a there

492
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:06,700
was a vehicle stopping after receiving a

493
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:08,409
v2x message I could just spam those

494
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:11,140
messages around and all of the vehicles

495
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:13,750
will stop that could be harassed for we

496
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:16,290
could force emergency breaks if

497
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:20,830
autonomous cars are supposed to trust

498
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:23,290
emergency brake messages and break we

499
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:25,059
could make an autonomous cars break

500
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:28,000
hopefully the driver behind them is

501
00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:31,178
doesn't have v2x technology and they

502
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,240
could crash and we could generate false

503
00:23:31,179 --> 00:23:36,160
alarms and this is only the other those

504
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,350
who are only be 2x safety messages but

505
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:43,210
there are so many more capabilities over

506
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:46,678
this new technology that this would

507
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:49,960
allow a hacker to do so many things that

508
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:53,230
now are not capable via wireless

509
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:57,400
technology over our cars but did you

510
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:58,030
thought about it those the RFC's for the

511
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,950
v2x

512
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:02,620
protocols are being published by the

513
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:05,559
european union and they think a lot of

514
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:08,229
security when building them every v2x

515
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:10,870
model has to have a certificate and

516
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:13,840
every v2x message needs to be signed

517
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:16,780
which is nice unless you just hack your

518
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:19,178
own v2x device and use its certificate

519
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:22,510
and they they are thinking of the

520
00:24:19,179 --> 00:24:24,610
solution on how to handle this i had i

521
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:26,169
started to build the slide about it but

522
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:29,020
we decided we didn't have time

523
00:24:26,169 --> 00:24:31,630
it was the proposed solution and then

524
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:36,040
the new vulnerabilities those digital

525
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:39,300
solutions create so this would have a

526
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:42,760
lot of problems of potential problems

527
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:45,710
finishing with v 2x the number of third

528
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:47,660
trend of the automotive industry

529
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:51,530
that is easily competing with the first

530
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:53,900
two ones are electrical vehicles the

531
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:56,660
charging that we know has developed from

532
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:59,660
buying gasoline in a store two fuel

533
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:01,610
stations and now we see electrical

534
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:03,920
charging stations being scattered around

535
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:05,810
more than 1 million stay of those

536
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:08,750
station of scattering only in China

537
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:12,320
which is the leading country of

538
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:14,360
electrical charging and I want to set up

539
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,470
the terminology for electrical charging

540
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:18,080
because this is an interesting

541
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:19,730
technology first we have the EVSE

542
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,870
electrical vehicle supply equipment

543
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:27,380
which is this one this is basically a

544
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:29,629
charging station on the other hand we

545
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:33,050
have the PV plug-in electric vehicle

546
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:35,330
which is a vehicle with an ECU electric

547
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:36,919
car a command control unit that is

548
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:40,460
connected to the batteries and

549
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:44,630
responsible for charging your car so

550
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:48,260
those get connected and the electron

551
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:51,140
starts to fill your tank and charge up

552
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:53,870
the batteries but you would maybe be

553
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:56,660
surprised to hear that over this

554
00:25:53,870 --> 00:26:00,290
electrical connection there is also a

555
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:01,820
tcp/ip connections over power line

556
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:04,879
communication this is not a new

557
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:07,520
technology you are able to go today to

558
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,500
the nearest electrical shop and buy PLC

559
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,960
to etholon is plug ins plugging in in

560
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:14,870
your house and have Ethernet connection

561
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:18,620
between computers that are connected to

562
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:21,530
the same electrical source but they did

563
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:25,939
develop new technology specifically for

564
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:31,070
automotive a particle of PLC called home

565
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:34,250
hope a green Phi a v HP GPA V I think

566
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:38,030
it's the longest abbreviation by now or

567
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:42,380
for protocol the commonly used and you

568
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:46,280
might might think why do we need a TCP

569
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:47,960
connection to charge our batteries when

570
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:51,020
you use regular batteries you do not

571
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:53,540
connect them to them by TCP and we need

572
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:55,760
us we do need that for two reasons two

573
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:57,920
reasons two main reasons the first one

574
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,580
is that you don't want our batteries to

575
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,710
explode

576
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:04,580
and different batteries works

577
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:07,880
differently the car by itself will tell

578
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:11,090
the EVC what charging method that does

579
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:13,610
it support AC or DC what current it

580
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:15,620
should use and more information like

581
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:17,658
that you could start to think what you

582
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:20,090
can do if you could do something to that

583
00:27:17,659 --> 00:27:22,370
connection but the second reason we need

584
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:24,769
it is because we're lazy and we don't

585
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:26,689
want to pass our credit card after we're

586
00:27:24,769 --> 00:27:29,659
finished with the charging we want to

587
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:31,279
get back to our car and go away so they

588
00:27:29,659 --> 00:27:33,500
said since they had they have to have

589
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:35,570
this TCP connection to charge your car

590
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:38,269
they already added the automatic

591
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:41,539
charging so this issue will save your

592
00:27:38,269 --> 00:27:43,309
credit card and the EVC will send you

593
00:27:41,539 --> 00:27:45,289
the bill in the mail after you've

594
00:27:43,309 --> 00:27:48,649
finished the communication you don't

595
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:52,779
need to swipe or beep your card and and

596
00:27:48,649 --> 00:27:56,539
that could be useful now this is the

597
00:27:52,779 --> 00:27:58,610
charging port O'Call stack the v2g

598
00:27:56,539 --> 00:27:59,240
vehicle-to-grid which is not a part of

599
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:02,178
v2x

600
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:06,230
and surprisingly this is the new

601
00:28:02,179 --> 00:28:11,539
protocol stack you can see HP GP the

602
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:14,529
left left-hand part is the electrical

603
00:28:11,539 --> 00:28:17,210
and management protocols

604
00:28:14,529 --> 00:28:19,639
daelin first decide how to charge the

605
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:25,100
car and then there's a UDP session

606
00:28:19,639 --> 00:28:27,260
sending STP data which is a start of the

607
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:30,110
of the encryption and certificate and

608
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:33,679
afterwards IP connection TCP connection

609
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:36,678
TLS connection and XML payloads being

610
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:38,389
sent to our car of course this could

611
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:41,510
result in vulnerabilities because we

612
00:28:38,389 --> 00:28:44,899
know that XML parsers tend to have

613
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:47,779
security vulnerabilities also all of the

614
00:28:44,899 --> 00:28:51,559
Newton protocols that are supposed to be

615
00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:56,240
implemented could have heavy edge cases

616
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:59,389
and other implementation bugs but what's

617
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:02,179
important for me that you understand is

618
00:28:59,389 --> 00:29:05,029
you are going to have a car drive with

619
00:29:02,179 --> 00:29:06,770
it around go up into a random device

620
00:29:05,029 --> 00:29:11,260
someone put on the street which is a

621
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:14,529
charging station connect your car to it

622
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:17,889
via TCP trust the information it sends

623
00:29:14,529 --> 00:29:19,269
you and anyone could put devices on the

624
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:21,969
street they can go at night

625
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:24,760
pull up a normal charging station place

626
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:26,230
a new one or just a hack or just hack a

627
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:29,379
charging station on the street

628
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:32,679
and since you trust this device you

629
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:36,070
could be vulnerable to attack over this

630
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:41,409
connection so also the protocols that we

631
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:44,678
trust the ipv6 TCP TLS they also have

632
00:29:41,409 --> 00:29:46,600
vulnerabilities so I have in a list from

633
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:48,940
last month group of vulnerabilities

634
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:52,389
published by Army slabs called the Elgin

635
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:55,019
11 those are the vulnerabilities of the

636
00:29:52,389 --> 00:29:56,199
even abilities in the tcp/ip stack of

637
00:29:55,019 --> 00:29:58,149
vxworks

638
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:00,970
rigs work is a real-time operation

639
00:29:58,149 --> 00:30:05,439
system commonly used for embedded

640
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:09,789
devices and also in the automotive world

641
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:12,450
and basically since the way you decide

642
00:30:09,789 --> 00:30:15,730
if you trust the EVs is by using TLS

643
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:20,580
using any of those vulnerabilities on

644
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:23,769
your car would result in code execution

645
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:27,340
against you which is bad since the TCP

646
00:30:23,769 --> 00:30:30,370
and IP all of them are prior to the TLS

647
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:32,769
connection you you wouldn't be safe

648
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:36,340
because of the encryption or because of

649
00:30:32,769 --> 00:30:39,639
the certificate and this is a very very

650
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:42,490
big threat I just think about it you

651
00:30:39,639 --> 00:30:44,799
come you plug your car and then an

652
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:47,110
attacker attacks you over the

653
00:30:44,799 --> 00:31:02,168
electricity it looks something like this

654
00:30:47,110 --> 00:31:03,879
a malicious TVC sends your electrical

655
00:31:02,169 --> 00:31:06,250
connection sends your data over this

656
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:10,210
connection and then your vehicle is gone

657
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:16,360
and you can think what could a hacker do

658
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:19,539
with after hacking your battery ECU so

659
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:22,779
first they can charge your credit card

660
00:31:19,539 --> 00:31:25,120
and not your car this is a pun it's a

661
00:31:22,779 --> 00:31:28,480
world play since this

662
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:30,939
to you is responsible for the the

663
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,450
billing at the end for making sure that

664
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:35,680
the amount of energy you got is

665
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:39,600
equivalent to at the amount of money you

666
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:43,870
have to pay if this ECU is hacked then

667
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:46,620
the EVs it could charge you for how much

668
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:49,030
it wants and nothing will stop him and

669
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:52,239
this is bad because this way they can

670
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:57,340
steal money and we like our money the

671
00:31:52,240 --> 00:32:01,420
other thing is that I'm hacking the DCU

672
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:03,159
the better ACU it is possible to hack at

673
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:06,760
the device and the components inside

674
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:08,740
your car all of the ECU's are connected

675
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:14,110
either by canvas or iphone a little more

676
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:18,130
and a hacker could possibly hack your

677
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:23,020
engine or your brakes or any other kind

678
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:23,440
of car control component and that's a

679
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:27,460
bad thing

680
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:30,280
using a malicious EVC you could crash

681
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:34,830
any car that is connected that is being

682
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:34,830
connected to it one hour after it left

683
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:41,199
we'll go to the last part of our

684
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:44,710
presentation and I'm passing the remote

685
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,870
to yonathan yeah okay so Leon has just

686
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:49,690
described a scenario in which an

687
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:52,030
attacker needs physical access to a

688
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:55,240
charging station in order to do bad

689
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:57,580
things but what if all of these charging

690
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:00,160
stations are connected somehow to

691
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:02,559
centralized management now this is very

692
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:04,960
reasonable because we like connecting

693
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:08,980
things in the 21st century or at least

694
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:12,130
in the second decade of the 21st century

695
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:13,900
and these EVs cease they need to

696
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:15,580
interact with you somehow so if they

697
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:17,080
want to send you the billing email they

698
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:19,840
have to be connected to the internet

699
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:22,419
somehow and if you want to update them

700
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,580
with new rates they need to be connected

701
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:27,340
to the internet somehow you get the

702
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:29,439
cause now once all these things are

703
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:31,300
connected to clouds that are quite

704
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,550
specific to vehicles because that's what

705
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:37,090
they're charging they are susceptible to

706
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:39,129
remote attacks it's not only just moving

707
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:42,939
around physically in the country

708
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:45,870
and trying to attack EVs es but now if I

709
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:48,850
for example leverage the vulnerability

710
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:50,949
by reverse engineering the application

711
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:53,020
used to communicate with this cloud for

712
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:53,679
management for the technician whatever

713
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:56,080
it may be

714
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:58,450
and I was able to somehow manipulate the

715
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:01,360
cloud to run my own code on one of these

716
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:04,120
EBS sees then probably I can run my own

717
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:06,010
code on many of these CVS's now the

718
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:08,168
scenario here gets a little bit more

719
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:12,940
complicated but we're trying to portray

720
00:34:08,168 --> 00:34:16,000
a way or new ways through each attackers

721
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:17,500
can reach your car in manners that maybe

722
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,830
the manufacturers didn't even think

723
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:23,440
about so this tcp/ip connection maybe is

724
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:25,750
not the thing that gets the most

725
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,580
attention in the car like your

726
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:29,560
infotainment system that now by now

727
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:31,840
everyone knows that infotainment systems

728
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:36,369
are connected and are susceptible to

729
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:39,159
attacks now not only Evo sees are

730
00:34:36,369 --> 00:34:42,070
connected to centralized management but

731
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:44,919
also cars so in the beginning of the

732
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:50,109
presentation we've showed how since

733
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:52,029
about 2015 a lot of cars began being

734
00:34:50,109 --> 00:34:54,668
connected to the Internet and in fact if

735
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:57,940
you go to Europe over 50 percent of the

736
00:34:54,668 --> 00:35:01,240
cars currently sold in Europe come

737
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:05,140
bundled with Internet connection to the

738
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:07,450
cloud now this is not like 2015 only for

739
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:10,690
your infotainment needs but this

740
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:12,700
actually connects critical issues within

741
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:15,280
the car to the Internet

742
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:17,799
now why would I do that because I am a

743
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:20,530
car manufacturer and I want to know for

744
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:23,350
example if there are issues in your car

745
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:25,960
I want to know if any of the ECU's is

746
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:27,880
malfunctioning I don't have to wait for

747
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:30,850
you to go to the garage once a year and

748
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:32,920
then maybe the garage person reports

749
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:35,740
back to me as the manufacturer maybe he

750
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:37,930
does not I can collect the telemetry and

751
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:41,529
I can send them to myself and process

752
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:45,430
them and maybe as a manufacturer I can

753
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:48,820
use this to realize if my specific model

754
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:51,040
has issues maybe I can use it to even

755
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:52,640
somehow fix these issues which will

756
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,890
refer to in a moment

757
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,990
so now you know that cars nowadays

758
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:58,850
connect to the Internet and they don't

759
00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:01,520
only use it to stream your songs over

760
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:04,790
Spotify but actually to do some quite

761
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:07,070
serious things now unfortunately we

762
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:09,590
cannot tell you about very sassy things

763
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:12,920
that we found but instead we'll have a

764
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:15,620
little bit of imagination and an

765
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:19,040
activity here to imagine what can a

766
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:22,759
hacker do with access or manipulation of

767
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:24,950
the vehicle cloud so for example you

768
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:27,050
have some normal stuff you have the user

769
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:29,720
the clients private information which is

770
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:32,230
quite a big deal nowadays with gdpr and

771
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:34,580
new regulations in the market and

772
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:37,100
consumers are very concerned about this

773
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:39,560
but it's quite normal you have credit

774
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:42,380
cards which already starts being quite a

775
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:45,110
larger deal and maybe you have om

776
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:47,600
secrets so for example some secret keys

777
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:50,330
used in a car manufacturing process I

778
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:53,000
don't know but these things are not

779
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:55,279
extremely unique to the vehicle industry

780
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,820
these things are things that you can

781
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:00,650
pretty much find in other IT clouds for

782
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:02,540
applications for example they have

783
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:04,820
secrets they have private information

784
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:06,710
many times they are able to charge you

785
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:08,930
for some things so this is not very

786
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:10,820
automotive specific what is more

787
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:13,339
automotive specific and then a little

788
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:16,130
more juicy is first of all your GPS

789
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:18,020
coordinates some people and the richer

790
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:21,290
you are the more problematic it is for

791
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:23,750
you usually the extremely rich people

792
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:25,520
are the most concern for the ability to

793
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:27,710
track them

794
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,780
the GPS coordinate is something that is

795
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:32,030
measured by your car and often

796
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:33,800
communicated to the backend of the

797
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:36,320
manufacturer for the sake of

798
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:40,010
decision-making so for example I have to

799
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:42,230
know in the very basic manner to which

800
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:44,390
specific server is your car supposed to

801
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:46,370
connect and this is according to your

802
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:48,259
car's location this is the most basic

803
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:49,910
thing that you can do with it but it's

804
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:52,330
also useful for a lot of other things

805
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:55,190
and this is why it's often communicated

806
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:58,430
more juicy stuff that I can do is that

807
00:37:55,190 --> 00:38:02,270
manufacturers now offer us the consumers

808
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:03,169
these same remote functions that were

809
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:05,980
priorly

810
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:08,859
offered by third-party vendors they are

811
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:10,960
there's land that for saying are not

812
00:38:08,859 --> 00:38:13,270
really forcing but encouraging people to

813
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:15,700
install third-party equipment in their

814
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:18,700
cars because these features are not

815
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:21,399
available by OEMs is to say the least

816
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:23,049
problematic and also they want to gain

817
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,060
money because they want to sell as many

818
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:28,030
cars that's essentially what they're

819
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:32,140
doing here so remote unlock features are

820
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:34,810
now official features of the car clouds

821
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:37,930
so this is also something that if I'm

822
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:39,880
able to conduct an identity theft on a

823
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:43,029
car cloud which is not something unheard

824
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:45,250
of in most cloud applications right you

825
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:48,400
can hear about vulnerabilities like this

826
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:50,530
all the time then perhaps I can gather

827
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,230
information about the location of the

828
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:55,960
car or I can even unlock it remotely

829
00:38:53,230 --> 00:39:01,270
which the more expensive the car the

830
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:02,980
more problematic it is and then we can

831
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:05,500
think about a little bit of futuristic

832
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:08,740
stuff this is an exercise I did with

833
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:13,180
myself about maybe next generation so

834
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:15,569
the 2025 sci-fi cars but when you think

835
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:18,970
about uber and about shared

836
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:22,720
transportation this is very likely to be

837
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:25,180
one of the first cars that converts to

838
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:27,580
being autonomous because it is much

839
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:30,490
easier that when you open Oberer and

840
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:33,220
order a cab what gets to you is not a

841
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:35,350
human driver that can protest and say

842
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:37,930
that he's not earning enough but rather

843
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:39,640
just a car and you don't care about the

844
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:41,799
car's rights you only care about

845
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:44,920
driver's rights so this is very useful

846
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:48,820
for companies like uber like lyft like

847
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:50,680
grab and perhaps sometimes in the future

848
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:53,560
public national public transportation

849
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:56,470
companies bus industry and when you

850
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:59,470
order an uber there is going to be or

851
00:39:56,470 --> 00:40:01,689
there has to be some kind of centralized

852
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:04,209
management that basically takes the

853
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:06,460
autonomous taxi and tells it okay this

854
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:09,210
is where you have to go now now if if

855
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:11,650
this is taken over we're on problem

856
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:13,480
another thing that I could think of is

857
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:16,510
the next generation of police

858
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:18,760
enforcement so perhaps some governments

859
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:19,750
could collect legal information of

860
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,790
course this will still

861
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:24,460
debated in the high courts of the EU

862
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:26,619
about privacy versus the ability to

863
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:29,859
protect the citizens but perhaps they

864
00:40:26,619 --> 00:40:31,570
can collect information and with vehicle

865
00:40:29,859 --> 00:40:33,549
to vehicle communication that will

866
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:35,380
involve sending information to the cloud

867
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:37,090
as well they could collect this

868
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:39,970
information process it and perhaps

869
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:44,320
decide that a specific car now needs to

870
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:46,930
stop and if they are given access to the

871
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:49,119
cars remotely even slight access even

872
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:52,529
for just putting on some notifications

873
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:55,900
or stuff like that this is also a

874
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:58,750
futuristic possibility with the vehicle

875
00:40:55,900 --> 00:41:00,670
cloud and with that I'll leave your

876
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:04,000
imagination to it because the the cloud

877
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:05,200
is the limit here now a word about over

878
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,950
the air that was mentioned in the

879
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:11,230
previous slide but I ignored it most

880
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:14,049
modern cars are connected to the

881
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:16,210
Internet and one of the most major

882
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:19,480
things that the OEMs want to do with

883
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:23,290
this is the ability to update your ECU's

884
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:25,630
remotely now why do they need to do that

885
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:27,369
because they have bugs because they want

886
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:28,960
to improve their features because maybe

887
00:41:27,369 --> 00:41:31,450
they want to install some features that

888
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:33,580
didn't exist before because maybe there

889
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:36,310
are security vulnerabilities that they

890
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:38,500
want to patch and up until now all these

891
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:40,990
things required you to go and take your

892
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:43,630
car to the garage and the technician to

893
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:45,729
flash your issues over the OBD port that

894
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:48,460
we've discussed but with over-the-air

895
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:51,310
updates the manufacturers can facilitate

896
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:53,080
this to update your ECU's remotely and

897
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:55,540
this is a huge advantage for car

898
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:59,619
manufacturers now the problem with this

899
00:41:55,540 --> 00:42:03,460
is if I'm able to force the over-the-air

900
00:41:59,619 --> 00:42:07,089
mechanism to deliver my own stuff I can

901
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:09,070
own a hell lot of vehicles at once and

902
00:42:07,089 --> 00:42:10,570
this would probably look like this an

903
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:12,700
attacker has compromised the vehicle

904
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:14,770
cloud and is able to craft a malicious

905
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:17,470
update the update is delivered to the

906
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:19,330
cars multiple cars now now it's not just

907
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:22,899
attacking a single car over Bluetooth

908
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:24,700
and the next morning BAM you wake up and

909
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:28,960
the very least that can happen to your

910
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:32,560
car is some kind of low criticality

911
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:35,500
vulnerability that is just popping up

912
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:38,980
message on your screen now this may not

913
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:41,260
risk your life but is sure to cause a

914
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:43,000
lot of pain and financial damage to the

915
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:44,980
car manufacturers and a lot of annoyance

916
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,960
for the users and this is to say the

917
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:50,440
very least of course I mean if I'm able

918
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:56,980
to flash other ECU's then I can do a

919
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:59,140
whole lot more damage massively so we

920
00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:02,109
spoke a lot about a lot of bad things

921
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:04,598
that can happen but we'd like to end

922
00:43:02,109 --> 00:43:06,819
with kind of a smile on their faces and

923
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:10,359
look a little bit on the bright side and

924
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:13,030
the bright side is that OMS invest so

925
00:43:10,359 --> 00:43:16,089
much effort in trying to make their

926
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:21,490
products as secure as they can I cannot

927
00:43:16,089 --> 00:43:23,380
express how much budget is used to make

928
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:25,868
sure that they hire the best security

929
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:28,599
consultancy services that they have and

930
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:30,490
it's also nice for us not to say that

931
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:32,859
we're the best but that pays the bills

932
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:35,020
and also what's really nice is that

933
00:43:32,859 --> 00:43:37,420
connected autonomous cars would be

934
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:40,569
really awesome this is going to change

935
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:42,400
our lives and I think it's for the good

936
00:43:40,569 --> 00:43:44,500
it will take a while to adapt to it and

937
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:47,050
of course people will always still want

938
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:49,599
to drive but this is going to change our

939
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:52,150
lives and the way we interact with the

940
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:57,310
world I think not any less than how

941
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:59,710
smartphones changed our lives okay

942
00:43:57,310 --> 00:44:02,259
do you want to do this to summarize if

943
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:04,810
you just enter the room so what we

944
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:07,030
talked about are the risks of everything

945
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:09,849
being connected the new attack vectors

946
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:13,119
coming up Bluetooth Wi-Fi NFC rhetorics

947
00:44:09,849 --> 00:44:14,980
PLC and more there are many new

948
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:18,910
technologies that we haven't have time

949
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:20,470
to discuss and the opportunities that we

950
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:22,720
talked about in the end there's going to

951
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:26,230
be less accidents and life changing

952
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:29,169
technologies and as a big thing this is

953
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:31,750
for the good now you can ask us anything

954
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:34,599
and we'll see the question soon I see we

955
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:37,990
have 15 minutes so we could do two

956
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:40,210
things we can do the questions or we

957
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:42,700
could speak about the health of

958
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:45,700
vulnerable 'ti technological explanation

959
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:47,740
a tech explanation

960
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:49,600
if we take about nine minutes earlier

961
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:50,740
and Jonathan wanted to do a little bit

962
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:53,830
something a little bit different give

963
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:56,290
you two options either talk about yeah

964
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:59,230
we can have 15 minutes the question of

965
00:44:56,290 --> 00:45:01,870
questions or a tech dive to help the cup

966
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:03,970
and six minutes of question it's already

967
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:05,799
instable yes yes vote but raise your

968
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:10,209
hands please I'd like to have the tech

969
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:11,560
dive okay okay so that is happening yeah

970
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:13,780
that's good

971
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:15,640
and so if we are afraid to just

972
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:19,450
accidentally press space so there's a

973
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:21,129
blank slide and then we go into the head

974
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:25,080
to cut vulnerability it was discovered

975
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:27,730
in 2018 by Barack ASPI of say motive

976
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:30,340
baracus P is what you call in in Hebrew

977
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:32,950
a scary cannon to attack my friend it

978
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:37,030
means he's really good at the

979
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:40,270
vulnerability research um and he found a

980
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:43,230
state machine bug in blue SDK and Sukup

981
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:47,650
implementation blue SDK is a provider of

982
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:50,380
Bluetooth Stax for embedded companies

983
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:53,410
developing companies which is used by

984
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:57,100
more than 100 million devices globally

985
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:59,710
part of them are autonomous ECU and

986
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:02,170
autonomous automotive ECU's but not all

987
00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:04,810
of them it's also other IOT devices

988
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:07,990
around the world and and here you can

989
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:10,150
see the Bluetooth stack the many

990
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:12,250
particles inside it I I will only dive

991
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:14,080
into what we need to know to understand

992
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:17,110
the vulnerability but what we need to

993
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:22,990
know is that l2 crap is being used

994
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:27,160
somehow like the IP of Bluetooth it

995
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:28,990
passes messages coming inside it's open

996
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:31,810
Bluetooth channels which are talk about

997
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:36,850
the next slide and over it the some

998
00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:40,720
other some other protocols specifically

999
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:46,150
SDP which we'll show in a little bit so

1000
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:50,950
how I look up works first as a device

1001
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:53,080
you connect to the Bluetooth service you

1002
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:56,080
connect by sending an l2 cap connect

1003
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:58,828
message with the PSM protocol ID you

1004
00:46:56,080 --> 00:47:02,230
wish to connect you so it

1005
00:46:58,829 --> 00:47:05,079
Bluetooth station has few services and

1006
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:07,599
you need to specify to which surface do

1007
00:47:05,079 --> 00:47:12,039
you wish to connect specifically PSM one

1008
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:15,460
is the SDP and then the station replies

1009
00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:18,549
with an L 2 Cup Connect responds with

1010
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:22,119
with an ID channel and then to fire it's

1011
00:47:18,549 --> 00:47:25,839
something like a port anticipate the IP

1012
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:28,930
the station opens a new channel this

1013
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:31,960
time channel 41 hacks this is a random

1014
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:34,149
number that we chose and all over this

1015
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:37,240
connection over this we will use this

1016
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:40,150
channel number every time wish to send a

1017
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:43,569
message to the upper layer that we chose

1018
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:45,640
specifically one and after we received

1019
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:50,589
there the DC ID the channel ID we need

1020
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:52,740
to communicate we we as their device are

1021
00:47:50,589 --> 00:47:55,450
able to send configuration requests

1022
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:57,970
using the DC ID number that we received

1023
00:47:55,450 --> 00:48:00,339
we can configure parameters of the

1024
00:47:57,970 --> 00:48:03,189
channel for example we can configure the

1025
00:48:00,339 --> 00:48:05,440
MTU the timeout and more parameters

1026
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:07,779
which we need to know to understand this

1027
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:12,190
vulnerability is the the minimal minimal

1028
00:48:07,779 --> 00:48:13,720
Bluetooth MTU is 48 and this is taken

1029
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:17,259
from the Bluetooth specification version

1030
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:21,160
3 saying all L 2 cap implementations

1031
00:48:17,259 --> 00:48:27,039
shall support a minimum MTU of 48 which

1032
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:29,379
is exactly what I said here this is a

1033
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:33,700
set of code from reverse engineering the

1034
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:36,910
L 2 cap configuration for MTU so what

1035
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:37,359
you can see is that we get a packet data

1036
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:40,180
ater

1037
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:43,509
are being sent to it this is code of the

1038
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:45,038
blue - blue SDK so on the station I'd

1039
00:48:43,509 --> 00:48:48,130
say it saves the MTU

1040
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:52,900
save this to the channel global object

1041
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:55,509
and then checks if the size the MTU that

1042
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:58,750
we require the channel to change to is

1043
00:48:55,509 --> 00:49:01,380
smaller than the minimum if it's smaller

1044
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:04,299
than the channel is being set to invalid

1045
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:06,609
so how will it look they'll do the

1046
00:49:04,299 --> 00:49:09,400
connect cannot request get a DC ID and

1047
00:49:06,609 --> 00:49:12,340
then if we send a valid and to you like

1048
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:15,430
hex 200 with this ad we just got

1049
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:18,160
the nto will be changed and we will get

1050
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:21,000
a success message on the other hand if

1051
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:25,660
we will send an invalid MTU size

1052
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:28,630
configuration request like hex 10 the

1053
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:32,200
channel will be set to invalid so valid

1054
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:34,570
no and the NTU will be saved in the

1055
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:37,180
channel object but for an invalid

1056
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:39,750
channel we could not send messages over

1057
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:43,180
it and that's a problem

1058
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:46,540
but the get flag we see here is that the

1059
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:50,649
value stored on line four and only then

1060
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:53,830
is checked on line five so if we could

1061
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:59,350
somehow restore the channel to be valid

1062
00:49:53,830 --> 00:50:01,600
what will happen what we do is send a

1063
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:03,759
configuration request changing the MTU 4

1064
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:06,640
to 20 20 is an invalid number because

1065
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:08,740
it's lower than 48 then the channel is

1066
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:11,980
being invalid in there and the value 20

1067
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:13,870
is being saved and afterwards we said

1068
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:15,790
the configuration request again for the

1069
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:18,370
phone above parameter called flash

1070
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:21,279
timeout and change it the time with

1071
00:50:18,370 --> 00:50:24,310
number to a different number in the code

1072
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:27,010
since this command was successful the

1073
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:29,380
channel is being set to be valid at the

1074
00:50:27,010 --> 00:50:33,400
end and now what we get is a valid

1075
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:35,710
channel with an MTU lower than 48 that

1076
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:38,470
of course could cause a problem because

1077
00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:40,300
l2 cap is responsible the LT cup the

1078
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:43,000
protocol implementation is responsible

1079
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:46,270
for setting the channel MTU for the

1080
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:49,270
upper layers the upper layers trust l2

1081
00:50:46,270 --> 00:50:52,330
cap to do it correctly and if we see the

1082
00:50:49,270 --> 00:50:56,080
upper layer SDP it's doing some

1083
00:50:52,330 --> 00:50:58,299
fragmentation the it takes the value of

1084
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:00,819
the MTU from the l2 cup layer from the

1085
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:06,820
global of journal objects that we saw

1086
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:10,420
this here and tu it subtracts 9 out of

1087
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:13,420
it this is the SDP header size and saves

1088
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:16,570
it into valuable curve a level called

1089
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:19,390
available size for fragment this is

1090
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:23,500
basically the parameter that will be

1091
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:24,670
copied after a few functions into mem

1092
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:30,089
copy

1093
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:36,069
and copying information into a buffer so

1094
00:51:30,089 --> 00:51:38,589
if our MTU is 48 minus 9 we get 39 which

1095
00:51:36,069 --> 00:51:40,930
is an okay size because the the

1096
00:51:38,589 --> 00:51:45,339
buffer it's being copied into is bigger

1097
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:48,069
than 39 but if the MTU supplied to a to

1098
00:51:45,339 --> 00:51:51,069
s DP is lower than 9

1099
00:51:48,069 --> 00:51:53,589
for example 8 then the available size

1100
00:51:51,069 --> 00:51:59,200
for fragment will cause an integer

1101
00:51:53,589 --> 00:52:03,009
overflow resulting in a FF FF FF FF FF

1102
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:07,118
size which is much bigger than the when

1103
00:52:03,010 --> 00:52:09,910
the buffer that the data attributes of s

1104
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:12,819
DB are being stored into and what we get

1105
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:15,520
is we set and low MTU that would result

1106
00:52:12,819 --> 00:52:20,529
in an integer overflow causing a buffer

1107
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:23,170
overflow and about one hour of Baudette

1108
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:25,930
presentation slides explaining what we

1109
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:29,109
do next to exploit this in Barack's

1110
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:31,660
research you can find most of them on

1111
00:52:29,109 --> 00:52:33,549
the on the website of say motive we have

1112
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:35,770
the full report of the health governor

1113
00:52:33,549 --> 00:52:38,500
ability but eventually what we get is

1114
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:41,109
profit being able to hack any device

1115
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:43,150
that is using Bluest decay of course

1116
00:52:41,109 --> 00:52:46,509
this vulnerability was disclosed you can

1117
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:50,079
see the CVE in our presentation where I

1118
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:52,440
talked about it before and now we have

1119
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:52,440
time for questions

1120
00:52:53,579 --> 00:52:57,339
ok great

1121
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:58,780
before I throw it to the audience I

1122
00:52:57,339 --> 00:53:02,920
usually throw it to the audience first

1123
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:05,670
but this time in on slide oh we have you

1124
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:07,839
seriously uploaded question 36 volts

1125
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:10,000
unfixable yeah I've never seen such a

1126
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:11,589
high number and the second one is 34

1127
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:16,869
words I think they deserve to be

1128
00:53:11,589 --> 00:53:20,229
answered first Wow yeah so Oh 38

1129
00:53:16,869 --> 00:53:23,920
Wow yeah I mean seriously you guys get

1130
00:53:20,229 --> 00:53:25,598
awards for getting such an opponent the

1131
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,499
first one you take the first two I think

1132
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:30,609
yeah sure

1133
00:53:26,499 --> 00:53:33,249
okay so as Israelis we say yes to

1134
00:53:30,609 --> 00:53:35,440
anything that any other external company

1135
00:53:33,249 --> 00:53:37,419
that is a potential client asks us if we

1136
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:39,099
can do so we don't only do a

1137
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:41,229
vulnerability research but we don't also

1138
00:53:39,099 --> 00:53:44,109
do consulting and as such I've been

1139
00:53:41,229 --> 00:53:47,140
consulting to car manufacturers exactly

1140
00:53:44,109 --> 00:53:50,380
on this so there is a lot of effort on

1141
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:52,960
secure design there are dedicated secure

1142
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:55,989
architects security architects for big

1143
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:58,509
projects both for the car and for the

1144
00:53:55,989 --> 00:54:01,269
braking systems and the answer to this

1145
00:53:58,509 --> 00:54:02,829
question is very much yes and I would

1146
00:54:01,269 --> 00:54:05,468
add that since a motive we have a team

1147
00:54:02,829 --> 00:54:08,589
of I think more than 12 security

1148
00:54:05,469 --> 00:54:11,469
architectures doing this 100% of the

1149
00:54:08,589 --> 00:54:13,299
time and we said in the presentation

1150
00:54:11,469 --> 00:54:16,259
that all of the manufacturers are

1151
00:54:13,299 --> 00:54:20,499
investing a lot into securing the cars

1152
00:54:16,259 --> 00:54:22,900
so they do work very hard on it the

1153
00:54:20,499 --> 00:54:26,618
second question is I want to hack TV

1154
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:29,259
charges by being zapped with 100k volt

1155
00:54:26,619 --> 00:54:32,619
it scares me please advise I had the

1156
00:54:29,259 --> 00:54:35,589
same feeling I am when we conducted the

1157
00:54:32,619 --> 00:54:40,809
similar research and what you find out

1158
00:54:35,589 --> 00:54:47,249
is you can buy development boards of HP

1159
00:54:40,809 --> 00:54:49,690
GP and every IV charger has a connection

1160
00:54:47,249 --> 00:54:52,598
bypassing the electrical scary

1161
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:54,249
connection that you can you can tug plug

1162
00:54:52,599 --> 00:54:57,400
into the development boards though

1163
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:59,049
pretty expensive it's like five hundred

1164
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:03,400
dollars each which you can buy them

1165
00:54:59,049 --> 00:55:06,160
online just all of them and try to use

1166
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:09,999
them it could be a little hard to set up

1167
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:13,149
to build a set up but it is possible the

1168
00:55:09,999 --> 00:55:16,919
two lines called CP and VP you connect

1169
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:19,599
them and hopefully everything will work

1170
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:21,729
you have to no hardware to do that yeah

1171
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:24,130
but you get the manual so after like two

1172
00:55:21,729 --> 00:55:25,509
weeks it will probably work yeah and

1173
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:28,579
also is this someone from the audience

1174
00:55:25,509 --> 00:55:32,989
because this definitely is worth

1175
00:55:28,579 --> 00:55:36,109
but you already got swag this is yeah

1176
00:55:32,989 --> 00:55:39,650
this is definitely worth swag yeah yeah

1177
00:55:36,109 --> 00:55:42,709
who was that what's the first question

1178
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:44,839
nice Jean had 41 votes well I have your

1179
00:55:42,709 --> 00:55:48,649
gift here we have double swag name is

1180
00:55:44,839 --> 00:55:51,619
Leo probably from home so Liam if you if

1181
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:53,239
you see us hop here to Singapore or send

1182
00:55:51,619 --> 00:55:54,499
an email or something and we will get a

1183
00:55:53,239 --> 00:55:56,569
swag delivered to you

1184
00:55:54,499 --> 00:55:59,029
so before we go to the next question

1185
00:55:56,569 --> 00:56:01,279
from slide I ride I want to throw the

1186
00:55:59,029 --> 00:56:14,839
throw open to the floor any questions

1187
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:17,239
from the floor yes sir it's about add

1188
00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:19,249
zoom in on the first question that made

1189
00:56:17,239 --> 00:56:23,089
you that as Israeli of course you are

1190
00:56:19,249 --> 00:56:25,640
sorry yes I can do it up what is I mean

1191
00:56:23,089 --> 00:56:29,660
from a practical perspective I mean I

1192
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:31,759
take the example of SCADA and ICS those

1193
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:33,499
guys they don't understand security you

1194
00:56:31,759 --> 00:56:37,359
train them you train them you try and

1195
00:56:33,499 --> 00:56:40,339
amongst it your programming and so

1196
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:43,910
Thurman's that is totally wrong and it

1197
00:56:40,339 --> 00:56:45,499
takes years years but on my humble

1198
00:56:43,910 --> 00:56:48,920
opinion they will never be up I mean a

1199
00:56:45,499 --> 00:56:51,919
few of them of the engineers will ever

1200
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:54,160
be able to switch their mindset so what

1201
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:56,839
has been your experience in this because

1202
00:56:54,160 --> 00:57:01,549
it's a business the one of the cars that

1203
00:56:56,839 --> 00:57:04,519
is huge and big and as far as I can see

1204
00:57:01,549 --> 00:57:06,619
it or the orders started your clients to

1205
00:57:04,519 --> 00:57:09,439
hire new engineers and youngers and when

1206
00:57:06,619 --> 00:57:12,859
a different mindset or trying and

1207
00:57:09,439 --> 00:57:14,779
forcing the mindset of our 40 50 years

1208
00:57:12,859 --> 00:57:19,670
old in general is not that easy at all

1209
00:57:14,779 --> 00:57:22,400
how is it so you're right

1210
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:24,670
these are giants and as part of our job

1211
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:27,439
as security consultants we are actually

1212
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:30,140
bureaucracy fighters and a lot of what

1213
00:57:27,439 --> 00:57:33,078
our top management does is create the

1214
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:35,558
understanding of the importance within

1215
00:57:33,079 --> 00:57:37,819
the different departments of the

1216
00:57:35,559 --> 00:57:39,589
companies with which we work okay so

1217
00:57:37,819 --> 00:57:41,750
this is a really important part of what

1218
00:57:39,589 --> 00:57:44,270
we do and we do that and

1219
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:45,710
we help them communicate better between

1220
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:47,390
the company between the different

1221
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:49,520
departments of the company because we

1222
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:52,069
and the first slide presenting sigh

1223
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:54,680
motive said end-to-end testing now this

1224
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:57,050
is sometimes just a buzzword but for us

1225
00:57:54,680 --> 00:58:00,740
we are really trying to portray

1226
00:57:57,050 --> 00:58:02,930
scenarios that are taken from the car to

1227
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:04,430
the backend from the phone or to the

1228
00:58:02,930 --> 00:58:07,549
phone and to anything that is related

1229
00:58:04,430 --> 00:58:09,410
and this requires some cooperation both

1230
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:10,850
between the OEMs and themselves the

1231
00:58:09,410 --> 00:58:13,759
different departments that they are now

1232
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:15,980
working really hard to create and there

1233
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:18,050
are tier 1 tier 2 tier 3 suppliers

1234
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:20,720
because we didn't mention that but most

1235
00:58:18,050 --> 00:58:22,820
of the automotive products and ECU's are

1236
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:24,649
not made directly by the car

1237
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:26,990
manufacturers but rather by large

1238
00:58:24,650 --> 00:58:30,050
companies like Bosch Continental Lear

1239
00:58:26,990 --> 00:58:32,509
all of these giants so it's definitely a

1240
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:34,910
struggle but it's improving so much they

1241
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:37,310
are really they are already on board at

1242
00:58:34,910 --> 00:58:41,060
least the major players in this market

1243
00:58:37,310 --> 00:58:42,980
are already on board have you heard

1244
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:44,360
anything positive about the certificate

1245
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:47,390
management for v2x

1246
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:49,490
the early specifications I've seen have

1247
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:51,470
government organizations managing these

1248
00:58:49,490 --> 00:58:54,589
certificates and since they can't manage

1249
00:58:51,470 --> 00:58:55,250
their own x.509 certificates or their

1250
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:56,840
websites

1251
00:58:55,250 --> 00:59:02,900
this is both a great opportunity and

1252
00:58:56,840 --> 00:59:06,080
terrifying yes so they do plan the OEMs

1253
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:08,360
to manage the certificates so they

1254
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:10,940
thought about giving the big OMS that

1255
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:14,930
supply with the car also to supply with

1256
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:16,940
this certificate which is a ok thing I

1257
00:59:14,930 --> 00:59:18,620
think they can do it because they have

1258
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:20,810
more incentive to do it than the

1259
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:23,569
government and because if there will be

1260
00:59:20,810 --> 00:59:26,330
a problem with the cars the other ones

1261
00:59:23,570 --> 00:59:27,740
that will suffer what they do plan to do

1262
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:29,420
and because we have time and we have

1263
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:32,959
time a minute

1264
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:37,760
have them talk about it they plan to

1265
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:39,560
have the cause report and suspected

1266
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:42,770
Liars of v2x

1267
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:46,370
so if if a car is sending a message

1268
00:59:42,770 --> 00:59:49,430
using a certificate saying that there's

1269
00:59:46,370 --> 00:59:52,160
an emergency break and the later or the

1270
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:55,368
Canada does not see your car is supposed

1271
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:58,299
to report the certificate to

1272
00:59:55,369 --> 01:00:00,799
the server and if enough cars report

1273
00:59:58,299 --> 01:00:03,049
this will result in the revoke of the

1274
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:05,690
certificate and then you won't be able

1275
01:00:03,049 --> 01:00:08,509
to send v2x messages the vulnerability

1276
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:11,930
the new vulnerabilities it creates is

1277
01:00:08,509 --> 01:00:14,029
that having enough a fake models you

1278
01:00:11,930 --> 01:00:17,450
could kick other people out you would

1279
01:00:14,029 --> 01:00:19,369
just like report them to the servers and

1280
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:22,879
then the v2x

1281
01:00:19,369 --> 01:00:23,660
devices would stop working which could

1282
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:27,259
be a bad thing

1283
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:30,220
and all of the OEMs are not that sure of

1284
01:00:27,259 --> 01:00:33,309
how to create such a reporting system

1285
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:40,910
because it's a lot of work for very

1286
01:00:33,309 --> 01:00:43,400
niche vulnerability the video X particle

1287
01:00:40,910 --> 01:00:45,589
stack is the same protocol stack they

1288
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:48,079
use the same protocols but the payload

1289
01:00:45,589 --> 01:00:51,828
in the end is a bit different so it's

1290
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:56,809
sn1 messages they make the structure of

1291
01:00:51,829 --> 01:01:01,460
the of the payload and then if if your

1292
01:00:56,809 --> 01:01:04,880
car supports the payload being published

1293
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:07,190
over there then it could talk to to your

1294
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:08,539
house but if you're all like they have

1295
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:12,440
the same certificates and the same

1296
01:01:08,539 --> 01:01:15,380
mechanism and then what could happen

1297
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:17,480
that is the small v2x suppliers of v2i

1298
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:19,910
equipment you should handle the

1299
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:21,499
certificates as well they're not sure

1300
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:23,598
how they'll do that yet

1301
01:01:21,499 --> 01:01:25,519
but they're still developing this

1302
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:27,890
technology there's a good point here

1303
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:29,299
that it requires cooperation between the

1304
01:01:27,890 --> 01:01:31,759
different manufacturers that are

1305
01:01:29,299 --> 01:01:34,009
essentially competitors so they're gonna

1306
01:01:31,759 --> 01:01:36,769
have to somehow sit in the same

1307
01:01:34,009 --> 01:01:38,660
committees and they have been so there's

1308
01:01:36,769 --> 01:01:39,950
progress there and they're there they're

1309
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:41,629
trying to take care of this and they

1310
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:44,629
have really good men on board that have

1311
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:46,579
been involved in such efforts okay I'm

1312
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:50,150
gonna squeeze in one question if I may I

1313
01:01:46,579 --> 01:01:52,579
wanted to ask that if I don't if I could

1314
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:54,520
you had a slide about bluetooth about

1315
01:01:52,579 --> 01:01:56,410
you know the

1316
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:59,920
you listed you had one slide listing all

1317
01:01:56,410 --> 01:02:02,830
the internet coasters and then it was

1318
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:04,210
Wi-Fi NFC p2x then you had one slide

1319
01:02:02,830 --> 01:02:06,009
specifically on Bluetooth

1320
01:02:04,210 --> 01:02:07,930
what about cellular have you looked at

1321
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:13,180
you know the particularly particular

1322
01:02:07,930 --> 01:02:15,190
vulnerabilities in cellular some NDA so

1323
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:16,960
cannot speak about them but I think

1324
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:20,080
there are some things available online

1325
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:24,640
and what more I will say is that usually

1326
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:27,089
the modems that are in in the chips used

1327
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:30,009
by car manufacturers are not unique so

1328
01:02:27,089 --> 01:02:32,430
the research is conducted on these

1329
01:02:30,010 --> 01:02:34,660
things for other industries as well and

1330
01:02:32,430 --> 01:02:39,759
you can look into that it's interesting

1331
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:41,560
for you with that I think all right one

1332
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:43,560
last last question because it is coffee

1333
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:45,759
break yeah we are two minute overtime

1334
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:47,080
yeah I don't know if there was at the

1335
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:50,290
beginning of your slides because I

1336
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:52,869
arrived five minutes after often when

1337
01:02:50,290 --> 01:02:56,980
I'm speaking about the seamless car like

1338
01:02:52,869 --> 01:02:58,869
be a BMW since Elena she bought well it

1339
01:02:56,980 --> 01:03:01,980
has got a sate who doesn't have say the

1340
01:02:58,869 --> 01:03:05,410
seamless what about the scenarios of

1341
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:08,140
more mobile mobile remote attacks

1342
01:03:05,410 --> 01:03:09,940
through this seamless tank as as an

1343
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:12,879
actor as a entry point

1344
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:17,380
what do you mean by seamless she never

1345
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:22,270
bought a SIM card but sure it's a

1346
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:24,220
virtual sim into the IBM SS a virtual

1347
01:03:22,270 --> 01:03:25,869
sim is not seamless it's a simple it

1348
01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:28,089
exists in the car it is configured by

1349
01:03:25,869 --> 01:03:30,220
the network and it's quite similar in

1350
01:03:28,089 --> 01:03:32,349
terms of after it's configured quite

1351
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:35,020
similar to sim cards I guess our

1352
01:03:32,349 --> 01:03:36,400
colleague here who is a mobile expert

1353
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:37,720
maybe can tell you more about it so

1354
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:40,869
there should not be any kind of

1355
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:44,439
differences as attacking us maybe in the

1356
01:03:40,869 --> 01:03:46,599
configuration protocol but ok thank you

1357
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:49,030
ok with that

1358
01:03:46,599 --> 01:03:50,890
do you have a favorite question that you

1359
01:03:49,030 --> 01:03:52,400
want to give some swag to elects your

1360
01:03:50,890 --> 01:03:55,450
question oh wow

1361
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:58,069
[Laughter]

1362
01:03:55,450 --> 01:03:59,359
yes but I would like to give a one for

1363
01:03:58,069 --> 01:04:01,910
everyone to ask a question because they

1364
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:03,680
have more and if you like the

1365
01:04:01,910 --> 01:04:05,180
presentations and then tell me and then

1366
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:08,690
I will give you another one I have like

1367
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:10,519
three more with that I would like to

1369
01:04:10,519 --> 01:04:17,328
applause to your and Jana
