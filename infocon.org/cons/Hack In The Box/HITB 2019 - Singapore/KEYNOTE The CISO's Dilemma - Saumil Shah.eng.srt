1
00:00:16,189 --> 00:00:21,859
thank you for waking up early and

2
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:24,529
sacrificing your sleep in time to put up

3
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:27,769
with me for the next one hour and thanks

4
00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:31,820
for having me back at jisuk okay without

5
00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:35,659
much further ado let me get the let me

6
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:38,780
get the talk started so this talk is

7
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:40,940
titled the seesaws dilemma and it was

8
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:44,479
actually a dilemma to figure out what to

9
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:46,399
what to talk about it so I thought let

10
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:48,769
me just recap since I have had many

11
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,500
years in the industry let me recap my

12
00:00:48,769 --> 00:00:54,199
own learnings and this time I'm here to

13
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:58,040
tell you a story of stuff I've learned

14
00:00:54,199 --> 00:01:00,890
by standing on the shoulders of giants

15
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:03,670
I formally like to thank dr. Igor Prada

16
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:06,229
Brad of Commerce Bank Kelly white

17
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,890
formerly of Zions Bank and now risk

18
00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:10,390
recon

19
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:14,180
Anoop City formerly of British Telecom

20
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:16,820
here in Shaa formerly of crystal and my

21
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:20,630
friend Thomas do lien for their thoughts

22
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:23,538
which I am going to regurgitate in this

23
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:26,479
in this talk basically I want to went

24
00:01:23,539 --> 00:01:30,140
around asking them how do you solve this

25
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:33,380
problem like I have worked as an InfoSec

26
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:36,369
vendor for many years with some of the

27
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:40,189
finest InfoSec teams in the world and

28
00:01:36,369 --> 00:01:43,280
three of them have been led by Igor

29
00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:45,589
Kelly and a nope and they've they've led

30
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,350
the team for several years done some

31
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:52,249
excellent work so I had the privilege of

32
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:55,280
learning from them both as a vendor and

33
00:01:52,249 --> 00:01:57,560
as a friend and then I just like called

34
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,119
them up and asked them like hey can I

35
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:03,920
get your thoughts and can I quote you on

36
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:05,719
it and they all of them said yes so my

37
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,060
story kind of begins where it ends and

38
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:12,799
it began in this lovely little city of

39
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:14,480
Singapore where me and Thomas give two

40
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:19,310
keynotes once upon a time at black

41
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:22,010
AirAsia in 2017 these two keynotes

42
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:24,200
kind of changed our thinking for the

43
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:26,989
worse we both end up ended up being very

44
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,390
depressed in thoughts after the keynotes

45
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,900
like okay we've now enumerated the

46
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:33,319
problem

47
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:36,530
and we don't see a solution in sight so

48
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:38,958
despair sets in but then you give the

49
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:40,849
spare some time and eventually something

50
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:44,060
works out so that's four that's where

51
00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:46,760
I'm going to present my learnings first

52
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:50,030
we'll begin with Thomas's whole thesis

53
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:53,209
in his keynote called why we're not

54
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:55,540
building a defendable Internet and he

55
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:58,489
enumerated the problems spot on

56
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:01,129
basically we're bringing the wrong army

57
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:03,349
to fight the battle than this in front

58
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:06,018
of us because the tacks are a technical

59
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:11,959
problem created by a few really skilled

60
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:14,959
individuals defense is like well trying

61
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:16,849
to take a live octopus put in throw a

62
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,989
can of Pringles while talking about

63
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:23,869
quantum dynamics on Wednesday this was

64
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:25,970
not my quote I stole it from the guy who

65
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:28,810
did the Prince of Persia speed through

66
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:31,209
from where I've taken the screenshots

67
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:37,880
smart ID

68
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:40,220
fast and place prints anyways so if

69
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:42,829
you're bringing technical solutions to a

70
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:46,940
political problem then that's not going

71
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:50,120
to compute which was title these seven

72
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:53,900
axioms of security basically began by

73
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:56,209
asking the following question who are

74
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:59,650
you most scared of and this was a slide

75
00:03:56,209 --> 00:04:03,590
from my talk who are you more scared of

76
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:08,060
attackers or auditors this is the first

77
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:09,440
dilemma that every seaso faces and you

78
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,349
want to make our decisions you can't

79
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:14,720
just ignore this question because if you

80
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:18,469
ignore this question what's gonna happen

81
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,789
is what I call the sea so mobius strip

82
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:22,910
which I'm going to talk about in a

83
00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:25,400
little while but pick which battle you

84
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:28,250
want to fight on this is the dilemma

85
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:31,880
that started that got me thinking about

86
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:35,180
how how can a sea so work on defending

87
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:37,490
the enterprise so yes I did enumerate

88
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:40,700
several measures on what it takes to

89
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:43,910
make this switch from a reactive mind

90
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:46,789
set in InfoSec to a more proactive mind

91
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:49,220
and I spewed out some some things called

92
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:51,170
like seven axioms of security cuz you've

93
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:53,510
got to make your type top title cool and

94
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:54,800
you really can't fit more than seven

95
00:04:53,510 --> 00:05:00,080
things in a single slide or a single

96
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:02,390
brain so yes there's decibel you know

97
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:08,650
thing but how do you put that into

98
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:13,940
practice so far what we really see is

99
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:16,640
basically and typically a journey of a

100
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:20,980
seesaw today can be best characterized

101
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:24,770
by a mobius strip the the average

102
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:27,470
diameter strip is about 18 months and

103
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:33,380
this journey happens it begins rather

104
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:35,660
pleasantly will close and basically when

105
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:38,270
you today you're trying to walk into a

106
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:42,530
new seesaw job life is great

107
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:45,340
I mean this this tweet was from a few

108
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:48,289
days ago which basically said that what

109
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:51,859
required about 600 K last year in annual

110
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:53,180
salaries now requires 2.5 million I mean

111
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:56,180
that says there's a staggering number

112
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,890
but do keep in mind this news is brought

113
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,810
to you by Bloomberg the same people who

114
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:02,570
brought you the super micro implant

115
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:07,250
so take it with a stack of salt and a

116
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:11,290
half anyway it's a good journey

117
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:15,020
you start off new in an organization

118
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:20,750
build up your visibility gain importance

119
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:25,940
be a predecessor did and grow in size

120
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:27,940
grow in power eventually you'll get this

121
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:31,910
beautiful thing they call budgets and

122
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:33,770
budgets give you money and money means

123
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:36,500
that you to spend it as you're gonna

124
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:38,599
lose the budget for next year so you go

125
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:45,320
to whatever the next Gartner Magic

126
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:46,830
Quadrant is go buy a metric shit-ton of

127
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:51,659
products

128
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:55,669
with questionable value and then you're

129
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:59,280
into like full roster mode your life is

130
00:06:55,669 --> 00:07:02,909
now set you're at the captain of the

131
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:06,929
defense ship everything in your life is

132
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:09,630
three primary colors high medium and low

133
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:11,160
your whole world revolves around red you

134
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:14,130
can any color you can't even see a color

135
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:17,220
called blue so I've talked to see so

136
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:20,069
they've gone colorblind the the whole

137
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:23,430
game is fought in dashboards and in

138
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:26,789
snakes and ladders type thing is where

139
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:29,069
your daily job is to figure out how to

140
00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:31,979
de-escalate a high vulnerability to a

141
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:35,099
medium and a medium to a low and this

142
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:36,360
cyclic process will never ever end but

143
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:37,830
you're doing defense because you're

144
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,539
doing blood very hard work you know it

145
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:41,280
takes time looking at all these

146
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:43,710
dashboards and clicking things up and

147
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,568
down and then make some donkey comes up

148
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:47,068
and post a cross-site scripting bug and

149
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:48,900
then like oh this is not a really

150
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:50,310
bug well truth be told cross-site

151
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:53,729
scripting bugs are not really bugs

152
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:58,800
anyway I agree on that part but suddenly

153
00:07:53,729 --> 00:08:01,219
you discover that life's not video beach

154
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,979
anymore you know things things happen

155
00:08:01,219 --> 00:08:07,949
you take a turn into the dungeons and

156
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:09,508
suddenly all these things come out and

157
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:10,919
hey wait where did these come from I had

158
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:12,120
all these products with the blinking

159
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:15,659
lights now what the are these

160
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:17,819
things doing so but you know what you

161
00:08:15,659 --> 00:08:21,719
start questioning this is the beginning

162
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:22,349
of your next dilemma like wait how did I

163
00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:25,110
get here

164
00:08:22,349 --> 00:08:26,819
this was not supposed to happen but you

165
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:28,590
really don't have time to think about

166
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:32,700
this because things are coming at you

167
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:35,000
from all directions and suddenly the

168
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:37,200
whole high medium and low world is

169
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,270
crumbling around you just like the

170
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,060
towers in Inception and you really don't

171
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:45,959
know what's going on eventually what

172
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:48,260
happens is team members start dropping

173
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:51,599
out they look for different jobs

174
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:54,209
regulators tighten their grip and sooner

175
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:58,140
or later you're gonna have to deal with

176
00:08:54,209 --> 00:09:00,609
this guy the board and this brings you

177
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:03,589
to the end of one

178
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:08,060
what do you do from there well at this

179
00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:10,760
point you basically game over herself

180
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:14,959
and the Mobius strip continues to world

181
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:16,730
number two 18 months are over time to

182
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:20,750
roll the dice again and see what happens

183
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:23,060
this is well this is not far from the

184
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:25,449
truth this is basically what goes on and

185
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:28,160
when you're going into world number two

186
00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:30,319
you're kind of wondering how am I going

187
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,300
to ever break this mobius strip ever

188
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,760
tried cutting a mobius strip see what

189
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:36,199
happens it becomes two mobius strips it

190
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:40,069
gets longer and longer it doesn't get

191
00:09:36,199 --> 00:09:43,579
disconnected so while this is all going

192
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:46,519
on you really want to figure out what it

193
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:49,459
takes to step away from this reactive

194
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:52,760
infinite loop to be able to do this

195
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:55,790
effectively you first need to understand

196
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:59,959
relationships you're basically dealing

197
00:09:55,790 --> 00:10:01,849
with four entities here is a board who

198
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:03,199
you're directly reporting to him who's

199
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:06,290
going to pay your salary and give your

200
00:10:03,199 --> 00:10:08,779
budgets the regulators well because

201
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:10,880
people make standards and standards

202
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:13,130
breed regulators and regulators tighten

203
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,260
things down around your neck

204
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:19,939
then there's the IT vendors of course

205
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:22,610
and your info psych crew the best way to

206
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:25,610
link all of these up is with a beautiful

207
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:29,570
medieval diagram that I found is what

208
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:31,610
actually really goes on and I had to put

209
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:33,230
happy faces on it and the guy was naked

210
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:37,839
sort of paint a suit on it and all that

211
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:42,160
but make the slide acceptable on stage

212
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:48,019
but yeah here at this point you

213
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:50,360
basically turn in all directions let's

214
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:52,699
rewind the tape back to when you spent

215
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:56,000
and bought all those InfoSec products

216
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:59,810
and this is what Thomas mentioned in

217
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:03,769
this keynote like why is there a market

218
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:06,939
for InfoSec products and basically this

219
00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:10,339
happens when you view the whole world as

220
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:14,709
risk reduction you're basically buying

221
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:14,709
blinking lights to reduce your risk

222
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:22,000
InfoSec products today have a fleeting

223
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:23,680
shelf-life and when you go out and buy

224
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,880
the products that you see in the next

225
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,910
big expo you're basically buying things

226
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:32,920
that you you're basically buying

227
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:39,480
security debt and this concept was best

228
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:39,479
characterized by weld pond by dan gear

229
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:46,209
Kunar Peterson and shelve and the vault

230
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:48,820
whenever you accrue a product you're

231
00:11:46,209 --> 00:11:50,920
basically paying for its future

232
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:52,630
maintenance and when it fails you're

233
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:55,930
bringing on assets which you have to pay

234
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:58,689
for so recently I saw one happy thing on

235
00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:02,050
LinkedIn which is a campaign called say

236
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:04,000
no to another P oh you stop C source

237
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:06,399
from buying render a random vendor craft

238
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,830
which is here's a high time we really

239
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:12,640
talked about decisions in purchasing in

240
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:14,529
was like products the problem why these

241
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:17,319
products are not really effective is

242
00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:19,510
because well we said we're trying to

243
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:22,540
solve a technical we're trying to solve

244
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:25,209
a political problem by technology and

245
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:26,949
that really doesn't work the other thing

246
00:12:25,209 --> 00:12:29,800
is we also need to understand the

247
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:32,079
culture in the info section we've

248
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,550
created a culture of toil and this was

249
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,219
best characterized by do you know right

250
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:40,390
so V in a few tweets is sent out in May

251
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:43,329
which I like very much and that that

252
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:47,620
kind of shows you that a culture of toil

253
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:48,370
will never scale against a growing

254
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:50,230
company today

255
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:52,600
you're fighting a battle with

256
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:54,430
diminishing returns and let's look at

257
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,130
two ways of doing work there's a geek

258
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:59,890
we're in the non geek way both start

259
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:00,700
manually eventually the geek figures out

260
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:03,760
that this sucks

261
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:05,500
starts writing scripts the manual guys

262
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,410
make fun of the geeks method saying oh

263
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,670
this guy is not getting done and

264
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:13,149
then all of a sudden the scripts are

265
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:16,479
ready the geek goes forward the manual

266
00:13:13,149 --> 00:13:19,720
guys are toiling and you see where the

267
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:22,000
lines see where the lines go so yes the

268
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,890
problem with toil is that it's actually

269
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,230
addictive you feel that you're doing

270
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,800
real work whereas you're actually just

271
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:30,430
fighting

272
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,959
forest fires it's kind of ironic we

273
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:36,250
mentioned forest fires right now in

274
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:39,670
today's time but yeah if you're you're

275
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:41,890
having your crew do work by toil that's

276
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:45,699
not a skill in defending the enterprise

277
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:48,730
so with this let me turn towards the

278
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:50,950
learnings of three people that I had

279
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:52,990
respected the most this is where my

280
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:55,630
InfoSec journey actually began and

281
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:57,550
didn't really even know it began in 1998

282
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:59,649
when I joined Ernst & Young and Kelley

283
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:01,390
was my friend at that time working as a

284
00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:02,950
colleague and through the years we've

285
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:04,569
worked together for a long long time in

286
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:06,430
different roles and learned many things

287
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:08,740
along the way

288
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:10,779
Anoop said he I met him in the first

289
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:13,120
wave hacking class that I taught in the

290
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:16,570
year 2000 when the twin towers were

291
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:20,350
still standing and the class was in one

292
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:22,630
of the string towers and he and another

293
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:24,760
friend from Commerce Bank were both in

294
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:26,529
my first public with hacking class in

295
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,370
that time web hacking was all

296
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:29,019
mumbo-jumbo

297
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,459
what do you mean inserting backticks and

298
00:14:29,019 --> 00:14:33,190
pipes and like that you know it's

299
00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:36,339
all a web page right but yeah that was

300
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:38,649
the beginning of new dimensions so I got

301
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:40,690
introduced to an open Commerce Bank in

302
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:42,310
the same year and through the through

303
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:44,610
the years I've worked as a vendor

304
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:48,069
through with with with all three and

305
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:50,380
they of all basically built great and

306
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:53,279
for SEC teams defended the enterprise

307
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:56,860
successfully so yes there's a way out

308
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:59,950
now how do we go about doing it so first

309
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:04,890
comes Kelly's thesis and his thesis is

310
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:09,520
on the what we call as a cyber security

311
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:11,380
capabilities asymmetry big words so let

312
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:13,660
me break it down by Mario style there's

313
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:15,939
the camp that have everything in terms

314
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:19,360
of capabilities and there's a camp that

315
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:24,040
are they have knots so what what

316
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:25,690
separates our 2d halves are capable the

317
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:29,260
capable of their own custom analytics

318
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:33,100
threat Intel and response they were

319
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:37,709
going for themselves by themselves we

320
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:41,020
have not have a culture of seeing

321
00:15:37,709 --> 00:15:43,810
cybersecurity as a necessary evil

322
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:46,630
when the haves have a culture of owning

323
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:48,640
their own cybersecurity there they want

324
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:52,110
to food they want to work on it these

325
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:55,810
guys want to push it under the rug and

326
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:58,089
the haves have all the talent they've

327
00:15:55,810 --> 00:16:00,399
got the people to drive capabilities for

328
00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:02,620
themselves and I have nots

329
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,470
are only dependent upon commercial

330
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:08,910
solutions they will never be able to

331
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:14,260
create but the whole idea is how do you

332
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:16,810
cross this asymmetric chasm the whole

333
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:18,189
point of the asymmetry is akia one side

334
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:20,969
keeps growing on the other side keeps

335
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:24,580
diminishing but there is a way out and

336
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:29,110
the way out is as suggested by Igor and

337
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:32,950
a note both they believe in the

338
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:36,339
capability of swarm intelligence I'm

339
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:38,800
using the word swarm not using the word

340
00:16:36,339 --> 00:16:41,440
team a team is a group of people who are

341
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:45,189
really motivated and sharp but a swarm

342
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:49,300
has a life and a soul and intelligence

343
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:52,510
of its own dependence and coexistence is

344
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:55,329
the only way the swamp can the swamp can

345
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:57,970
move ahead what happens with a swarm is

346
00:16:55,329 --> 00:17:00,790
like it is fantastic when you see it in

347
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:04,720
motion it can do things which you will

348
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:07,329
never be capable of so how do you go

349
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:12,459
about building swarm intelligence under

350
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:18,010
under your own roof and this was

351
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:20,860
suggested by actually is the suggested

352
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:23,079
by Igor and I never I never really paid

353
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:25,688
attention to things like Maslow's needs

354
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:29,230
or things like that was diagrams really

355
00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:31,480
bore me this is the one concept which I

356
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:33,429
really really like it's you know people

357
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:36,429
think about evolution in terms of

358
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:39,010
scaling up Maslow's pyramid of needs but

359
00:17:36,429 --> 00:17:42,090
truly that's not what evolution is the

360
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:45,129
evolution is to grow in human values

361
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:47,709
build a culture around values and what

362
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:51,130
you hold core to your heart and that

363
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:53,559
concept was proposed by Clare graves

364
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:54,410
when he unfortunately died before he

365
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:56,870
could publish it

366
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:58,820
eighty six and then this concept was

367
00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:00,260
later on published by his protege s and

368
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:04,280
this concept is called spiral dynamics

369
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:05,990
and I spent the last week reading up

370
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,420
about spiral dynamics I filled about

371
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:12,230
like 20 pages in my notebooks just

372
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:14,510
scribbling about it and there's actually

373
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:16,790
something fantastic spiral dynamics

374
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:19,910
takes you through several stages of

375
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:23,360
human evolution in terms of building up

376
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:26,570
values so you're really going from basic

377
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,679
survival to power struggles do you know

378
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:31,129
this

379
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:35,230
there's dogmas and religious approaches

380
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:37,070
to life to being achievers to being

381
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:39,560
egalitarian that's where you come to the

382
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:41,720
green level but the true breakthrough

383
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:45,770
happens when you break the borders and

384
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:48,080
boundaries of personal existence to an

385
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:50,240
interpersonal and inner transpersonal

386
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,330
existence when you hit these stages

387
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:57,620
above yellow to turquoise the world is

388
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:58,730
now holistic experience shell and you

389
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:01,729
are now achieved

390
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:04,850
you've now achieved the the hive mind

391
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:06,620
you you're now truly running a swarm so

392
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:09,139
where does a leader fit in the leader

393
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:12,560
has to catalyze this whole process of

394
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:17,720
this spiral you want to build the hive

395
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:20,270
mind once the swarm assembles the swarm

396
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:23,690
will learn and overcome any obstacle

397
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:25,790
that you direct it to and it solve it

398
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:28,490
beautifully better than you ever

399
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:30,770
expected so all you have to do as a

400
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:33,130
leader is basically be a catalyst be

401
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:37,040
very mindful of where your team is in

402
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:41,420
stages of spiral dynamics and keep

403
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:43,730
spinning the spiral up eventually you

404
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:47,270
have to be in charge of selecting the

405
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:50,560
goals that are worth fighting for and as

406
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:54,650
a decision you want to trade your depth

407
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:56,750
with breadth you see the forest and not

408
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:59,030
the trees let the team handle the depth

409
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:00,680
you keep the breadth and drive the

410
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:02,420
strategy and the swarm will do this and

411
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:08,330
I've seen this at work in all these

412
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:11,450
three organizations my my view of spiral

413
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:13,789
is more I like to go with this diagram

414
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:16,070
of me mainly like quantum energy levels

415
00:20:13,789 --> 00:20:17,899
in electron you keep pushing the

416
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:19,549
electrons to the orbits you need more

417
00:20:17,899 --> 00:20:22,610
and more energy to get the electrons

418
00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:26,720
excited and once you've reached the most

419
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:29,059
exciting orbits then comes the task of

420
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:33,169
keeping the energy levels there and this

421
00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:35,360
is where a lot of fractures happen these

422
00:20:33,169 --> 00:20:38,269
spirals are nice but maintaining the

423
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:41,629
spiral at the topmost level requires a

424
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:43,490
lot of energy it's hard work to build up

425
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:46,399
the energy levels and to go into the

426
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:49,250
spiral but it's also very easy to fall

427
00:20:46,399 --> 00:20:52,129
into the downward spiral trap electrons

428
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:54,620
will deorbit like this and one false

429
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:57,799
move and you're gonna see the spiral go

430
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:59,989
down once it goes down it is actually a

431
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:02,720
very very slippery slope and this is

432
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:04,549
something that I've seen happen even

433
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,250
with the best of InfoSec teams the

434
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:09,260
cascade effect things crumble and they

435
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:12,200
crumble in a geometric progression and

436
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:17,210
it doesn't really take much to do or

437
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:20,870
'but the whole stack again it all hinges

438
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:23,630
upon you as a InfoSec leader what are

439
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:26,239
the factors are going to cause it to to

440
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:28,220
deorbit so again I turned to the experts

441
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,899
and asked sounds like okay what did you

442
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:32,769
do what did you do to keep the steam

443
00:21:29,899 --> 00:21:36,799
going and keep the whole thing working

444
00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:39,350
and here are the points and the lessons

445
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:45,649
that I've learned which are actually now

446
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:48,260
the closest to my heart the first is you

447
00:21:45,649 --> 00:21:53,018
need to be able to self-reflect see

448
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:56,870
yourself for who you are truthfully so

449
00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:58,880
all your efforts in InfoSec are now

450
00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:00,229
going to be divided into two parts one

451
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,139
is of course building the InfoSec

452
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:05,779
strategy but the second and the most

453
00:22:03,139 --> 00:22:09,799
important thing which you should never

454
00:22:05,779 --> 00:22:12,049
forget is to protect this warm this

455
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:16,520
protection business starts very very

456
00:22:12,049 --> 00:22:18,918
early on eventually you also have to

457
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:20,270
empower the swarm as you're taking them

458
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:22,100
up to a collective

459
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:23,809
remember you are not a

460
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:26,750
away from the collective you are in that

461
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:28,668
collective itself and if that collective

462
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,870
has a difference with you or you have a

463
00:22:28,669 --> 00:22:32,150
difference with the collective it

464
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:34,850
doesn't work how do you bring the

465
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:38,960
collective together it is simply by

466
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:40,639
empowerment and lastly if you really

467
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,760
want to achieve full power of the hive

468
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,280
mind you must build really strong

469
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:51,410
partnerships I'm gonna expand upon all

470
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:55,060
these points in just a little bit so

471
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:56,980
first let's talk about reflections and

472
00:22:55,060 --> 00:23:02,500
[Music]

473
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:02,500
what it takes to analyze yourself

474
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:10,070
there's two sides right what type of a

475
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:12,409
leader are you and you've got to be very

476
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:18,289
truthful when you when you see your own

477
00:23:12,409 --> 00:23:21,350
reflection in the mirror who are you are

478
00:23:18,289 --> 00:23:27,110
you an authoritative person rather your

479
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:31,658
catalyst do you listen do you push back

480
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:31,658
to the business do you resist the forces

481
00:23:32,049 --> 00:23:39,650
do you always have a sky is falling

482
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:41,510
attitude so first thing you've got to

483
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:44,929
make this decision which which

484
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:47,270
properties do you want to work upon in

485
00:23:44,929 --> 00:23:48,919
terms of turning them around and which

486
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:51,830
properties do you want to work upon and

487
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:55,850
grow them what you have without this

488
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:58,668
there is no next step the second and the

489
00:23:55,850 --> 00:24:00,889
most important thing is yes we talked

490
00:23:58,669 --> 00:24:03,830
about swarms and swarm intelligence but

491
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:05,840
let's really define the core DNA or

492
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:08,750
first of all what is our spawn doing

493
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:12,889
what is your InfoSec team doing what's

494
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:16,190
the model of your InfoSec team so on

495
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:19,220
opes view is you view your InfoSec team

496
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:21,679
as a center of excellence for all

497
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:24,289
technical security this what you're

498
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,240
really building this is the core guts of

499
00:24:24,289 --> 00:24:28,490
it this is what your team members are

500
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,020
communicated and they're working towards

501
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:34,450
this purpose

502
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:37,580
you want to be the Oracle that can help

503
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:39,860
everyone in the organization eventually

504
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:42,860
your capabilities are such that people

505
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:45,199
will come to you for a solution but you

506
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:47,629
the swamp and the swarm will help out

507
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,090
anyone and everyone in the best in the

508
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:53,600
most efficient way possible and this

509
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:55,879
creates incredible value value that your

510
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,590
organization will initially want to

511
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,649
profit from this is also very dangerous

512
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:01,850
thing when you build up a really really

513
00:24:59,649 --> 00:25:04,549
competent company and this is what

514
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:07,580
British Telecom ended up facing British

515
00:25:04,549 --> 00:25:09,889
telecoms InfoSec is is twofold they have

516
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:12,289
internal InfoSec and they also do

517
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:14,299
consulting for others so the board

518
00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:15,830
started seeing the their team has hey

519
00:25:14,299 --> 00:25:17,210
look these guys are really sharp let's

520
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:19,250
just sell them out to other companies

521
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:21,620
but then you have the problem of you

522
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:24,260
know really depleting her own depleting

523
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:25,610
your own resources and working upon

524
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:27,440
others because it makes short-term

525
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:31,639
profits so there you've got to be really

526
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:33,740
really careful and and creative to not

527
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:36,850
let that happen but eventually you to

528
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:39,890
run this whole show as an independent

529
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:41,918
consultancy within the organisation this

530
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:45,409
is what it's true nature should be

531
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:50,720
independent which means no interference

532
00:25:45,409 --> 00:25:53,419
and it's it's consultive in nature how

533
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,700
do you take care of the swamp and this

534
00:25:53,419 --> 00:26:00,890
is where your initial batter is gonna

535
00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:03,919
start because let's face it boards

536
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:06,110
understand only one language the bottom

537
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:08,090
line is the top line and that's fine we

538
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:11,178
don't want to push back upon that first

539
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:16,070
thing let them be who they are that's

540
00:26:11,179 --> 00:26:20,120
okay within these constraints how do you

541
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:22,789
grow your InfoSec team because it's

542
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:25,129
gonna take time to demonstrate benefits

543
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:26,990
you can't have benefits instantly you

544
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:28,789
have all the other four forces tugging

545
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:31,279
at you and that's not gonna stop you're

546
00:26:28,789 --> 00:26:32,450
not going to get a breather so what are

547
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,960
the first things you're going to need to

548
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:38,770
do is figure out how to creatively

549
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:42,320
insulate your team from all the forces

550
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:43,500
don't make your swarm part of the

551
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,360
medieval problem

552
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:47,549
because that's gonna fracture it very

553
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,709
very quickly you'll have to let it grow

554
00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:51,899
from the pourcel stage to the

555
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:53,970
transpersonal stages and while that

556
00:26:51,899 --> 00:26:56,789
happens you've got to make sure they're

557
00:26:53,970 --> 00:27:01,470
insulated and the only way you can do it

558
00:26:56,789 --> 00:27:04,500
is by absolute honesty and openness if

559
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:06,539
you are not honest with your teams there

560
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:09,120
is no trust there is no hive man

561
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:12,120
happening there you want to take this

562
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,289
decision very early on you you have to

563
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:17,779
be honest there's no such thing as

564
00:27:13,289 --> 00:27:20,700
selective honesty full-on or nothing

565
00:27:17,779 --> 00:27:22,320
once you have that and you weren't the

566
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:25,830
team's trust you want to make sure that

567
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:28,230
it stays there one of the biggest

568
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:31,199
detractors to the trust is when you're

569
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:32,370
going to be faced with a crisis and you

570
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,990
all know it ours is a very dangerous

571
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:39,239
game mistakes happen and sometimes big

572
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:42,509
mistakes happen it's not like okay we

573
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:45,809
can you know wipe it away things will

574
00:27:42,509 --> 00:27:47,399
affect people production will break you

575
00:27:45,809 --> 00:27:50,070
know your entire East Coast cloud

576
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:53,639
centers gonna go kaput this is okay this

577
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:56,399
will happen at this time it is most

578
00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:58,740
important to maintain full honesty and

579
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:02,639
integrity towards both you you will be

580
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:03,769
caught in fire if you take the easy way

581
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:06,870
out

582
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:08,730
throw a team member under the bus blame

583
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:11,100
it on them and let them sell them down

584
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:13,019
the river you do that that's the end of

585
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:15,689
it downward spiral happens instantly

586
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:16,620
your swamps broken and you've really

587
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:19,230
reached the end

588
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:21,449
don't don't don't ever throw your team

589
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:23,570
members under the bus in fact you gotta

590
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:26,129
own it up you'll have to face the music

591
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:28,168
the only message that goes out to your

592
00:28:26,129 --> 00:28:30,918
team is it's okay to make mistakes and

593
00:28:28,169 --> 00:28:34,889
these are anok's words make mistakes

594
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:37,470
make many mistakes make new mistakes you

595
00:28:34,889 --> 00:28:41,610
learn from your mistakes but don't ever

596
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:44,850
bloody make the same mistake again new

597
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:46,559
ones are okay repeating old mistakes not

598
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:50,158
okay so yeah there's got to be some

599
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:52,740
semblance of checks and balances there

600
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:56,220
can be no blank check though so you've

601
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:58,450
got to keep that that bit in mind

602
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:00,940
that being say there's also a very

603
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:04,510
important lesson in protecting the swarm

604
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:06,970
as as your swarm is young and growing or

605
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:10,900
even when it's not young and still still

606
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:13,870
mature you got to beware of bad apples

607
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:16,120
and the only response to bad apples is

608
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:19,780
throw them out instantly there's there's

609
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:22,449
no place the more you let bad apples

610
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:24,220
persist you will end up in the street

611
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:28,060
which I like very much the block chain

612
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:29,950
of toxic you get to toxic friends that's

613
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:33,570
it the block chain is established and

614
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:33,570
there you go it's done

615
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:38,800
the next point was about empowering your

616
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:45,070
swamp

617
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:47,649
you basically have to enable your folks

618
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:50,730
to call on you otherwise the

619
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:54,730
emperor has no clothes and life's ok

620
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:57,370
InfoSec teams can really be let you live

621
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:59,790
in illusions and until one fine day you

622
00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:02,530
look in the mirror this this happens but

623
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:03,610
be honest with yourself and let people

624
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:06,910
call you out on it

625
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:09,699
now this I don't know how you enable

626
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:12,760
this in your organization but you have

627
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:16,020
everything from you know lunches drinks

628
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:20,500
hanging out together you know stand-ups

629
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:24,629
the best form of empowerment I've seen

630
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:28,210
is when you let this swarm make solid

631
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:30,910
partnerships with vendors and I have

632
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:33,250
been fortunate to be a partner to three

633
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:36,210
of these big swarms for for a very long

634
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:40,380
time and some of them still continuing

635
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:44,650
partnerships are great and this is what

636
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:46,660
the the seesaw that I used to be a

637
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:49,090
vendor to here in Chow who is actually

638
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:51,280
not the CEO of crystal anymore he is the

639
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:52,990
president of next square he he left his

640
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:55,270
company and joined us to lead the lead

641
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:57,040
the group his words to me were that yeah

642
00:30:55,270 --> 00:31:00,040
you must surround yourself with smart

643
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:01,720
people and surround yourself with small

644
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:05,020
teams because they are most agile and

645
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:07,120
learn from them let your team members

646
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:08,379
cross pollinate with the knowledge that

647
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,899
they're going to bring

648
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:12,910
and two shining examples I've seen one

649
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:14,590
of them's British Telecom zone info SEC

650
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:16,780
conference called snoop con which is

651
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:19,060
invite only I believe it's now in its

652
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:21,610
eighth year and has about 150 people

653
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:24,399
attending internal folks and vendors and

654
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:26,800
is a fantastic event and the other is

655
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:29,280
commerce banks of wudu and they they do

656
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:31,810
this in December and in glass Hooten and

657
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,430
they also got a really sharp through

658
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:35,200
coming year after year after year and

659
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:38,170
this is how they keep the partnerships

660
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:42,340
build the the smalls cross-pollinated

661
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:44,380
and when you do this the big vacuum and

662
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:45,610
the big dilemma that other InfoSec

663
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:49,300
leaders is like yeah where do i get

664
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:52,780
people from you do all this they'll come

665
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:54,940
to you you don't have to go looking bt

666
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:57,280
doesn't hire any headhunters people come

667
00:31:54,940 --> 00:32:00,190
straight to them they'll want to join

668
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:02,310
your swarm even though it pays only half

669
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:05,520
of what the industry average pays

670
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:09,280
because eventually a culture of freedom

671
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:12,220
fraternity empowerment innovation will

672
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:13,690
outweigh any paycheck that you can get

673
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:16,240
people will stick together because they

674
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:19,810
like working with one another on

675
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:23,860
creative challenges so this kind of

676
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:28,330
brings me to the to the most important

677
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:32,770
question what really is the seesaw the

678
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:35,350
dilemma and this is a question that you

679
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:37,660
must answer before you begin your

680
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:40,870
journey as a seesaw or as you're taking

681
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:45,190
the first step as a Cecil absolutely

682
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:46,530
early early on in your career whose side

683
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:49,780
are you on

684
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:54,310
without this question this whole talk is

685
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:57,190
meaningless whose side are you on are

686
00:32:54,310 --> 00:33:00,460
you on your own side or are you on your

687
00:32:57,190 --> 00:33:02,230
team side the two stories here if you're

688
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:04,390
on your own side that's a good story

689
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,830
you're gonna go upwards and personal

690
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:07,600
growth

691
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:11,500
okay packages are handsome that's all

692
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:14,550
great you will be able to keep your

693
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:18,100
technical depth you you certainly grow

694
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:21,820
you definitely run the risk of being

695
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:24,209
trapped in the Mobius loop

696
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:26,259
if you're happy with it that's fine

697
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:28,090
SuperMario right you can always keep

698
00:33:26,259 --> 00:33:32,769
going from world one to world eight and

699
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:35,918
then you're 60 and you're done or you

700
00:33:32,769 --> 00:33:37,509
can choose the team side initially it's

701
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:40,720
a painful thing because you have to let

702
00:33:37,509 --> 00:33:43,269
go of your persona you to let go of your

703
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,509
your own technical depth but you

704
00:33:43,269 --> 00:33:49,690
maintain your technical expertise and

705
00:33:45,509 --> 00:33:54,460
you're then working on building this

706
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:57,190
spiral you do this you're gonna stand on

707
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:59,139
the shoulders of giants and they're

708
00:33:57,190 --> 00:34:01,989
gonna take you to Heights which you will

709
00:33:59,139 --> 00:34:04,539
never have expected to reach and you you

710
00:34:01,989 --> 00:34:06,340
you get that joy and this is a joy I've

711
00:34:04,539 --> 00:34:08,559
seen on all these three leaders that

712
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:11,489
that the joy of growing and building is

713
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:13,780
superb team and even beautifully so

714
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:16,000
letting it continue even after they've

715
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:17,379
left and they've moved on and that is

716
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,059
the hardest step because once you leave

717
00:34:17,379 --> 00:34:20,918
where is your next step

718
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:22,510
who's who's going to carry it forward so

719
00:34:20,918 --> 00:34:28,598
it's also a part of your learning

720
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:30,460
process so with this for now if you're

721
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:35,230
not into the whole spiral dynamics thing

722
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:38,199
I can promise you one thing a time will

723
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:40,359
come we're going to be put in a very

724
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:43,270
tight spot and you're going to be all

725
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:47,020
alone and there's no way out and at this

726
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:50,559
point you've got to do what Khrushchev

727
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:53,199
did so I don't know if this legend or

728
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:55,839
not but after Brezhnev succeeded

729
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:57,910
Khrushchev the old man told in that look

730
00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:00,160
one day you're gonna find yourself in a

731
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:02,618
in a shitty situation there are two

732
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:06,129
letters that I've written for you you

733
00:35:02,619 --> 00:35:08,500
open them you'll find the answers so

734
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:10,329
Brezhnev eventually does open one of the

735
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:13,660
letters during the height of the Cold

736
00:35:10,329 --> 00:35:15,549
War and when he's facing real problems

737
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:17,828
so the first let us say to blame it all

738
00:35:15,549 --> 00:35:19,960
on me blame it all on samalisha blame it

739
00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:22,780
on someone blame it on your predecessor

740
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:24,880
and it works like a champ it'll get you

741
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:27,220
it'll get you going and blame it on the

742
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:30,400
old man but then you're gonna run into

743
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:33,009
this again so Brezhnev opens the second

744
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,120
letter and that says well write two more

745
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:39,190
letters

746
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:41,549
so basically yeah this by the way is not

747
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:41,550
the grog

748
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:50,020
so with this I would like to conclude my

749
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:53,020
talk thank you for your time and

750
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:56,140
attention really we have 9 minutes for

751
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:59,020
any questions and answers or whatever

752
00:35:56,140 --> 00:36:01,450
thoughts you may have this morning thank

753
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:02,530
you very much thank you any questions

754
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:05,049
from the floor

755
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:13,450
live from the floor before we move on to

756
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:15,940
the questions on the slide oh oh oh it's

757
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:18,759
good to see ya I was impressed by the bt

758
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:20,740
thing but I have one comment to give you

759
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:25,510
but because I'm a European as you know

760
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:28,870
so for example Italy yeah they call

761
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:31,780
private companies in order to make

762
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:35,589
tenders Invitational in order to sell

763
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:37,900
contestants to someone which is like

764
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:40,300
it's a punch with what you say but I

765
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:43,780
think that this happens in though the

766
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:47,230
huge organizations and in Europe maybe

767
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:52,120
were slower or I would even say more

768
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:54,550
idiots trying to approach everything did

769
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:57,040
you explain it because Europeans are not

770
00:36:54,550 --> 00:37:01,150
humble as awesome people with what's

771
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:03,040
your answer or your talk I well there's

772
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:05,380
no answer to ravage ESL that is

773
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:09,370
something I've learned and in all these

774
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:15,400
years and honestly I have no answer here

775
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:17,640
hey I don't know maybe over the bar we

776
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:20,590
will evolve some answers out of it I

777
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:22,330
think that one it isn't an answer but a

778
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:25,720
key word and go for it get back to make

779
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:27,370
20 its culture is a black culture oh

780
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:30,609
yeah because everything that you say

781
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:33,009
that I really enjoyed so much ah if the

782
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:36,640
season is not a ball alone to being

783
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:39,010
humble and everything you say it to hack

784
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:41,200
himself into his brain and being humble

785
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:43,180
again and understanding the cultures of

786
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:47,500
the continents at least

787
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:51,190
he can't learn it oh yeah so absolutely

788
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:53,650
it's it's all about the culture there's

789
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:55,870
there's no there's no two words about it

790
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:58,270
at all you must know your organization

791
00:37:55,870 --> 00:38:00,880
you must know your business very well

792
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:03,900
and form strong relationships with both

793
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:05,580
without this there is no way forward

794
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:10,320
cool

795
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:15,549
anybody else bug me you have 7 minutes

796
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:17,470
mark Stefano Katie come on sorry for not

797
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:21,760
joining you last evening this happened

798
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:23,049
this was going on till 4:00 a.m. well in

799
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,370
the meantime while we wait for more

800
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,810
questions from the floor maybe you will

801
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:28,630
take a look at a question sat on their

802
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:31,360
short what seems like the most voted one

803
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:34,060
we have right now their two highest

804
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:35,410
voted once your choice so meal as I see

805
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:37,540
so is it important to have an offensive

806
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:41,170
security or a defensive security

807
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:44,380
background is war is one more advantages

808
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:47,050
than another you know what I'm going to

809
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:49,300
answer this straightaway by saying just

810
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:50,860
just focus on the culture just focus

811
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:53,740
everything works

812
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:56,080
you will need you need both I am both

813
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:57,879
and I am neither my my entire background

814
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:59,950
has been in breaking stuff have never

815
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:03,690
really really built anything in my life

816
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:08,799
but both offensive or defensive

817
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:11,650
eventually it's warm or urine that

818
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,420
reactive and for sec loop second

819
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:17,320
question how do we apply spiral dynamics

820
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:19,570
to demonstrate values to stakeholder who

821
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:23,020
are more oh hey

822
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:26,210
damn it moved and turned blue I can only

823
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:29,000
see high medium and low blue color

824
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:31,160
all right so how do you demonstrate

825
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:36,230
value to stakeholders are very focused

826
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:40,069
so this basically by creating a swarm

827
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:42,580
you're empowering the consultancy

828
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:45,380
organization within your company and

829
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:47,750
that's what's gonna drive the most value

830
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:51,220
where whatever you set the tasks to

831
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:54,500
those ones want to achieve them today

832
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:57,140
not only is the InfoSec team just you

833
00:39:54,500 --> 00:40:00,380
know defending the company but they're

834
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:02,960
also advising their own business units

835
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:07,810
on what it takes to bring InfoSec from

836
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:11,030
the design upwards working at vendors

837
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:12,410
you will end up demonstrating results

838
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:15,530
early on I am going to give you the

839
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:18,529
story of Zions Bank they built their own

840
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:20,960
threat analytics engine out of a few

841
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:23,690
unused computers and ran overdue cluster

842
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,830
on it to total cost was about $25,000 to

843
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:27,350
$100,000

844
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:28,730
two guys sat and built this because they

845
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:31,130
were getting hit by a lot of phishing

846
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:34,070
campaigns so they say let's just ingest

847
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:36,470
all the data and see can we look at some

848
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:39,260
HTTP headers and HTTP traffic and

849
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:40,939
correlations by seeing like whether our

850
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:42,530
images are going to get getting pulled

851
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:44,990
out or being directly linked for

852
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:46,760
phishing campaigns and this paid them a

853
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:49,100
lot of early dividends they were able to

854
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:51,470
send stopped a lot of phishing campaigns

855
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:54,440
to the customers eventually they took

856
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:58,430
this and started analyzing all the HTTP

857
00:40:54,440 --> 00:41:01,820
traffic for eight to nine years and they

858
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:03,440
rolled out their own fraud modeling they

859
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:05,180
had a platform called catwalk where

860
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,340
different fraud models would walk

861
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:10,100
through and they wrote everything in our

862
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:12,620
and they were able to stop a lot of

863
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:16,009
fraud and demonstrate effectiveness

864
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:18,350
straightaway in savings cuz money saved

865
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:21,050
is money earned you you show a savings

866
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:23,950
of about 3.5 million dollars prevented

867
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:26,540
in fraud directly within the first year

868
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:28,490
nobody's going to ask you for if you ask

869
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:30,560
for another 200k for building that

870
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:33,350
hadoop cluster it's like shut up and

871
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,990
take my money at that point matrix kpi's

872
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:37,310
will be a done deal

873
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:39,509
demonstrate results early demonstrate

874
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:42,370
them often yes mark

875
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:44,890
I'm not I'm not sure I 100% agree with

876
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:46,029
you on that and I'll phrase it as a

877
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:49,270
question sure

878
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:51,910
one of the challenges when you are

879
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:53,980
succeeding as a security leader is it

880
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:55,089
often the company won't see anything

881
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:56,860
that's right they'll see you being

882
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:58,990
really really busy and they'll see your

883
00:41:56,860 --> 00:42:00,550
team's building a lot of stuff but no

884
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:02,200
bad things happen and they don't see

885
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:04,240
anything that kind of gives them an

886
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:06,009
impression that something's happened how

887
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:09,189
would you go about communicating good

888
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:11,800
news upwards kpi's is the language that

889
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:14,350
Ward's talk yeah so that they know that

890
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:17,650
you're actually delivering value yeah I

891
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:19,960
mean that that that's a that's a very

892
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:22,180
important thing at some point if you

893
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:25,810
really find yourself in a situation

894
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:28,060
which you're very orthogonal like the

895
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:31,060
bigwigs just don't listen to you and

896
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:34,150
then that's a that's a problem which is

897
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:37,840
still not solved most most solutions end

898
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:39,010
up being walking away but maybe I'm

899
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:42,280
going to ask you the same question in

900
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:46,540
tomorrow's keynote the answers very

901
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:48,610
flection do you feel there is a future

902
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:50,650
and open-source product says oh yes

903
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:54,580
there is a big future I wanted to

904
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:57,940
mention one cool thing have you heard of

905
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:59,860
Facebook's OS query it it's a brilliant

906
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:01,480
piece of open source software that

907
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:05,080
initially they wrote for them of their

908
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:08,590
own selves and my facebook at the time

909
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:09,970
had several you know diverse technical

910
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:12,190
platforms and they wanted to answer

911
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:13,779
things like can we find a malicious

912
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:15,220
calculator that's running on any

913
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:18,160
computer in our whole enterprise

914
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:20,890
so can we query processes just like

915
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:22,540
doing a query in a sequel table and they

916
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:24,250
wrote OS query which they've open

917
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:25,960
sourced and they had a lot of fun

918
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:28,630
building and maintaining it and in fact

919
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:31,570
this is going to be a key to even

920
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:34,120
growing and retaining your team build

921
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:38,320
your own open source set that others

922
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:43,089
contributed let it grow I I would go for

923
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:47,380
it yes next question a slider maybe any

924
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:50,790
questions from Life audience great

925
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:50,790
Stephan off yes

926
00:43:53,420 --> 00:44:00,589
so um I was wondering about this while

927
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:04,290
while you were talking about the the

928
00:44:00,589 --> 00:44:07,500
difficulties and a way to just jump

929
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:11,700
ahead by building this swarm concept

930
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:14,490
yeah in the US a number of people are

931
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:19,500
starting to wonder if it would be a good

932
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:22,169
idea to strip out the compliance role

933
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:24,800
from the Caesar role and just have

934
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:28,109
somebody that does the compliance but

935
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:30,359
regulatory part privacy part and

936
00:44:28,109 --> 00:44:32,578
somebody that actually that's what

937
00:44:30,359 --> 00:44:35,670
you've what you said yeah the actual

938
00:44:32,579 --> 00:44:38,849
Caesar do you think that that's a wise

939
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:40,859
idea and wise idea because I am kind of

940
00:44:38,849 --> 00:44:47,069
divided on that I would like to hear you

941
00:44:40,859 --> 00:44:51,270
absolutely I want to go back to my my

942
00:44:47,069 --> 00:44:55,890
old my old keynote that I did and this

943
00:44:51,270 --> 00:45:06,150
is this is basically what I mentioned

944
00:44:55,890 --> 00:45:08,220
where do we go give me one sec yeah may

945
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:11,339
I have the slides please Thanks

946
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:15,058
yeah basically the the seesaw role had

947
00:45:11,339 --> 00:45:20,549
forked from InfoSec from I mean so from

948
00:45:15,059 --> 00:45:22,650
cio role but let me yeah so if you look

949
00:45:20,549 --> 00:45:24,960
at the see source data job functions

950
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:28,170
it's this this stuff this is all from

951
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:30,869
that keynotes and you look at the fact

952
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:33,660
that 90% of your time is gonna be sucked

953
00:45:30,869 --> 00:45:35,190
into compliance and it is you know

954
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:37,319
basically at this point you to say this

955
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:42,150
is not myself is not my monkeys you you

956
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:46,619
essentially hive off the whole job of

957
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:49,440
compliance to somebody else stickin with

958
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:51,559
a sac and you move on to what you want

959
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:55,470
to do best is defend against attackers

960
00:45:51,559 --> 00:45:58,050
the compliance officer defends against

961
00:45:55,470 --> 00:46:01,470
the auditors you need time

962
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:06,440
to create thoughts and teams for defense

963
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:12,299
you get stuck in compliance good luck

964
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:14,550
right we bring this to a close yeah I

965
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:16,290
think that wraps up the time we have

966
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:17,910
question shall be answered at after

967
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:19,860
parties and wherever you can find me

968
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:22,259
