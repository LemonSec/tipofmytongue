1
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:19,330
so I realized that I'm the last one that

2
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:22,400
stands between you and the Friday party

3
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:27,589
so I'll try to make it so that it is

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:30,799
worth being here a couple of things so

5
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:33,710
yeah I was introduced I've been in this

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:38,180
field since Eric's exploits I don't know

7
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:41,710
does anyone here remember Eric's one

8
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,710
person okay so two of us right

9
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:48,830
so it was like before some of you were

10
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,199
born and this is insane it's not because

11
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:54,140
I want to say how old and cool I am and

12
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:56,870
I'm not it's just because for the

13
00:00:54,140 --> 00:01:01,220
research that I was conducting here the

14
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:03,680
many things that I saw they looked so

15
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:08,619
similar to the stuff that I saw in 90's

16
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,619
so the situation is not really improving

17
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:14,809
yeah besides that I I was involved in

18
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:17,330
both in for second and IT operations

19
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:20,420
many times and it's helped me a lot and

20
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:22,009
I recommend many people to switch sides

21
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:25,580
from time to time because it gives a

22
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:28,250
different perspective and when you're on

23
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:31,190
the infest excited always like why the

24
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,900
hell those IT guys are not moving or

25
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:36,470
whatever and then when you switch it

26
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:39,710
over they're usually think like those

27
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:42,980
security people they have no clue at all

28
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:45,500
and yeah I've been on both sides of that

29
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:48,070
and they really like it so nowadays I

30
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:53,360
mostly do PowerPoint to be honest but

31
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:55,039
once I had some free time and I got

32
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,960
bored I guess

33
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,810
so besides power phones I decided to run

34
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:05,570
nmap and and this is how this story

35
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:07,100
started so there was a net and it was a

36
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:09,949
very traditional office network like

37
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:11,379
nothing nothing fancy right reasonably

38
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:19,019
well maintained

39
00:02:11,379 --> 00:02:21,149
and this is a simplified scheme

40
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,970
okay so there was a couple of VLANs

41
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,590
there those users real and it was

42
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,820
management for landfill security devices

43
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:31,430
and there was a separate security

44
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:34,230
devices with them and if you ever had to

45
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:36,960
maintain all those access control

46
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:39,570
devices you know that a usually hugely

47
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,940
outdated aspect and software for the

48
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:44,190
management stations is also like I don't

49
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,859
know I think in that case it was Windows

50
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:50,900
2003 and when they insisted that knob

51
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:55,020
they should be installed because reasons

52
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:58,320
so I was scanning that Network and at

53
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:02,340
some point and realized that although it

54
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,450
was expected that a configuration bouton

55
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,250
on the firewall would only allow

56
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,810
communication from the management we

57
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:09,420
learned to this those security devices

58
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:11,100
and access control wheel and that due to

59
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:18,299
a Mis configuration of the firewall

60
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:20,910
where there Edmunds I guess wanted to

61
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,560
let users access many things on the

62
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:26,329
internet inadvertently they also made it

63
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:29,400
available the security devices villain

64
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:31,350
so a mistake but I think it's a pretty

65
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,970
common one so if you look on a typical

66
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:35,540
enterprise for above you probably will

67
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:38,820
see something like that

68
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:40,590
so when I was looking at that that that

69
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,200
particular network I found something

70
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:44,880
interesting

71
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,350
the password was default of course like

72
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:50,130
ednan admin or something I don't

73
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:54,480
remember what exactly about that and I

74
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:57,900
found that right like typical network

75
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,450
settings thing but then besides besides

76
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:03,240
network configuration for that and I

77
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:06,899
knew that this seemed to be somehow

78
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:09,450
related to access control but I didn't

79
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:12,150
know initially what exactly that was but

80
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:15,238
I found the firmware date page so I

81
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:19,709
thought ok turn bro

82
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:21,209
so I went to a vendor side and yeah

83
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:23,310
I said no we are not disclosed in the

84
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:27,090
vendor at the moment because I'm still

85
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:30,630
trying to get them to confirm something

86
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:36,810
that I will reveal later on

87
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:39,870
and issue fix hopefully sometimes this

88
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:41,340
century tape they will reply and

89
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,840
hopefully in this millennia they will

90
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,179
raise a fix and then we will post a blog

91
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,729
or something so I found that I found a

92
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:50,820
firmware right and I went to render site

93
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:52,650
download firmware run big walk if you

94
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:55,020
ever if you ever had to deal with the

95
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:58,859
frame where you know how to do that

96
00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:02,070
pretty pretty easy stuff so download

97
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:04,080
firmware run bean walk found what you

98
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:09,590
expect to find there the aroma fest file

99
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,590
system over here links kernel somewhere

100
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:19,099
extracted file system mounted it and

101
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:23,250
look at the files how the four files

102
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:28,800
that I found there there was a post

103
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:29,970
video file and yeah I got curious why

104
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,850
would you need a possibility file there

105
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:38,220
right so wiper sweetie and yeah of

106
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:41,580
course because this is a traditional

107
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:44,550
unix hashing it was not hard at all to

108
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:49,070
to to get today although the password is

109
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:51,330
I would say reasonably secure is not the

110
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:54,719
vocabulary puzzle that's not a

111
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:57,030
dictionary one but yeah I nevertheless

112
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,670
it was traditional unix hashing so i

113
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:02,039
didn't took long to together possible so

114
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:03,750
why would you need a password okay there

115
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:07,080
should be a reason for that and that

116
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:08,730
puzzle was different from from the one

117
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,500
default that I had on the web at Nova

118
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:13,230
Babel interface so I started looking

119
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:16,830
around there are a few things in the TC

120
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:21,080
folder and they're interesting one was

121
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:25,020
that drop beer who knows what droopy is

122
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:27,210
yeah right Robby is an embedded SSH

123
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:30,479
daemon that the SSH daemon is typically

124
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:36,049
used in embedded system so lower size

125
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:39,720
less features reasonably well suited for

126
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:42,300
for smaller devices and less powerful to

127
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,950
us oh okay drop where there were derby

128
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,950
is interesting

129
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:49,500
but when I was scanning this device I

130
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:51,750
didn't didn't find a way and I didn't

131
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:55,320
found sshd actually listening anywhere

132
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:56,850
so there was no SSH port open so I

133
00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:00,240
thought okay there should be a reason

134
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:03,630
why drop where files are there that will

135
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,710
be a binary is there but it's not

136
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:08,219
listening so there should be a way to

137
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:13,849
start it so I look in obvious places in

138
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:18,050
each tab nothing bound etcc

139
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:22,530
also nothing of particular interest

140
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:24,900
except for I realize that the device is

141
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:27,030
initially configured with static IP IP

142
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,500
address and only later on it is

143
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,969
reconfigured to the one that you have

144
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,530
any other configuration settings and

145
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:38,520
that gives you a window of opportunity

146
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:41,760
to attack the device in addict conf and

147
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:44,280
also again nothing of interest so I

148
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,800
thought okay it should be like something

149
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:50,099
less trivial I saw step tsuki that the

150
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,080
binaries themselves there was a standard

151
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,730
one like the typical busy box what you

152
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,479
would expect to find an embedded system

153
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:59,100
and I never a few that we are not

154
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:01,170
something that I would expect and they

155
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:04,290
seem to be related to the main function

156
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:08,970
of the device which is scanning

157
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:10,860
fingerprints and and and and checking

158
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:16,320
cards like those access cards that you

159
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:17,490
use so and you see drop where there so

160
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:21,330
at this point that was reasonably

161
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:24,510
convinced that there is a way to start

162
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:26,310
as a sage daemon there I just didn't

163
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:29,099
know how so and also the interesting

164
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:31,440
thing was that as you can see those

165
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:34,790
binaries those existing executables are

166
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:39,240
not elf that what you would expect on a

167
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:43,380
typical Linux system they develop what

168
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:49,380
is called BBB flit and those are coming

169
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:55,110
from I think now abandoned use the Linux

170
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:57,779
project so they fled is a pretty simple

171
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:59,759
format of a pretty simple binary

172
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:02,819
woman so what you got there and unlike

173
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:05,100
elf there is no header almost at all

174
00:09:02,819 --> 00:09:14,149
there is no meter data nothing like all

175
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:19,170
you've got is it certain where is it

176
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:22,410
yeah at the address 40 hacks you just

177
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:22,769
have your raw data segment and nothing

178
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:25,469
else

179
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:32,970
it could be gzipped or it could be just

180
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:35,430
raw and I started googling virus but I

181
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:37,110
don't go into details I look in multiple

182
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:40,109
binaries but at some point that looked

183
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:41,660
at the httpd the one that was serving

184
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:46,019
webpages to me

185
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:50,219
so we realized at that point that this

186
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:53,209
is actually a bora web server and again

187
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:55,470
this is an open source web server

188
00:09:53,209 --> 00:10:02,040
interestingly it was last updated in

189
00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:06,600
February 2005 which is like 14 years

190
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:09,000
from now and at that time it seems to be

191
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:13,740
a top notch and was used in user Linux

192
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,449
project and again interested in it runs

193
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:19,800
like an anywhere under very limited

194
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:23,219
memory conditions so the way how it

195
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:27,269
works is different from like Apache or

196
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:31,410
nginx the way how it works is that you

197
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:33,839
need to register handlers for for the

198
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:37,920
URLs that you want to serve okay

199
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:42,569
and Abbie fleet is also interesting

200
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:44,279
because either initially I didn't had

201
00:10:42,569 --> 00:10:47,128
support for it but thankfully throughout

202
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:53,750
tons of plugins for it so we did manage

203
00:10:47,129 --> 00:10:53,750
to figure it out so and out of all

204
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:00,170
out of all callbacks out of all

205
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:01,190
functions that were registered there was

206
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:05,780
a one that was particularly interesting

207
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:10,370
for me this one below for the URL that

208
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:13,400
ends with slash is shd dot HTM it would

209
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:24,080
run the function that we call bring up

210
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:28,790
sshd and that did this here go there are

211
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:33,650
wonderful drop by a binary and then it's

212
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:34,849
also out some text interested in the

213
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:36,890
same text you can find on the file

214
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:41,090
system which was the way how I initially

215
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:42,949
discovered and then if you hit on the

216
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:46,070
real run in device if you hit the secret

217
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:54,980
URL that was not documented then you

218
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:59,690
will see that and then if you scan the

219
00:11:54,980 --> 00:12:03,320
IP address again you will see this on

220
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:11,500
port 8000 9 there isn't doorbell so

221
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:11,500
listening yeah and then that's it

222
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:24,140
now who thinks this is a back door who

223
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:28,730
thinks this is not a back door whole

224
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:32,620
things you can exploit it whole things

225
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:40,010
this is a vulnerability lady seriously

226
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:43,810
no okay it is a feature okay well you're

227
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:43,810
probably better embedded def right

228
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:51,160
whether it is vulnerability or not I

229
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:56,720
mean this is all terminology discussion

230
00:12:51,160 --> 00:13:02,810
but I think that if you have a static

231
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:05,029
password yeah okay so

232
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:08,779
if you have a static password and a

233
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:12,310
password that was not documented and the

234
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:16,700
functionality that was not documented

235
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:22,760
mom maybe you can qualify this is

236
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:25,910
engineering access but I think many of

237
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:30,589
us know this story about some Chinese

238
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:34,810
telecom producer that was recently

239
00:13:30,589 --> 00:13:38,080
slammed for much less level of

240
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:46,099
engineering access and their devices so

241
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:48,500
I don't know but that's not all

242
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:50,930
so I promise you've liked virtual to

243
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:53,450
physical and also physical to virtual so

244
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:55,520
if you look at a typical device they all

245
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:59,480
are the same like if you go to your

246
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:01,250
office and and look at those you usually

247
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,980
will see that like the interesting

248
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:05,630
property of those readers is that they

249
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:08,030
are mounted outside of your security

250
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:13,010
perimeter right so they outside of your

251
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:16,699
door and also they usually have a screw

252
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:18,080
like I check about I think 10 and all of

253
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:20,630
them they edit screw down they're like

254
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:22,700
somewhere on the side or on the button

255
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:26,660
from that and if you saw you just with

256
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:31,670
one screwdriver you can open them and

257
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:34,400
once you open them you'll see that so we

258
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:35,870
have a couple of things here so this one

259
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,480
in the middle services on that interface

260
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:43,339
right but mm-hmm

261
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:45,230
this is a modern device but the thing

262
00:14:43,339 --> 00:14:49,850
with those systems the daily life time

263
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:52,640
is also like year so maybe like 15 10 15

264
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:56,030
years so they have to be compatible

265
00:14:52,640 --> 00:15:00,160
backer compatible to something that was

266
00:14:56,030 --> 00:15:03,350
invented back in the arocs exploits time

267
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:07,459
so that particular device had two more

268
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:11,540
interfaces one is why grant and the

269
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:12,939
other one was C report so why don't is

270
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:20,079
interesting

271
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:22,990
Wygant is free wise one is ground one is

272
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:26,860
used to send zeros and other ones used

273
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:33,280
to send once and I said no flow control

274
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:36,070
nothing no authentication no whatever so

275
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:40,209
and then there's an another interesting

276
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:43,090
feature of those devices is that they

277
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:46,540
are usually designed so that they still

278
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:48,220
operate if you have lights out and then

279
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:52,209
some of them are file open some of the

280
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:54,970
file close some of them try to walk if

281
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:57,760
your management server is not reachable

282
00:15:54,970 --> 00:16:00,910
for whatever reason I think that's a

283
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:06,010
good idea like I don't want to be locked

284
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:08,890
out in a room with the server so the way

285
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:10,840
how they do that is then they have a

286
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:13,120
local database out that I'll go to into

287
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:19,450
more details here I think so they have a

288
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:22,060
local database of all cards and in case

289
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:27,760
of this specific device they also had a

290
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:31,869
database of all fingerprints on it that

291
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:34,900
were presented as a specific type of of

292
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:37,120
a card of access card so there are those

293
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:41,620
wonderful guys outside there the RFID

294
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:44,560
research group that and they didn't pay

295
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:48,160
me for this advertisement but they they

296
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:51,520
sell RFID readers and if you get into

297
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:53,709
such device and you'll have a full

298
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:56,740
database of cards down all you need to

299
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:59,130
do mmm it's just to program your card

300
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:03,430
with the IDS that you have

301
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:04,800
so which means that you attack this

302
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:09,040
device over the Internet

303
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:13,659
you grab the IDS you program your card

304
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:17,170
you walk to the door and you opened and

305
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:18,970
that's how you get in and more

306
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:22,540
interesting if you cannot do that for

307
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:24,670
some reason you just take a screwdriver

308
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:28,690
it's very low-tech

309
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:31,990
you to open the device you connect a

310
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:35,260
background in the face and then you just

311
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:38,760
send the common to the controller that

312
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:42,310
okay I have the right card interestingly

313
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:44,290
you don't even know need to know the

314
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:48,159
idea of the card because the controller

315
00:17:44,290 --> 00:18:01,030
just trust that the reader that it has

316
00:17:48,160 --> 00:18:02,380
the right card tennis it and then there

317
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:05,740
are a couple more things because I said

318
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:09,130
that this thing is high-tech like it's a

319
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:11,640
modern equivalent of it so it's not only

320
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:15,240
Kuna case all those legacy interfaces

321
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:20,710
but it also communicates over the modern

322
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:22,110
secure and encrypted protocols so here's

323
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:27,000
an example

324
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:27,000
that's a configuration file from the

325
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:32,980
from one such device that is set up to

326
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:35,889
communicate with the controller over the

327
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:40,450
internet so over there is right over the

328
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:42,490
IP so as you can see here the

329
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:46,690
communication is encrypted with a Triple

330
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:50,410
DES which is could be sufficiently

331
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:53,470
secured by nowadays standards except for

332
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:56,130
that we know the Triple DES has just

333
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:59,110
three consecutive applications of the

334
00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:05,140
legacy DES encryption protocol with

335
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:06,820
different keys so in this case as you

336
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:11,650
can see the second and the third key

337
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:15,520
they were empty which a fish effectively

338
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:19,000
reduced the security of the

339
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:22,629
communication to a single des which is

340
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:29,409
56 bit key and which could be trivially

341
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:34,299
broken nowadays in your laptop but I bet

342
00:19:29,409 --> 00:19:36,070
I bet the vendor claims that like the

343
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:38,370
communication is encrypted thank you

344
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:38,370
very much

345
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:57,460
so what can we do here like what what is

346
00:19:54,130 --> 00:20:02,289
what is the take from here hmm

347
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:06,159
so you can go from virtual to physical

348
00:20:02,289 --> 00:20:08,019
so like while you're on the internet and

349
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:11,679
you somehow have a remote access to this

350
00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:13,960
device you can break in then you can

351
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:17,200
dump you please you can program your

352
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:21,240
case and then you can like just walk in

353
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:25,240
through the door and interestingly

354
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:27,580
because your clone in the real key so

355
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:30,399
there would be probably little suspicion

356
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:34,360
so not from from the monitoring

357
00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:36,370
perspective nothing special is happening

358
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:39,250
here like just another employee is

359
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:49,178
walking into the office or in your data

360
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:52,059
center or anywhere now the other way

361
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:55,720
around would be that you unscrew this

362
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:57,309
device you connect to internet port or

363
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:02,710
you connect a vagrant port and you send

364
00:20:57,309 --> 00:21:06,789
a comment to controller again the keys

365
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:14,669
are static so same as passports so they

366
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:28,350
are the same I bet like 99.9 devices

367
00:21:14,669 --> 00:21:28,350
worldwide will have the same key and

368
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:34,880
then

369
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:37,760
lucky with this research and you know

370
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:42,410
sometimes you just had one legacy device

371
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:49,970
or one legacy model and then the rest is

372
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:52,880
fine so we went ahead and downloaded all

373
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:54,230
firmware files that this vendor for all

374
00:21:52,880 --> 00:22:03,160
different devices that this vendor

375
00:21:54,230 --> 00:22:03,160
produce so what we found was was this

376
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:19,340
there's a how many one two three four

377
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:22,250
five different firm res from different

378
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:26,840
devices from the same vendor that all

379
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:31,540
share the same SSH host key so not only

380
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:35,990
all devices of the same model worldwide

381
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:38,690
share the same SSH key but also multiple

382
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:41,420
devices from different models share the

383
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:43,520
same SSH key and the private key is

384
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:48,590
there in the firmware that you can

385
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:52,220
download which means that you fear if

386
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:55,909
you represent an organization with an

387
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:59,270
ability to control traffic over the

388
00:22:55,910 --> 00:23:02,210
Internet or over some networks that is

389
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:05,000
supposed to be secure or maybe they're

390
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:09,200
not you can trigger the make

391
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,720
man-in-the-middle attack here because

392
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:15,340
you know private keys again there's

393
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,340
static and they're the same everywhere

394
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:22,450
and you guess what

395
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:28,250
that's isocell keys for HTTP so the

396
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:31,760
vendor does use HTTPS on the management

397
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:35,090
interface but frankly speaking it

398
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,710
doesn't help because again the keys are

399
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:38,600
not only the same that like not only

400
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:41,000
they are on the front where and their

401
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:44,000
static they also the same for all

402
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,850
devices and there

403
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,330
the same for all multiple models of the

404
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:53,780
sender eyes of the different devices and

405
00:23:49,330 --> 00:24:02,629
again so that means that H HTTP

406
00:23:53,780 --> 00:24:04,490
man-in-the-middle strudel and yeah even

407
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:08,150
though you can imagine that people like

408
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:11,690
would click accept anyway in the browser

409
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:12,830
so maybe this is less redundant SSH but

410
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:15,700
nevertheless you can do man in the

411
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:21,020
middle and no one would suspect anything

412
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:24,200
and then of course this is actually an

413
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:27,860
improvement here so there are two kinds

414
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:41,900
of static passwords and different models

415
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:50,169
but they all study yeah and then I was

416
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:54,380
wrong so now I want to do a quiz tell me

417
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:59,690
how many hits did I find how things I

418
00:24:54,380 --> 00:25:03,680
found less than 100 know how things that

419
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:06,710
I found less than 10 okay who thinks

420
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:10,640
that I found less than 200 but wallet

421
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:15,020
100 one person more than 100 or less

422
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:19,700
than between 100 and 200 devices and

423
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:22,310
shortened that the devices of this time

424
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:26,150
so what I did okay yeah some explanation

425
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:28,940
here so look at an HTTP team and I look

426
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:31,730
at signatures that httpd producers so

427
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:34,340
you can reliably identify those devices

428
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:38,720
on the network they have some unique

429
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:41,689
properties and there are distinctive

430
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:47,450
enough that you can use shorten to

431
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:51,230
search for them so I

432
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:53,360
research so how what do you think how

433
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:57,830
many devices did I find on the Internet

434
00:25:53,360 --> 00:26:01,250
less than 100 between one and two

435
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:05,600
hundred okay between two and five

436
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:10,480
hundred okay between two and five

437
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:17,750
hundred okay between one 500 and 1000

438
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:26,200
you're pessimistic between 1,000 and

439
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:26,200
2,000 okay between 2,000 and 5,000

440
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:41,110
between 2,000 and 5,000 10,000 now now

441
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:45,260
okay so I think it's not that bad right

442
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:49,760
I I think that that wouldn't be the

443
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:52,250
largest botnet in the world but I think

444
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:58,610
it would be pretty decent and also it

445
00:26:52,250 --> 00:27:01,010
would be very hard to to actually remove

446
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:03,260
their tracker from this device because I

447
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:11,090
don't know about you but I'm not aware

448
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:13,908
of any malware protection or any any

449
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:21,129
other form of protection for for the

450
00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:30,080
fingerprint readers so that is not hard

451
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:32,299
at all to to set up about 9 that would

452
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:35,449
be running on those devices but that's

453
00:27:32,299 --> 00:27:43,158
not it that's not all because what we

454
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:47,539
found was that when you when you update

455
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:50,419
the firmware there's no validation at

456
00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:53,110
all I mean there is a validation for the

457
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:54,950
consistency of the firmware apparently

458
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:59,030
while there are no cryptographic

459
00:27:54,950 --> 00:28:04,350
signatures whatsoever which means

460
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:07,740
that yeah and Phil Murray by the way was

461
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:10,409
I think I downloaded over HTTP not HTTP

462
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:13,549
but I think comparing to everything else

463
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:17,190
is like it's just a minor thing

464
00:28:13,549 --> 00:28:18,570
so that interesting that means that if

465
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:20,630
you get a hold of your firmware you

466
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:24,629
actually control you on your firmware

467
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:28,590
and then run an update and the device

468
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:32,940
would be safely updated and then you

469
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:36,928
will get it like something that you

470
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:40,679
probably cannot do anything this because

471
00:28:36,929 --> 00:28:44,820
consider this I could make a firmware

472
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:49,380
that would change the password change

473
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:51,120
default passwords and probably even

474
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:56,549
disabled if you if you look at original

475
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:59,149
original stuff what they do here just

476
00:28:56,549 --> 00:28:59,150
give my mom

477
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:23,350
yeah yeah so upon startup after mounting

478
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:28,270
the file systems and blah blah blah blah

479
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:30,870
blah and ringing up the network they run

480
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:36,520
a root shell on the console on this

481
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:38,379
serial port that I mentioned so I

482
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:40,030
actually don't need all that again if

483
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:44,760
you have a screwdriver and you can

484
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:44,760
connect to a serial port you just get in

485
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:52,680
so but if I'm an attacker and I want to

486
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:55,419
build a firmware that would not do that

487
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:57,520
that would disable SSH password or

488
00:29:55,420 --> 00:30:01,150
changes the sage person and it will

489
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:03,970
change your admin password for this HTTP

490
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:07,570
interface it probably would be not easy

491
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:10,000
to get in so the device would be there

492
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:11,530
just running you probably would never

493
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,760
discover it but we just keep functioning

494
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:23,950
but even if you discover that it is

495
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:30,520
broken into you cannot get in so I think

496
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:34,150
this is very this is very nice add on to

497
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:36,910
that to the whole situation so you can

498
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:38,920
do from physical to virtual you can go

499
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:42,670
back from virtual to physical you can't

500
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:50,110
you can do both and I think this is

501
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:52,870
pretty nice so with that said what do

502
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:55,949
you think what is missing from the whole

503
00:30:52,870 --> 00:31:01,149
presentation here what didn't is

504
00:30:55,950 --> 00:31:08,950
solution that will be good one so we are

505
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:14,470
walking with the vendor that responded

506
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:17,080
to us but I didn't yet issue the patch

507
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:22,090
and they didn't even confirm yet that

508
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:27,070
the like this whole thing exists this

509
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:29,919
particular vendor is has a history

510
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:32,260
and it's they are not different from any

511
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:35,050
other vendors in this field so they are

512
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:36,879
not particularly bad they're like from

513
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:39,520
the security standpoint they had the

514
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,860
usual ones so they have a history of

515
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:45,820
vulnerabilities in their products they

516
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:48,429
seem to fix them somehow but I don't

517
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:54,270
know how many of you did ever update the

518
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:57,040
firmware of your access control devices

519
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:59,500
so in the situation that I encountered

520
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:02,020
that was done by an external vendor

521
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:03,490
external to the company and this

522
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:05,889
external vendor took the full

523
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:09,700
responsibility for this access control

524
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:12,160
system and as I mentioned for example

525
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:13,690
they insisted on a particular operating

526
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:16,900
system on the management station I

527
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:21,360
insisted on that they manage it and as

528
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:25,660
they wanted and the security team was

529
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:26,770
not able to do much at least back then I

530
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:29,320
don't know what is the situation right

531
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:34,270
now I was not able to do much about this

532
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:39,250
whole setup do you think I miss anything

533
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:44,070
else no all good okay

534
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:44,070
like when Steve Jobs said one more thing

535
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:51,070
so there's an LCD and this whole thing

536
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:53,709
there's a rule like so when you look at

537
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:56,139
those old things and there isn't part of

538
00:32:53,710 --> 00:33:02,560
that is that when I looked at the build

539
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:13,300
times of those boundaries that was I

540
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:17,020
think mm gosh 2013 or 2014 something

541
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:22,030
like that or 2012 it was a last working

542
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:26,980
day before the Christmas and the build

543
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:28,960
time was like 5:00 p.m. something so the

544
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:31,060
guy who built that like this whole this

545
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:35,100
whole thing he really wanted to go for

546
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:38,230
vacation right very much

547
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:40,000
and for those of you who works in

548
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:42,130
software engineering we all know right

549
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,980
that okay the pressure is high that

550
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:48,190
lengths deadlines are always making fun

551
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:52,890
of us so we really want to to do that

552
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:55,990
and move on so he did that and move on

553
00:33:52,890 --> 00:34:01,000
and unfortunately he he made a mistake

554
00:33:55,990 --> 00:34:02,950
and in Singapore like okay I don't want

555
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,270
to say it was trivial i I don't want to

556
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:06,940
just regard the efforts that went into

557
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:11,259
that but there was a buffer overflow in

558
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:17,050
the metadata in specifically in the HTTP

559
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:18,970
host header that went to in the end of

560
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:24,750
the day event or ability to override the

561
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:28,239
memory and led to the hip corruption

562
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:30,040
which in turn in a classic way went to

563
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:31,330
remote code execution again

564
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:35,409
unfortunately they are not going into

565
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:37,480
more details right now because we expect

566
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:40,960
to get them back from vendor and we

567
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:45,010
expect them to issue fixes for that and

568
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:48,810
we also hope that people will update the

569
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:53,260
firmware on on the machines on the

570
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:55,839
security devices and now that's it and

571
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:58,450
many things to to the people who helped

572
00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:07,170
me and I'm happy to answer your

573
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:11,020
questions as for Kevin please thank you

574
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:13,540
now we'll we'll do questions from the

575
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:15,880
floor as well as from slide oh and same

576
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:17,740
thing applies best question or most

577
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,510
uploaded question get surprised and

578
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:21,669
Kevin also gets to choose Jun's favorite

579
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:23,710
question and he's got lots of nice

580
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:26,530
goodies from I have no worries in it to

581
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:35,280
give so any questions from the floor

582
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:41,460
please yes sir no my releases of work is

583
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:45,970
powerpoint budgeting PowerPoint Excel

584
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:48,040

meetings meetings meetings

586
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:55,900
and then sometimes nmap yeah right so no

587
00:35:52,450 --> 00:36:00,669
that's not a usual thing but I'm I feel

588
00:35:55,900 --> 00:36:02,500
privileged that sometimes I get some

589
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:06,520
spare time to play with interesting

590
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:17,320
things any more questions from the

591
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:20,410
audience yes uh hi just now you

592
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:23,110
mentioned almost all mother has the same

593
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:25,450
public key right in this town

594
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:29,800
so as you're advised to protect against

595
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:35,140
it was I sitting well if I were

596
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:37,030
designing such things what I would do I

597
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:43,629
would generate the keys

598
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:51,010
every time the device booted and I would

599
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:52,840
hope that that is better because in a

600
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:54,730
situation and every key is different

601
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:58,180
like the problem of embedded devices is

602
00:36:54,730 --> 00:37:00,850
that you don't have much space to to

603
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:05,200
store your stuff that the keys are not

604
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:07,089
big and and like you you usually can

605
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:11,950
find a couple of kilobytes to store key

606
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:14,320
but the other problem is that sometimes

607
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:16,750
for the from the cost perspective those

608
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:19,540
devices do not they only have ROM and

609
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:23,230
RAM and I do not have any room at all

610
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:28,029
right so when you reboot the device I

611
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:33,850
just got back it goes back to to factory

612
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:37,480
settings and what I would do in this

613
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:40,839
situation I would generate the key every

614
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:45,580
time and then I probably would send CSR

615
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:47,140
to the management server and then the

616
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,880
management server would like would be

617
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:50,500
returning a full certificate then I

618
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,320
would keep the certificate in RAM and

619
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:55,720
and then it would be like first on one

620
00:37:53,320 --> 00:38:00,720
side it will be trusted on the other

621
00:37:55,720 --> 00:38:00,720
hand that could not be easily movable

622
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:07,299
else if you if you speak about SSH then

623
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:12,700
I probably wouldn't want to have it at

624
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:15,580
all so that is okay I am NOT an embedded

625
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:19,750
developer here and I don't have a lot of

626
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:23,440
experience and I cannot judge but I do

627
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:26,860
believe that a serial port would be

628
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:29,140
enough for debugging and you don't

629
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:30,820
really need to have an SSH D running on

630
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:33,160
your production system and on top of

631
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:38,020
that you should if you do please

632
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:41,140
document that okay any more questions

633
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:42,130
from the audience if not can I ask one

634
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:44,049
yeah sure

635
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:46,060
okay I wanted to ask you actually how

636
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:49,750
many different types of fingerprint

637
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:55,540
scanners did you test so we looked at I

638
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:59,050
think about 12 of 15 from brands so we

639
00:38:55,540 --> 00:39:03,540
find five that were closely syndrome and

640
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:09,130
then if I found another family that used

641
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:13,360
a more modern version of Linux and they

642
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:14,830
did the stuff that he did there was done

643
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:18,280
a little bit better from the security

644
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:22,259
standpoint but also those seem to be the

645
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:27,100
devices that had more CPU and RAM and

646
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:29,020
probably the developers had to make less

647
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:34,600
trade-offs when they are doing that

648
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:36,520
stuff and so overall as I said we were

649
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:38,680
looking about like 12 to 15 devices and

650
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:41,470
the five of them experiment like had had

651
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:43,890
those properties okay I've looked at

652
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:46,319
this for a bit and I've come across to

653
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:48,549
readers where what the way they

654
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:51,700
perpetrate the fraud is they use a

655
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:53,860
residual fingerprint and as have you did

656
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:56,230
you come across that or and also another

657
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:59,710
way was an overriding hard-coded

658
00:39:56,230 --> 00:40:02,020
password I think this is okay I didn't

659
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:05,320
look for this possibility here but I

660
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:07,990
definitely think it could be doable and

661
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:10,150
again like those devices this particular

662
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:14,729
device was designed to work offline so

663
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:16,650
it kept all the state locally in RAM

664
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:20,580
which means that as soon as you get hold

665
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:24,630
of it you can do whatever you want all

666
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:31,980
right all right yes please go ahead we

667
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:33,990
still have time to go hi you mentioned a

668
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:35,580
lot of proprietary protocols proprietary

669
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:39,029
technology do you think open-source

670
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:41,420
would help in this case oh it's good

671
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:41,420
question

672
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:56,640
data shows that open source does not

673
00:40:52,710 --> 00:41:00,300
mean that it is secure so this device

674
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:03,120
most of it was built on on open source

675
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:04,710
stuff so open source web server build

676
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:11,490
together with open SSL and you guess

677
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:14,220
what the open SSL was from like 2009 or

678
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:16,799
something and you had there what you

679
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:20,730
expect together everything event follow

680
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:23,430
it so no I don't think it is going to be

681
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:25,140
more secure because of fusing of in this

682
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:28,520
particular case of using the open open

683
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:36,210
source software I think what would help

684
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:37,500
would be using more it would be using

685
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:41,340
public standards for those

686
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:45,590
communications between between those

687
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:50,220
devices and a control server or between

688
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:52,310
the the locks and the readers because

689
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:55,410
there is also another problem like so

690
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:57,330
the way how how those systems work is

691
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:59,609
that you have a reader so the reader

692
00:41:57,330 --> 00:42:01,590
talks to controller controller talks to

693
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:05,370
the lock to that like that did the real

694
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:08,130
log that opens the door right so the

695
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:09,600
authentication scheme as I said like in

696
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:11,670
this in this case it was very

697
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:15,690
rudimentary or non-existent and all of

698
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:17,490
the Houmas so it talks to controller and

699
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:23,190
then control signals to the daughter

700
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:26,589
like to open it so I think that we are

701
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:28,749
this protocol open if

702
00:42:26,589 --> 00:42:33,130
could be better implemented then and

703
00:42:28,749 --> 00:42:34,930
what we have witness here and so that

704
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:37,900
would help whether the implementation

705
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:42,219
will be open source or closed source one

706
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:43,390
I don't think it is significant okay I

707
00:42:42,219 --> 00:42:45,789
think now would be a good time to go to

708
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:48,969
the questions on slide oh we've given it

709
00:42:45,789 --> 00:42:51,069
enough time to warm up so we have one

710
00:42:48,969 --> 00:42:53,440
question on the top with the highest

711
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:55,509
number of votes so far given the

712
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,309
immutable nature of biometric data what

713
00:42:55,509 --> 00:42:59,019
are the best custody standards you've

714
00:42:57,309 --> 00:43:02,249
come across to stop attackers from

715
00:42:59,019 --> 00:43:08,140
immediately being able to use this data

716
00:43:02,249 --> 00:43:13,140
okay I think the best way to protect

717
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:18,969
biometric data is not to store it at all

718
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:21,009
and I think that the biometric

719
00:43:18,969 --> 00:43:24,700
authentication is actually worse than

720
00:43:21,009 --> 00:43:27,640
anything else particularly because you

721
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:31,419
cannot change your fingerprints so if

722
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:34,450
your fingerprint got leaked like you're

723
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:36,999
done for the rest of your life this is

724
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:43,450
not something you can mitigate like not

725
00:43:36,999 --> 00:43:49,078
at all and I don't think that any

726
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:52,239
technology any standard any regulation

727
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:55,380
anything will protect us from the

728
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:55,380
biometric data leakage

729
00:43:56,219 --> 00:44:03,729
last year we in Singapore witnessed the

730
00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:10,690
leakage of some sensitive data multiple

731
00:44:03,729 --> 00:44:13,479
times and there was regulation the

732
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:16,989
regulations in place they were protocols

733
00:44:13,479 --> 00:44:18,848
in place for that but that didn't

734
00:44:16,989 --> 00:44:22,479
prevent that this data to be from from

735
00:44:18,849 --> 00:44:26,430
from being leaked so I don't think that

736
00:44:22,479 --> 00:44:28,868
we as a society at this point are

737
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:32,979
capable enough of developing anything

738
00:44:28,869 --> 00:44:36,069
that could adequately protect biometric

739
00:44:32,979 --> 00:44:37,529
data so the best thing is not to keep it

740
00:44:36,069 --> 00:44:39,520
not to use it

741
00:44:37,529 --> 00:44:41,950
hello

742
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:43,810
and you have got a word of approval from

743
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:48,040
the questioner because he says excellent

744
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:49,990
answer just so who is Ari you want to

745
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:52,180
identify yourself you can get a nice

746
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:58,529
yeah I think it's a very good question I

747
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:58,529
have is that really you okay come over

748
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:05,890
okay how about the next question while

749
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:08,020
we're waiting for this young man to come

750
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:11,190
over any thoughts on the recent reach of

751
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:13,480
supremo's Biostar to security platform

752
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:15,820
to be honest I have no idea what they

753
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:19,060
don't know so I haven't heard them just

754
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:24,250
sorry but that so many breaches like

755
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:26,529
happening every day every week I think

756
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:29,790
it is easy to miss one so sorry about

757
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:29,790
that I don't know what is this a lot

758
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:37,770
shall we move on to the next one yeah is

759
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:37,770
it possible sorry

760
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:49,750
yeah sure it's basically the web

761
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:52,420
platform where they authenticate you for

762
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:56,020
your power matrix and everything failed

763
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:59,200
because they kill the web platform and

764
00:45:56,020 --> 00:46:03,100
this expecting 83 countries in the world

765
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:06,790
1.6 1 million people okay so well I

766
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:08,319
think I think like in this case the

767
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:10,210
biometric data is just another con type

768
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:13,660
of data and there's this this particular

769
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:15,250
breach then has nothing in particular to

770
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:17,618
do with biometrics right this is just

771
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:20,770
another breach of a web platform that

772
00:46:17,619 --> 00:46:25,119
happened to store sensitive data and as

773
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:26,500
I said I think that the current state of

774
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:29,380
software development and current set of

775
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:31,690
security is just not measure enough to

776
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:33,340
store this kind of data that you like

777
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:36,550
have to carry with you for for the rest

778
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:38,500
of your life all right we have a new

779
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:40,570
question that's come up to the top is

780
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:42,280
there possibility to fool biometric

781
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:48,340
scanners if you're able to open them up

782
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:49,869
yeah yeah so couple things so if you're

783
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:52,530
one and up and I said there's a database

784
00:46:49,869 --> 00:46:52,530
in there and

785
00:46:52,599 --> 00:47:01,430
for this particular vendor the way how

786
00:46:55,430 --> 00:47:04,190
it works is that they interact with the

787
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:07,790
reader itself and then from the reader

788
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:11,470
they they get there like a large number

789
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:14,660
a vector a binary vector that represent

790
00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:17,330
the the fingerprint and they in this

791
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:18,470
situation they were storing it as a in

792
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:23,150
the same way as they would store the

793
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:25,368
card ID and then it would just compare

794
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:28,369
like upon the next scan they would

795
00:47:25,369 --> 00:47:30,980
compare with like with existing table so

796
00:47:28,369 --> 00:47:35,780
I think there's a full bunch of attacks

797
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:37,910
here from SQL injection through the

798
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:42,589
biometric reader and I think that would

799
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:44,509
be like pretty cool too and then when

800
00:47:42,589 --> 00:47:49,940
you can do whatever one and open it up

801
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:53,359
to their ability to actually clone their

802
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:56,839
the fingerprint image and this is also

803
00:47:53,359 --> 00:48:00,400
available like everywhere almost so you

804
00:47:56,839 --> 00:48:02,299
can definitely fool this way and

805
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:04,580
probably if you think about it a little

806
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:09,650
bit more the probably that there will be

807
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:13,430
other ways to to do that but again for

808
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:16,310
this particular device and for about ten

809
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:19,190
others that I reviewed over the last

810
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:23,660
year you don't need all that you need a

811
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:25,339
screwdriver that's it so who is T you

812
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:29,000
want to identify yourself I think you

813
00:48:25,339 --> 00:48:31,820
get a prize for most uploaded questions

814
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:35,500
I'm gonna come up and I think you you

815
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:37,010
haven't had you taken your prize yet

816
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:41,750
later okay

817
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:44,109
okay come on great wonderful thank you

818
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:44,109
very much

819
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:50,650
okay next we still have about eight

820
00:48:49,239 --> 00:48:54,039
minutes so we can answer a few more

821
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:56,529
extra do you think with armed trust zone

822
00:48:54,039 --> 00:49:05,940
or Intel SGX it'll be safe to store

823
00:48:56,529 --> 00:49:05,940
biometrics data no I don't think so

824
00:49:06,539 --> 00:49:18,359
so first of all there's no magic in

825
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:21,549
there III said today to someone that I

826
00:49:18,359 --> 00:49:25,960
discussed this before before the talk

827
00:49:21,549 --> 00:49:28,538
net there is no hardware there is no

828
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:33,450
such thing as hardware garages Linux

829
00:49:28,539 --> 00:49:35,559
boxes with a very old Linux kernels so

830
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:37,960
everything around you that would be just

831
00:49:35,559 --> 00:49:39,970
okay inkay in case of Intel SGX I think

832
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:43,539
this is this would be MINIX instead of

833
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:46,720
Linux if I'm not mistaking but this is

834
00:49:43,539 --> 00:49:48,700
inherently software so you can

835
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:51,189
communicate with this software you can

836
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:53,230
try to faucet you can try to find bugs

837
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:54,789
it you can try to download the firmware

838
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:59,529
and then you can try to reverse-engineer

839
00:49:54,789 --> 00:50:02,109
it and find bugs this this way so it is

840
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:06,059
always going to be software and it will

841
00:50:02,109 --> 00:50:06,058
always go in to have bugs and then and

842
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:15,430
and you just back to square one with all

843
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:20,650
that so no I do not believe that again

844
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:23,680
as a software engineering industry at

845
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:27,819
that moment right now like in 2019 we

846
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:30,460
are capable of producing the software

847
00:50:27,819 --> 00:50:35,579
that is secure enough to hold this kind

848
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:35,579
of data so we just shouldn't do that

849
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:42,759
we've we've gone through that one the

850
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:45,038
next one down given that the end-user

851
00:50:42,759 --> 00:50:47,920
application of biometrics is heavily IOT

852
00:50:45,039 --> 00:50:50,259
based some sensors ID readers so on

853
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:53,049
would you say those IOT devices are the

854
00:50:50,259 --> 00:50:54,299
best attack vector vector to target this

855
00:50:53,049 --> 00:51:06,910
data

856
00:50:54,299 --> 00:51:08,859
that's an interesting question I was

857
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:13,029
thinking about that taking those devices

858
00:51:08,859 --> 00:51:18,369
a lot in in terms of the ultimate

859
00:51:13,029 --> 00:51:20,259
persistence and on the under Network

860
00:51:18,369 --> 00:51:22,749
because if you get hold of this device

861
00:51:20,259 --> 00:51:25,200
and you are on the network and it's very

862
00:51:22,749 --> 00:51:27,700
hard to radiate you from this network

863
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,239
because again like there are no endpoint

864
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:31,868
security

865
00:51:28,239 --> 00:51:33,339
anything like that and those devices are

866
00:51:31,869 --> 00:51:37,569
usually not considered a security threat

867
00:51:33,339 --> 00:51:39,670
at all so I think from that perspective

868
00:51:37,569 --> 00:51:41,680
as okay I'm a little bit different

869
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:43,839
questions but anyway I think this is a

870
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:47,019
valid point to make so from that

871
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:54,038
perspective I think those devices are a

872
00:51:47,019 --> 00:51:57,038
very valid target and if we think about

873
00:51:54,039 --> 00:52:04,630
the persistent attackers I think it is

874
00:51:57,039 --> 00:52:06,880
very reasonable way of getting initial

875
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:09,670
foothold on the Condor on the network

876
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:14,920
but also to maintain the persistence on

877
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:16,719
the network now if you if you think does

878
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:23,380
it make sense to attack those devices to

879
00:52:16,719 --> 00:52:29,529
to to collect biometric data I think

880
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:35,619
it's not but it's not because it's hard

881
00:52:29,529 --> 00:52:39,489
to do but it's mostly because you won't

882
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:43,299
get a lot and second it might be not

883
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:47,170
useful can see that the fact that again

884
00:52:43,299 --> 00:52:51,339
for this particular device that that I

885
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:55,420
researched you don't get a picture of

886
00:52:51,339 --> 00:52:58,450
the fingerprint right you get the binary

887
00:52:55,420 --> 00:53:00,519
vector that didn't look like this to me

888
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:02,979
it didn't look like a picture so I

889
00:53:00,519 --> 00:53:04,629
didn't I didn't manage to figure out

890
00:53:02,979 --> 00:53:08,259
like back to the image of the

891
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:11,279
fingerprint so I don't think it is maybe

892
00:53:08,259 --> 00:53:13,539
I'm wrong but I don't think it is so

893
00:53:11,279 --> 00:53:15,640
even if you break into this device what

894
00:53:13,539 --> 00:53:19,150
you will get you will get some kind of

895
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:20,558
hash or whatever that represents that

896
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:22,359
the fingerprint you don't have a

897
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:24,910
fingerprint yourself so it probably

898
00:53:22,359 --> 00:53:27,670
would be less useful and then the second

899
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:30,910
point is you just mentioned this

900
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:33,729
biometric website freaking where you get

901
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:36,519
millions of millions of fingerprints of

902
00:53:33,729 --> 00:53:39,009
biometric some kind of biometric data if

903
00:53:36,519 --> 00:53:45,848
you break into such device you will get

904
00:53:39,009 --> 00:53:48,099
I don't know few hundred maybe so unless

905
00:53:45,849 --> 00:53:54,279
you're targeting a specific organization

906
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:57,489
or specific person I don't think it

907
00:53:54,279 --> 00:54:02,079
makes sense and by all means but please

908
00:53:57,489 --> 00:54:03,910
don't do that anyway yeah so maybe we

909
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:06,999
can take the last question on clone and

910
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:09,729
I'm sorry slide oh and then we can go

911
00:54:06,999 --> 00:54:11,499
back to the audience sure it is it is it

912
00:54:09,729 --> 00:54:17,558
possible to clone one master control

913
00:54:11,499 --> 00:54:23,709
card to access all called scanners and I

914
00:54:17,559 --> 00:54:29,410
like the next one as well so from what I

915
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:31,329
learned and like over the last year and

916
00:54:29,410 --> 00:54:38,140
also from what I learned today from the

917
00:54:31,329 --> 00:54:40,059
RFID guys it seems to be possible that

918
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:43,749
is also system dependent seems to be

919
00:54:40,059 --> 00:54:47,319
system dependent so I think that at

920
00:54:43,749 --> 00:54:50,259
least for some assistance yes it is

921
00:54:47,319 --> 00:54:52,808
doable and maybe there are others out

922
00:54:50,259 --> 00:55:01,539
there that I haven't seen yet that make

923
00:54:52,809 --> 00:55:06,779
it hard or impossible so yeah and then

924
00:55:01,539 --> 00:55:06,779
the question on the perimeter defense I

925
00:55:09,809 --> 00:55:18,170
think

926
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:18,700
was obsolete long before that like 15

927
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:22,130
years ago

928
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:24,439
so yeah not because of this though it is

929
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:28,900
but not because of that and physical

930
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:33,380
security yeah I think I think we as a

931
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:38,140
like this locks industry I think they

932
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:42,410
actually progress a lot so I think it is

933
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:45,950
possible to make a device that would be

934
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:49,759
hard to physically break into without

935
00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:52,640
breaking some things inside of it and

936
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:56,990
that it would not be cost efficient for

937
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:59,538
an attacker to perform such an attack of

938
00:55:56,990 --> 00:56:04,089
course those devices will be more

939
00:55:59,539 --> 00:56:07,609
expensive than what we are now but is I

940
00:56:04,089 --> 00:56:10,130
mean as your network as your office so

941
00:56:07,609 --> 00:56:11,869
it is up to you and up to me to make a

942
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:14,029
choice what kind of devices you want to

943
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:17,349
buy okay thank you

944
00:56:14,029 --> 00:56:24,200
so any last questions from the audience

945
00:56:17,349 --> 00:56:27,769
yes I think that thing is very

946
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:30,890
interesting if you read it also on the

947
00:56:27,769 --> 00:56:33,859
comment about storing fingerprint what

948
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:37,069
what power star did was store the real

949
00:56:33,859 --> 00:56:39,078
JPAC hidden image there anybody who

950
00:56:37,069 --> 00:56:43,160
locked in can go and menu play

951
00:56:39,079 --> 00:56:45,230
everything and like where because the

952
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:48,259
the whole thing is like you access to

953
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:54,279
the secure area of that building or the

954
00:56:48,259 --> 00:56:58,549
premises so you can menu plate anybody's

955
00:56:54,279 --> 00:57:00,470
coat and anybody's fingerprint and can

956
00:56:58,549 --> 00:57:02,630
make yourself to access anything

957
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:04,939
anywhere and yeah you can yeah yeah I

958
00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:07,430
think I discussed this so yeah yes well

959
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:09,859
this is the the whole breakdown of that

960
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:12,890
thing is once you get hold of such

961
00:57:09,859 --> 00:57:14,598
device here you definitely can go and

962
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:19,339
provide yourself of a physical access

963
00:57:14,599 --> 00:57:23,119
and the different forms and yeah I think

964
00:57:19,339 --> 00:57:24,359
I discussed that in in my talk ok we ran

965
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:26,099
out of time

966
00:57:24,359 --> 00:57:29,609
like to ask heaven would you like to

967
00:57:26,099 --> 00:57:31,829
choose your favorite question I think

968
00:57:29,609 --> 00:57:37,049
the first one I like the first one the

969
00:57:31,829 --> 00:57:39,239
very first question about now not come

970
00:57:37,049 --> 00:57:41,640
from the audience from the Fed from the

971
00:57:39,239 --> 00:57:46,470
audience who is that the first wardens

972
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:52,470
can't that was you oh yes you yes I have

973
00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:54,149
all the Cisco stuff though you well I

974
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:56,279
liked it too so you deserve it

975
00:57:54,150 --> 00:58:00,839
thank you very much I like the question

976
00:57:56,279 --> 00:58:04,650
about that you asked as well hey Bo

977
00:58:00,839 --> 00:58:06,328
open-source so thank you okay everybody

978
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:11,599
please give a warm round of applause to

979
00:58:06,329 --> 00:58:11,599
Kevin well done so thanks for having me
