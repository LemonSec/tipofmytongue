I always learn a lot from him we are

5
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:42,000
post from chadmichael this is our first

6
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:45,989
time to be in Singapore very beautiful

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,510
country welcome to join in this session

8
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:51,660
today we are going to share our

9
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:55,610
researcher research we are doing

10
00:00:51,660 --> 00:01:00,449
recently the topic is what species of

11
00:00:55,610 --> 00:01:05,670
this fish is may work vacation we square

12
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:08,420
fish this is show in the dues of hours

13
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:11,250
we focus on a PD compelling research

14
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:14,570
including Hakan of the mail where

15
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:18,660
tourists and the technology they use and

16
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:24,809
how do defense against them and the

17
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:28,500
tubular related stress solution let's

18
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:32,569
move on to today's agenda we will

19
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:36,450
discuss why we want to do this research

20
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:39,899
and what's related to earth and the

21
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:42,899
walls to this research and we will

22
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:46,490
explain the methodology step-by-step as

23
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:50,399
detailed as we could following is

24
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:54,509
growing up is a simple demo we made a

25
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:58,380
POC and we will demonstrate how to use

26
00:01:54,509 --> 00:02:02,220
the POC to get great finish a future

27
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:05,270
that is evaluation we tell a campaign

28
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:07,860
name operational cars and in stemple

29
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:11,329
aburrido kai is a campaign that we

30
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:16,200
disclose in 2011 oh sorry

31
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:21,440
2017 and we were is brand of how we get

32
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:28,099
this Eastham islambol finally there are

33
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:32,340
limitation and the conclusion this is

34
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:35,910
motivation so why do we need to do

35
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:38,550
maiya where chris vacation as a sniper

36
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:41,489
security researcher handle everyday we

37
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:44,790
have to deal with a lot of a Marisa mode

38
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:47,790
without criticizing mere words we might

39
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:50,340
need you in the analyzed army aware one

40
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:52,950
by one sometimes everything in the

41
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:55,830
nineteen where we might understand that

42
00:02:52,950 --> 00:03:00,179
this tie of mail where we have feared

43
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:04,440
with before so I believe some of you

44
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:07,230
suffer this kind of situation you might

45
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:10,380
wonder if I could save least time to

46
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:15,530
analyze another unknown malware you

47
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:19,470
would be more efficient so that's why

48
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:23,790
that's why malware Chris vacation

49
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:25,799
doesn't matter so with a good male where

50
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:29,640
Chris vacation we don't need to analyze

51
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:33,840
each malware one by one we could just

52
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:37,108
pick one of ten similar mail wars and an

53
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:40,410
idea and then we could learn what this

54
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:43,250
group of mayor to another motivation is

55
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:46,920
that we want to assure cybersecurity

56
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:50,010
integer more efficient in tracking

57
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:54,450
campaigns is important to learn what our

58
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:57,328
researchers - there are many good report

59
00:03:54,450 --> 00:04:02,280
about a PD campaign and in most of these

60
00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:06,000
proposed they offer IOC that the mayor

61
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:10,470
chest up such as mpfi O Shah femoris

62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,500
however sorry however you might realize

63
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:17,269
that it's hard to find this sample in

64
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:22,830
your repository or in miles toto by

65
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:25,830
mayor chasm that's that's one crater

66
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:29,130
over apt email where symbols they are

67
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:34,770
target some organization and rare

68
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:37,159
however it doesn't mean that there is no

69
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:39,389
similar stem hose in your mail where

70
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,390
repository or inverse Toto

71
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:44,880
so what if there is a some chests on

72
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:48,360
that could present a good

73
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:51,930
of similar mayor west and we could put

74
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:56,460
up it just like we look up empty fire of

75
00:04:51,930 --> 00:05:04,140
malware on risotto I sing it will be

76
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:07,320
great so there are a lot of tourists and

77
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:11,280
the work related you may well Chris

78
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:14,880
vacation field they are like weapons the

79
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:17,159
malware analyzer has I just this videos

80
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,380
not but they should be very practical

81
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,800
and the widely used

82
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:28,260
we will check each doesn't know me very

83
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:33,000
quickly and they are crypto hash like

84
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:37,710
empty Phi and the Shaw family and Farley

85
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:42,770
hash like hero as such as a steep and

86
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:48,780
the Future past like employers or a

87
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:52,460
fresh fish like beef or hybrid like

88
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:57,510
improv Adi is combine future pace and

89
00:05:52,460 --> 00:06:02,340
validation there should be a machine

90
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:05,159
learning or AI passes na me here however

91
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:11,789
I'm not as well of AI so I didn't DC

92
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:16,020
here the first one is crib atoll hedge

93
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:20,160
of course they are not for male workers

94
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:23,340
vacation however they are very basic are

95
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:26,640
very useful and widely used knowledge so

96
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:29,640
they I used to look look up if one

97
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:35,090
simple is easy or not in the mayor

98
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:40,200
repository the second one is Valley Hesh

99
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:45,049
we also call City pH and they used to

100
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:49,229
make input that has have they have

101
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:53,670
hormone largest and in the beginning is

102
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:57,830
for digital forensic such as clear as

103
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:57,830
such and as a steep

104
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:05,060
until I'm here now methodology we're

105
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:07,539
talking about is talking hole he's cute

106
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:12,460
about fire next we want to introduce

107
00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:16,219
future based methodology like in Paris

108
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:19,008
English is disciple minion now is fire I

109
00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:21,650
they surely internal mail where past

110
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:27,080
vacation master employers had the

111
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:31,460
importable Imperator stable IAT as as

112
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:34,789
the is curable future as a as the future

113
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:38,359
of it's curable so you can chew it as a

114
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:42,529
path contents over it's curable and the

115
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:46,069
land it create a hash best library API

116
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:48,330
names and their specific order within

117
00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:50,469
love is curable

118
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:54,889
[Music]

119
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:57,620
the next is a Highbury measure like in

120
00:07:54,889 --> 00:08:02,270
Parvati in apparel basically is ten

121
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:04,639
their idea of imposition a week said

122
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:09,049
that it combined in porridge and the

123
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:14,889
fancy hash easily of calculating md5 of

124
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:20,469
IIT involve fuzzy KQ l SD / radio of

125
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:28,550
executables IIT his idea of wrong

126
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:32,149
channel not choose song from episode and

127
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:36,829
you know we all talk about figuration

128
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:41,149
that target binary content of a suitable

129
00:08:36,828 --> 00:08:44,810
fryer no matter no matter a whole pirate

130
00:08:41,149 --> 00:08:49,459
content or partial content now there is

131
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:51,079
another as a knowledge that is graphic

132
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:53,750
art I squid pest

133
00:08:51,079 --> 00:08:59,239
it's now analyzed the different of

134
00:08:53,750 --> 00:09:02,060
executable from with point of view the

135
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:10,820
below picture is cooperative screenshot

136
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:15,140
wrong idea pearl so Ingrid you can

137
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:18,650
as a map of reduce excusable in growth

138
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:21,680
in Griffith similar similarity analysis

139
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:25,579
he didn't do cross at this assembly of

140
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:32,930
binary content it doing out with a

141
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:36,260
referral structure of excusable for

142
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:39,829
example in div the div is very powerful

143
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:44,240
tool to analyze and compare is suitable

144
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:47,320
fire in the query pest feared it over

145
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:50,630
material information about what

146
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:56,480
similarity in which parts of to a

147
00:09:50,630 --> 00:10:00,590
suitable file is used to it is usually

148
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:08,480
used to do variability analysis patch

149
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:15,200
analysis is pre development however when

150
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:17,810
use arm pinned if it only can process to

151
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,290
fire at the same time and the

152
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:25,400
performance actually the performance is

153
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:28,370
good but compared to litter said we just

154
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:33,310
mentioned is a little slow

155
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:36,370
that's because it doesn't only to have

156
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:42,530
comparison but also disassembly

157
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:47,810
comparison okay okay now the another

158
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:51,260
issue is how to scary and you know

159
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:53,839
there's very show introduced in the

160
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:55,670
division from institution about the

161
00:10:53,840 --> 00:11:01,330
torah' cell or research should be that

162
00:10:55,670 --> 00:11:04,810
you two may well clarify so before we

163
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:10,340
move on I have three tests for you all

164
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:12,640
there are about cope F comparison this

165
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:17,570
is the first job this is the first test

166
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:18,140
artist to Kokura have similar yes I

167
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:22,210
think so

168
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:22,210
they look like the stand of similar

169
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:30,969
the second is compare comparing more

170
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:36,930
complicate cooperative so are they less

171
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:41,440
then or similar yes I think so

172
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:46,060
okay is it this is the final test are

173
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:52,600
they the same or similar anyway I'm

174
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:58,060
going to answer this question this UN do

175
00:11:52,600 --> 00:12:01,660
you want to try someone okay okay I

176
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:03,969
think it's not actually I put I prepared

177
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:06,310
some gift so I think if it's someone

178
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:16,480
answer this question I will give a kid a

179
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:19,329
small gift for you so she D okay so what

180
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:24,640
if there is something that could present

181
00:12:19,329 --> 00:12:28,479
a wave of executable now graph is

182
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:33,220
now graph but a binary then we can

183
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:36,250
calculate a crypto hash of it oh we can

184
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:44,190
kick it a fiery hash of it that's our

185
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:45,670
basic idea so now we want to introduce

186
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:52,360
you

187
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:58,380
coke graph pattern a k GG p the purpose

188
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:58,380
over the CTP is to prison cooperate okay

189
00:12:58,829 --> 00:13:06,660
so so our methodology is belong to

190
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:11,709
Highbury

191
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:16,209
tanaami first essentially GTP is a

192
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:20,199
perfect base pattern and that is finally

193
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:26,410
dead so we could combine suitably with

194
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:30,069
crypto hash of re hash so

195
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:33,910
is a methodology fro and a beginning we

196
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:38,229
have a cooperative of executable then we

197
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:41,740
take you to the Coker patent the patent

198
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:45,000
is firing for my help data so we could

199
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:49,870
figure that crypto Heche of Rho V and

200
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:53,740
the finally we can never teach the

201
00:13:49,870 --> 00:14:00,220
application of crypto hash or Phi has to

202
00:13:53,740 --> 00:14:02,769
do similarity analysis okay so let's

203
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:05,680
start with square for hash I'm sorry

204
00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:07,829
let's not waste Kohei code this is now

205
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:11,829
is cold breath

206
00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:17,439
this is screenshot this profile a cobra

207
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:20,800
road like we have it by use Ida Pro to

208
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:24,219
implement our idea we use Ida Pro a lot

209
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:32,410
so the following content will come with

210
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:37,110
the script shops of Ida Pro so what is a

211
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:43,779
corporate front we have a point of view

212
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:51,250
our graph is composed a set of vertices

213
00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:55,240
and a set of H maybe bed to making many

214
00:14:51,250 --> 00:15:00,899
a map in bed to an incurable vertices

215
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:05,230
prism functions of s curable from web

216
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:09,279
from west point of view edges describe

217
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:15,009
the relationship between birth but a

218
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:19,899
system that mean but but has a culture

219
00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:26,879
but has being and the male impact you

220
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:31,410
and cutable he means is killed fro means

221
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:31,410
function a cos function B

222
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:41,370
so here is a simple abstract Poker of

223
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:46,949
Islam hole in this Cobra there there are

224
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:52,620
vertices from 0 to 9 and the tape reason

225
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:58,139
functions and that there are ages one to

226
00:15:52,620 --> 00:16:02,699
nine to two oh two two zero five to nine

227
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:07,370
and the SS ratio and the date they

228
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:07,370
present relationship between methods

229
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:20,730
okay force so first let's go to the

230
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:24,300
vertices from idea from Ida Pro point of

231
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:27,990
view a cell brothers is include every

232
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:32,639
function that could recognize and import

233
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:38,850
a function that is from dynamic link

234
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:42,829
library so everything getting a set of

235
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:46,889
brothers we want to assign value to a

236
00:16:42,829 --> 00:16:52,170
Metis we is bet that the value could

237
00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:56,399
present Metis front worth point of view

238
00:16:52,170 --> 00:17:00,449
is like Carolyn Albert s so here is then

239
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:03,329
here is an example both of cocker F sure

240
00:17:00,449 --> 00:17:08,520
less than layout and each pair of

241
00:17:03,329 --> 00:17:12,530
related bird has has lost anchors so we

242
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:17,490
may say that this chuck opera are

243
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:22,559
identical Lynette

244
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:28,860
the next example is also to this is

245
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:32,520
similar to to Co graph sure Lascelles

246
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:36,780
layout and there are children but he

247
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:41,460
said in the right hand side and one more

248
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:43,860
compared to the left side so we might be

249
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:46,320
able to say that these two of popper

250
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:54,399
have 90

251
00:17:46,320 --> 00:18:00,220
similarity the final exam of color but

252
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:05,230
has the color in five pairs of vertices

253
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:08,680
in the pose Cobra is different we might

254
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:14,460
be able to say that this tube Cobra has

255
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:18,750
50 percent similarity so that's how

256
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:26,380
mothers may be helper to do wave

257
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:31,750
comparison no this is what one brothers

258
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:34,870
one bird has very ruthless blue like we

259
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:39,640
take two property of function to define

260
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:42,810
butters value they are function HS Brock

261
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:49,900
and the function type the value is

262
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:54,610
system bits from pit Nero to say from

263
00:18:49,900 --> 00:19:01,440
with zero to seven stole the HS Brock

264
00:18:54,610 --> 00:19:06,909
and the front pitch a 215 he stole

265
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:11,350
function type and the HS proud for P

266
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:15,280
from diesel 250 and the function height

267
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:19,990
will be from 0 to 4 I will explain that

268
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:27,730
if definition in the farallon's right so

269
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:32,680
function type we've we refer this least

270
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:38,080
five types right I a Phi function hi

271
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:42,490
from pin is poor principle is is a

272
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:46,510
subculture of print if they are incur

273
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:49,690
regular function library function import

274
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:54,730
the function sum function inverted

275
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:58,989
function okay now go

276
00:19:54,730 --> 00:20:01,809
I chose Brock the a jib the HS bracket

277
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:04,989
describe which as HS Brock that a

278
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:10,029
function is belong to so it's kind of

279
00:20:04,989 --> 00:20:13,179
normalization processing he here is how

280
00:20:10,029 --> 00:20:17,679
to get it so first we divide whole

281
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:21,340
linear address space into 16 HS Brock's

282
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:24,759
and then we calculate which edges Brock

283
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:32,678
that each function log has a coating to

284
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:38,340
is starting address sorry so we you can

285
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:41,529
see the above screenshot a go picture

286
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:45,369
function one is belong to property row

287
00:20:41,529 --> 00:20:49,059
and end of a function to is true - tree

288
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:52,809
is belong to Brock one and function n

289
00:20:49,059 --> 00:21:01,600
function n minus 1 minus 2 is param to

290
00:20:52,809 --> 00:21:05,320
bracket shell so this is H so how do we

291
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:09,779
get a set of edge in Cochran it's pretty

292
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:14,439
easy with Ida Pro we check every iTunes

293
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:21,789
itunes cross reference in information in

294
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:25,119
the function if one item has a ko ko ko

295
00:21:21,789 --> 00:21:27,539
ko ko' cross reference to another

296
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:32,100
function then we build a relationship

297
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:37,179
that means we can H between functions

298
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:40,149
the left hand cream shop is disprin the

299
00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:44,859
coal cross reference example in Idaho

300
00:21:40,149 --> 00:21:53,008
and only on Leroy and Royce I on the

301
00:21:44,859 --> 00:21:56,480
right hand there are edges visiting now

302
00:21:53,009 --> 00:22:01,190
we are moving to

303
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:04,040
a cockerel traversal strategy on here

304
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:09,070
now we already have a set of vertices

305
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:14,030
and a set of edges the next step will be

306
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:17,720
building a wear pattern for a

307
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:23,710
breath so it's about coke graph

308
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:25,000
traversal strategy basically it has two

309
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:31,240
protocols

310
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:34,520
the first one is snow is good for test

311
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:37,549
route matters is a British that has no

312
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:49,610
parents and then the second one another

313
00:22:37,549 --> 00:22:53,410
second protocol is hip first search so

314
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:57,729
here is a simple traversal in slam hoe a

315
00:22:53,410 --> 00:23:02,450
DFS is demo we have a cockerel as a

316
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:09,169
graph on rice night discography has a

317
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:14,900
set of birthdays they are 1 2 5 6 7 8 9

318
00:23:09,169 --> 00:23:18,200
and the ages is five two nine five two

319
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:26,419
six six two one nine two seven nine two

320
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:28,990
a and 92 and the lavertus is five so

321
00:23:26,419 --> 00:23:33,559
everything

322
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:43,790
traversing the cooperator would be five

323
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:45,770
nine seven eight two six one okay so

324
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:51,500
here is a one concept we want to

325
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:54,860
emphasize here material vertices in the

326
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:59,169
art world frank webb point of view there

327
00:23:54,860 --> 00:24:04,320
are multi multiple but has but vertices

328
00:23:59,169 --> 00:24:09,450
that dozen has parents for example

329
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:16,740
in this screenshot there are serious in

330
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:20,850
this graph heavy mud

331
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:24,510
having multiple vertices is very common

332
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:30,510
in a cockerel for example a Windows

333
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:33,090
service Pierrot he had to his poll for

334
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:36,780
example he has to his fault service name

335
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:39,330
and the DLL entry point when loading

336
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:41,370
this service 0 into memory the contents

337
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:45,600
of the arrow entry point will be is

338
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:48,840
cubed and the windows service handle

339
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:53,149
service SVC host will is killer content

340
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:57,179
of servicemen to do windows service job

341
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:59,910
you can choose this to you can show this

342
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:04,050
as choose starting point of windows

343
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:08,630
service the arrow and the from corporate

344
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:13,379
point of view there are two root

345
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:20,280
vertices that's there our service men

346
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:22,950
and the zero entry point now let's come

347
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:28,440
the next concept that we want to discuss

348
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:30,600
is function we use we want to show you

349
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:33,870
how to deal with function reviews in

350
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:37,110
building code where patterns for

351
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:42,889
programming function we use is for code

352
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:48,540
reviews and about redundancy and for

353
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:53,310
traversing proper F reusing function

354
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:57,570
means visiting reduced function brothers

355
00:25:53,310 --> 00:26:03,360
and each other but assists more than one

356
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:08,610
hand but for the purpose of efficiency

357
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:14,179
we just keep on we we keep only the

358
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:17,179
visited but has in cgp withou is child

359
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:17,180
vertices

360
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:30,350
okay so here is the we use functions

361
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:36,530
covert for example we have a set of

362
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:43,559
vertices a set of edges and you can see

363
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:50,520
the edges in right word it means we use

364
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:56,010
the function is nine okay so editor

365
00:26:50,520 --> 00:27:00,230
after our traversing the city the CTP

366
00:26:56,010 --> 00:27:05,010
were P five nine seven five nine seven

367
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:18,420
fine finite seven eight three four two

368
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:23,490
zero six one and nine and a seven seven

369
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:28,710
nine and a seven sorry

370
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:32,130
and the seven a three four two zero were

371
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:37,500
business will be nappies though in gdb

372
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:43,679
here again but it's okay because we had

373
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:53,010
so Lisa stopped a pattern here when we

374
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:57,620
first can visit but has nine okay so

375
00:27:53,010 --> 00:28:03,530
this is an example of coke wave pattern

376
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:15,520
so what a suitably really like approve

377
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:19,870
the prison but but has and here is a

378
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,870
environment just for your reference

379
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:38,180
include inappro-- 7.2 and the Ida Python

380
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:52,940
and define and SS Steve okay so here we

381
00:28:38,180 --> 00:29:01,580
have a simple demo for you so let's open

382
00:28:52,940 --> 00:29:10,700
an Ida Pro here and that we we have

383
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:16,159
already open and executable and we long

384
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:20,600
the PLC Squibb you will help us to take

385
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:25,600
your a grave grave empty file and with

386
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:35,750
assistive here okay just like this one

387
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:40,149
it's clear and simple and we also have a

388
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:43,100
page fire that can help you to

389
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:47,590
processing multiple files in the same

390
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:51,860
time and the last page fire is called

391
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:55,580
go th the pison and you have various

392
00:29:51,860 --> 00:30:00,350
that you have to assign ID up haste for

393
00:29:55,580 --> 00:30:02,919
it and the addition the pairs offer the

394
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:02,919
same house

395
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:10,910
let's go he was sure

396
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:29,960
you were updated status over the

397
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:34,330
processing and everything that he will

398
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:38,330
give you least this kind of readout and

399
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:44,389
you will told you he was give you the

400
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:49,360
file name and and it's curable grab

401
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:49,360
fresh grave as deep and the fire SS deep

402
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:18,080
okay so the Federation we tell a

403
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:22,459
campaign that we name in operation

404
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:27,678
O'Connor's example and a broker is a

405
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:31,820
long-term stable spy operation and must

406
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:42,590
park is our East Asia countries we

407
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:48,490
destroy it in 2017 okay the loss demos

408
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:48,490
of oka include 322 T's change samples

409
00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:58,399
and we take this 322 sample testing

410
00:31:56,270 --> 00:32:02,320
samples into ten memories

411
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:05,600
the effects are based on tokens c'mere

412
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:14,960
communication protocol of c2 used by me

413
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:18,918
aware and then this this is a readout by

414
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:23,630
fire SS tip so you can see the

415
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:28,730
screenshot on world right sign different

416
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:34,700
colors means different group sth similar

417
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:45,850
t rate is 85% and the in this control in

418
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:51,169
this condition 211 from same host from

419
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:54,199
322 symbols could be classified into sis

420
00:32:51,169 --> 00:33:01,059
to 662 groups

421
00:32:54,200 --> 00:33:04,960
it's about CCC's cope in red light and

422
00:33:01,059 --> 00:33:09,080
in a screenshot love white points means

423
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:11,320
the symbols that that doesn't cut group

424
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,320
hint

425
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:27,970
this is a real by with and define 260

426
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:41,180
from 322 examples could be crucified in

427
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:48,350
271 scoops is about 81 grooving ray the

428
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:51,920
firing upper is a real alibi with wave

429
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:57,850
as a steep now SSD with similarity is

430
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:57,850
also identified and in this condition

431
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:12,969
274 from 320 to semo's could be

432
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:20,509
classified into 667 scoops is about 85%

433
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:27,379
cope in red okay this is a comparison

434
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:33,020
table so haha after this result we can

435
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:36,410
say that F and if I has about more 50

436
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:44,150
percent open rate than fire as a steep

437
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:49,580
and gref SS deep has about moorland 1913

438
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:53,720
rates land fire SS steep so for for a

439
00:34:49,580 --> 00:35:05,360
caucus I think it's a strong result for

440
00:34:53,719 --> 00:35:09,040
us so nice this is this is that we

441
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:13,640
compare the result of F as deeper and

442
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:16,400
memories we see this comparison we

443
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:20,450
noticed some relationship between them

444
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:24,670
in this script in the description the

445
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:27,089
sentence means they are open together by

446
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:32,160
12 f SS

447
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:35,910
deep so you can see that in different

448
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:42,290
mail where families they share the same

449
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:42,290
color point like three blue circles and

450
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:55,560
two red circles on the right sign that

451
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:59,610
cause our initiative so we take a close

452
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:04,799
look and then we do for for a more than

453
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:08,750
anything and in analyzing um under

454
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:12,600
symbols in this strip whoo rooster crows

455
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:17,040
every today we learned that this uh

456
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:20,880
query point cutting points and the pure

457
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:26,400
point should be very wrong to mail well

458
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:30,240
February for effect EOS the are sorry

459
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:36,210
Becca TOC so it means that we might even

460
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:40,560
on some facts before let's go to uh ray

461
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:45,060
circles um what does the relationship

462
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:48,660
means at the forum for Mall and enticing

463
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:54,840
we realized that this system was shared

464
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:58,589
lesson Baker's the of all rate circles

465
00:36:54,840 --> 00:37:01,860
is an inspector and the below red

466
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:10,160
circles is Empress it's quite

467
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:16,320
interesting okay next we are mutual

468
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:21,870
accuracy test so here is how we do in

469
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:24,900
addition to all customers we calculate

470
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:29,730
where f RF amplifier and the graph as a

471
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:36,030
tip of ten thousand and one hundred

472
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:39,750
fifty epididymis and we compare if there

473
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:47,250
are samples crucified us the group

474
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:48,540
or Cosimo's so it means if a lot of our

475
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:53,760
SAPT Simoes

476
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:58,700
go britain grouping with a cup of the

477
00:37:53,760 --> 00:38:04,770
accuracy of law where every hash is low

478
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:08,609
if not the accuracy is good and the real

479
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:11,660
love is the end of the real au is only

480
00:38:08,609 --> 00:38:17,390
one sample from oka and the two samples

481
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:20,430
from Ibiza most are classified

482
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:26,098
others can opt symbols are classified as

483
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:35,930
less than group and the reason is they

484
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:38,760
share the same paper okay Namine haitian

485
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:42,750
where where for hash is not so good for

486
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:44,900
paper or simple structure is curable but

487
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:50,040
I think it's pretty common for

488
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:52,500
esthetical executable analysis however

489
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:57,830
in some situations

490
00:38:52,500 --> 00:39:01,890
CTP could recognize some paper routines

491
00:38:57,830 --> 00:39:03,020
and for now we learn down I'd have her

492
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:09,049
very much

493
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:09,050
we need I defer to complete our job

494
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:21,330
future work right now we block of the

495
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:25,530
nice fire test and the Europe and the

496
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:32,430
matter Ohio test we just used grave hash

497
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:35,760
are around 50 to 60 samples of Euro II

498
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:39,750
arrived and the mark all files and they

499
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:43,290
all fine so far he was fine so far but

500
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:47,540
we still need to it has large amounts of

501
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:51,990
these kind of fires in addition to

502
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:53,110
either pros program we are thinking to

503
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:57,029
make him

504
00:39:53,110 --> 00:40:08,680
we need to make province for radar - Oh

505
00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:11,500
G dry publish bran and the schedule we

506
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:15,450
want to publish POC as all pencils

507
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:18,730
because we believe that this research

508
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:20,890
could help its security inheritance

509
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:24,270
changing and that do malware

510
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:28,740
classification and the mall security

511
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:31,870
researchers used Hmong influence that

512
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:36,310
this research can man now

513
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:40,420
his under chemical internal review so we

514
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:43,150
spell posh we expect to publish POC as

515
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:50,110
soon as possible we will update

516
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:53,710
information on my Twitter okay

517
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:57,910
in the end we want two things Kenny -

518
00:40:53,710 --> 00:41:05,500
Stanley Nani and the Tony Hong because

519
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:10,330
they made this research better okay

520
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:14,170
so singer can four of you join this

521
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:27,420
session so we hope you like it

522
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:27,420
so if anyone have any question no ok

523
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:41,629
so I can pick Oh

524
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:49,519
one question if you could just start

525
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:54,680
with the top question there is any

526
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:56,899
immunity are there any limitations to

527
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:59,240
the types of program that this

528
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:06,819
technology can be used on of this

529
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:12,890
approach okay I yes and so for Andrew

530
00:42:06,819 --> 00:42:18,049
for for now our testing is Windows

531
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:24,069
peripheral and we just test fearsome

532
00:42:18,049 --> 00:42:29,960
whole like ear a fire or mock old fire

533
00:42:24,069 --> 00:42:33,759
they refuse but they walk through there

534
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:39,259
was fine so far but we think we have to

535
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:43,759
test more fire more more MORE among we

536
00:42:39,259 --> 00:42:50,559
we need to test much amount of least and

537
00:42:43,759 --> 00:42:55,220
it's kind of our platforms problem okay

538
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:58,450
have you got any examples of times where

539
00:42:55,220 --> 00:43:09,848
this gave incorrect results where the

540
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:09,848
sample tripped the graph ash no no but

541
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:23,960
we have some limitation I just made just

542
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:25,839
as as I mentioned for some simple

543
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:29,119
structure is curable

544
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:33,140
La Cueva Hirsch were become not

545
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:36,069
statistically significant for us

546
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:36,069
yep

547
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:52,390
okay this is a very good question so he

548
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:58,000
Alejandra to ask try to do we try to use

549
00:43:52,390 --> 00:44:01,480
dynamic a brief behavior of Mara where

550
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:05,860
nope okay I think it might it might be a

551
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:12,280
solution for the situation that we face

552
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:17,770
like the paper severity analysis but the

553
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:21,070
problem is in my team i am i thought i

554
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:24,160
think we couldn't long

555
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:29,890
this is cuba a little bit and the

556
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:33,759
lengths we keep testers of such as

557
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:37,330
memory such as the memory status and

558
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:39,730
then we we long we calculate the wafer

559
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:45,240
heads of it much of the problem is how

560
00:44:39,730 --> 00:44:53,530
do we know fund who is the stop point of

561
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:56,080
technical analysis okay the next

562
00:44:53,530 --> 00:45:00,280
question is how do we do it because it

563
00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:08,650
was circus okay just just i mentioned i

564
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:16,660
was i was kid subdued of subbulu of of

565
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:21,250
the function keys is is it's like a

566
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:25,930
recursive or circus function call so i

567
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:30,970
didn't go through all of l'a over its

568
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:45,850
child Albert but but is so it will help

569
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:50,620
us to to more efficient way okay um for

570
00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:57,850
this question because I did did not

571
00:45:50,620 --> 00:46:01,560
wrong t-try so I don't know if there if

572
00:45:57,850 --> 00:46:14,940
there will be another any difference

573
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:14,940
between them I think is not necessary

574
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:31,230
yeah it will be affair because in this

575
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:34,359
methodology is belong to static curable

576
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:37,510
is belong to static analysis

577
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:41,050
so if LeMay aware tyrannical loading

578
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:44,010
module at runtime we could not see this

579
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:44,010
kind of information

580
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:47,410
[Music]

581
00:46:50,850 --> 00:47:00,040
no he is focused our male workers

582
00:46:55,600 --> 00:47:01,750
vacation okay thank you very much

583
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:03,670
do we have any more questions from the

584
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:11,640
floor before we finish we still got a

585
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:11,640
bit of time no Andrew sink your question

586
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:21,120
okay thank you very much thank you
