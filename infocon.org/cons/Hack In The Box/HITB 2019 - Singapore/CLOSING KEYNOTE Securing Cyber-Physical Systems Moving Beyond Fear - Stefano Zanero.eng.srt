1
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:24,470
I would like to share a few thoughts

2
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:27,419
about how do we go about securing

3
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:30,869
cyber-physical systems which is the

4
00:00:27,419 --> 00:00:34,250
complicated way that academics used to

5
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:36,809
define IOT systems

6
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:38,940
automotive industrial control systems

7
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:42,800
everything that is attached to a

8
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:56,160
computer but as a physical component now

9
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:58,260
as you may have clicker not working it

10
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:05,640
was working when we tested it so of

11
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:08,190
course it doesn't wear now yeah Stefan

12
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:12,210
answer probably yeah of course so as you

13
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:15,990
may have all seen we basically belong to

14
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:20,729
the circus cyber security is a circus

15
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:24,208
and our conferences are a circus now

16
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:29,610
when you go to the circus what you want

17
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:33,239
to see are the attractions and we all

18
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:38,160
like to see the attractions so I listed

19
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:43,619
a few attractions Barnaby Jack making

20
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:46,280
like an ATM spit $100 bill from remote

21
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:49,920
on a stage in Las Vegas

22
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:51,869
ATM $100 bills Las Vegas what can

23
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,569
possibly go wrong

24
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:59,160
well Barnaby Jack of course could go

25
00:01:54,569 --> 00:02:00,479
wrong about that so but and for I think

26
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,110
that everybody in the room probably

27
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,129
knows

28
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:09,110
Barnaby passed away way too early so

29
00:02:05,129 --> 00:02:09,110
this is my way of reminding them

30
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:17,160
Charlene Chris exploiting a jeep and

31
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:20,369
driving a journalist off the road to

32
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:25,409
prove a point now what's funny about

33
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:29,219
this specific example is that Charlie

34
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:30,060
and Chris were not the first ones to do

35
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:34,079
that

36
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:37,560
this Jeep hack happened in 2015 actually

37
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,930
in 2010 people from University of

38
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:44,040
California San Diego did the very same

39
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:45,720
thing with another vehicle why did you

40
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,569
never hear about them because they

41
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:52,160
presented their research at a scientific

42
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:55,079
conference so everybody ignored them

43
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,090
prove that you need to drive Andy

44
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:01,440
Greenberg off the road if you want to

45
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:03,600
prove a point and finally this is my

46
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,550
friend colleague former student former

47
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,380
whatever

48
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:09,900
Federica mod Z and now working for Trend

49
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:14,010
Micro FDR during one of the phases of

50
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:17,069
our research on robot exploitation so

51
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:24,810
these are the attractions of the

52
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:26,609
cybersecurity world and uh how are they

53
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:30,080
are the attractions we are the

54
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:34,140
attractions because our conferences

55
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:37,410
reward a PAC research that's what we

56
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:39,869
have seen for the past few days here we

57
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:44,160
have seen a lot of breaking a lot of

58
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:46,890
hacking a lot of compromising things up

59
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:50,340
to and including the last talk before

60
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:53,820
mine and the reason is that we are

61
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:59,640
hackers at heart and we do enjoy the

62
00:03:53,820 --> 00:04:03,540
beauty of these hacks to has an exploit

63
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:06,328
or a chain of xsplit is as elegant and

64
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:08,459
as beautiful as a mathematical

65
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:12,239
demonstration to mathematician or as a

66
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:15,540
poem to an artist it's the same thing

67
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:18,060
it's elegant it's beautiful and it's it

68
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:21,839
brightens your intuition when you read

69
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:24,330
it you go through it and you all of a

70
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:28,799
sudden understand it and something is

71
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:33,990
revealed to you and that's good it's

72
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:37,110
awesome I'm happy that my own government

73
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:39,000
finds it important enough to pay me to

74
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:42,930
keep doing sound keep training students

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,860
to do so however we may have realized by

76
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:47,190
now

77
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:52,530
that we are not on IRC in our hacker

78
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:54,380
crews anymore what we are doing either

79
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:58,739
we like it or not but what we are doing

80
00:04:54,380 --> 00:05:03,030
ends on front-page news and our findings

81
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:05,340
do impact the public perception let me

82
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:07,590
give you a few examples and it will be

83
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:10,260
also printed on the last slide of the

84
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:13,229
deck but let me iterate that I keep

85
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:15,719
taking some research and I'm not

86
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:19,760
criticizing the research I'm looking at

87
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:22,140
the impact so do not mistake me me for

88
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:25,230
criticizing the research I'm looking at

89
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:29,729
the impact so first research in the

90
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:32,060
circus gusting air traffic presentation

91
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:35,190
by Android Costin a few years ago

92
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:37,380
discussed ad SB which is a protocol we

93
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:41,010
used in aviation basically if you ever

94
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:44,159
have ever used flight rather 24 to track

95
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:45,560
a plane that's the protocol that gives

96
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,760
the data to that thing

97
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,140
there's the presentation linked over

98
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,500
there you can go look at it

99
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:55,830
it's probably also on YouTube somewhere

100
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:57,900
now the point is basically everything

101
00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:00,810
that was pointed out about a DSP is

102
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:05,760
correct because of course Costin is

103
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:11,990
great researcher however the impact of

104
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:14,490
those vulnerabilities is overestimated

105
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:18,630
because those are not vulnerabilities

106
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:22,020
they are design choices the peer to peer

107
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:24,420
value of keeping a DSP open and also

108
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:29,010
open to infiltration spoofing and other

109
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:32,240
things is actually larger than the

110
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:36,180
potential value and the complexity of

111
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:39,060
making it closed because there's a lot

112
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,680
of challenges it's not as easy as saying

113
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,780
oh we encrypt it and we assign the

114
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:46,340
messages okay who gives out the

115
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:48,919
certificates who decides the numbering

116
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:51,719
Alleviation is a very complex word

117
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:53,640
aircrafts travel through different

118
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,830
states sometimes they travel even

119
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,750
between states that are not friends with

120
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:59,640
each other so

121
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:02,520
every time that you create a regulation

122
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:04,169
in aviation it needs to take into

123
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,080
account a lot of political things as

124
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:11,490
well as commercial things so this was

125
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:14,419
not wrong I mean the research was okay

126
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:17,580
but there was a reason for it

127
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:19,830
on the meat and also most of these

128
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:22,050
apples with humans in the loop so the

129
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:26,280
possibility of leading to lack of safety

130
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:29,190
is really low under medium this is the

131
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:31,260
impact of the research next-generation

132
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:35,060
air traffic control vulnerable to

133
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:39,000
hackers spoofing planes out of thin air

134
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:42,050
now that's not true that's just not true

135
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,810
but it's not in Andres research either

136
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:50,100
that's not true this is an exaggeration

137
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:52,950
of impact because of course protocol

138
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:56,310
used in some subset of next-generation

139
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:58,919
air traffic control actually could lead

140
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:05,729
to some secondary vulnerabilities

141
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:06,340
happening it's not a good title you go

142
00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:08,830
taser

143
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:11,609
craft acting actually ACK in the Box few

144
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:15,639
years ago what did you go do

145
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:18,010
he basically bought an F MSF like

146
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:20,110
management system for the people that

147
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:22,750
are passionate about aircrafts that have

148
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:24,550
flown in an aircraft before it's the

149
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:27,880
huge computer in the middle between the

150
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:30,580
two pilots just to simplify it it's the

151
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:32,289
thing that is used to do a number of

152
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:36,490
things on a plane including most

153
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:38,880
critically program the autopilot so you

154
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:42,460
go both an FM AC unit on eBay and

155
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:46,630
exploited it which was cold it's a cool

156
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:49,180
hack then in his talk he also included

157
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:51,820
information on how you would use a GSB

158
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:55,060
that is open in order to get some

159
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:57,880
information that you would need and also

160
00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:00,849
showed how could this theoretically

161
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:02,770
affect a plane on a simulator because of

162
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:09,790
course it didn't have a plane to test

163
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:13,720
this on now it actually got so bad on

164
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:17,410
the media hackers use occur uses and

165
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:20,529
Android because the the example with a

166
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:23,279
DSP was on an Android phone and Android

167
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:28,330
to remotely a pack in hijack an airplane

168
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:30,459
that the FAA had to step in and actually

169
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:34,120
say no this is this actually not going

170
00:09:30,459 --> 00:09:38,079
to happen this was so bad that if you go

171
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:41,680
and look at websites talking about MH

172
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:44,709
360 370 the disappearance of the

173
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,120
Malaysian Airlines flight you will find

174
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:49,630
that there's a lot of theories that have

175
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:51,370
to do with Hugo's presentation not with

176
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:54,040
this presentation per se because

177
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:56,830
technically that's correct but with what

178
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,390
happened on the media afterwards you see

179
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:00,940
where I'm going to write this is an

180
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:03,010
italic so it even ended on Italian

181
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:05,070
newspaper so you need you know that

182
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:08,220
these spread pretty badly

183
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:09,970
it says the hacker that wanted today to

184
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:13,510
hijack an airplane

185
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:16,839
we were smartphone in a small app not

186
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:19,240
exactly and the list goes on and it's in

187
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,680
this set of examples I used all

188
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,840
airplanes because that's

189
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,510
that was the theme of this introduction

190
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:29,350
but you could do that with any other

191
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:32,710
type of systems so this is a site Reagan

192
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:36,850
tweeting what probably was a misguided

193
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:38,710
joke and getting arrested by the FBI for

194
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:44,140
a hack that could not possibly have

195
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:47,580
happened and this is from like a month

196
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:50,530
ago or less at blackhat in Vegas

197
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:53,200
researchers looking at the code of a

198
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:56,800
specific application that runs on some

199
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:59,560
systems inside the 787 and saying we

200
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,990
found vulnerabilities and then and in

201
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:04,619
this article actually which is by end

202
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:08,290
Greenberger so it's very good report

203
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:11,980
actually says it in this line that I put

204
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:14,110
in bold Santa Marta himself admits that

205
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:16,540
he doesn't have a full enough picture of

206
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:18,310
the aircraft or access to an aircraft

207
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:25,060
that costs two hundred and fifty million

208
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:28,930
dollars to test is research now this is

209
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:31,959
a huge warning flag right there you

210
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:35,170
cannot claim consequences of an attack

211
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:37,240
if you don't have the system to test the

212
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:42,250
attack on this is a huge disappointment

213
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:45,550
to all of us hackers why because when I

214
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:47,410
am Katie and mark well mark it already

215
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:51,189
started a number of years before but

216
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:54,219
when I hear a sawmill started doing

217
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:58,600
stuff on computers well if you wanted to

218
00:11:54,220 --> 00:12:00,940
exploit a oft PD you had to install it

219
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,160
that's all you needed to test your

220
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:05,160
exploit you didn't need that two hundred

221
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:11,140
and fifty million dollars aircraft part

222
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:12,969
behind your office to try it actually

223
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:17,350
you would need it in flight even so it's

224
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:19,690
even worse so so this is actually the

225
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:21,730
challenge that we faced whenever we look

226
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:23,980
at cyber-physical systems the problem is

227
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:26,650
that the larger and the more critical

228
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:30,220
the physical system is the more unlikely

229
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:32,439
it is for you to have it to test and and

230
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:34,209
in these guys it's not something that

231
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:37,420
they're going to go beyond

232
00:12:34,209 --> 00:12:40,149
just normal that's the whole point of it

233
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:41,998
why are so few people publishing

234
00:12:40,149 --> 00:12:45,040
research for instance in academia about

235
00:12:41,999 --> 00:12:48,129
aircraft security well because we don't

236
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:50,050
have the budget to buy an aircraft in

237
00:12:48,129 --> 00:12:52,480
order to do automotive security research

238
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:54,279
we bought a car and we placed it

239
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:59,199
endeavour in our parking lot and we

240
00:12:54,279 --> 00:13:01,959
experiment on it so why is this coming

241
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:03,579
up a lot with cyber-physical systems the

242
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:06,248
first thing is that these are things

243
00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:09,638
that people see and immediately perceive

244
00:13:06,249 --> 00:13:12,999
as relevant to their life so for

245
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:16,300
instance these things were so evidently

246
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:17,860
important that the video reading that

247
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,800
was the Vice President of the European

248
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:24,610
Commission to Commission's ago so 10

249
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:27,779
years ago when she became vice president

250
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:30,730
she already pointed and said ok priority

251
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:36,429
keeping those important critical systems

252
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:38,759
online so it's not something new the

253
00:13:36,429 --> 00:13:41,319
realization that computers govern

254
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:45,399
significant portions of our life is

255
00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:49,990
there and not just between us also with

256
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:52,470
the decision-makers so the second point

257
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:55,299
is that these systems are actually

258
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:58,540
safety critical they involve danger to

259
00:13:55,299 --> 00:14:02,139
human life and this is very different

260
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:07,439
than anything else at banking hack that

261
00:14:02,139 --> 00:14:12,519
steals 1 billion euros is very important

262
00:14:07,439 --> 00:14:15,449
but computers and euros do not bleed it

263
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:18,040
doesn't make for big see no graphic news

264
00:14:15,449 --> 00:14:24,910
anything that affects an airplane or a

265
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:26,679
car is more important to the person and

266
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:29,799
for instance consider our research

267
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:31,149
industrial robots the point is that you

268
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:34,720
are moving from industrial robots that

269
00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:37,179
work like this confined and so if you

270
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,759
open up the cage the robots stop and

271
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:42,669
it's an electrical stop you can act into

272
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:46,139
the robots all you want but if a person

273
00:14:42,669 --> 00:14:48,230
is opening the cage the robots will stop

274
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:51,950
to disrobe

275
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:55,490
and these robots are super safe to use

276
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:58,519
this human ABB robot it's very cute

277
00:14:55,490 --> 00:15:00,920
right it's built to be cute because you

278
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:03,320
need not to impress fear on the people

279
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:06,949
that are around it and it's built in

280
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:11,920
order to not be able to harm their human

281
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:14,899
co-workers but here's the thing

282
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:18,410
this is an electrical mechanism it

283
00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:22,160
cannot be disabled this is safe because

284
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:25,699
their software making it safe so for

285
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:31,880
this security is more critical than for

286
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:36,100
the previous one there are systems that

287
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:39,950
are becoming more and more automated

288
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:43,940
when you step into a car that has no

289
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:46,850
steering wheel you will damn well want

290
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:52,060
to know that it's going to take you to

291
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:56,390
destination it's a huge leap of faith

292
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:59,119
it's fear of loss of control it's

293
00:15:56,390 --> 00:16:02,029
exactly the same fear that makes people

294
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,790
wonder about flying the reason why

295
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:06,260
people fear flying while flying is

296
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:08,660
actually the safest way to get to

297
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:10,250
destination it's because you have the

298
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:13,339
feeling that once you are in the metal

299
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:14,810
tube there's literally nothing that you

300
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:17,180
can do to help yourself

301
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:19,609
you just dependent that the metal cube

302
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:21,410
is going to take you to destination if

303
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:23,660
you are on a ship you think that you can

304
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:26,719
swim if you are in a car you think that

305
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:29,660
maybe you can intervene in some ways but

306
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:34,100
in a plane nope that's the reason why

307
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:37,250
some people fear planes and loss of

308
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:40,010
control has always evoked fear this is a

309
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:43,430
film that most of you now for the people

310
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:45,350
of my generation it's the first film

311
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:48,439
that actually made something click in

312
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:52,339
our mind because we saw a guy dialing in

313
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:56,240
a Pentagon computer and accidentally

314
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:59,750
almost start a nuclear war but you know

315
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,010
what the topic of wargames is not

316
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:03,950
hacking

317
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:07,160
the theme of wargames is fear of

318
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:09,890
automation the fear of ending the

319
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,690
control of nuclear weapons to an

320
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:14,120
artificial intelligence this is what a

321
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:19,310
1984 artificial intelligence looks like

322
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:21,800
I I really love this picture that's what

323
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:25,639
caused the fear that was part of the

324
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:28,970
trail of the film automation causes fear

325
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:30,410
if we cannot ensure people that

326
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:33,140
automation is going to work very

327
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:35,300
reliably they're not going to make use

328
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:38,570
of anything that we offer to them with

329
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:41,540
that inside so we cannot just keep the

330
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:43,810
circus going because some tracks are

331
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:47,659
important because they raise awareness

332
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:49,370
they raise up the question but once the

333
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:52,490
question is raised then people are

334
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:59,419
listening to you then you better have

335
00:17:52,490 --> 00:18:02,860
some answers to offer stand hacks focus

336
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:05,960
on specific vulnerabilities now our

337
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:09,159
vulnerability is important in the long

338
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:13,040
run this is a short abstract from

339
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:16,250
keynote that then here who I think is

340
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:20,090
one of the best security minds on the

341
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:21,860
planet gave at blackhat in 2014 if you

342
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:23,360
have one hour to spend instead of

343
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:26,600
listening to me actually you should go

344
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,610
and listen to him it's a much better how

345
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:31,939
I'm sorry you are stuck with me I'm just

346
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:32,709
sorry but in this keynote there is this

347
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:37,880
reflection

348
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:42,110
so if vulnerabilities are sparse so

349
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:44,020
there's just a few fixing them one by

350
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:47,810
one or at least fixing one of them

351
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:50,030
reduces risk if phoner abilities are

352
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:53,510
dense there's many of them and many are

353
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:55,639
created every time we write code and we

354
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:57,110
don't know which of the two is the case

355
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,790
actually we don't have a demonstration

356
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:03,860
of that but everything points to the

357
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:06,740
dense part fixing them actually doesn't

358
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:10,669
matter of course if you see about you

359
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:12,790
quash it but it doesn't matter in the

360
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:12,790
end

361
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:22,070
so we are not going to solve things by

362
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:24,800
squashing a vulnerability at a time this

363
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:27,100
is also evident in other fields with

364
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:29,899
this we have already learned that lesson

365
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:32,090
security is extremely bad keeping track

366
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:33,980
of lessons we already learned and that's

367
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:37,699
a problem because we learn them at great

368
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:40,940
expense we learned this from kernel

369
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:44,590
exploitation you heard what Stephan was

370
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,590
saying in an answer to a question before

371
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:50,660
making the exploitation a order in the

372
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:57,310
harder and harder harder to achieve the

373
00:19:50,660 --> 00:20:00,560
final goal we'll make it an T economical

374
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:02,480
reduces the number the pool of attackers

375
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:06,260
reduces the pool of occasions that

376
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:09,080
attack is going to be used in and this

377
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:12,680
is everywhere this is an email by bus

378
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:14,480
Albert's years ago on the kernel

379
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:17,150
developer I think make the mailing list

380
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,100
where but Albert's was agreeing with

381
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:21,050
Brad Spangler which fingers which I

382
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:25,610
think is almost as rare as an alignment

383
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:27,919
of cosmic planets saying yeah you know

384
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:31,219
we don't need to kill the bugs one by

385
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:32,270
one we need to quash the ways those bugs

386
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:35,110
can exploit it

387
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:39,290
we need to deny attackers their goal

388
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:44,719
that's a lesson we have learned it we

389
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:47,480
should just apply it again and in order

390
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,660
to apply that lesson we need systemic

391
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:53,120
thinking we need to understand how

392
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:55,040
vulnerabilities work in the context of

393
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:58,959
the system that is being exploited and

394
00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:03,590
as we said before this is a problem

395
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:05,690
these understand the context is exactly

396
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:11,720
the problem expressed in that last bold

397
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:13,910
line there if we don't understand how

398
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:16,190
the vulnerability is going to affect the

399
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:19,070
actual system we don't have the faintest

400
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:22,370
idea is it important or not oh look

401
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:25,639
there's a buffer overflow inside one of

402
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:27,739
the 14 or 15 million lines of code of my

403
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:30,410
Mercedes

404
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:37,060
I can assure you there's probably a

405
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:39,560
hundred thousand others is it important

406
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:42,919
can we do something to prevent it from

407
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:45,020
happening or can we do something even

408
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:47,720
better to make it so that this

409
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:50,360
vulnerability that is there it's

410
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:53,930
actually it actually doesn't have an

411
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:57,350
impact and if we are looking at cyber

412
00:21:53,930 --> 00:22:01,910
physical systems impact is what happens

413
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:06,080
on the physical side we need to get to a

414
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:08,930
point if possible where we can safely

415
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,540
ignore the fact that somebody may have

416
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:12,350
compromised the computer inside if we

417
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:16,550
get there

418
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:18,230
guess what we have secured the system it

419
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:20,360
doesn't matter if the computer gets

420
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:24,560
compromised I know that for hackers this

421
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:27,139
is almost blasphemy but in fact if it

422
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:29,950
doesn't affect the final operation of

423
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:32,720
the system it really doesn't matter and

424
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:36,080
since we are not terribly good at making

425
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,580
sure that hacks do not happen and thanks

426
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:41,780
what for that because otherwise we would

427
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:44,060
be all out of a job soon we need to make

428
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:45,500
sure that when hacks do happen they

429
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:49,340
cannot affect the operation of the

430
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:51,920
system so how do we fix this because hey

431
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:53,600
I said that we shouldn't raise a problem

432
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,610
without proposing a solution so I'm

433
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,500
taking a bit of my own medicine and

434
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:59,570
trying to propose a solution I don't

435
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:03,950
think I have a solution but they have a

436
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:06,590
few suggestions I just named two first

437
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:09,380
suggestion thinking systemically not

438
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:13,550
thinking a specific one let me pick up

439
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:15,020
my own research and tear it apart so

440
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:16,730
this is research that we did we

441
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:20,690
presented it at blackhat we presented it

442
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:24,920
as security and privacy we looked at a

443
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:29,120
robot and tried to break into it now

444
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:31,520
this is what the circus cheered for we

445
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,020
presented the fact that in this robot

446
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,690
specifically I will not go through all

447
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:37,100
of the things so you you can go and pick

448
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:39,290
up these lights of this talk and read

449
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:41,000
them for for yourself even what we

450
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:44,090
presented the fact that

451
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:49,039
inside this robot which is a half a ton

452
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:51,699
of metal costing about 80,000 euros all

453
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:56,210
of the components do not do code-signing

454
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:59,059
my cell phone does but big area robot

455
00:23:56,210 --> 00:24:02,030
doesn't so whatever you upload it to

456
00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:04,850
whatever vulnerability you find the

457
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:06,740
robot will blindly accept it this is a

458
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:11,209
stupid vulnerability so the circus

459
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:14,299
cheered for this out of configuration

460
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:15,890
the reason a directory in the robot

461
00:24:14,299 --> 00:24:17,809
which is similar to a virtual directory

462
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:21,020
such as slash broke on a Linux system

463
00:24:17,809 --> 00:24:23,090
that you may be more familiar with where

464
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:25,610
you can read configuration parameters

465
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:27,500
but if you write you also write the

466
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:29,750
configuration parameters and if you

467
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,789
write a specifically named comment the

468
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:36,520
robot will execute whatever you write in

469
00:24:31,789 --> 00:24:36,520
there Serkis Cheers

470
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:45,590
do I need to comment this is literally

471
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:48,110
the example that is on my slides for

472
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:51,470
computer security 101 of a buffer

473
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:53,928
overflow and additionally since this is

474
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:55,909
on a robot and the robot runs an

475
00:24:53,929 --> 00:24:58,340
operating system that is meant to do

476
00:24:55,909 --> 00:25:00,830
things timely and not necessarily

477
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:02,928
securely the robot does not ever an

478
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:05,270
address the randomization it does not

479
00:25:02,929 --> 00:25:09,710
have stack protection so you can exploit

480
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:10,549
this just like in smashing the stack for

481
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:14,260
fun in profit

482
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:16,510
it's 1996 exploitation all the way

483
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:18,770
circus Cheers

484
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:21,260
this is not important

485
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:25,490
none of these three slides was important

486
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:28,580
this is what ended up being uploaded in

487
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:30,890
the audience at blackhat this is what

488
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:32,899
ended up on the press capacitor free

489
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:33,760
warning what an industrial robot get

490
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:37,010
hacked

491
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:40,760
what hackers sabotage an industrial

492
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:42,919
robot harm a that's ask hackers are

493
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:44,360
remotely controlling interesting robots

494
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:50,260
now the sky is falling

495
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:53,780
my favorite headlight so basically we

496
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:54,620
inadvertently created a publicity crisis

497
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:58,490
for robots

498
00:25:54,620 --> 00:26:01,760
three actually the interesting part of

499
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:05,720
the paper was the next section which was

500
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:08,210
about how do you actually avoid this

501
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:11,210
from happening which is not passing the

502
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:12,590
robot it's also patching the robot but

503
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:16,430
passing the robot is useless because

504
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:17,480
that code is all proprietary has never

505
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:19,160
been scrutinized

506
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,780
there's gazillions of vulnerabilities in

507
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,640
there you're not going to solve it by

508
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:25,010
squashing one vulnerability at a time

509
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,780
I can throw an infinite number of PhD

510
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:31,820
students at that robot and it will not

511
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:34,700
be solved the way you solve it is yeah

512
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:36,889
professors count work hours in number of

513
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:41,950
PhD students per subject that's the

514
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:44,960
third no worse so we for instance

515
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:48,800
explored how what do you do post

516
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:50,450
exploitation and how to close those post

517
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:53,120
exploitation strategies instead of

518
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:55,400
closing the vulnerabilities we explored

519
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,590
the threat landscape so that we found

520
00:26:55,400 --> 00:27:00,740
ways to minimize the impact the

521
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:03,320
discussion on electrical versus software

522
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:05,059
based controls is one example we

523
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,409
explored the architectural changes that

524
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:11,629
would improve resilience such as

525
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:13,220
signatures maybe we suggest the research

526
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:16,130
directions for doing that for instance

527
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:17,990
how do we statically analyze the more

528
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:20,740
and more complex progress that are going

529
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:24,200
to be used in robots and in deployed

530
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:28,460
production lines in the future crickets

531
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:31,429
because we don't know just so that you

532
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:34,220
understand how deep the problem is when

533
00:27:31,429 --> 00:27:37,130
a robotics engineer wants a robot to

534
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:39,860
talk to another robot usually they code

535
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:41,750
a socket connection like literally they

536
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:43,490
ran ually right a socket connection to

537
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:46,250
send data in the socket connection to

538
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:48,530
receive data which we all know is the

539
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:51,230
single most difficult task in creation

540
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:53,480
like preparing data sending them across

541
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:55,460
the network and parsing them on the

542
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:57,610
other hand in a secure way is literally

543
00:27:55,460 --> 00:28:01,400
one of the hardest things to get right

544
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:02,928
these are not computer engineers these

545
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:06,910
are automation engineers they have never

546
00:28:02,929 --> 00:28:06,910
been trained to write a line of C code

547
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:13,390
the probability of them getting this

548
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:13,390
right is abysmal

549
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:20,390
we know how to do better than that

550
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:23,510
we already know this specific lesson we

551
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:29,840
have already learned it well evidently

552
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:31,400
not but we should we identified another

553
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,709
thing that is very interesting like

554
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:37,130
industrial routers which are these big

555
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:40,520
bulky connection systems that protect

556
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:42,950
industrial networks they cost between

557
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:47,240
five and ten thousand years each and

558
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:49,160
they are glorified consumer routers they

559
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:52,640
are no better than your hundred dollars

560
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:56,330
router that you pick up at Costco their

561
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,980
software quality is abysmal and 85,000

562
00:28:56,330 --> 00:29:01,460
networks around the world are behind

563
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:04,250
these devices so this is what was

564
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:07,400
actually important figuring out how do

565
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:08,960
we make it so that this thing that is

566
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:12,950
riddled with vulnerabilities and there's

567
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:18,980
no way that it isn't this ecosystem gets

568
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:22,790
better second suggestion we need to

569
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:24,920
embed security much earlier into the

570
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:27,320
design process and you know this is one

571
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:30,050
of those phrases I started hearing it

572
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:36,520
when I started looking at security 20

573
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:40,480
years ago more than and it's still true

574
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:44,660
let me use automotive for example

575
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:46,760
charlie increases are right taking over

576
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:49,730
a car from remote from another state and

577
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:52,190
driving it off the road but lots of

578
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:54,410
hacks have happened in the past few

579
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:55,970
years it's been a very prolific thing

580
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:58,580
there's been a number of talks about

581
00:29:55,970 --> 00:30:00,530
automotive hacking here there's people

582
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:02,929
doing how to motive a king villages at

583
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:06,080
DEFCON it's been popularized it's a

584
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:10,330
popular sport hacking into cars and the

585
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:15,320
reason is that all these AXA at the end

586
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:18,279
are basically the same AK they're all

587
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:21,418
the same fine

588
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:25,389
an exploit in one of the Gateway systems

589
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:27,549
get into the car Network the car network

590
00:30:25,389 --> 00:30:30,218
is basically a trust based network where

591
00:30:27,549 --> 00:30:32,859
every component trustus each other

592
00:30:30,219 --> 00:30:35,679
component and so you can do whatever in

593
00:30:32,859 --> 00:30:39,749
hell you want all of these attacks are

594
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:42,190
the same we can demonstrate a thousand

595
00:30:39,749 --> 00:30:46,929
with this demonstration of a thousand

596
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:49,749
attacks change anything no what we need

597
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:52,029
is actually a way to solve this which is

598
00:30:49,749 --> 00:30:55,869
not quashing the vulnerabilities in

599
00:30:52,029 --> 00:30:57,639
these gateways not alone also but not

600
00:30:55,869 --> 00:31:00,428
alone because when you quash the

601
00:30:57,639 --> 00:31:03,399
vulnerabilities in the Gateway when you

602
00:31:00,429 --> 00:31:07,330
find a vulnerability patching the car is

603
00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:10,268
not as simple as patching vft PD this is

604
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:12,609
what FCA ended up doing for passing the

605
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:14,710
cars they mail that each and every

606
00:31:12,609 --> 00:31:18,789
single owner of the affected vehicle a

607
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:23,950
USB key instructing them to slam the USB

608
00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:26,529
key inside the car and updating it which

609
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:28,659
is at the same time the best thing that

610
00:31:26,529 --> 00:31:31,989
they could possibly do at that point and

611
00:31:28,659 --> 00:31:34,330
an awful idea because you are training

612
00:31:31,989 --> 00:31:39,989
people to slap unknown USB keys in your

613
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:43,178
cars and let the car update itself so

614
00:31:39,989 --> 00:31:45,339
that this is the defense circus which is

615
00:31:43,179 --> 00:31:51,399
always the same but funnier than the

616
00:31:45,339 --> 00:31:53,440
offensive circus so how do we make

617
00:31:51,399 --> 00:31:55,330
itself that this does not happen well

618
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,009
this will happen from time to time but

619
00:31:55,330 --> 00:32:01,109
how do we make so that this does not

620
00:31:57,009 --> 00:32:04,059
happen or isn't that so impactful well

621
00:32:01,109 --> 00:32:05,889
there's there's a number of problems

622
00:32:04,059 --> 00:32:08,529
here that the issue is that can is a

623
00:32:05,889 --> 00:32:11,228
trusted network and it's also unable to

624
00:32:08,529 --> 00:32:12,969
support any reasonable all tent occation

625
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:15,399
or encryption mechanism because it is

626
00:32:12,969 --> 00:32:18,999
very short messages now things are

627
00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:21,488
changing there in the industry but

628
00:32:18,999 --> 00:32:23,919
there's a lot of research that has tried

629
00:32:21,489 --> 00:32:27,489
to address this but almost everything

630
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:29,979
that we say is well every single hacker

631
00:32:27,489 --> 00:32:32,080
the less than this is like yeah this

632
00:32:29,979 --> 00:32:35,080
protocol sucks change it

633
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:37,059
as soon as you say change it all of the

634
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:39,908
automotive people in the room raise

635
00:32:37,059 --> 00:32:43,178
their asses and walk out because you

636
00:32:39,909 --> 00:32:45,940
can't that's a very beautiful suggestion

637
00:32:43,179 --> 00:32:48,580
that will never work because it's

638
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:49,899
impossible cost wise it's going to

639
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:52,500
happen in the next generation of

640
00:32:49,899 --> 00:32:55,629
vehicles but not in the current one

641
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:57,700
lots of research camp tries to come up

642
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:59,799
with magic intrusion detection systems

643
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:02,860
hey I'm an intrusion detection systems

644
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:05,918
guy I wrote my PhD thesis on intrusion

645
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:09,010
detection I'm suddenly relevant again to

646
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:11,740
say intrusion detection systems did not

647
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:13,960
work when I wrote my thesis in 2006

648
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:17,919
thanks God they didn't realize it before

649
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:20,080
giving me my PhD they did not work

650
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:24,850
throughout the next few years and they

651
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:27,730
do not work out now and in particular

652
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:30,969
even if they did work in this specific

653
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:31,720
context there's an issue what do you do

654
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:34,000
with them

655
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:38,110
once you have detected that there is an

656
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:40,000
attack do you turn on a light on the

657
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:44,590
dashboard of the vehicle with a guy in a

658
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,899
balaclava the owner goes to the manual

659
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:52,449
incentive and says yeah pull over very

660
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:54,518
slowly cold police do you know that

661
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:56,950
there's an attack being actually there

662
00:33:54,519 --> 00:34:00,309
are ways good ways to use this but I'm

663
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:03,659
saying that lots of research actually is

664
00:34:00,309 --> 00:34:06,100
not really that practically applicable

665
00:34:03,659 --> 00:34:07,990
squashing bugs in hand thousands of

666
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:09,609
combinations of ECU's and firmer of

667
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:13,359
course is never going to work

668
00:34:09,609 --> 00:34:17,230
and so we need to embed secure design on

669
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:20,290
networks based on the risks and lo and

670
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:24,369
behold the compromise of those issues is

671
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:27,639
not a risk per se the risks in an

672
00:34:24,369 --> 00:34:30,669
automotive V in a vehicle are basically

673
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:32,589
four types of risks either someone wants

674
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:34,830
to kill the owner or the people around

675
00:34:32,589 --> 00:34:37,679
it safe operations of the vehicle

676
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:40,418
someone wants to steal the vehicle

677
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,399
someone wants to track the owner of the

678
00:34:40,418 --> 00:34:44,500
vehicle or get some personal information

679
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:45,638
of the vehicle someone wants to violate

680
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,440
intellectual property

681
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:49,119
these are the four things that are going

682
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,220
to happen three of these are going to

683
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:54,700
impact the brand one is going to

684
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:58,890
directly impact the indio and the

685
00:34:54,699 --> 00:35:01,989
manufacturer so once you've done this

686
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:05,348
then the treads that you're going to

687
00:35:01,989 --> 00:35:06,700
face are actually kind of evident what's

688
00:35:05,349 --> 00:35:08,710
going to happen well one thing is

689
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:12,180
already happening single biggest

690
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:15,489
cybersecurity threat to vehicles theft

691
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:18,339
most vehicles are stolen by abusing

692
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:20,950
their electronic keys that's a

693
00:35:18,339 --> 00:35:22,119
cyberattack if you want we've never

694
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:25,239
called it like that

695
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:27,329
but if you want to say to seek what is

696
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:31,210
the most common threat against vehicles

697
00:35:27,329 --> 00:35:33,579
theft what's another threat that could

698
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:37,299
happen to vehicles well that somebody or

699
00:35:33,579 --> 00:35:40,599
create a ransom scheme for them is it

700
00:35:37,299 --> 00:35:40,869
going to happen yes when is it going to

701
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:43,480
happen

702
00:35:40,869 --> 00:35:44,069
I don't know when it's going to be worth

703
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:48,249
it

704
00:35:44,069 --> 00:35:52,319
how do you know because obviously it's

705
00:35:48,249 --> 00:35:57,339
going to happen there's no way around it

706
00:35:52,319 --> 00:36:01,630
so how do we make sure that these end

707
00:35:57,339 --> 00:36:04,269
goals of attackers cannot happen well

708
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:06,279
fortunately enough we can break them

709
00:36:04,269 --> 00:36:08,950
down according to the components in the

710
00:36:06,279 --> 00:36:11,559
because and according to their

711
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:15,308
functionalities and once we've done that

712
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:17,920
we are able to map that on how we design

713
00:36:15,309 --> 00:36:20,680
for instance the networks where do we

714
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,319
place the security protections in the

715
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:26,440
network we cannot really filter all of

716
00:36:23,319 --> 00:36:28,808
the messages but we can filter some we

717
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:31,960
cannot really embed security on all

718
00:36:28,809 --> 00:36:35,559
ECU's but we can embed it on some

719
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:39,579
functionalities this is a reasonable

720
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:41,829
approach to try to integrate security

721
00:36:39,579 --> 00:36:44,380
into vehicle design because if we go to

722
00:36:41,829 --> 00:36:46,359
the designers and we say oh it's easy

723
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:47,609
you just need to draw away everything

724
00:36:46,359 --> 00:36:49,749
and start from scratch

725
00:36:47,609 --> 00:36:54,489
that's a beautiful suggestion that

726
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:58,538
cannot be applied so these are the two

727
00:36:54,489 --> 00:36:59,380
big ones that I think are in my list of

728
00:36:58,539 --> 00:37:02,890
suggestion

729
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:04,779
but then maybe you have some in Hilo we

730
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:07,269
we have a lot of work to do

731
00:37:04,779 --> 00:37:11,289
so everybody's suggestions are as good

732
00:37:07,269 --> 00:37:15,519
as mine to take away for this my

733
00:37:11,289 --> 00:37:18,279
conclusions on this are that one and I'm

734
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:20,558
sorry to say that I think I like attic

735
00:37:18,279 --> 00:37:23,920
reset but we focus too much on attack

736
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:26,710
recess because vulnerability discovery

737
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:29,740
exploitation is cool but it doesn't

738
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:32,049
matter in the grand scheme of things

739
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:34,769
each single vulnerability does not

740
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:40,599
matter in the grand scheme of things

741
00:37:34,769 --> 00:37:44,410
span hacking is needed before somebody

742
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:47,109
takes notice then Stan packing distracts

743
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:52,058
the industry and the public from

744
00:37:47,109 --> 00:37:53,130
sensible risk reduction the sky is

745
00:37:52,059 --> 00:37:57,369
falling

746
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:59,500
works for a limited time and is not

747
00:37:57,369 --> 00:38:02,410
really effective in getting the sensible

748
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:05,920
things done because the effect that you

749
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:09,940
get is oh everything can be broken so it

750
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:14,230
doesn't matter if we protect it or even

751
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:20,319
worse okay so we protect the things when

752
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:22,990
they get broken which is way too late we

753
00:38:20,319 --> 00:38:25,990
need to focus on at least three things

754
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:29,319
that I can think of structural

755
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:33,609
resilience so building things that can

756
00:38:29,319 --> 00:38:35,769
be broken gracefully architectural

757
00:38:33,609 --> 00:38:38,650
changes to make it so that in complex

758
00:38:35,769 --> 00:38:40,450
systems the impact of one vulnerability

759
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:46,210
does not propagate to everything at once

760
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:50,609
such in cars or such as in robots and in

761
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:52,690
particular impact reduction we need to

762
00:38:50,609 --> 00:38:57,940
reapply something that we have already

763
00:38:52,690 --> 00:39:03,549
learned deny attackers their goal not

764
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:06,160
the attack the goal it's easier here the

765
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:08,769
goal is physical we have all sorts of

766
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:12,170
layer that we can use to deny attackers

767
00:39:08,769 --> 00:39:15,709
their goal if we may

768
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:19,730
it's so that in the worst case the robot

769
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:23,359
stops even if we are not achieving that

770
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:26,990
for a computer we are stopping one of

771
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:29,660
the attackers goals if we make it so

772
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:35,598
that it's impossible to upload a changed

773
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:39,589
firmware we avoid Ukraine's power

774
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:47,770
network to be taken down if we make it

775
00:39:39,589 --> 00:39:51,349
so that it's impossible to create an

776
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:54,290
impact on the whole vehicle by starting

777
00:39:51,349 --> 00:39:57,020
from one single component we make

778
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:58,759
Charlie and Miller work way more in

779
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:03,290
order to drive the next journalist of

780
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:05,930
the road so these are the things that

781
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:08,808
matter when we are doing where we are

782
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:12,500
trying to secure cyber-physical systems

783
00:40:08,809 --> 00:40:15,680
this is the road we need to take and as

784
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:19,220
hard as it is to do security research in

785
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:24,109
the offensive word finding reasonable

786
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:27,169
ways to do this is way harder so I do

787
00:40:24,109 --> 00:40:30,109
not encourage you to join me in doing

788
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:32,119
the easier thing of securing systems I'm

789
00:40:30,109 --> 00:40:35,119
encouraging you to do the harder thing

790
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:37,160
of securing systems because you know

791
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:39,740
breaking some of these systems is like

792
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:42,069
stealing candy from babies and that's

793
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:44,209
not something that we do as hackers

794
00:40:42,069 --> 00:40:46,520
thank you very much for your attention

795
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:48,970
and if you have any questions I am ready

796
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,970
to take them

797
00:40:54,270 --> 00:41:03,520
gratia gratia Stefano grad C Stefano but

798
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:08,290
so let's throw it open to the floor for

799
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:11,050
any questions and by the way we have

800
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:13,540
swag if you have most uploaded question

801
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:20,530
I think I know which one's gonna win why

802
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:24,060
are you so handsome I will steal that

803
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:27,520
from my debt or my twitter bio my father

804
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:31,029
like next ten minutes why don't you

805
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:33,490
answer that first okay just kidding

806
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:35,530
we'll come back to slide oh but I wanted

807
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:38,589
to throw it open to the floor first so

808
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:41,050
prices for the most uploaded question

809
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:44,710
and price for a question that you choose

810
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:46,570
as your favorite so so the thing about

811
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:48,700
stun hacking is that we have an

812
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:50,860
incentive as researchers to do highly

813
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:54,189
visible work like that obviously it

814
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:56,170
advances our career but for security it

815
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:59,020
also advances the awareness of the lie

816
00:41:56,170 --> 00:42:00,990
of the potential problems there and

817
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:03,670
where is the incentive for the

818
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:05,950
manufacturers to take on the investment

819
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:07,900
to do the design changes that's

820
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:10,509
necessary to construct like secure

821
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:12,220
systems oh that's actually that's

822
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:15,550
actually an awesome point that I forgot

823
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:17,500
to make yes the the probe is not I mean

824
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:19,810
the incentive for us in doing attack

825
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:21,340
research is evident and I mean I'm fine

826
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:24,700
with that I don't I don't think we

827
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:26,830
should stop doing that god forbid we

828
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:30,790
should just you know kind of partition

829
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:32,080
our time differently but in the case for

830
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:35,710
the second half of your question which

831
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:38,440
is the important one the point is what

832
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:40,270
is the incentive to the OEM the

833
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:42,400
incentive to do em is selling cars

834
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:46,870
selling cars and not incurring expenses

835
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:48,580
because they sold cars so in the case of

836
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:50,529
automotive for instance there is a

837
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:52,810
strong incentive there are a lot of

838
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:55,270
regulations related to safety that they

839
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:57,610
need to adhere to and the cybersecurity

840
00:42:55,270 --> 00:43:00,009
is becoming part of these considerations

841
00:42:57,610 --> 00:43:02,290
but this is not true across all the

842
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:05,260
industry it's true for automotive it's

843
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:06,099
true for aviation but for instance in

844
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:09,489
the industry

845
00:43:06,099 --> 00:43:11,769
control systems area it's way more it's

846
00:43:09,489 --> 00:43:14,440
way more great the economics of how you

847
00:43:11,769 --> 00:43:16,238
do that in the robotics area it's more

848
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:19,809
great the economics of how you do that

849
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:22,809
so the ways we get that to get we had

850
00:43:19,809 --> 00:43:24,819
any IOT like a consumer IOT there's

851
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:27,489
basically zero except the incentive is

852
00:43:24,819 --> 00:43:29,558
to put out whatever next bullshit you

853
00:43:27,489 --> 00:43:33,069
want to put out and and not test it

854
00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:35,470
actually I was doing another slide deck

855
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:38,799
I looked at for some of the most absurd

856
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:42,368
IOT phoenix' and I think the top for me

857
00:43:38,799 --> 00:43:45,038
is this IOT wine bottle it's a wine

858
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:48,539
bottle with screens on all the sides you

859
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:51,220
put in wine from an unmarked bottle and

860
00:43:48,539 --> 00:43:53,950
then you scan the code on your mark

861
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:57,578
bottle and this downloads all sorts of

862
00:43:53,950 --> 00:44:00,368
information to color the bottle and I

863
00:43:57,579 --> 00:44:03,759
was looking at it another I just can't

864
00:44:00,369 --> 00:44:06,450
even what what is this so the good thing

865
00:44:03,759 --> 00:44:09,190
is since the wine is not affected

866
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:10,149
whatever hack on that bottle just

867
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:11,920
doesn't make sense

868
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:14,289
that's a good thing the positive thing

869
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,969
is that is not safety critical the

870
00:44:14,289 --> 00:44:18,700
negative thing is do you really think

871
00:44:15,969 --> 00:44:22,930
that there is an incentive to secure

872
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:24,519
such a stupid device of course not there

873
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:27,160
is no incentive that's not part of the

874
00:44:24,519 --> 00:44:30,729
economical model so the only way we can

875
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:33,670
do that is if as a community we figure

876
00:44:30,729 --> 00:44:37,960
out ways to create to pick up these

877
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:40,479
externalities and make the vendors the

878
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:42,630
audience the manufacturers pay for them

879
00:44:40,479 --> 00:44:45,819
the same thing as with pollution

880
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:49,150
pollution is an externality it's a cost

881
00:44:45,819 --> 00:44:51,819
of the manufacturing that is put on

882
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:54,309
society so the only way to make that go

883
00:44:51,819 --> 00:44:54,910
away is that you regulate it out of

884
00:44:54,309 --> 00:44:58,450
existence

885
00:44:54,910 --> 00:45:01,149
you make it costlier to pollute then to

886
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:03,098
actually fix it and the same thing goes

887
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:05,829
for security unfortunately which is a

888
00:45:03,099 --> 00:45:08,410
discussion that no manufacturer no

889
00:45:05,829 --> 00:45:11,920
vendor has ever wanted to hear but in

890
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:13,808
the cyber physical systems field it's

891
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:15,729
just going to happen in Europe it's

892
00:45:13,809 --> 00:45:18,750
happening the European Commission has

893
00:45:15,729 --> 00:45:21,419
created a cybersecurity Act which will

894
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:24,690
create a set of industry vertical

895
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:28,380
regulations for doing some basic

896
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:29,940
security testing of devices just like

897
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:31,830
you do basic safety testing for

898
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:33,330
electrical systems we will do basic

899
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:35,790
security testing for devices that's one

900
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:38,040
of the routes the other road is imposing

901
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:39,930
costs that's the two routes if you want

902
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:41,609
to go the free-market way you need to

903
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:44,069
impose the costs if you want to go to a

904
00:45:41,609 --> 00:45:46,580
European regulation way we need to build

905
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:49,170
regulation

906
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:51,119
gratzi so and you will take one more

907
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:52,020
question from the audience and then

908
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:56,130
we'll go to slide Oh

909
00:45:52,020 --> 00:46:01,200
anymore anyone from the audience is that

910
00:45:56,130 --> 00:46:04,320
a hand up no I've not then let's take

911
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:07,169
the first one on the top okay ten volts

912
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:09,900
what is the trust awareness trade-off we

913
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:11,430
stand hacking well sometimes tax bring

914
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:13,980
attention to another examine issue

915
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:16,319
it also comes at the cost of trust and

916
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:20,510
inhibits future engagement I think I

917
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:20,510
know who wrote this question anyway

918
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:28,440
that's exactly the trade off and I would

919
00:46:25,109 --> 00:46:30,240
like to not to point out to the obvious

920
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:33,210
part which is the one about bringing

921
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:36,720
attention to an under examine issue but

922
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:40,680
to the later part performing a stand

923
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:43,169
hack in certain ways is going to raise

924
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:46,319
the attention and to also bring the

925
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:50,339
vendors to the table performing a stunt

926
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:53,970
act in other ways raises the attention

927
00:46:50,339 --> 00:46:57,390
but since it scares the vendors into not

928
00:46:53,970 --> 00:47:00,480
talking to you it actually pushes the

929
00:46:57,390 --> 00:47:04,348
solution of the problem away so if your

930
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:06,150
objective is to make the stunt research

931
00:47:04,349 --> 00:47:09,060
because we have our personal incentive

932
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:11,670
in appearing then either way works well

933
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:14,779
well for you but if the incentive is

934
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:17,490
trying to improve the world a little

935
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:19,020
then you want to do your stand hack in

936
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:21,689
such a way that it doesn't scare the

937
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:25,770
vendors away aviation industry is a

938
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:28,950
specific example of this we try it for a

939
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:31,589
number of years to get aviation people

940
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:32,779
at blackhat for instance discussing

941
00:47:31,589 --> 00:47:35,750
vulnerabilities with

942
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:37,940
churches and they don't come because

943
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:41,480
they think that the engagement is not

944
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:44,210
going to be positive the same thing

945
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:49,370
happened with automotive until a few

946
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:51,440
years ago so it's good to do stunts

947
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:52,670
hacking to raise awareness of a problem

948
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,460
but if you want to solve the problem

949
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:57,020
this must also take into consideration

950
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:58,970
how it affects the vendor and if the

951
00:47:57,020 --> 00:48:00,890
vendor is going to be so pissed off that

952
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:07,850
they don't want to have to do with a

953
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:10,160
curse anymore okay so um next so you're

954
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:12,710
saying the recent article about a bug

955
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:14,839
that could make a female sex robot

956
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:15,740
strangle a man was exaggerated that's

957
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:20,930
disappointing

958
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:23,209
so first of all I am Pro freedom of

959
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:25,009
expression and choice if a female sex

960
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:27,530
robots ever develops a conscience and

961
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:29,540
says no I will support the female sex

962
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:34,610
robot to do whatever it takes to protect

963
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:37,820
herself however however this specific

964
00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:41,540
article this specific article was

965
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:43,790
bullshit I will I will say that in the

966
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:46,910
most diplomatic way I can but he was

967
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:48,950
complete bullshit alright we have I

968
00:48:46,910 --> 00:48:50,690
think we'll squeeze in maybe one or two

969
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:53,240
more questions any more questions from

970
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:55,280
the audience if not we'll continue it

971
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:56,660
slide oh all right go ahead how do you

972
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,090
think the government should regulate

973
00:48:56,660 --> 00:49:05,720
such spam tax that you shouldn't next

974
00:48:59,090 --> 00:49:08,210
question we should we should so there's

975
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:10,339
a longer answer is we should be

976
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:13,790
responsible enough that this doesn't

977
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:15,320
happen we don't we don't want to make

978
00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:17,720
someone think that they need to regulate

979
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:21,290
us because that's not going to work well

980
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:23,750
for them first and it's not going to

981
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:25,460
work very well for us either do you

982
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:27,860
think that these stunt hacks can have a

983
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:30,260
benefit in terms of throwing new talent

984
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:32,870
into the industry as carrot or does it

985
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:35,060
scare them away now I think that this is

986
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:37,549
a this probably a positive point they

987
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:40,340
should point out in any future version

988
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:43,580
of this talk yes stunt hacks do attract

989
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:46,250
new people into the fold the question

990
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:47,990
may be are those it

991
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:50,330
exactly the people that we want to

992
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:52,459
attract into the fold I will probably

993
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:54,860
want to think about that question for a

994
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:56,060
while before give me an answer okay one

995
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:58,550
last question okay

996
00:49:56,060 --> 00:50:00,259
how there's a PhD candidate keep up with

997
00:49:58,550 --> 00:50:01,970
his a research direction with the

998
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:04,250
Seesmic changing land signals secure

999
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:07,549
cyber security you just abandon yourself

1000
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:11,690
the flow you just just put your trust in

1001
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:15,530
the force and in your Jedi Master - the

1002
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:17,480
flap that was wonderful well said okay

1003
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:20,920
with that do you want to choose the

1004
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:23,360
winner of your favorite question I think

1005
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:25,550
by the way I do know who asked the first

1006
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:29,540
question you know about about you being

1007
00:50:25,550 --> 00:50:31,190
ruggedly handsome yes yes no that that

1008
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:34,310
that one would be an obvious choice but

1009
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:39,170
I think that the question about the

1010
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:41,240
involvement of people in drone by the

1011
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:43,580
stunt acts that's actually something

1012
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:45,740
that I didn't think about so that's the

1013
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:51,380
most helpful question to me okay

1014
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:53,959
who is that was it from here oh yeah one

1015
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:55,760
of the last ones okay probably anonymous

1016
00:50:53,960 --> 00:51:00,260
so we don't know who it was okay but

1017
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:03,140

1018
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:05,930
