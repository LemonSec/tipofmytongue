35
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:38,360
that because you know this team

36
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:43,190

when we organize the capture the flag

41
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,789
for the two days we saw a very

42
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:58,549
outstanding performance from the team

43
00:01:55,789 --> 00:02:00,380
and you know it's a very excited to see

44
00:01:58,549 --> 00:02:01,790
that the team is you know competing for

45
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,229
the places like there is a team that

46
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:04,820
going to the first plane and then great

47
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:08,509
keep going now and you know it you know

48
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:10,489
the sauce first so yeah also it's great

49
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:13,760
actually to see some of the greatest

50
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:17,570
team in this Southeast Asia because we

51
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,829
from war games previously only do local

52
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:21,230
completion in Malaysia

53
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:23,120
so it is our office time organizing an

54
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:24,850
international event so yeah it's a

55
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,810
pretty disaster for us

56
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:29,319
[Applause]

57
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:29,319
[Music]

58
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:36,040
one thing I want to comment is that we

59
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:38,530
have 20 team and the one thing the

60
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:41,920
numbers of the number of Tina came is 17

61
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:43,930
musical and the great things to say that

62
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,149
nearly all the team have managed to

63
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:49,000
solve even one question so this is a

64
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:50,830
great thing to hear right okay so I'm

65
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,370
going to talk about the game format okay

66
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:55,900
so so in CT usually have two different

67
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,690
format I we have at your party and

68
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:01,210
attack defense so basically our game is

69
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:04,870
at your party but a little Swiss little

70
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:06,760
twist which is the instead of every team

71
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,920
is giving the same self question with

72
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,940
tractor and mice in life for example we

73
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,369
have five question

74
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,920
so maybe Team a and B we get three

75
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:18,760
question but in their eyes random I said

76
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:20,350
I mean ah so that is it so with this is

77
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,600
kind of a new format that we was

78
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:26,260
thinking and we want to experiment with

79
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:29,230
it so I when we decided we all team and

80
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:32,799
we thought this is a great place to test

81
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:36,519
our idea so we did for the past two days

82
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:38,230
all right so and you know when we try a

83
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:41,620
new thing them there might be a problem

84
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:44,260
right because new because the the order

85
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:47,560
from AB people have thought about the

86
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:50,140
problem and Harris fix it so we had a

87
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,240
problem actually for the step but we try

88
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,540
our best to organize it to fix it all

89
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,570
right

90
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:58,780
okay so for the first day really least

91
00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:01,930
14 challenges and that was great because

92
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:04,240
there was a very great team that analyst

93
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:05,230
off all of the questions and we were oh

94
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,000
my god

95
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,950
how can how can we can be the new

96
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,400
occasion but I think that's all right

97
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:14,500
and for a second they will release

98
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,858
another night ranges which compromise

99
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:19,630
all kind of for me like you know by

100
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:23,320
transportation weapons possession

101
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:27,490
subsolid like that and the greetings

102
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:31,110
there from our 20 release question only

103
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:34,540
two of them was unsolved so you know

104
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:41,140
another 21 question was soft so this was

105
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:45,100

the LOC note please join me to welcome

195
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:08,199
the troublemaker founder of hacking the

196
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:09,730
box meat dog all right so we won't take

197
00:10:08,199 --> 00:10:14,170
too much time because you know we have

198
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:15,579
to partay and so usually the lock node

199
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:18,670
is we're not talking about what's going

200
00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:19,930
to happen next year but this time we

201
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:21,849
actually have something that's going to

202
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:23,229
be happening this year which I guess

203
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:26,800
most of you have heard about which is

204
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:28,769
hid be saga week it's going to be one of

205
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,469
our largest ever hacking the Box events

206
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:34,480
anticipated like 5,000 people so 40

207
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:36,850
something days from now we are expected

208
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,889
to have a very large crowd joining us

209
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:41,230
and I'll just run through a little bit

210
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:42,670
in case you guys have been affected out

211
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:46,209
on the website or taking a look at the

212
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:49,839
video basically it's going to be it's a

213
00:10:46,209 --> 00:10:51,630
hid be when plus so it's hid B plus and

214
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,790
we're gonna have our usual conference

215
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:57,160
the conference format will now be over

216
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:58,990
three days and we also have lots of

217
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,569
training mr. Samuel at the back on the

218
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:03,579
photo here will also be doing a training

219
00:11:00,569 --> 00:11:05,349
and this is gonna be slightly different

220
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:08,109
from a usual hack in the box event so

221
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:10,329
normally we have our exhibition area we

222
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:13,540
have some challenges we have our usual

223
00:11:10,329 --> 00:11:14,888
CTF but at cyber week we're gonna have

224
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,649
something new which is called cyber

225
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:20,529
battle of the Emirates CBOE and it's

226
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:22,959
actually an expansion of our edu CTF

227
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:26,139
that we normally do except in this case

228
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:27,939
it's best of the best from the UAE high

229
00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:29,769
schools and universities we're actually

230
00:11:27,939 --> 00:11:31,540
providing them like a three-month

231
00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:33,939
training that's already been going on

232
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:35,860
currently and then they're gonna be

233
00:11:33,939 --> 00:11:37,629
competing and then the winners from that

234
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:40,149
competition will go and play with the

235
00:11:37,629 --> 00:11:41,350
this protest 1p dat right they're gonna

236
00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:42,339
join those guys as well and then we'll

237
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:44,139
see what happens

238
00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:46,240
and then a long side that we have this

239
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:47,910
new bug bounty thing that we're doing I

240
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,709
think if you were watching Katie's

241
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:53,469
impromptu talk that she very thankfully

242
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:56,709
gave yesterday it's a new bug bounty

243
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:58,990
contests it's a 90 plus 90 format take a

244
00:11:56,709 --> 00:12:01,388
look at the website everybody's welcome

245
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:03,939
to submit and we're going to probably

246
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:09,040
fly it on around 25 to 30 of the world's

247
00:12:03,939 --> 00:12:12,430
best bug hunters to come in play and

248
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,719
alongside that we've got Pro CTF which

249
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:15,248
obviously pity katie is going to be

250
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,370
there so you can check out the

251
00:12:15,249 --> 00:12:20,309
Indonesian team there we also will have

252
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:23,740
winners from DEFCON CTF from code blue

253
00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:25,389
each sleep on repeat who has one hack in

254
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,009
the box CTF back to back I think last

255
00:12:25,389 --> 00:12:28,899
year almost every single CTF they've

256
00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:30,459
been winning it those guys will be there

257
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:34,480
they're all going to be competing for

258
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:36,069
grand prize 100 K pretty cool we also

259
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,189
have an AI challenge which is my

260
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:41,829
personal favorite thing AI and we have

261
00:12:39,189 --> 00:12:44,259
two different challenges for for teams

262
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:47,170
to submit surprisingly we had a lot of

263
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:48,759
universities actually apply for this and

264
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:51,370
we are just taking a look at some of the

265
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:51,879
code that they had checked out pretty

266
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,470
impressive

267
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:56,199
we've got one challenge where it's a

268
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:59,259
malware modification so use again to try

269
00:12:56,199 --> 00:13:01,300
and like modify a piece of malware code

270
00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:03,040
so that's undetectable which will be a

271
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,300
problem for any antivirus companies I

272
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,509
don't know where percenter virus here

273
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:10,449
good luck to you guys and we also have

274
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:12,220
automated pawning challenge so using

275
00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:14,079
machine learning to try and like Auto

276
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:16,089
hack some stuff right whether it will

277
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,888
work who knows man I guess we're going

278
00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:19,329
to find out right and so we've got an AI

279
00:13:17,889 --> 00:13:21,910
challenge and then we also have a

280
00:13:19,329 --> 00:13:23,620
research rewards just one point five

281
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:26,379
million dollars given away by the ue

282
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:29,259
government mainly for university

283
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:31,259

284
00:13:29,259 --> 00:13:33,370

287
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:39,999

00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:02,469
keynote speaker tree but I'll leave that

296
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:04,060
as a one more thing that you guys can

297
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:05,730
check on the website by next week we

298

should have that announcement up and

299
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:10,000
because this is not just a normal hack

300
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,890
in the box event we decided that we're

301
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,510
gonna have highlight tracks so we'll

302
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:15,699
have actually breakout sessions on each

303
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:16,899
afternoon and of course you know you

304
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,339
have to have a quantum because quantum

305
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:19,089
computing that's going to be like the

306
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:21,760
next big thing

307
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:23,980
we have Jose Ignacio he's written

308
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,470
something like 120 odd papers I think in

309
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,760
his lifetime super super great guy he's

310
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:30,250
going to be the highlight speaker for

311
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,760
the quantum track we have Jerrod for

312
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:35,290
blockchain and then my personal favorite

313

track we have anima who is the director

314
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:40,899
from Nvidia also a super super smart

315
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,540
person should be the highlight speaker

316
00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:45,310
for for the AI track if you guys want to

317
