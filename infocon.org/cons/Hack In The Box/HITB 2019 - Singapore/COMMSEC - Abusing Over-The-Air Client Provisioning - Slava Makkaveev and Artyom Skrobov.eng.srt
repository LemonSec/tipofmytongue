1
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:20,850
we are Ottomans la from checkpoint

2
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,330
research mobile team what's happened to

3
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:27,840
our slides

4
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:29,640
yeah all right well anyway our daily job

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,189
is to find new ways into your mobile

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,950
devices so to go and play we go to talk

7
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:37,980
about one such way that we found it's

8
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:46,410
going to be a through oh that's a

9
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:49,349
Windows Update how exciting no no it's

10
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:51,959
going to be through SMS so everybody

11
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:54,719
knows SMS it's one of the oldest mobile

12
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,690
technology is still in use it's ironic

13
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,609
that a old-school hacks such as fake as

14
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:04,440
immersed messages remain relevant even

15
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:06,659
now in 2019 and with the hack that we

16
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:10,230
are going to talk about any attacker

17
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:12,659
with a very cheap USB modem dongle can

18
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:15,630
attack any phone across the world and

19
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:17,610
with a just one SMS he can intercept

20
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:20,880
somebody's mobile traffic or still his

21
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:24,240
private information or possibly even set

22
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,970
his browser homepage to his own site and

23
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,789
our estimate is that almost a half of

24
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:32,490
all smartphones are currently acceptable

25
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:35,460
to all there's a kind of attack this is

26
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:37,830
because it's not a particular

27
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,570
vulnerability in a software or in

28
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,310
Hardware of these devices but rather a

29
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,889
straightforward to implementation of a

30
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:48,420
rather old specification which just was

31
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:52,280
not designed with a security in mind so

32
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:55,740
we start from the technical background

33
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:58,440
SMS is not just plain text message it's

34
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,570
a client provisioning message so start

35
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:03,030
by describing the provision in

36
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,919
technology this is what the mobile

37
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,050
network operators used to supply new

38
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,390
settings to your phones when for example

39
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:11,370
you switch it on for the first time on a

40
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:16,410
new network such as as a conference

41
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:18,150
abroad like here but also enterprises

42
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:21,000
can use this technology for example to

43
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:23,939
distribute the corporate email server

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,689
address to their employees and these

45
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:28,859
settings take form of special SMS are

46
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:31,170
compliant with

47
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:35,300
specification defined by Open Mobile

48
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:37,589
Alliance this is a standards body which

49
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:40,980
basically defines all the standards for

50
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:44,460
the mobile industry much like the ITF

51
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:48,570
does for the internet so it's consists

52
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:50,190
of members representing the equipment

53
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:52,170
manufacturing companies software

54
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:54,359
developing companies mobile network

55
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:57,329
operators membership changes from year

56
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,370
to year and the companies which are on

57
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:02,190
the board of directors this time around

58
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:04,560
shown on the slide curiously it doesn't

59
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:06,780
include any software companies this time

60
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,420
around but for many years it had

61
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:14,489
included represented from Microsoft and

62
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:16,738
converse so what how may does is it

63
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:18,810
write specifications much like ITF

64
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:22,010
releases their own RFC's which are

65
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:23,970
identified will they just 0 numbers is

66
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:25,920
specifications while they open Wella

67
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:28,050
Alliance I have more structured

68
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,780
hierarchical names which also include

69
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:33,660
version number and release date the

70
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,489
revision letter sold the specifications

71
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:38,160
which are relevant for client provision

72
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:40,200
shown on this slide and you can see that

73
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,720
all of them date from quite a few years

74
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,459
ago and they all beast one corresponding

75
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,870
to the session protocol that it's back

76
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:50,400
to 2002 and the specifications from may

77
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,110
cover all layers of mobile

78
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,350
communications from the bits and bytes

79
00:03:52,110 --> 00:04:00,870
inside an SMS all the way to the general

80
00:03:55,350 --> 00:04:04,310
architecture of mobile communications so

81
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:09,840
they come into the specification the SMS

82
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:11,760
it shares a decade's old protocol when

83
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,370
transmitted it physically takes form of

84
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,978
one or several protocol data units OPD

85
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:20,160
use for short but logically it employs a

86
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:23,340
full four layer stack of protocols much

87
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,660
like the tcp/ip four layer stack except

88
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,280
that all the protocols are completely

89
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,490
different and unrelated to internet

90
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:33,059
protocols so at the lowest level which

91
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:35,760
is called bearer layer we have the short

92
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:39,240
message transfer protocol or SM - TP for

93
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:42,370
short to distinguish it from SMTP wishes

94
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,560
for email and there

95
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:48,060
it's Heather specifies the recipient for

96
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,650
a phone number and it's curious that it

97
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:53,979
allows not specifying the origin phone

98
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:58,349
number this is handy to us if you want

99
00:04:53,979 --> 00:05:01,900
to impersonate somebody else than the

100
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:05,800
transport layer implemented in well as

101
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:07,510
Datagram protocol or wdp specifies the

102
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,639
source and destination port numbers

103
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:12,120
which focal and provision hard-coded to

104
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:18,330
the values shown on this slide that's

105
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:20,919
2948 and 9200 the session layer handles

106
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:22,780
authentication of a message and then at

107
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:25,030
the top application layer we have the

108
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:27,099
payload which for a simple text message

109
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:30,340
would be just plain text in a specific

110
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:33,190
encoding or it can be a picture or a

111
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,448
voicemail indicator which is what you

112
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:37,150
get when your phone tells you that you

113
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:40,030
have new voicemail or for contribution

114
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:43,150
it can be an XML document encoded in

115
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:49,150
dense binary format called web binary

116
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:50,770
XML so this is an example of what a

117
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:54,219
client provision document could look

118
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:56,320
like in source text format so it has all

119
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:59,110
the settings highlighted on this slide

120
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:01,240
that's the display name access worth now

121
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:03,669
that's what the receiving user would see

122
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:07,510
also the network type that the settings

123
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:09,700
apply to and the proxy detail stats were

124
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:12,729
all heus mobile traffic is going to be

125
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:15,039
routed through the settings document can

126
00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:17,139
also include other vendor specific

127
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,060
extensions for example it can specify

128
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:22,389
email server or a directory

129
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:26,080
synchronization server to know where to

130
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:33,520
send his contacts and scheduled meetings

131
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:37,479
to or even browser home page so when the

132
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:40,299
settings document is transmitted it

133
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:43,270
takes form of these two PDUs because one

134
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:46,180
PDUs user data is limited to 140 bytes

135
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:48,969
so we have to chunk it you can say that

136
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:50,800
each apdu includes its own headers for

137
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:54,789
the first two layers and then the

138
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,080
session header is entirely inside the

139
00:06:54,789 --> 00:07:00,340
first video

140
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:03,490
and the bulk of the APD use is taken by

141
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:05,198
the yellow-colored payload so that's the

142
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:07,449
binary and not human readable

143
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:10,569
representation of the same XML document

144
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:14,110
but you can notice the proxy IP number

145
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:17,500
and port number as the plain text ASCII

146
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:20,009
strings it's basically the only detail

147
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:23,259
you can recognize in V binary format and

148
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:25,930
T of all that attacker needs to supply

149
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:28,990
his settings to your phone is to stream

150
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:35,949
this 125 bytes through a USB modem and

151
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:37,659
then it becomes a SMS message so far so

152
00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:41,530
good but what about security

153
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:44,110
how does SMS protocol ensures that only

154
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:46,119
your mobile network operator can

155
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:48,310
provision in your mobile phone but your

156
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,490
colleagues cannot play a prank on you in

157
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:55,689
this way so first of all let's take a

158
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:59,069
look at specification more and more

159
00:07:55,689 --> 00:08:02,550
important that Open Mobile Alliance

160
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:05,319
specification there is very little

161
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:08,080
intention to security importance the

162
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:10,659
security is defined to be optional as

163
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:14,080
you can see in the provision in context

164
00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:16,360
specification it contains the exact

165
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,180
sentence which we show here the

166
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,250
connectivity media may contain security

167
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:24,699
information so it's males not must shoot

168
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:26,740
okay and the second point and that if

169
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:29,319
security information is presented it

170
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:32,320
return lights on engine number of the

171
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:34,990
recipient the user must be used as a

172
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,630
network specified for it second what

173
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:40,659
what does it in the number and why if

174
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:43,448
it's not really good idea to use MV for

175
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:48,519
any identification we will show it in

176
00:08:43,448 --> 00:08:50,219
this talk so Antofagasta norm but when

177
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:53,649
present

178
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:57,040
it's a dealt with in the session level

179
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:59,760
header here you see it detected it

180
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:03,640
specifies the content type this one

181
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:06,459
allowing security checks after that the

182
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:09,449
second field here is a security method

183
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:13,810
and network pin which relies on in

184
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:17,849
other options such as user pin also

185
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:20,258
available and the last view is in this

186
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:23,620
session level header is message

187
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:26,319
identification code of payload you you

188
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:29,769
can see message notification code as hex

189
00:09:26,319 --> 00:09:32,649
ASCII string here actually message

190
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:39,370
identification code is just sha-1 hash

191
00:09:32,649 --> 00:09:44,380
off of in Z sort this data this means

192
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:46,449
that anyone who wants to generate a

193
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:50,350
message Shanta fication code from in z

194
00:09:46,449 --> 00:09:52,810
just need to use standard open ssl tool

195
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:59,680
or any other cryptographic libraries to

196
00:09:52,810 --> 00:10:02,319
do this as was mentioned international

197
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:06,910
mobile subscriber identity or simply in

198
00:10:02,319 --> 00:10:10,540
z number can could be used as key for

199
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:13,959
client provisioning and once we have

200
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:16,779
victims in Z we can impersonate a

201
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:20,319
genuine client provision message but

202
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:21,910
problem here is that in Z it's not

203
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:25,360
really confidential

204
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:29,800
it's like IP address and tcp/ip protocol

205
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:31,930
which is not public advertise it but it

206
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:35,639
need to divide the known for mobile

207
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:39,790
wrote in to work and there are a lot of

208
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:42,940
ways to to extract to finding the number

209
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:45,670
of the target mobile phone for example

210
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:48,459
any android mobile application can query

211
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:52,120
this in the number from the phone and

212
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:55,239
then transmitted to an attacker or any

213
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:59,980
employee of any mobile network operator

214
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:03,880
can disclose in the number or cheap fake

215
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:08,170
BTS based transmitting station can sniff

216
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:11,829
in the out of the air and at last each

217
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:16,029
one of you can can find it's in the

218
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:17,949
number just looking at it's on your SIM

219
00:11:16,029 --> 00:11:20,910
card for example in this picture you can

220
00:11:17,949 --> 00:11:22,209
see that Indian number was printed on

221
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:28,569
1818

222
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:31,118
SIM cards stealing into number with

223
00:11:28,569 --> 00:11:35,670
Android application doesn't require it

224
00:11:31,119 --> 00:11:38,589
something special Android provides

225
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:41,259
framework public functions

226
00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:44,139
actually it's get subscriber ID method

227
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:49,540
of a telephony manager which returns in

228
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:51,970
Z this method requires read phone state

229
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:55,389
Android permission but we have checked

230
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:59,350
our records and find that always in sort

231
00:11:55,389 --> 00:12:01,569
of all mobile applications released in

232
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:05,110
the last three years already have this

233
00:12:01,569 --> 00:12:05,949
permission and it would not raise any

234
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:09,759
suspicion

235
00:12:05,949 --> 00:12:13,929
anyone of you use Android phones

236
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:16,360
I sure to have a handful of it stalled

237
00:12:13,929 --> 00:12:18,970
mobile application we already have

238
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:24,759
access to you the number and can do

239
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:27,009
whatever they want with it so how

240
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:31,509
exactly do we perform this attack we

241
00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:33,670
have simple with the dongle and we need

242
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:36,189
this SIM card we just need to connect it

243
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:38,979
to our laptop or PC and we using a

244
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:42,189
simple Python script to put together the

245
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:47,079
message booth the message bits for us

246
00:12:42,189 --> 00:12:51,248
and let's sophisticated hackers can you

247
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:53,229
can use now SMS or any other freely

248
00:12:51,249 --> 00:12:55,360
available software tool in Internet and

249
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:59,259
for example in this screenshot you can

250
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:02,649
see that as screenshot of now SMS to all

251
00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:05,920
just you need to do it two fields to

252
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:08,439
fill several fields in a web interface

253
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,660
of of these two and to press send

254
00:13:08,439 --> 00:13:14,069
message button to send a provision into

255
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:19,799
any mobile phone in the world

256
00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:22,329
so how demand in our smartphone vendors

257
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:27,490
involved dating of client provisioning

258
00:13:22,329 --> 00:13:30,160
messages we discovered that Samsung took

259
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:36,010
it literally that authentification is

260
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:38,530
optional and any Samsung mobile phones

261
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:41,220
hopefully accept any client provision

262
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:45,569
and message without message out in

263
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:52,810
identification code who are LG and Sony

264
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:56,320
require the security information but do

265
00:13:52,810 --> 00:14:04,030
except in the signed client provisional

266
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:06,280
messages how far does the client

267
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:09,970
provisioning message take the attacker

268
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:12,069
if attacker through client provision and

269
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:16,240
message install on your mobile phone

270
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:18,310
it's a proxy he can perform in the

271
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,100
middle attack on all your cellular

272
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:23,170
traffic its mean attacker can simply

273
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:26,850
sniff all your network traffic to the

274
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:30,479
server which he controls and enters it

275
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:34,540
there are several vendor specific

276
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:38,650
extensions which allow to set settings

277
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:42,150
for email or directory server or browser

278
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:45,069
and so on and in this case attacker can

279
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:47,850
can steal your contacts and calendars

280
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:50,890
just by installing it server as

281
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:52,870
directory synchronization server attack

282
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:55,540
you can read your emails just by

283
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:58,420
installing its email server attacker can

284
00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:03,640
read you MMS and even change home page

285
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:08,949
in your browser so now it's time to show

286
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:11,140
some of this in practice and so as was

287
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:13,680
mentioned some song fool with the

288
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:16,530
specification which says that

289
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:20,550
identification is optional and some

290
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:23,079
Samsung Galaxy smartphones allows any

291
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:29,650
client provisioning message without any

292
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:33,610
identification and on on the upside the

293
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:37,209
implementation lists exact what settings

294
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:39,520
are going to be installed but what user

295
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:42,850
understand any of these technical

296
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:45,430
details would you parents know what an

297
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:48,040
IP and proxy IP is and what is the

298
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:49,280
values would normally be here so I think

299
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,650
that no

300
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:54,560
now we are going to show a simple demo

301
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:57,980
video where we sent a provisional

302
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:01,219
message from from my laptop and - to

303
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:03,500
Samsung s8 and earth direct in all

304
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:15,710
network traffic from the telephone to

305
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:18,200
our Amazon server right so in this video

306
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:20,750
you see the attackers computer desktop

307
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:23,510
on the left and the victims mobile phone

308
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,800
screen on the right so what the attacker

309
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:27,590
does is he runs the Python script

310
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:32,839
providing just the whole number of the

311
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:34,730
victim then he opens his favorite tool

312
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:38,270
for man in the middle attacks we used

313
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:41,690
with control panel that standard tool in

314
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:44,240
Linux distribution in the meantime the

315
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:46,820
victim has received the message he opens

316
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:50,600
to see what's inside he sees all the

317
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:54,170
details including the proxy IP of Amazon

318
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:56,990
web server install the settings and now

319
00:16:54,170 --> 00:17:02,360
he is going to open his browser and try

320
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:06,109
to go to MIT web page and when we see

321
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:07,970
his request in Arabic control panel we

322
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:10,750
would be able to redirect him to

323
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:10,750
something else instead

324
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:19,760
so we using social engineering tools and

325
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:22,640
that's pretty soft and we're going to

326
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:25,609
push him a fake facebook login page so

327
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:28,670
when he puts in his email and password

328
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:30,169
we're gonna intercept that basically

329
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:38,860
still his Facebook credentials

330
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:38,860
that's quite neat yeah there we have it

331
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:53,210
okay through this vendors huawei LG and

332
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:56,299
Sony and requires the client provision

333
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:59,179
and message to be authenticated

334
00:17:56,299 --> 00:18:02,839
and as we explained before the

335
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:06,229
authentication key is in Z as you can

336
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:09,009
see on these three screenshots none of

337
00:18:06,229 --> 00:18:13,779
these vendors provide any details about

338
00:18:09,009 --> 00:18:17,749
settings which been installed and so

339
00:18:13,779 --> 00:18:20,629
who's the message from what is going to

340
00:18:17,749 --> 00:18:22,489
be changed and why is there anything to

341
00:18:20,629 --> 00:18:25,998
worry about before you press install

342
00:18:22,489 --> 00:18:28,459
buttons so the answer is not another and

343
00:18:25,999 --> 00:18:34,719
now we are going to show second video

344
00:18:28,459 --> 00:18:38,959
the similar video is we attack an LG

345
00:18:34,719 --> 00:18:51,589
smartphone providing in Z which we still

346
00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:53,919
before this one right so the only major

347
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:56,418
difference here is that the attacker

348
00:18:53,919 --> 00:19:01,839
apostasy in the number as well as the

349
00:18:56,419 --> 00:19:04,549
phone number when he runs the attack and

350
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:06,200
opens the control panel same as before

351
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:07,668
now the victim received the message it

352
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:11,450
only has install button not even an

353
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:13,700
option to cancel when he's accepted the

354
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:15,979
settings here navigates to MIT website

355
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:18,709
same as before and this time we are

356
00:19:15,979 --> 00:19:24,769
going to mount a different kind of man

357
00:19:18,709 --> 00:19:32,659
the middle attack right we see his

358
00:19:24,769 --> 00:19:38,059
request although social engineering but

359
00:19:32,659 --> 00:19:42,529
now we push a fake Google Account login

360
00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:44,269
page so we he sees the login page and

361
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:45,709
suspecting the puts in his a username

362
00:19:44,269 --> 00:19:48,289
and password

363
00:19:45,709 --> 00:19:50,950
this time we are still in his gmail

364
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:50,950
credentials

365
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:12,409
so why why is the client provision and

366
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:14,870
the perfect fishing capac it can target

367
00:20:12,409 --> 00:20:17,960
any mobile phone starting from where

368
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:21,590
thief used and Android versions and even

369
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:24,590
pre Android phones and Open Mobile

370
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:27,678
Alliance specification provide no way to

371
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:30,939
verify the origin of the of the client

372
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:34,519
provision apart from in the

373
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:41,389
identification which tooks little time

374
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:45,679
to overcome an attacker doesn't need any

375
00:20:41,389 --> 00:20:50,139
software as any sophisticated software

376
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:54,440
or hardware to perform this attack and

377
00:20:50,139 --> 00:20:56,539
it can target any mobile phone or as

378
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,399
part of the large-scale phishing

379
00:20:56,539 --> 00:21:04,429
campaign or is a narrowly targeted

380
00:20:58,399 --> 00:21:06,320
attack finally the recipient of the

381
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:09,580
client provisioning has very little

382
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:13,100
visibility and control over the settings

383
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:15,470
which are going to be configured and and

384
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:20,869
would probably not understand the

385
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:25,159
implications to mitigate this attack

386
00:21:20,869 --> 00:21:27,470
vector we recommend the following just

387
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:30,259
for mobile and work at rates of truth

388
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:32,299
should just drop any client provision

389
00:21:30,259 --> 00:21:36,499
and messages from under eyes at parties

390
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:39,679
because because a regular regular mobile

391
00:21:36,499 --> 00:21:43,369
user never have a valid reason to send

392
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:46,309
client provision message and actually

393
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:49,009
it's this just only the effective

394
00:21:46,309 --> 00:21:51,759
mitigation and we were surprised that it

395
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:53,929
had not been implemented during the

396
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:57,220
decades that the client provision and

397
00:21:53,929 --> 00:22:01,119
protocol is in use there are a few more

398
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:04,990
possible mitigations but less effective

399
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:08,418
so for example the smartphone vendors

400
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:10,369
can discontinue support of client

401
00:22:08,419 --> 00:22:12,049
provision and protocol it should be

402
00:22:10,369 --> 00:22:13,850
noted that client provision protocol

403
00:22:12,049 --> 00:22:14,309
it's not a corrinoid feature you can

404
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:17,478
find

405
00:22:14,309 --> 00:22:21,779
in one new a source of Android is just a

406
00:22:17,479 --> 00:22:27,019
just vent or specific implementation so

407
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:29,879
it could be discontinued - and

408
00:22:27,019 --> 00:22:32,639
alternatively the smartphone vendors

409
00:22:29,879 --> 00:22:34,529
could improve user interface to give

410
00:22:32,639 --> 00:22:41,070
users more control and more visibility

411
00:22:34,529 --> 00:22:45,359
over all the installed settings and and

412
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:51,289
as well as educate them about possible

413
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:55,820
mitigations possible okay and finally

414
00:22:51,289 --> 00:22:59,219
finally Open Mobile Alliance should to

415
00:22:55,820 --> 00:23:02,428
revise this specification and device

416
00:22:59,219 --> 00:23:06,979
most secure protocol for for client

417
00:23:02,429 --> 00:23:11,719
provisioning which allows the

418
00:23:06,979 --> 00:23:17,789
purification of of the origin of the

419
00:23:11,719 --> 00:23:20,369
suggested settings we in in March we

420
00:23:17,789 --> 00:23:23,820
reported our findings to the vendors and

421
00:23:20,369 --> 00:23:27,928
to Open Mobile Alliance and Samsung and

422
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:32,939
LG reacted quickly and pitched these

423
00:23:27,929 --> 00:23:36,529
issues and this - to purchase you can

424
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:41,669
see here huawei ontology solution and

425
00:23:36,529 --> 00:23:46,859
are working on a fix for the UI for the

426
00:23:41,669 --> 00:23:49,710
new models of their phones Sony on the

427
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:52,678
contrary did not indulge this issue and

428
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:56,039
stated that their mobile phones

429
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:58,889
follow this specification by Open Mobile

430
00:23:56,039 --> 00:24:02,700
Alliance and still not convinced that

431
00:23:58,889 --> 00:24:07,199
there is a problem we should to be fixed

432
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:09,869
and Open Mobile Alliance itself open it

433
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:13,349
highly priority ticket for this issue

434
00:24:09,869 --> 00:24:17,369
but up the specification updating it's

435
00:24:13,349 --> 00:24:18,928
not to be expected in a short term so

436
00:24:17,369 --> 00:24:21,959
thank you for your attention this is

437
00:24:18,929 --> 00:24:25,999
details file coordinator of our contacts

438
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,999
and you are welcome these questions

439
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:36,040
[Applause]

440
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:38,260
so thank you can we proceed with the

441
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:47,860
question the question answers from the

442
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:51,190
audience so first of all thank st.

443
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:53,050
thanks for the talk second it feels to

444
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:55,030
me like this is a really issue for the

445
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:57,430
mobile operator and I was wondering if

446
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:59,830
you had tested this issue with with

447
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:01,330
different operators in Israel or

448
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:03,460
somewhere else in the world because I'm

449
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:07,120
wondering if some of them take actions

450
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:08,830
against it we only tested it with the to

451
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:17,199
Israel apparatus we didn't test it

452
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:22,000
abroad so are there plans to test it

453
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:32,890
abroad yes sir at some point any

454
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:36,300
volunteers as you can see really quickly

455
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:43,020
so it's it's problem in Asia as we know

456
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:43,020
so any more questions yeah redditor

457
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:51,129
thank you very much for this session so

458
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:55,090
my question is you mentioned all the

459
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:57,600
vendors from Android what I don't see

460
00:25:55,090 --> 00:26:00,879
here is the pixel phone from Google and

461
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,409
pixels actually outsource to they have

462
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,960
changed vendors I don't know whose the

463
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:07,300
latest so I'd like you to tell me

464
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:11,860
whether this has been patch or not patch

465
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:14,830
the other thing is about that IMSI so it

466
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:18,250
is very interesting that one can get

467
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:21,939
hold the entire was mobile phone number

468
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:26,020
quite easily because as long as you know

469
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:28,360
the IMSI you can enter it and generate

470
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:31,690
all the mobile phones if you want to

471
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:34,090
attack everybody or spam or whatever so

472
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:34,990
how does the mobile operator prevent

473
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:39,590
this from happening

474
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:41,570
thank you so for the first question

475
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:45,049
Google pixel just doesn't support this

476
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:47,809
protocol and as we mentioned early it's

477
00:26:45,049 --> 00:26:50,120
a vendor extension that some of the

478
00:26:47,809 --> 00:26:51,918
vendors chose to implement that some

479
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:55,070
others chose not to implement so for

480
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:57,080
example Apple is not a good member of oh

481
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:59,330
ma and never has been and they are doing

482
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:03,710
all their own protocols and not relying

483
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:07,399
on any of these protocols and for the

484
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:12,669
second part yes in the same manner as

485
00:27:07,399 --> 00:27:15,860
you can spam the entire internet just by

486
00:27:12,669 --> 00:27:18,019
picking random IP numbers in a very

487
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:20,570
similar manner you can spam this all

488
00:27:18,019 --> 00:27:23,090
phones in the world like there is no way

489
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:25,580
to prevent this bit because when network

490
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:27,470
operator sees an incoming message it has

491
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:32,480
no way to validate whether it's coming

492
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:34,639
from a good person or an attacker okay I

493
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:38,210
think there's one gentleman there red

494
00:27:34,639 --> 00:27:39,740
shirt yeah um so you guys what hardware

495
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:41,119
did you use to test out these attacks

496
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:42,740
and where can you get this hardware I

497
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:44,360
thought it was like a $10 dongle

498
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:48,110
something yeah

499
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:51,639
so you can just order it online I think

500
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:51,639
we just bought it in a corner shop

501
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:57,669
thanks any more questions from the floor

502
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:02,509
if not maybe we can go to the first

503
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:04,700
question on the the most upload or there

504
00:28:02,509 --> 00:28:07,759
to with the highest number of votes

505
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:09,649
maybe can answer both of them how do you

506
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:11,330
sniff inject SMS about connection

507
00:28:09,649 --> 00:28:16,090
packets if you want to do sexual

508
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:18,259
resolution we just wrote a simple

509
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:21,049
application that subscribes to all the

510
00:28:18,259 --> 00:28:26,029
incoming packets basically dumps it into

511
00:28:21,049 --> 00:28:27,619
a log cat so yeah all you need is a

512
00:28:26,029 --> 00:28:31,610
debugging connection to your Android

513
00:28:27,619 --> 00:28:34,879
phone and the next one

514
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:35,979
will you make Python script availa no we

515
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:39,969
will not

516
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:43,309
we're at a defense company and we're not

517
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:45,259
encouraging such attacks okay

518
00:28:43,309 --> 00:28:48,040
maybe you can ask answer the third one

519
00:28:45,259 --> 00:28:54,800
as well then I have a question if sure

520
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:58,159
forensic record of worthy it probably

521
00:28:54,800 --> 00:29:00,139
would have these source numbers stored

522
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:02,930
somewhere but we have no idea how to

523
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:06,580
extract it like that the phone itself

524
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:12,280
doesn't show their origin number at all

525
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:15,230
like if it writes some Logs with the a

526
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:17,090
dump of the incoming message such as I

527
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:18,890
already bug application then it would be

528
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:22,879
possible if it doesn't write such logs

529
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:27,950
that no okay

530
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:30,200
yes so sorry think I mean light I had to

531
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:31,850
pack the packages I lost your talk no

532
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:35,690
but I know the topic and have a question

533
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:38,810
yes ah me and my wife we do security we

534
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:41,300
fight the bad guys and governments we we

535
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:42,800
keep on to receive oti a table I mean

536
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:45,770
everything that you explain it at thank

537
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:48,010
you on two phones on which we used to

538
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:51,379
have installed at our personals in cars

539
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:54,080
but it's remove it and even when it's in

540
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:56,180
airplane mode but it's obviously

541
00:29:54,080 --> 00:30:03,470
connected to Wi-Fi what's your

542
00:29:56,180 --> 00:30:09,470
explanation of this who is trying to

543
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:11,180
kick our essence all like we can try to

544
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:13,460
see but yeah it's probably not nothing

545
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:15,350
to do with this attack because it has

546
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:20,510
nothing to do with Wi-Fi it's all about

547
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:22,100
the mobile internet let's talk more

548
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:25,460
about this because I'm not so on the

549
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:26,449
person sure sure of your okay that's are

550
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:29,840
you going to leave it you're staying

551
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:31,460
first things ok knock you later thank

552
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,899
you alright yeah I have a similar

553
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:34,640
question of this gentleman I have two

554
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,900
questions now so basically my

555
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,150
understanding that this is all about

556
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:40,880
cellular this a cellular base so it's

557
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:43,820
about youth hijacking SMS which you

558
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:46,070
don't have in Wi-Fi right so my question

559
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:48,590
then is that's K if that's true what I

560
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:50,419
just said if that my understanding is

561
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:56,750
correct then my question is how do you

562
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:59,960
see this continuing in 5g networks the

563
00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:01,520
protocols don't change yeah because I in

564
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,530
this four layers that which you

565
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:06,429
on one of the earlier slides is only the

566
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:09,800
better layer which depends on the actual

567
00:31:06,429 --> 00:31:12,160
wireless technology but all the upper

568
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:15,919
level protocols are remain unchanged

569
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:18,679
this is for example with the reason why

570
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:20,240
this hack attacks though all phones

571
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:23,420
starting from the old Nokia smartphones

572
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:25,940
yes so I can understand this working

573
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:27,980
where you use SMS for configuration

574
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:29,840
settings right so question then is are

575
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:32,120
you aware of different ways to do

576
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,919
configuration settings in 4G and 5g

577
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:37,489
networks which would bypass this use of

578
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:41,090
SMS and therefore not have this issue of

579
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:43,190
development okay great and I think I

580
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:45,740
also I actually like that next question

581
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:48,429
does a mobile device management help

582
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:52,730
mitigate this vulnerability

583
00:31:48,429 --> 00:31:55,700
no actually it's enough so as we

584
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:58,640
explained there are several possible

585
00:31:55,700 --> 00:32:01,130
attacks here in the middle and stealing

586
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:05,150
emails still in CHEM ms and and so on

587
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:08,840
and minun minun in the middle of course

588
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:11,929
so it's enough that in any MGM in any

589
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:17,059
other application is enough to send for

590
00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:21,290
example a request to to his server and

591
00:32:17,059 --> 00:32:23,870
check IP of received connection so it's

592
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:27,050
there is a simple way to understand that

593
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:30,439
there is proxy proxy server so in this

594
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:32,480
way you get MDM it's possible it's

595
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:34,730
simple to understand that there are uses

596
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:38,530
movement in the middle okay for several

597
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:42,920
network but what about emails and and

598
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:45,260
ant MMS and so on yes it's it's possible

599
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:47,900
but it's too difficult I think because

600
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:51,350
in this case you need you need to

601
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:55,220
analyze traffic but if you if you simple

602
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:58,010
application on on an Android phone

603
00:32:55,220 --> 00:33:01,550
you haven't accessed to traffic in case

604
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:04,340
of MDM if you open into your oven VPN as

605
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:06,710
in this case maybe you need to just

606
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:09,620
through parse all traffic and understand

607
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:13,360
IMAP protocol for example for will pop

608
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:15,549
up three year on SMTP to understand the

609
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:19,270
some proxy so it's possible that's too

610
00:33:15,549 --> 00:33:21,250
difficult thank you before I go back to

611
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:22,679
the questions on slide or any other

612
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:26,220
questions from the floor

613
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:26,220
any more questions

614
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:42,400
any other questions from the floor no

615
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:44,559
would you like to answer the next

616
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:47,350
uploaded question what is the cost

617
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:49,570
involved in executing the attack sending

618
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:52,149
the client provision into one phone you

619
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:54,909
pay for two SMS messages so that's

620
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:58,179
essentially zero if you're on unlimited

621
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:59,860
SMS that plan less we are like if you're

622
00:33:58,179 --> 00:34:02,110
going to spam a thousand phones then you

623
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:06,189
probably would need a a more expensive

624
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:08,290
per plan but yes it's basically that the

625
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:11,770
cost of SMS message itself so it's

626
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:13,869
really dangerous it's any children can

627
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:16,300
send a lot of message to your mobile

628
00:34:13,869 --> 00:34:19,359
phone and I'm sure that you will press

629
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:21,609
install because it's a regular message

630
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:25,418
and sometimes you have a you haven't

631
00:34:21,609 --> 00:34:28,810
canceled button at all okay any

632
00:34:25,418 --> 00:34:32,679
questions from the floor all right

633
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:34,690
if not then actually I wanted to check

634
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:38,050
with the gentleman at the back do we

635
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:42,359
have the name of the the highest voted

636
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:42,359
question up voted question I I didn't

637
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:52,300
remember that one oh they're gone or

638
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:53,888
maybe gentlemen can you choose your

639
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:56,379
favorite question from the audience

640
00:34:53,889 --> 00:35:02,560
oh yes this one the the one with five

641
00:34:56,379 --> 00:35:07,450
votes KH who is KH yes here you go okay

642
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:09,520
um and okay the next one is anonymous so

643
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:14,200
so gentleman would you like to pick your

644
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:15,910
favorite questions from the audience our

645
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:22,419
favorite was via to questions from the

646
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:28,160
lady in the back yeah thank you okay

647
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:30,470
yeah all right

648
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:32,240
I think if well we still have quite a

649
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:34,609
bit of time your well that you want to

650
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:37,339
answer one more two more questions I'll

651
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:40,790
call it morals yeah so the requirements

652
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:43,090
of your input you would still need user

653
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:46,029
input but we know that many malware

654
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:48,140
applications receive the accessibility

655
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:50,570
permissions which allow them to simulate

656
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:54,500
user input so then for example such an

657
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:57,100
application can forge client revision

658
00:35:54,500 --> 00:36:00,910
message to the phone itself and this way

659
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:03,110
hijack all the users traffic so

660
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:05,720
basically it would slow NIT user input

661
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:08,000
but it can be simulated user input okay

662
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:09,620
all right with that I would like to

663
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,420
thank you for your presentation and for

664
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:12,500
answering the questions ladies and
