hello everybody my name is Tom Benson

2
00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:28,880
sighs my last name today I will talk

3
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:34,089
about tickles major a major taggers

4
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:37,180
catalyst malware to stand conditions

5
00:00:34,089 --> 00:00:40,670
decreased red act that has been

6
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:43,940
affecting cooperation and organization

7
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:46,180
in Korea and Japan for more than ten

8
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,180
years

9
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:53,869
firstly I would like to talk to you

10
00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:57,559
about the straight actors that are

11
00:00:53,869 --> 00:01:00,110
mainly active in Korea many unknowns red

12
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:02,269
actors have continued to attack Korea

13
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:05,360
since 2008

14
00:01:02,269 --> 00:01:08,630
this is an overview of the threat actors

15
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:12,049
currently active and has a specific

16
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:14,899
effect August 3rd it does not include

17
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:18,320
those involved in land somewhere online

18
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:22,130
games two rows into a banking store and

19
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:26,809
coin - of course there are odd groups

20
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:29,270
that have not been crisp added and I am

21
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:32,359
praying to you as the grooves to hear if

22
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:35,240
there are more discovered ative some

23
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:38,298
straight actors are attacking Japan as

24
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:44,568
well as Korea and I will talk I will

25
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:45,469
talk about tickles in 2016 a semantic

26
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:48,950
post

27
00:01:45,469 --> 00:01:52,759
disclosed 30 ghosts followed by many are

28
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:55,520
the secret companies policy-relevant

29
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:58,999
analyst on the groups to labelled

30
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:03,170
additional information even be pro being

31
00:01:58,999 --> 00:02:05,929
identified as key groups in 2016 they

32
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:10,340
were mentioned by some security

33
00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:14,620
companies Delta groovy is also known as

34
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:18,590
France but Ron Paul denied and their

35
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:21,610
their main targets were organization and

36
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:25,040
cooperation in Korea in Japan in other

37
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:28,319
analysts reports most of their activity

38
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:32,159
were focused it on around Japan

39
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:38,369
so I began to wonder water damage deaf

40
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:40,769
coaches to South Korea I was tracking

41
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:44,099
down the related malware in this group

42
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:46,950
and I discovered that their attacks

43
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:51,599
against Korean organizations have been

44
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:54,298
ongoing since 20 protein mobile the

45
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:58,399
malware appearance used by this group

46
00:02:54,299 --> 00:03:01,500
has been founded in Korean since 2000 a

47
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:05,129
there are main targets were the Korean

48
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:09,569
defense industry national security and

49
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:12,018
political organizations it also includes

50
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:16,138
cooperation in the field of a nose

51
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:21,719
electronic secret web hosting IT

52
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:24,090
services and more without a doubt they

53
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:28,319
is spending their target across the

54
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:32,010
region this grooves made attack back to

55
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:34,138
include spear piercing watering holes us

56
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:37,590
three strikes vulnerability and the

57
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:41,220
asset management claim in Korea there

58
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:44,430
was kissed urban impacted cutie pie

59
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:48,090
being spread throughout us fresh drive

60
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:50,819
while in Japan it was spread by using

61
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:53,939
our own abilities in an asset management

62
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:58,129
program according to your audit report

63
00:03:53,939 --> 00:04:02,280
they also used our known vulnerabilities

64
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:05,429
this group has several characteristics

65
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:08,970
since their main targets are Korea and

66
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:13,079
Japan they carry out customized at

67
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:16,289
export these regions the attack OpenEdge

68
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:18,900
tossed and used the domain right before

69
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:20,219
the attack rather than just hacking the

70
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:23,698
exists servers

71
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:26,430
I discovered several malware generators

72
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:30,180
and I will share some of my point with

73
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:33,060
you possibly the attack seems to be

74
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:35,250
familiar with the Adelphi language since

75
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:39,120
the majority of Marvel was later in

76
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:42,150
their pie the attack also added some

77
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,780
garbage code to disrupt the areas

78
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:49,919
emesis the attack attempt to bypass the

79
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:53,669
64m by creating a pile less than 15

80
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:56,010
megabyte on the user system because some

81
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:59,820
security programs do not correct PI's to

82
00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:03,000
reduce trans lastly they used with large

83
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:09,030
console branched was mainly used to

84
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:11,190
leaked internal information here are

85
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:18,929
some of the major advanced cases in

86
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:21,930
Korea that I discovered and 2019 even a

87
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:24,890
pest against the web hosting or item

88
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:27,930
service companies who are made is

89
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:33,810
impossible sobriety wants to a supply

90
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:36,290
chain attack this group is known to have

91
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:38,990
used various malware put their

92
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:41,820
activities over the rest of ten years

93
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:44,730
some Mario is no longer used and

94
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:51,599
sometimes a combination of malware was

95
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:54,420
used for attacks drug Actos generally

96
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:57,180
used malware products sometimes they

97
00:05:54,420 --> 00:06:00,810
would create a new malware but most of

98
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:03,690
it used exist source code by multiples

99
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:06,660
multiplying or dividing the sub code to

100
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:09,780
create appearance although they can also

101
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:12,690
create malware quite easily with real

102
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:15,780
generated tools this is not the case for

103
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:19,670
most attacks the developer of this

104
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:22,679
malware are also human the beings cell

105
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:25,590
they cannot create a new Mario for every

106
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:28,230
attacks a security component previously

107
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:31,169
disclosed some of the burial generated

108
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:33,870
used by the tickler why tracking the T

109
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:36,840
crossed I also discovered some new

110
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:41,540
malware generated step the tick groups

111
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:44,510
may have used during effects or testing

112
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:47,490
yeah Empress Empress is a tool that

113
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:49,700
multiplies the PDF part to insert

114
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:52,670
malicious code

115
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:55,099
yeah it was littering littering in

116
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:59,240
Chinese and I don't know the Chinese

117
00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:03,460
character stand this bro used in 2011's

118
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:06,350
and Ariane integralists attacks and iPod

119
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:10,330
Touch app yeah it seems to be a

120
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:13,310
prototype used during the diss attack

121
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:15,740
and this controller used the control

122
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:18,590
mario during attacks have also been

123
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:22,250
discovered this controller can create

124
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:25,250
and control net boy nepo is battle

125
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:30,560
written in Delhi language and has been

126
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:36,560
detected from 2008 to 2017 the menu of

127
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:39,590
this era controller is in Chinese this

128
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:44,060
is control of the only version of SX mm

129
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:47,810
there was pound in 2014 this controller

130
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:51,350
pyla was cost and it's manuals in

131
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:54,070
English ghost is your Chinese pepto and

132
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:56,660
each source code has been disclosed it

133
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:59,210
was it wasted on the ghost wrestle

134
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:01,340
school looking at the rest of the

135
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:07,340
malware generators it seems very likely

136
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:11,210
that it was empiricist by ghost well the

137
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:13,940
shadow which was correct in 2015 is

138
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:17,570
similar to the existing SX and main

139
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:21,530
controller the attack seems to like net

140
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:27,170
our shadow under Mario generators in to

141
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:30,080
include C's net or shadow the object

142
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:32,570
used stagger appears to encrypt and save

143
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,130
the address Pro downloading path in the

144
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:36,530
imaging PI's

145
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:40,220
this tool creates to increase the image

146
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:43,959
which was also introduced by erotic the

147
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,960
company in 2015

148
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:51,050
yeah SS mm to build on which was correct

149
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:55,310
the end 2015 generated on SS m

150
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:58,370
embarrassed and can settle suspect

151
00:08:55,310 --> 00:09:02,569
active time for the credit appearance it

152
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:06,210
set the time from

153
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:10,440
prompter yeah and the object seems

154
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:12,540
called this pram shadow rock as well the

155
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,960
name of the generator also contains the

156
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:19,500
world shadow frisky but not that of this

157
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:21,750
Mario and UI because his name and usual

158
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:27,450
interfaces are similar to that of the

159
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:30,750
artifact or generator this is a settle

160
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:32,670
down which created the download this

161
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:36,560
generate created the malware used by

162
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:36,560
used to read access mmm

163
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:44,010
according to the program implementer of

164
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:50,849
analyst control around in 2017 it was

165
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:53,220
based on ghost 3.6 purest version of the

166
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:57,420
necros control have been discovered and

167
00:09:53,220 --> 00:10:06,240
some of them as post password when being

168
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:08,969
is cute kid yeah Stage one although I

169
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:12,089

176
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:37,920
known as dropper however some of expires

179
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:51,569
use download for example P so down is

download a Japanese analysts who had

185
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:06,089
been sharing tea cruised related the

186
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:09,779
information with me was surprised to

187
00:11:06,089 --> 00:11:12,660
find Tonto group using our busines tyst

ghost rat was detected from February

191
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:26,220
2013 to February 2018 it's made strange

192
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:30,430
such as API addressed and Cincy

the app is key this sensible address was

195
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:43,510
used by this download as well as other

there are CNC service

199
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:58,510
it is usually created one month before

200
00:11:50,470 --> 00:12:01,240
the attack ago parole is download this

201
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:05,500
malware has not been reported in Korea

202
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:08,890
in our system only the relevant bearers

203
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:13,030
in Japan have been reported to be

204
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:15,760
effective thus is possible that the

205
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:22,420
attack only distributed this barrier in

206
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:26,710
Japan and some barons have digital

207

signature is huido electronic technology

208
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:36,370
but no company exists by the name so I

209
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:39,360
found the some prize digitally signed by

210
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:44,050
this company and I found additional

211

00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:10,630
usually around 30 or the protocol bytes

217
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:15,190
but some parents are wrong Adel 100

218
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:18,550
provide the attack wrote this Mario in C

219

225
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:41,230
excuse disgusting this malware include

226
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:44,170
is fraudulent informations in the body

227
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:49,839
and it has encrypted the sense

information at the end of the PI the

229
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:58,329
origin of Napoleon form of DLL was

230
00:13:52,990 --> 00:14:02,640
discovered in Korea in 2000 a but it has

231
00:13:58,329 --> 00:14:05,380
been frequently detected since 2010

232
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:08,079
several variants exist what their

233
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:12,970
attacks targets have not been identified

234
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:16,589
but in Korea it was used to attract

235
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:21,100
mates enterprise and depends industry in

236
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:23,890
2015 this Mario is written in their

237
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:26,709
parallel to and its main string is

238
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:29,980
actual encrypted with the system key

239
00:14:26,709 --> 00:14:34,029
they are all spirit with odd key value

240
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:36,940
this Mario has functions including key

241
00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:40,209
logging screen capture process list view

242
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:44,350
and Prem institution there was a change

243
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:48,849
in the code end 2012 and the garbage

244
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:52,060
value was added to their in 2013 to make

245
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:59,350
a difficulty to decompile the code we

246
00:14:52,060 --> 00:15:03,390
asked idea x-ray an access Emily is

247
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:07,269
first discovered in 2015 and has been

248
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:10,839
actively used since 26 p.m. it's called

249
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:13,959
exist mmm because its initial version

250
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:15,760
includes the exams exist mmm string in

251
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:20,010
the PDB list but

252
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:24,850
PDB has not been since December 2015

253
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:28,180
January it consists of the drop Lord and

254
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:30,370
pectoral it's complicated we using the

255
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:34,630
encrypted key or to become an activity

256
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:37,630
only at specific times since 2017 the

exist among parents has and it is that

258
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:42,220
Gabi's value at the end of the past when

259
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:44,530
creating the part

260
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:49,750
to create the appearance we do last a

more than 50 megabyte once access mmm is

262
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:57,310
is QT it the system checked a proportion

263
00:15:52,780 --> 00:16:00,250
is 32-bit or 64-bit to create the drop

264
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:03,040
based on the exact version this drop

265
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:08,620
edited the canvas data and at the end of

266
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:11,079
the part 2 and part critical law loaded

267

00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:17,500
megabyte the rod includes the encrypted

269
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:19,540
a test their loader increased the

270
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:23,200
critical malicious code from the

271
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:29,560
encrypted data and it is cute malicious

272
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:33,390
code in the memory data was first

273
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:34,569
described in 2015 and is still being

274
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:38,590
detected

275
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:42,880
to this day this Mario was written in

276
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:45,910
their PI again and it validated in Korea

277
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:51,990
and Japan here I was called to disrupt

278
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:51,990
LSD analysis or embedded end this parent

279
00:16:52,080 --> 00:17:00,630
some of the impacted system are bound to

280
00:16:55,420 --> 00:17:04,740
how kilowatts there are many kilowatts

281
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:08,290
the USB is under the unusual malware

282
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:10,720
different from the perverse factors this

283
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:13,000
Mario leaked the information saved

284
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,959
within the u.s. depressed right and

00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:26,770
April 2015 to November 2017 it is

288
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:30,760
unknown well there are no wrong active

289
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:34,960
or simply not detectable the Mario was

290
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:39,280
postponed in 2015 but each area version

291
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:45,720
might have been active since 2012

some barrels can multiply the years pass

294
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:55,090

297
00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:04,630
downloads of odd malware this Mario was

298
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:09,600
posted is crossed by Palo Alto Networks

299
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:12,850
in last year what's interesting is that

300
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:16,209
when an impacted system is connected to

301
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:18,909
the specific Korean sicker us fresh dry

302
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:21,790
it brings you a certain code from the

303
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:25,300
specific area within the Korean secure

304
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:28,240
us depress drive on front way the

305
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:33,450
securest first stripe because it is no

306
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:36,309
longer used just it cannot be obtained

307
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:40,260
while call did the effect put into the

308
00:18:36,309 --> 00:18:43,629
u.s. depressed secure USB flash drive

309
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:46,090
what stage did three attack inject the

310
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:49,270
code is there are not matter where they

311
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:52,000
inject malicious code during the three

312
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:55,389
productions of the secure us fresh drive

313
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:59,050
or into a specific area of sick of us we

314
00:18:55,390 --> 00:19:02,500
prescribe this question will remain in

315
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:06,700
mystery after reading this bro I pissed

316
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:08,770
Japan in October last year and I had the

317
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:12,250
opportunity to talk to you mister Hadj

318
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:15,309
about the tech growth since this blog

319
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:17,920
was postulated I have made additional

320
00:19:15,309 --> 00:19:21,550
point in on relevant barrier and

321
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:23,980
variants I concluded that the malware is

322
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:27,760
caused by a parallel to was initial

323
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:30,640
version particular at the USB and it is

324
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:37,690
highly possible that it might have been

325
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:43,570
active before September 2012 this is the

326
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:46,420
flow chart of the USB as stage 1 if the

327
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:49,809
user is skewed to download it downloads

328
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:52,990
and learned by real parts there are two

329
00:19:49,809 --> 00:19:56,740
method of rolling the malicious DLL file

330
00:19:52,990 --> 00:20:01,480
the first method is being in suitably

331
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:04,450
the esv pass by disguise as disguising

332
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:08,169
as the recoil DLL file all the mess to

333
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:09,610
do is by patching the est file that uses

334
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:12,070
in the system to

335
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:16,540
the malicious DLL when the prime is

336
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:21,549
running this is post first and this the

337
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:28,059
second master on the rope I used

338
00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:32,280
perpetual pal is I app app dot exe stage

339
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:36,428
two one stick USB is loaded and executed

340
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:37,270
fears the asleep I drove it all of this

341
00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:40,480
method

342
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:43,330
it created our log pass and downloads

343
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:46,390
the additional parts the malicious DLL

344
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:49,720
file check well the US fresh stripe is

345
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:52,679
committed to the system if the u.s.

346
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:56,049
first drive is connected if dancetube

347
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:59,190
Mario in the prompt of the x-pyr some

348
00:20:56,049 --> 00:21:02,230
barons do not have a separate es upon

349
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:05,799
the inspire create the rogue pants again

350
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:09,280
and corrected listo pass several in the

351
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:12,280
u.s. restroom some barriers multiplied

352
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:17,230
the ESD pile in the following parts

353
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:17,799
exist in the u.s. press drive straight

354
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:22,780
three

355
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:25,570
it's a multiplied is fine the good parts

356
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:29,020
every in the us first write exactly the

357
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:32,500
download once the yes pile is multiplied

358
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:35,410
the end is suited by tomorrow since it

359
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:38,919
injector specific is q2 pile when

360
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:43,059
multiplying the pi any type of Mario can

361
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:45,880
be injected additional the merrier patch

362
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:49,830
were not specific Korean and force is

363
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,830
good to a part is detective

364
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:02,460
leaves behind programs that help with

365
00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:06,450
the transport to other systems till the

366
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:10,680
attackers is installed secret prime are

367
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:13,490
quiet annoying that's because those

368
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:16,830
plants can detect and remove the malware

369
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:20,340
for this reason the attack produced a

370
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:23,699
plan to attack and is the app disabled a

371
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:27,240
secret program and generate is driver

372
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:30,690
pass that attacks that why do you use

373
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:32,960
the Korean antipas program such as

374
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:35,540
Annette and Howie

375
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:41,850
there are Korean local and foreign

376
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:44,820
companies though Esther p70 Polly is the

377
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:48,899
tools discovered from the system

378
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:50,129
impacted by TQ SP the picture of the

379
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:53,280
disk of the pile

380
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:56,520
disguised is that as name of a Hong Kong

381
00:22:53,280 --> 00:23:00,060
Hangul word processed by there is wild

382
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:08,370
used in Korea however it is a tool that

383
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:10,530
causes the app spoopy until 2013 WC has

384
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:13,919
been used to still credential

385
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:16,410
information some parts were digitally

386
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:20,550
signed video had WIDA electronic

387
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:24,890
credential used in the download however

388
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:29,909
the attack no wrong used WCE because

389
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:32,820
mimic us up 20 ppm the attack use mimic

390
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:38,010
us to steal credential information the

391
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:41,580
attack uses me me to be three and we

392
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:44,520
started to as your pylons April mimic us

393
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:48,689
video certain such a name is detected it

394
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:55,830
can be considered as the sine of T ghost

395
00:23:48,690 --> 00:24:00,230
attack this is a program for network for

396
00:23:55,830 --> 00:24:07,040
amazement it was first discovered in

397
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:09,680
2018 for 32-bit and 64-bit version exist

398
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:12,170
it has not been in community yet whether

399
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:13,730
it is a self-made program autumn but

400
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:20,840
appointed for John or what program

401
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:23,870
released on the Internet the word

402
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:26,800
posting that come to my mind when

403
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:30,919
leading the auto secretly such as

404
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:34,220
limited regarding these groups was why

405
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:37,640
is this malware pointed to this group

406
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:42,500
I've found the pure interesting fact

407
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:45,250
while analyzed or related malware with

408
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:48,440
different code for each malware it's

409
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:52,100
difficult to determine is similarities

410
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:55,490
with just a code however some of them

411
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:58,639
use the same encoding method although it

412
00:24:55,490 --> 00:25:02,510
is not safe to say that the Mario is

413
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:05,990
from the same group just because it uses

414
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:08,500
the same encoding method considering the

415
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:13,430
other factors it is fair to say that

416
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:16,220
they are in the same group there is some

417
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:19,280
evidence that this Mario is little to

418
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:22,520
the crew the attacker is using a similar

419
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:25,550
bill dust and controller programs the

420
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:29,540
name of these frames include shadow net

421
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:32,379
with their similar use interfaces some

422
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:37,629
download and tools contains signature

423
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:41,120
become companies that do not exist

424
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:43,510
similar problem are used as well the

425
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:46,310
name of the mimikar pilot is similar and

426
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:50,270
the name of killer occupants are also

427
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:53,000
similar or the same there have been a

428
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:55,220
number of cases that have been pawned

429
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,230
together with several previously

430
00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:01,010
mentioned but we're on the impacted

431
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:03,620
systems it may just be a coincidence but

432
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:08,379
it's hard to say it is too well little

433
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:08,379
Mario is found on multiple systems

434
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:16,159
sometimes different type on bar where

435
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:19,280
our quantity is the same c2

436
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:22,220
in some cases the malware used by tick

437
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:24,980
group is counted those though through

438
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:27,950
the same CNC were linked to two other

439
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:31,190
come campaigns this is the most mystery

440
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:33,620
part some analysts believe they're

441
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:41,270
different groups use this infrastructure

442
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:43,729
together the attack pre-registered the

443
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:50,090
domain regarding the old C&C server Dell

444
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:53,810
will be used for the attack okay

445
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:56,840
conclusion I made the song we are loose

446
00:26:53,810 --> 00:27:00,379
and I hope that we can discover the

447
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:05,090
undetected virus using this yearõs and

448
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:08,330
the group is shred act that have been

449
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:12,679
has been active in Korea and Japan pull

450
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:15,830
past 10 years it seems like they are

451
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:17,720
still at here however a few questions

452
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:22,070
remain unanswered

453
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:23,960
well they are the same group it might be

454
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:27,379
possible there are various builders

455
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:31,310
exist and those who have also such

456
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:34,370
builders could use this malware perhaps

457
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:37,909
these builders are used in poverty I

458
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:40,580
loved anyone to create malware our

459
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:43,730
question is still associated with the

460
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:46,850
artist red actress server they've been

461
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:50,210
provided as a different red actors but

462
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:53,980
it seems like the malware in that group

463
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:58,000
is used for sharing some common

464
00:27:53,980 --> 00:28:01,610
infrastructures such as CNC

465
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,280
last three are we talking of I'll talk

466
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:07,340
about collaborations

467
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:10,310
why tracking this malware I have like

468
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:12,889
the previous reports and rights related

469
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:16,010
to samples and corroborated with

470
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:19,250
Japanese and Taiwanese analysts to ask

471
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:22,620
the question I was able to discover

472
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:24,809
additional if malware through though

473
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:28,229
or some reproach that other health

474
00:28:24,809 --> 00:28:31,260
published it I seriously hope to

475
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:36,809
maintain our collaborative relationships

476
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:39,840
and at the same time I hope my analysis

477
00:28:36,809 --> 00:28:43,770
analysis slip rod can be of the help to

478
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:51,030
those who try and stall it this group as

479
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:54,570
well and is my email address and is my

480
00:28:51,030 --> 00:29:01,850
Twitter's and if you have any questions

481
00:28:54,570 --> 00:29:01,850
please contact my address hell thank you
