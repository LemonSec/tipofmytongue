1
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:09,670
surprise so you probably weren't

2
00:00:06,819 --> 00:00:11,080
expecting this talk neither was i but

3
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:13,269
we're gonna do our best how much time do

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:16,329
I have by the way is this is this timer

5
00:00:13,269 --> 00:00:17,740
accurate you have until 4:00 I don't

6
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:21,250
know what that means in terms of this

7
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:23,349
clock so 55 minutes all right

8
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:27,790
perhaps I'd suggest leave a little bit

9
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:30,010
time for Q&A right okay right on so I

10
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:32,769
had told Dylan that I would be happy to

11
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:34,329
come to this conference and I joked with

12
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,699
him that in case the speaker doesn't

13
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:38,109
show up I have one in my bag this is the

14
00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:41,099
one in my bag okay

15
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:43,480
so if you haven't met me before either

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,449
coincidentally or online this is kind of

17
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,248
a word cloud of my most popular things I

18
00:00:46,449 --> 00:00:51,550
tweet about so things I find very

19
00:00:48,249 --> 00:00:53,249
important including tonight's karaoke I

20
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:56,468
hope there will be people who join me

21
00:00:53,249 --> 00:00:58,780
but I am the founder and CEO of luta

22
00:00:56,469 --> 00:01:00,309
security we do work with governments

23
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,429
large organizations in helping them

24
00:01:00,309 --> 00:01:05,950
prepare for vulnerability disclosure

25
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:08,560
processes and sometimes bug bounties but

26
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:11,439
that's typically not our main focus we

27
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,259
really focus on getting people ready in

28
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,939
terms of how are they going to decide

29
00:01:14,259 --> 00:01:17,110
which bugs are the most important how

30
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:19,600
are they going to eliminate as much

31
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:21,610
low-hanging fruit themselves as possible

32
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,559
and how are they going to if they do

33
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:26,409
choose to do a bounty avoid common

34
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,909
pitfalls perverse incentives and all

35
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:31,930
kinds of bad things that can happen to

36
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:34,750
you so how do we get here this is on the

37
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:36,399
on that side with all the military folks

38
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:38,439
that's probably my favorite picture of

39
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:40,570
myself at work it's how I explain to my

40
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:42,788
family what I do for a living I don't

41
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:45,158
know if you can see me in that one yeah

42
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:47,679
anyway the one on the right was me

43
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:50,200
testifying before US Congress last year

44
00:01:47,679 --> 00:01:52,060
on the uber data breach does anybody

45
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:55,299
remember 57 million records were

46
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:57,280
downloaded and then they got paid an

47
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:59,890
extortion fee through their bug bounty

48
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,200
platform and I testified as an expert on

49
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:04,960
bug bounties on what they are what they

50
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:07,030
are not and on the marketplace that we

51
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,508
are creating by creating more and more

52
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:13,060
of these incentives so how did we get

53
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:15,510
here in general I've been hacking since

54
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:18,269
I was a teenager in the late 80s yep do

55
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:21,450
that math in your heads okay we're here

56
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:23,310
together now this is uh this is what I

57
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:27,569
call my midlife crisis hair so just

58
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:31,470
enjoy this when I started hacking in the

59
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:35,940
late 80s early 90s there were very few

60
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:37,920
new anti hacking laws we got to grow up

61
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:41,340
in a period where we could experiment

62
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,858
and not get into very much trouble the

63
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,620
same is not true today but what has

64
00:02:43,859 --> 00:02:48,239
become true is that over the last twenty

65
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,310
years where I've been professionally in

66
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,459
the security industry we've created a

67
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:55,379
huge amount of marketing yeah we've

68
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:58,620
created a lot of marketing a lot of

69
00:02:55,379 --> 00:03:01,980
solutions and a multibillion-dollar

70
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:04,349
security industry and yet why does this

71
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:08,369
stuff keep happening right we still

72
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:10,560
cannot seem to nail the basics a lot of

73
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:13,230
the worms that we see go out the patches

74
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,639
were already available so when it comes

75
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:17,518
to vulnerability disclosure

76
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,840
vulnerability management everybody has

77
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,459
the same vulnerability management

78
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,260
problem which is they have to apply the

79
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:24,269
patches for the bugs that are well-known

80
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:26,280
that are already out there that people

81
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:28,560
have exploits for and then there are a

82
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,419
few people a few organizations that

83
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,730
actually write code and have to create

84
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:34,709
those patches but everybody is in that

85
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:36,418
first boat of we have to apply the

86
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:38,190
patches for the technology that we've

87
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:39,959
deployed and if we don't do that in a

88
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:45,299
timely manner there we are

89
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:47,579
right so silver bullets are often sold

90
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:49,530
in the security industry is if you do X

91
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:52,379
then we'll protect you from breaches I

92
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:54,629
have not noticed any werewolves out in

93
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:56,280
the world that we live in that that

94
00:03:54,629 --> 00:03:58,768
would be susceptible to these silver

95
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,319
bullets so what does it really break

96
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:03,900
down to when I think about how these

97
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:05,750
terms are used so interchangeably these

98
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,459
days terms like bug bounties

99
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:11,400
vulnerability disclosure and pen testing

100
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:13,530
I have to take a pause and take

101
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,120
everybody a step back and just get back

102
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,289
to the basic definition so one of the

103
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,228
things you might have noticed on my bio

104
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:21,209
slide is that I was the co-author and

105
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:22,710
co-editor of the ISO standards on

106
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:24,409
vulnerability disclosure and

107
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:29,099
vulnerability handling processes that's

108
00:04:24,409 --> 00:04:32,250
ISO 29 147 ISO 3 0 1 1 1

109
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:34,350
and really all that is is the process of

110
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,820
receiving vulnerability reports doing

111
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:37,800
something with it such as creating

112
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,230
resolution and then putting something

113
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,550
out in terms of maybe a patch or an

114
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:44,100
advisory or both

115
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:46,410
sometimes it's taking in a vulnerability

116
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,960
report doing something with it maybe on

117
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:51,270
your actual cloud infrastructure and not

118
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,760
issuing any kind of alert because you

119
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:55,380
took care of it on your end it's all of

120
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,349
those things and that describes that

121
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:00,120
process bug bounties have become

122
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:02,370
synonymous with vulnerability disclosure

123
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,320
this makes no sense considering bug

124
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:06,690
bounties are simply the cash reward that

125
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,860
you may or may not offer to someone who

126
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:10,410
reports something to you

127
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,300
and they're also bug bounties are being

128
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:14,360
conflated with penetration tests you'll

129
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:17,790
actually hear people call them

130
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:20,060
crowdsource penetration testing now that

131
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:23,100
sounds like a harmless enough

132
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:25,140
equivocation of the two terms but what

133
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:27,720
are you really paying for when you get a

134
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:29,039
good pen test and I caveat that with

135
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,080
good because there's a lot of variety

136
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,570
and pen testing but ideally you're

137
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:36,539
seeking an organization who has vetted

138
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:37,860
technical security resources that are

139
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,510
under NDA not just with that

140
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,290
organization but then by signing a

141
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:44,610
contract with you are under NDA with you

142
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:46,140
what does that NDA do well it makes it

143
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:49,380
so that you can fix the bugs in a pen

144
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:50,969
test at your own timeline right and you

145
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,909
don't have to deal with the norms of

146
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:55,950
vulnerability disclosure which have

147
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:57,810
typical deadlines and you know

148
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:01,530
expectations from a finder that you will

149
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:02,820
fix things in a reasonable timeframe but

150
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:04,289
the other thing you can do with

151
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,240
penetration testing companies is that

152
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:09,120
they already vet each vulnerability

153
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,370
you're paying for only real bugs in a

154
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,870
pen test now what's strange is when the

155
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,010
marketing of bug bounties say pay only

156
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,690
for the real bugs

157
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:18,270
well they miss the fact that there's a

158
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:20,100
whole lot of noise associated with bug

159
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:21,750
bounty programs and so they seek to

160
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,850
manage it for you right the seams all

161
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,500
fine you manage it you know they can

162
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:28,410
deal with the signal-to-noise for you

163
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:30,750
and you get allegedly thousands if not

164
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:34,080
hundreds of thousands of eyeballs on

165
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:36,270
your code continuously scanning not

166
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,919
exactly the case but let's just pretend

167
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:40,169
for a minute that it's just that easy

168
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,810
and you know if you want to start a vole

169
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:44,370
disclosure program or maybe a small bug

170
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:46,500
program you just open up the front door

171
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,960
see what happens so most people are

172
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,400
expecting something like this

173
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,409
it's like mostly you know friendly

174
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,900
researchers some white hats a couple of

175
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,919
gray hats maybe but and it might be a

176
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,440
little bit of a flood but it's

177
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:01,320
manageable when in actuality it looks a

178
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,570
lot more like this and you kind of have

179
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,430
no idea exactly who is knocking on that

180
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:07,620
front door and often your incident

181
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:10,110
response team has to pay the price and

182
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,310
do the investigation right so how do you

183
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:14,250
distinguish friend from foe

184
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:16,860
when all probing activity looks about

185
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:18,960
the same especially when it comes to

186
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,970
data privacy now remember pentesting

187
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,320
they're under contract under NDA they

188
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:24,750
are acting as an arm of your

189
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:27,330
organization what that means is that

190
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:29,310
even if they uncover the entirety of

191
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:31,710
your databases and all of your customer

192
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:33,740
data it's not considered a data breach

193
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:36,870
why because they were under contract

194
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:39,870
authorized acting as an extension of

195
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:42,060
your organization bug bounties and vole

196
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:44,460
disclosure programs do not operate that

197
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:46,500
way now you might have heard the term

198
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,760
safe harbor kicked around for Volm

199
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,289
disclosure programs and bug bounty

200
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,510
programs and it's one of the worst

201
00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:53,969
misnomers that I've heard applied in the

202
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:56,849
space in a few years the reason is that

203
00:07:53,970 --> 00:08:00,240
no one can actually grant diplomatic

204
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:01,500
immunity to hackers funny not even the

205
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,330
Department of Defense in the United

206
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,400
States so when I worked on their

207
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:07,260
vulnerability disclosure policy there's

208
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,969
legal disclaimer there that says if you

209
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:11,610
follow these rules we won't take legal

210
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:14,280
action against you but it also goes on

211
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:16,320
to say that if a third party brings

212
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,669
legal action against you will kind of

213
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,500
stick up for you and say that you were

214
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:21,570
following these things but if you notice

215
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,530
it says that a third party could still

216
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:24,440
bring legal action

217
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:26,909
remember the uber data breach

218
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:29,490
fifty-seven million records they signed

219
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:31,050
an NDA they presumably deleted all the

220
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:33,390
data in exchange for their hundred

221
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:36,690
thousand dollars but what about all that

222
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:39,630
victims how is that data stored how is

223
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:41,010
it transmitted you know all kinds of

224
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:43,260
data breach laws could have still been

225
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:45,870
broken and those hackers are still

226
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:47,459
liable so using the term safe harbor I

227
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:50,279
would definitely stay away from that

228
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:51,630
because it's a misnomer for you and for

229
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:58,040
the researchers who might come forward

230
00:08:51,630 --> 00:09:01,439
to you and let's see what about

231
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:04,170
automation how many of you heard of the

232
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,380
DARPA cyber grand challenge right where

233
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:11,010
it was all AI and the teams basically

234
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:14,300
created these AI systems to hunt for

235
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:17,490
bugs and to also dynamically patch bugs

236
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,780
well what's gonna happen if you can't

237
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:22,110
handle the bugs you already know about

238
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:24,870
from human sources when AI and other

239
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:28,350
enhanced vulnerability and exploitation

240
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:30,240
technology becomes more commonplace it's

241
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,950
like going to eat at a buffet when you

242
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:36,329
have no digestive system good luck with

243
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:38,579
that okay so this story we already know

244
00:09:36,329 --> 00:09:40,410
the outcome of this story this person

245
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:45,270
was found not guilty by reason of

246
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:48,089
insanity but what happened was this

247
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:50,819
person who had participated in some CTFs

248
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:53,520
been a security researcher went a little

249
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:56,520
off his rocker and stole an armored

250
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:59,610
vehicle from a military base where he

251
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:02,490
was stationed and luckily nobody was

252
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:03,800
hurt he was tased on his way out let's

253
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:07,200
see what happened do we have sound

254
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:10,260
that's okay it sounds like a siren in

255
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,270
the US it's sounds different than here

256
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,730
so just imagine your local siren sounds

257
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:16,620
and also people swearing because there's

258
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:19,079
also swearing in the background this

259
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:21,420
chase started in daylight you can see

260
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:23,790
this thing doesn't move very fast you

261
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:25,380
can also see all of the incident

262
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,089
responders okay this is a part where it

263
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:29,430
had the people swearing in it so just

264
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:31,260
imagine your favorites where's what you

265
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,859
would swear if you saw this driving down

266
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:35,670
the street

267
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:37,230
very slowly going by right so people

268
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:38,550
were lucky one that that thing didn't

269
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:40,770
have any weapons it was an armored

270
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:44,189
personnel carrier it didn't it was

271
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:45,959
basically a tank without the guns this

272
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:48,500
went on for a couple of hours it ended

273
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:53,699
peacefully in the middle of downtown

274
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:55,530
Richmond in Virginia okay so they tased

275
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,570
him but this is what he said he said he

276
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:59,520
had authorization and he was just

277
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:01,230
running a test now clearly he had

278
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:03,660
problems and luckily he's gonna get the

279
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:05,459
help he needs because you know sometimes

280
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:07,420
the justice system works out and he was

281
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:12,369
found not guilty by reason of insanity

282
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:14,800
but how many hackers can be going forth

283
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:16,330
using the authorizations that you've put

284
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,329
in the scope of your Volm disclosure or

285
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:21,670
bounty programs causing major disruption

286
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:23,530
to your organization using up tons of

287
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:26,620
your incident response resources chasing

288
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:31,390
after what inevitably ended up being

289
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:33,070
harmless weird but harmless you know so

290
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,360
all right back to the bug bounding

291
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:36,780
platforms they're supposed to manage all

292
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:39,400
this for you right manage that flood

293
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:42,760
give you only validated bugs but there's

294
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:46,270
a fundamental assumption here the triage

295
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:49,270
labor is magical unending and we'll

296
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:51,069
always want to work for you not so so

297
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:52,060
when I worked at Microsoft for seven

298
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:54,880
years I feel like I should have like

299
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:56,770
seven like little windows tattoos on my

300
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,189
face you know for all the years hard

301
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:02,620
time I did on the inside but um

302
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:04,420
Microsoft even to this day receives over

303
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:07,660
a hundred fifty thousand to two hundred

304
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:10,300
thousand non-spam email messages a year

305
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:12,250
to secure at Microsoft pretty sure no

306
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:14,530
other vendor where government comes even

307
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:18,280
close to that number at the top of the

308
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:22,410
funnel so a human being does the initial

309
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:25,240
triage for each of these no spam filter

310
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:27,370
manually sorts the spam from the real

311
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:30,040
messages and then performs further

312
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:33,940
triage and when I joined Microsoft in

313
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:36,880
2007 popular science made a list of the

314
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:39,850
top ten worst jobs in science and they

315
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,680
said the Microsoft security grunt as in

316
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:45,370
the people who were on the other end of

317
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,979
secure at Microsoft had among the worst

318
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:50,170
jobs in science somewhere between

319
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:52,210
elephant vasectomized and whale feces

320
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,660
researchers like right there in the

321
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:54,730
middle

322
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:58,089
this was accurate and we made t-shirts

323
00:12:54,730 --> 00:13:00,160
so the fact of the matter was you could

324
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:02,850
not keep triage personnel and these were

325
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:06,250
full-time six-figure paid Microsoft

326
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:07,810
security program managers you could not

327
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,880
keep them in their jobs for the

328
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:12,069
mandatory 12 months that it would take

329
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,600
for them to be allowed to apply for a

330
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:17,830
different job inside of Microsoft that's

331
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:20,720
how painful this job is so back to the

332
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:23,240
outsourcing who is

333
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,160
hang at your books it's not a bunch of

334
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:27,410
full-time engineers getting six-figure

335
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:31,089
salaries at these startups no no it's

336
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:33,500
mostly contractors mostly bug hunters oh

337
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:35,569
nothing nothing possibly could go wrong

338
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:38,360
with that all right so let's pretend

339
00:13:35,569 --> 00:13:40,579
everything's going great and there is

340
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,740
such a thing as too much chocolate right

341
00:13:40,579 --> 00:13:45,680
you could be getting the purest cleanest

342
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:47,930
feed of only validated bugs and yet

343
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,750
you're still overwhelmed why because you

344
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:53,628
didn't do the due diligence that this

345
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:58,430
type of program requires for you to not

346
00:13:53,629 --> 00:14:00,500
hurt yourself I do an entire talk about

347
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:02,989
a vulnerability coordination maturity

348
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:04,759
model it's not just engineering that you

349
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:07,120
have to think about in terms of your

350
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:09,740
readiness to deal with vulnerabilities

351
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,050
communication analytics your

352
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:15,829
organizational priorities and yes

353
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:17,750
incentives but not all money some of the

354
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:19,489
best incentives that we ever created at

355
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:22,810
Microsoft were things that only

356
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:25,970
Microsoft could do so for example

357
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:28,279
certain bugs that came in before the bug

358
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:30,829
bounties were open we didn't want to

359
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:33,259
retroactively lipe them because boy that

360
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:35,689
would get expensive but we wanted to say

361
00:14:33,259 --> 00:14:37,699
thank you to some prolific you know

362
00:14:35,689 --> 00:14:39,639
security researchers so we'd reach out

363
00:14:37,699 --> 00:14:43,309
to them and ask do you have an Xbox and

364
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:46,040
if they said no we would ask them do you

365
00:14:43,309 --> 00:14:48,889
have a favorite graphic and what handle

366
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:53,019
would you like skinned on your personal

367
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:58,069
Xbox and they went crazy this cost us

368
00:14:53,019 --> 00:15:01,730
$15 internally to do 1/5 write another

369
00:14:58,069 --> 00:15:02,269
one a one-time cost to a graphic

370
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:05,689
designer

371
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:09,259
who is a vendor to Microsoft Xbox that

372
00:15:05,689 --> 00:15:10,819
created one-time use like download code

373
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:13,490
so we only had to pay this this graphic

374
00:15:10,819 --> 00:15:16,279
designer once to create a black hat a

375
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:18,620
blue hat a black t-shirt that said

376
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:20,870
hacker and you know a couple of other

377
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:23,029
clothing items that we would hand out

378
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:25,759
one-time download codes to researchers

379
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:28,309
who like did us a solid people went

380
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:30,019
insane and I believe they're still

381
00:15:28,309 --> 00:15:32,809
handing these out you know so there's

382
00:15:30,019 --> 00:15:36,429
one time 3,000 dollars spent certain

383
00:15:32,809 --> 00:15:36,429
things that only you can do

384
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,560
no yes

385
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:46,639
oh that's the laser that's the right one

386
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:48,619
okay so not all bugs are created equal

387
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,600
this comes from a different presentation

388
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:52,040
based on some work that I had done with

389
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,769
MIT Sloan School in Harvard Kennedy

390
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:57,349
School in modeling the vulnerability

391
00:15:54,769 --> 00:15:59,000
economy and exploit market if you think

392
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:01,819
that all bugs are the same level of

393
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,060
sophistication to find or to fix or have

394
00:16:01,819 --> 00:16:07,040
the same value across all markets well

395
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:09,099
then I've got a cross-site scripting bug

396
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,959
to sell you for a hell of a lot of money

397
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:14,480
so a lot of the work that I do with

398
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:16,638
organizations is pointing out that there

399
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,560
is such a thing as low-hanging fruit

400
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,690
with known classes of vulnerabilities

401
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,180
with well understood cheap or free tools

402
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:25,209
that all you need to do is run them and

403
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:27,560
you will find these bugs yourself

404
00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:30,050
whereas the majority of bug bounty

405
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:33,800
programs are still paying out for

406
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:35,449
cross-site scripting no that's really

407
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,339
the one okay so a lot of organizations

408
00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:39,410
think they're just going to set up a bug

409
00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:41,630
bounty program set up a volna Scotia

410
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:43,969
program ask for certain things ask for

411
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:45,920
certain types of bugs and really all

412
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:48,589
they get are bugs that are very very

413
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:53,029
uninteresting to them right it's not the

414
00:16:48,589 --> 00:16:55,459
bugs you're looking for if we think

415
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:57,949
about it a lot of the breaches that have

416
00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:59,649
made the headlines are due to basic

417
00:16:57,949 --> 00:17:04,938
misconfigurations

418
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:07,609
basic security errors creating things

419
00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:09,970
that have improper or no authentication

420
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:11,990
in front of them these are not

421
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:13,220
groundbreaking new classes of

422
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:16,609
vulnerabilities that you should be

423
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:19,579
spending tons of money to fix even if

424
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:22,760
you did hire pen testers as opposed to

425
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:25,908
using bug bounty crowdsourcing you still

426
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:28,069
can't start there as your first step to

427
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:30,200
true risk management right I can't

428
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:31,668
believe I've been professionally in this

429
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,240
industry for twenty years and I'm still

430
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:37,039
saying this but it's true

431
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,230
yeah and I call that bug bounty Botox if

432
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,419
you missed it so let's go through some

433
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:43,080
myths of this marketplace and some

434
00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:45,330
motivations

435
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:47,970
we hear a lot that bug bounties are the

436
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:49,289
logical end goal of all vulnerability

437
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:52,289
disclosure programs that if you're

438
00:17:49,289 --> 00:17:53,879
mature that you have you know you have

439
00:17:52,289 --> 00:17:56,879
reached the pinnacle if you're doing a

440
00:17:53,879 --> 00:17:59,219
bug bounty a lot of organizations are

441
00:17:56,879 --> 00:18:01,168
using that as shorthand for maturity

442
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,639
when in fact they've missed all the

443
00:18:01,169 --> 00:18:04,470
low-hanging fruit themselves and they're

444
00:18:02,639 --> 00:18:07,709
looking real busy and paying out a lot

445
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:09,570
of money but actually it's for stuff

446
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:11,340
that I have literally taught Hollywood

447
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:14,220
screenwriters how to find in less than

448
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,949
an hour okay if that's if that's the

449
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,059
class of vulnerability you're paying for

450
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:19,950
definitely bug bounties are not the

451
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:21,960
logical conclusion and indicate maturity

452
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:25,279
there's a myth that hackers will only

453
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:28,109
look for bugs with in exchange for cash

454
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:30,389
not only is that provably not true

455
00:18:28,109 --> 00:18:32,340
because Microsoft until 2013 when I

456
00:18:30,389 --> 00:18:34,609
offered their first bug bounties did not

457
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:37,259
offer cash and was still getting over

458
00:18:34,609 --> 00:18:41,549
150,000 or 200,000 non-spam email

459
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:43,289
messages a year for free but I have a

460
00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:45,840
different story about that in a minute

461
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:48,210
and the third myth is that you have to

462
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,499
outbid the offense or the black market

463
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,659
it's not really a black market if it's

464
00:18:49,499 --> 00:18:55,580
not illegal and how many of you think

465
00:18:51,659 --> 00:18:58,350
the offense market is evil and immoral

466
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:59,759
well okay all right a little bit all

467
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:01,580
right well I was expecting everyone to

468
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:05,340
just you know kind of go along with like

469
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:06,928
offense that sounds bad but really what

470
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:09,149
the offense market describes our bugs

471
00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:10,859
that are bought not for fixing but for

472
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:13,850
using for exploitation now that is not

473
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:16,320
inherently evil if you think about it

474
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:18,840
organizations like governments who use

475
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,269
it to target terrorists use it to target

476
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,220
child predators those are all uses that

477
00:19:21,269 --> 00:19:26,429
we can all agree with they are legally

478
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:29,460
sanctioned by a judge etc I much prefer

479
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:31,440
that use of exploits with governments

480
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:33,899
than governments mandating that software

481
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:37,049
backdoors and crypto backdoors be you

482
00:19:33,899 --> 00:19:39,689
know built into common applications so

483
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:41,908
anyway all right let's

484
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:45,450
oh that's the laser again all right so

485
00:19:41,909 --> 00:19:47,190
one of the things in terms of this myth

486
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:49,499
that hackers will only do it for money

487
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:52,080
this was a great exchange that happened

488
00:19:49,499 --> 00:19:56,940
on Twitter there was a hacker security

489
00:19:52,080 --> 00:20:02,649
researcher who got a six-figure payday

490
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:04,660
$119,000 from one program when we broke

491
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:06,010
it down and I said look you know even

492
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:08,230
the Google project zero guys aren't

493
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:10,510
making $29,000 an hour and they're

494
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:12,850
finding very very unique bugs that you

495
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:14,770
know I browsed this list of bugs and

496
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:16,659
they're not exciting new classes of bugs

497
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:18,220
they were imminently discoverable yes

498
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:20,770
you would need some skill to discover

499
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:23,740
them so it's not skill lists that I'm

500
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:25,480
talking about but it was any pen tester

501
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:28,270
could find them if they're a decent pen

502
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:31,570
tester so then someone you know came in

503
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:34,150
and and and said oh well why would he

504
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:36,669
ever accept a position inside of an

505
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:39,220
organization when he could make you know

506
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:40,660
119 thousand dollars in four hours do

507
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:45,610
you did four hours of work to find those

508
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:47,740
and actually he replied back he himself

509
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:49,600
he said I was trying to join their team

510
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:50,710
it fell through the cracks through you

511
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,959
know paper work and an acquisition

512
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:53,890
happened but I've been wanting to join

513
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,380
their team forever

514
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:58,480
he left his full-time job to be a book

515
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:00,400
bounty hunter but he doesn't want to do

516
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,130
that even though it's super lucrative

517
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,650
and then this other person said well why

518
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:08,290
is that and what it came down to in

519
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:11,260
terms of motivation was he wanted

520
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:13,659
stability for his daughter so even

521
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:16,810
though he could Bank you know a bunch of

522
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:18,490
cash tons of cash in doing bug bounty

523
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:20,639
hunting the instability was something

524
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:23,050
that he didn't really want to live with

525
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,990
especially when it came to dealing with

526
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:29,260
his daughter and supporting his daughter

527
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:31,660
so completely different from what a lot

528
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:34,600
of organizations think when they think

529
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:37,060
bug bounty hunter we have seen so many

530
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:39,340
bug bounty hunters turned down bug

531
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:41,770
bounties because they wanted to see the

532
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:44,320
issue resolved and fixed that's another

533
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:46,210
huge motivation for security researchers

534
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,280
right when I was a professional pen

535
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:51,400
tester my specialty was robbing banks

536
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:55,720
you know this is like the early 2000s

537
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:58,090
and frankly you know bank security was

538
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:00,790
non-existent of a point online banking

539
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:03,250
and there were ways that I knew how to

540
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:05,020
mint money such that I wasn't stealing

541
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:09,159
from a person and I wasn't stealing from

542
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:11,619
the bank now I still drive a used car so

543
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:13,989
obviously money isn't the only thing

544
00:22:11,619 --> 00:22:19,269
that motivates all of us who are capable

545
00:22:13,989 --> 00:22:22,989
of finding bugs so this is another

546
00:22:19,269 --> 00:22:24,759
excerpt from that system dynamics

547
00:22:22,989 --> 00:22:26,830
research that I done with MIT Sloan

548
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:34,539
School Harvard Kennedy School there is

549
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:36,728
more to this ecosystem than money when I

550
00:22:34,539 --> 00:22:38,769
look at the claims from bug bounty

551
00:22:36,729 --> 00:22:41,049
companies that promise continuous

552
00:22:38,769 --> 00:22:43,269
coverage let's just break it down by the

553
00:22:41,049 --> 00:22:45,749
numbers so part of what we did in that

554
00:22:43,269 --> 00:22:48,549
study was we did a labor market study of

555
00:22:45,749 --> 00:22:50,979
the bug bounty hunters at the time and

556
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:54,099
we took data from Facebook and from

557
00:22:50,979 --> 00:22:56,619
hacker 1 and we basically found that

558
00:22:54,099 --> 00:22:59,559
most of the people registered on these

559
00:22:56,619 --> 00:23:02,799
platforms or even reporting directly to

560
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:06,970
Facebook it was a lot of noise versus

561
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:08,859
signal so and in Kakkar one got upset

562
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:10,539
that those numbers were recirculating

563
00:23:08,859 --> 00:23:14,470
and then published their own this is

564
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:17,109
from January doesn't look so good over

565
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:19,379
300,000 people registered only one in 10

566
00:23:17,109 --> 00:23:23,529
has ever reported a bug on that platform

567
00:23:19,379 --> 00:23:26,379
out of those a thousand have made $5,000

568
00:23:23,529 --> 00:23:29,889
and that's lifetime it's not a lot right

569
00:23:26,379 --> 00:23:33,279
so who's making all this money well a

570
00:23:29,889 --> 00:23:36,369
hundred hackers have made over a hundred

571
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:39,399
thousand that's about pentester salary

572
00:23:36,369 --> 00:23:40,658
it's in that range and only two of them

573
00:23:39,399 --> 00:23:42,820
at the time I think it might be up to

574
00:23:40,659 --> 00:23:44,859
three or four now but only two of them

575
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:46,809
had made a million in the entirety of

576
00:23:44,859 --> 00:23:48,970
their time on the platform now one of

577
00:23:46,809 --> 00:23:51,309
them who had made a million was a 19

578
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:52,749
year old argentinian hacker who had just

579
00:23:51,309 --> 00:23:55,269
started doing bug bounties about three

580
00:23:52,749 --> 00:23:58,029
years ago so in other words didn't play

581
00:23:55,269 --> 00:24:00,129
fortnight did bug bounties that was what

582
00:23:58,029 --> 00:24:02,559
he was doing and if you actually look at

583
00:24:00,129 --> 00:24:04,719
his breakdown of the severity of his

584
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:07,869
cases in the number of his cases it took

585
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:10,359
him over 1,600 vulnerability valid

586
00:24:07,869 --> 00:24:12,009
vulnerability reports with only a

587
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:14,710
hundred twenty eight of them rated as

588
00:24:12,009 --> 00:24:18,729
critical is that a million dollars worth

589
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:21,960
of value from that bug hunter probably

590
00:24:18,729 --> 00:24:24,779
not but the whole thing is that it's

591
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,520
based on this predicated idea that

592
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:29,399
there's an endless supply of

593
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:31,080
high-quality motivated eyeballs who are

594
00:24:29,399 --> 00:24:33,299
going to look at your stuff all the time

595
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,820
and it's just not the case these hundred

596
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:37,289
individuals are pretty much bouncing

597
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:39,539
around between the major bug bounty

598
00:24:37,289 --> 00:24:42,240
platforms so even getting their eyeballs

599
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:43,679
to look at your stuff is a challenge and

600
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,799
guess what the bug mounting companies do

601
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,940
they say raise the bug bounty how long

602
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,490
is this going to last

603
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:52,470
well the truth is bug bounties cannot

604
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:54,809
replace traditional penetration testing

605
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:57,539
nor do they indicate on their own that

606
00:24:54,809 --> 00:25:00,480
your organization is mature all human

607
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:03,090
beings which includes hackers because

608
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:06,059
we're not machines yet have a mix matrix

609
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:09,360
of motivations and frankly finding bugs

610
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:12,178
is not a forever game not even for you

611
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,158
know those of us who want to stay active

612
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:16,260
doing hacking when we did the labor

613
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,990
market study we looked at some publicly

614
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:20,908
available data for critical level

615
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:22,470
vulnerability is submitted to Microsoft

616
00:25:20,909 --> 00:25:24,840
because that was publicly verifiable as

617
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:27,510
well like with the bulletins and the

618
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:29,639
names and all that stuff it's about

619
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:32,940
seven years that people are

620
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:35,100
participating at peek game when it comes

621
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:38,130
to being able to find vulnerabilities

622
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:40,830
and reliably exploit them in the latest

623
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:42,690
versions of top software so this is

624
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:44,699
software that's had a ton of investment

625
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:47,029
in security so we're talking Google

626
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:49,169
Chrome we're talking talking Apple iOS

627
00:25:47,029 --> 00:25:51,510
we're talking the latest version of

628
00:25:49,169 --> 00:25:56,700
Windows and way back when Windows had a

629
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:59,279
phone that too right so right so it's a

630
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:02,210
seven year peak activity window for most

631
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:04,980
security researchers at that level and

632
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:07,110
then finally the last truth here is that

633
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:10,850
the defense market can only go so high

634
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:14,309
before it creates perverse incentives

635
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:17,309
what are perverse incentives and what

636
00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:21,809
are some ways to avoid them so one of my

637
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:24,299
favorite cartoons is from 1995 and it

638
00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:26,610
was Dilbert cartoon it'll come up a

639
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:29,460
little bit later but our friends at

640
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:31,590
Apple recently decided that a million

641
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:33,450
dollars was a good defensive amount for

642
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:35,429
a bounty

643
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:37,710
so they were saying you know hey we're

644
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:39,780
doing it because it's harder now to

645
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:42,120
break into our operating system and what

646
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:44,580
we're looking for is so very rare that

647
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:46,110
we want to be able to scare this out of

648
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:47,610
the woodwork and we want to be able to

649
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:49,229
quote-unquote compete with the black

650
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:52,590
market compete with the offense market

651
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:56,070
now offense market is nation-states and

652
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:58,350
organized crime what on earth makes

653
00:26:56,070 --> 00:27:01,230
anyone think that a million dollars from

654
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:04,110
Apple won't just drive up offense market

655
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:06,179
prices right they were going up on their

656
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:09,178
own without the intervention of the

657
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:11,429
defense market so there's no competition

658
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:13,350
that's actually gonna happen it's just

659
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:14,850
going to drive up offense market prices

660
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:17,419
now why is this a problem

661
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:19,740
well offense market won't feel it and

662
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:22,650
they won't feel it in a very particular

663
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:24,480
way that the defense market will the

664
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:26,400
offense market was already outsourcing

665
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:31,890
finding these vulnerabilities at this

666
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:34,860
top level they do not have the mission

667
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:36,920
that the defense market has of trying to

668
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:40,379
prevent these bugs in the first place

669
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:43,650
how do you continue to supply your

670
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:47,420
internal engineering defensive labor

671
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:50,460
market if it's cool to just stay out and

672
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:54,500
not go work for Apple and make a million

673
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:56,610
dollars right the risk of collusion

674
00:27:54,500 --> 00:28:00,270
dramatically increases at these prices

675
00:27:56,610 --> 00:28:02,879
and if we think about it

676
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:07,020
I mean when I offered Microsoft's first

677
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:09,570
bug bounties in 2013 there were three of

678
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:11,760
them and one of them was $100,000 and at

679
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:16,290
the time it was the highest ongoing

680
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:18,059
vendor supplied bug bounty ongoing

681
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:19,800
meaning it wasn't a once a year contest

682
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:24,480
because we didn't want people to hold on

683
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:26,220
to the bugs and some people you know

684
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,750
when I started speaking out against this

685
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:29,370
million-dollar bounty we're saying well

686
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:31,860
but didn't you offer the highest bounty

687
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:34,739
said yes but it was matched to the

688
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:38,939
defensive prices at the time the pone to

689
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:40,590
own contest top price was $100,000 so we

690
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:41,910
weren't introducing a new price point to

691
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:45,480
the market what we were doing was we

692
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:47,300
were offering it 365 days a year and for

693
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:51,690
something that we wanted

694
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:55,500
so yeah Dilbert Dilbert figured this out

695
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:59,190
in 1995 right the potential for

696
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:01,080
collusion increases and if you look at

697
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:03,240
the United States healthcare system it

698
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:05,939
really takes one medical emergency to

699
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:11,670
increase your chances of needing a lot

700
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:13,170
of money really fast so let's talk about

701
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:15,420
the Microsoft bug bounties for a second

702
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:18,000
so what you're looking at here this is

703
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:20,490
the actual graph that was used to

704
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,520
convince the head of ie to pay for his

705
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:25,140
own bugs missus after Microsoft in 2008

706
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,040
had sworn they would never pay for

707
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,400
vulnerabilities because they were

708
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:31,909
receiving so many bugs already for free

709
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:35,550
but what we did was I looked at the data

710
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:38,940
the white line is actually how many bugs

711
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:39,540
we receive during the ie 10 public beta

712
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,840
period

713
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:43,770
not that many and then the white spike

714
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,720
was how many bug reports received

715
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:48,060
immediately after the beta period was

716
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:50,180
over kind of the worst time ever for

717
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:52,230
Microsoft to hear about a bug right and

718
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:53,670
these were all these friendly hackers

719
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:55,410
who were willing to turn these bugs over

720
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:57,540
for free why were they finding them

721
00:29:55,410 --> 00:30:00,390
clearly during beta and holding on to

722
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:03,270
them what perverse incentive had we

723
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:05,700
created for them unwittingly well the

724
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:08,010
only thing we were offering them was

725
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:11,700
their chance for their name and 12-point

726
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:13,260
arial font in a bulletin if the bug only

727
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:16,530
affected the beta version and no other

728
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:18,629
versions we had created an incentive to

729
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:20,610
cause them to hold on to it until after

730
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:22,410
it was out of beta because that was the

731
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:27,270
only chance for them to get their name

732
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:30,600
in a bulletin oops so I told them I told

733
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:32,250
ie that we could move the spike to the

734
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:34,740
beginning of the beta period if we

735
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:39,330
offered small amount of compensation but

736
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:42,090
really it was recognition and so we

737
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:44,970
offered the ie11 beta bug bounty in the

738
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:49,080
first 30 days of ie11 guess what we got

739
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:51,570
18 serious vulnerabilities in that first

740
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:53,189
30 days so we were right we did the

741
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:56,340
traffic shaping exercise and we were

742
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:59,280
right anyone want to guess how many or

743
00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:00,129
how much I spent for all of those 18

744
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,530
total

745
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:04,480
guess guess guess guess a hundred

746
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:08,680
thousand all right anyone else lower

747
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:10,510
higher how many think higher okay how

748
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:12,220
many think lower ten thousand okay so

749
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:16,720
somewhere in them in between yes it was

750
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:19,210
about $28,000 total and why was that

751
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,970
well one it was just a token of our

752
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:24,220
appreciation really we had this web page

753
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:25,600
where we'd feature them we had blog post

754
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:29,290
we had media that we were doing around

755
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:32,230
these folks who are helping us and in

756
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:35,200
reality a lot of the people who I knew

757
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:37,450
were capable of finding these bugs there

758
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:40,060
were very few individuals we already

759
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:43,060
knew who they were couple of a more on

760
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:45,340
parental leave I had to send onesies -

761
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:46,600
like seriously - babies to get them to

762
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:49,480
work on this thing because it was a

763
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:52,000
fixed time period and somebody had given

764
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:54,280
birth in their household so yeah there

765
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,230
was a lot that we did to round up the

766
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:59,050
right sets of eyes to prove this point

767
00:31:56,230 --> 00:32:01,570
that we could do something with bounties

768
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:03,820
that nobody else had done and that was

769
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:06,070
take the eyeballs the friendly people we

770
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:08,350
already knew about understand the market

771
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:11,110
dynamics of who was buying our bugs for

772
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:13,389
how much and when and understand that

773
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:16,689
the incentives were very much around

774
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:18,180
behavioral economics absolutely not

775
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:20,200
about price

776
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:21,640
so this hundred thousand dollar check

777
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:25,150
that's not my real signature by the way

778
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:27,250
stop it cut it out

779
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:29,530
that hundred thousand dollar check was

780
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:31,000
written to James for Shaw who at the

781
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:34,870
time was working for contacts now he

782
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:37,060
works at project zero but that hundred

783
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:39,040
thousand dollars again this was for

784
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:41,590
something it wasn't just an exploit

785
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:43,180
nothing that was going to win at pone to

786
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:45,340
own could win this hundred thousand

787
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:49,990
dollars why because we were looking for

788
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:51,639
an exploitation technique now let's talk

789
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:54,160
about the offense market does the

790
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:55,840
offense market by bugs at six figures or

791
00:32:54,160 --> 00:33:00,100
a million dollars a pop for beta

792
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:01,780
products probably not maybe for Apple

793
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:03,669
products because people line up you know

794
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:05,350
out the door and pre-order that stuff

795
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:08,620
but I have never seen a line for people

796
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:10,300
waiting to install IE it's not that's

797
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:11,860
not a thing so understanding your

798
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:13,350
products and understanding your user

799
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:14,668
behavior important

800
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:16,889
and understanding your market dynamics

801
00:33:14,669 --> 00:33:19,950
the other thing the hundred thousand

802
00:33:16,889 --> 00:33:21,750
dollars right so clearly the offense

803
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:24,000
market will by working exploits that can

804
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:28,409
defeat the latest mitigations but do

805
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,970
they need new exploitation techniques no

806
00:33:28,409 --> 00:33:33,389
because the old exploitation techniques

807
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:35,399
work just fine right who needs the new

808
00:33:33,389 --> 00:33:37,320
techniques it's the people building the

809
00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:40,080
operating system because you need to

810
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:41,879
plan out several generations ahead to

811
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,309
fully incorporate the architectural

812
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:47,789
changes it takes to fix exploitation

813
00:33:44,309 --> 00:33:49,649
techniques so not only were we offering

814
00:33:47,789 --> 00:33:52,080
it year round don't make people wait

815
00:33:49,649 --> 00:33:54,120
until poned own but we were offering it

816
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:57,059
for something that was not just an

817
00:33:54,120 --> 00:34:01,860
exploit but so suitably rare is a brand

818
00:33:57,059 --> 00:34:03,509
new exploitation technique ok hack the

819
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:07,469
Pentagon I want you to pay attention to

820
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:09,929
a few numbers ok so we were hoping that

821
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:11,579
a few hundred people would join you had

822
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:13,139
to pre-register you to give your actual

823
00:34:11,579 --> 00:34:15,419
name your social security number I

824
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:17,879
remember a few friends freaking out on

825
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:20,399
Twitter being like I am NOT giving the

826
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:22,739
government my social security number and

827
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:28,049
I was like the government gave you that

828
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:29,310
number they also know your name and they

829
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:31,500
were like what they don't know I'm a

830
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:34,710
hacker I'm like you're tweeting about it

831
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:37,679
you know so that was cool I sent some

832
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:40,589
friends some tinfoil for the Hat but we

833
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,869
got an overwhelming response which led

834
00:34:40,589 --> 00:34:44,699
to the worst signal-to-noise you can

835
00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:46,980
imagine oh my god look at that it was

836
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:50,399
terrible over a thousand bug submissions

837
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:53,339
and 138 were real and not duplicate

838
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:57,480
right what is your duplicate rate tell

839
00:34:53,339 --> 00:34:59,099
you your duplicate rate tells you how

840
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:02,010
many people could find that same

841
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:05,150
vulnerability how common and how

842
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:08,040
low-hanging fruit and discoverable is it

843
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:09,300
it's funny the bug bounty companies do

844
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,920
not track that number for you they

845
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:13,560
remove duplicates but they don't tell

846
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:17,130
you which of your bugs were super

847
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:18,990
discoverable low-hanging fruit because

848
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:21,180
that might actually get you to fix those

849
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:24,868
or prevent those or something hmm

850
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:25,609
anyway also don't start a bug bounty at

851
00:35:24,869 --> 00:35:30,680
mid

852
00:35:25,609 --> 00:35:32,000
do not don't do that this was us after

853
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,250
we had launched hack the army actually

854
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,590
I'll go back one so see this you can see

855
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:38,930
a little binary around there this was

856
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:41,510
one of those non-monetary gifts that

857
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:43,368
only you can give specially designed

858
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:45,230
challenge coin that went out to

859
00:35:43,369 --> 00:35:47,270
everybody who successfully participated

860
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:48,890
in hack the Pentagon and submitted at

861
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,970
least a valid bug even if it didn't get

862
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:53,210
paid out because it wasn't the first

863
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:56,509
submission the binary round there said I

864
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:58,280
hacked the Pentagon this was the

865
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:59,869
Secretary of the army at the time when

866
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:03,230
we launched hack the army and he said

867
00:35:59,869 --> 00:36:08,720
can our binary say I hacked the army

868
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:11,060
beat Navy it did and actually their

869
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,799
their football team did beat the Navy

870
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:14,509
for the first time in 50 years so I'm

871
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,400
pretty sure it was the hackers just

872
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:19,520
gonna say right there but look at the

873
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:22,640
numbers first the registration number a

874
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:25,460
lot smaller that was deliberate we

875
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:27,440
capped the registration in order to

876
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:29,530
handle what we knew was gonna be a

877
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:33,890
little bit of a signal-to-noise melee

878
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:36,500
right because the DoD wanted to start

879
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:38,359
with bug bounties as opposed to starting

880
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:40,490
with a Valdez closure program why

881
00:36:38,359 --> 00:36:42,098
because bug bounties are sexy and money

882
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:44,109
is sexy and they wanted some headlines

883
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:47,960
this sounds familiar

884
00:36:44,109 --> 00:36:53,660
million dollars anyway also starting it

885
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:57,349
at noon was much nicer right so how do

886
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:59,509
we deal with this as a whole I have been

887
00:36:57,349 --> 00:37:01,369
one of the biggest proponents of good

888
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:04,520
bug bounty programs well thought out

889
00:37:01,369 --> 00:37:06,230
carefully planned deliberately executed

890
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,630
bug bounty programs and yet I'm up here

891
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:11,390
telling you that they're not all that

892
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:13,550
what is the proposed solution well when

893
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:15,799
I testified before Congress about the

894
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:19,760
uber data breach one of the things I

895
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:21,470
pointed out is that frankly the top 10

896
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,380
computer science programs in

897
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:27,830
universities in the United States lacked

898
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:30,650
any kind of requirement for security so

899
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:32,240
even the university educated computer

900
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:34,369
scientists out of top universities in

901
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,229
the u.s. we're receiving zero security

902
00:37:34,369 --> 00:37:38,070
education three of those top

903
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:40,260
universities had no security

904
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:43,350
electives whatsoever so we were not

905
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:46,880
we're not cranking out code writers were

906
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:52,080
cranking out bug writers it's pretty bad

907
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:53,940
also the fact that bug bounty hunting is

908
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:56,370
being celebrated by some of these

909
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:58,170
companies at outpacing the median

910
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:59,790
salaries in their countries especially

911
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:02,190
India where a lot of the bug bounty

912
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:03,930
hunters come from because there's a lot

913
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:06,300
of low-hanging fruit and a lot of like

914
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:09,060
easy money to be made India it's

915
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:10,740
something like 16 or 17 times 40 times

916
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:12,540
that in Argentina that's because of that

917
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:13,620
million dollar bug bug bounty hunter by

918
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:16,650
the way that's that data point that

919
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:20,460
drove that number up but talk about

920
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:23,040
perverse incentives where do we

921
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:24,240
outsource a whole lot of code writing to

922
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,720
a lot of the countries with a lot of

923
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:29,640
these bug bounty hunters so a tiny

924
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:33,870
fraction of talent majority generate

925
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:36,900
noise so what can you do

926
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:39,480
bug bounties for that works out well for

927
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:41,370
you finding bugs you missed after you

928
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,170
did your due diligence and there are a

929
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:45,140
lot of ways to discover or whether or

930
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:47,970
not you did your due diligence right

931
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:50,190
known classes of bugs the rate of

932
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:52,560
duplicates all kinds of stuff recruiting

933
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:56,940
for talent that maybe you wouldn't have

934
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:58,410
found and focusing eyes that you know

935
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:01,440
are capable of finding bugs and your

936
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:04,200
stuff on the areas that you need more

937
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:07,170
help with or focusing them at a time

938
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:08,700
that is mutually advantageous to you to

939
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:09,780
them and to your users like the

940
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:12,509
beginning of a beta period

941
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:15,240
what are they bad for your first time

942
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:18,390
ever receiving a bug that causes a lot

943
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:20,250
of bug indigestion let me tell you it's

944
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:21,839
really bad for employee morale if you

945
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:26,640
haven't thought through your recruiting

946
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:29,520
and pipeline capabilities when I was a

947
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:31,259
young twentysomething hacker working as

948
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:33,270
an independent penetration tester the

949
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:35,430
only thing that got me to join my

950
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:38,250
friends at at stake was because I

951
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:40,080
respected my NDA's and I didn't have

952
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:43,050
anyone to talk to you about the cool

953
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:45,660
bugs I was finding bouncing ideas off of

954
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:47,549
in terms of pen testing techniques

955
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:49,589
and really nobody to share knowledge

956
00:39:47,549 --> 00:39:51,930
with where we would enhance each other's

957
00:39:49,589 --> 00:39:56,250
knowledge so I took a huge personal pay

958
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:58,109
cut to join at stake back in 2003 when I

959
00:39:56,250 --> 00:40:00,480
had been independent and happily humming

960
00:39:58,109 --> 00:40:01,589
along since about 2000 as an independent

961
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,400
pen tester

962
00:40:01,589 --> 00:40:07,619
why would young Katie have ever joined

963
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:10,109
Microsoft and ever joined any mega

964
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:12,450
corporation whatsoever if I had had

965
00:40:10,109 --> 00:40:14,609
better economic opportunities and

966
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:18,240
freedom remaining an independent bug

967
00:40:14,609 --> 00:40:21,359
bounty hunter forever so you'll never

968
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:23,848
know who or what you may miss if you

969
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:26,640
price your incentives for bug bounty is

970
00:40:23,849 --> 00:40:28,349
way too high this is the problem that I

971
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,058
worry about with my friends at Apple I

972
00:40:28,349 --> 00:40:32,510
hope they find some of those

973
00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:34,859
million-dollar exploits but then what

974
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:37,859
what's the next generation going to look

975
00:40:34,859 --> 00:40:41,609
like for them how will they attract new

976
00:40:37,859 --> 00:40:43,549
players and invest in them and how will

977
00:40:41,609 --> 00:40:46,140
they retain the people that they have

978
00:40:43,549 --> 00:40:48,329
there will be career limitations for

979
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:50,368
folks inside of Apple I mean not

980
00:40:48,329 --> 00:40:52,890
everybody is gonna end up taking Tim

981
00:40:50,369 --> 00:40:55,500
Cook's job right you know especially not

982
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:58,109
from the technical engineering side of

983
00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:00,329
the house so what happens to those folks

984
00:40:58,109 --> 00:41:02,460
when they could just sit out the waiting

985
00:41:00,329 --> 00:41:06,270
period and then come back in and start

986
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:08,190
making millions and then finally this is

987
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:10,020
not good but bounties are not good for

988
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:12,029
data privacy unless you've really

989
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:14,009
thought through how are you gonna scope

990
00:41:12,029 --> 00:41:16,319
these issues how are you gonna handle

991
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:19,650
intentional or accidental breaches of

992
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:21,779
your terms if you are vulnerable to

993
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:23,609
heartbleed technically that requires a

994
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:25,529
small exfiltration of data in order to

995
00:41:23,609 --> 00:41:27,839
determine your vulnerability if your

996
00:41:25,529 --> 00:41:29,339
terms say thou shalt not exfiltrate data

997
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:32,099
that doesn't belong to you under any

998
00:41:29,339 --> 00:41:33,720
circumstances then guess what you may

999
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:35,760
have some hackers who will never come

1000
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,259
forward because they know that even

1001
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,869
testing for heartbleed is a technical

1002
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:41,819
violation of your terms or you'll have

1003
00:41:39,869 --> 00:41:43,500
people coming forward and then you have

1004
00:41:41,819 --> 00:41:45,450
a choice about what you do about it

1005
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:47,970
so often I tell organizations they have

1006
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:50,098
to prepare for when people deliberately

1007
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:53,368
or accidentally breach their data

1008
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:55,799
protection terms so what are you gonna

1009
00:41:53,369 --> 00:41:57,180
do go hack yourself seriously No

1010
00:41:55,799 --> 00:41:59,400
get out of here and go hack yourself

1011
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:01,589
right now but really what you need to do

1012
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:04,380
is understand where are you actually

1013
00:42:01,589 --> 00:42:07,078
missing personnel where are you missing

1014
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:08,670
processes what tools could you be

1015
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:11,099
running yourself to prevent phoner

1016
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:12,900
abilities in the first place - if you

1017
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:14,369
are one of those organizations that does

1018
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,749
write code what kind of secure

1019
00:42:14,369 --> 00:42:17,309
development lifecycle stuff are you

1020
00:42:15,749 --> 00:42:20,098
actually doing what are you learning

1021
00:42:17,309 --> 00:42:21,829
from every single bug every bug is an

1022
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:25,170
opportunity right

1023
00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:27,480
beware of perverse incentives and don't

1024
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:29,789
just automatically assume that hackers

1025
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:33,869
that we all do it just for money we

1026
00:42:29,789 --> 00:42:36,119
absolutely don't yeah bug Danny Botox

1027
00:42:33,869 --> 00:42:38,130
not a good look you actually have to be

1028
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:43,880
pretty on the inside - turns out in

1029
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:46,980
terms of your processes there's a ton of

1030
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:50,009
cultures that have this idea of balance

1031
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:53,130
between creation maintenance and

1032
00:42:50,009 --> 00:42:56,269
destruction and I think right now we are

1033
00:42:53,130 --> 00:43:00,299
over romanticizing destruction right

1034
00:42:56,269 --> 00:43:03,240
finding flaws constantly finding and not

1035
00:43:00,299 --> 00:43:06,299
having enough people personnel knowledge

1036
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:08,758
passed down practices passed down that

1037
00:43:06,299 --> 00:43:10,650
helped us nail the basics I never

1038
00:43:08,759 --> 00:43:14,539
thought that there would still be were

1039
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:17,549
mobile bugs in 2019 and yet here we are

1040
00:43:14,539 --> 00:43:19,680
so there's a lot of references I will

1041
00:43:17,549 --> 00:43:23,038
make the slides available so you don't

1042
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:26,430
have to photograph that but I will leave

1043
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:28,440
you with one thought in order to hack

1044
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:31,410
our labor market our labor market has to

1045
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:33,390
change the last 20 years in my

1046
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:35,089
professional career I have looked at

1047
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:38,430
rooms that look a lot like this one

1048
00:43:35,089 --> 00:43:41,009
right and how are we gonna change it

1049
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:42,868
well we need to borrow from other

1050
00:43:41,009 --> 00:43:44,489
disciplines this is a nurse who became

1051
00:43:42,869 --> 00:43:47,430
interested in cybersecurity when her

1052
00:43:44,489 --> 00:43:49,349
patients could be killed by remote

1053
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:51,180
attacks and embedded medical devices

1054
00:43:49,349 --> 00:43:52,710
she's now one of the best advocates for

1055
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:55,788
cybersecurity and building secure

1056
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:58,230
medical devices making them updatable

1057
00:43:55,789 --> 00:44:00,059
helping Institute vulnerability

1058
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:02,900
disclosure programs in those medical

1059
00:44:00,059 --> 00:44:05,470
devices borrowed from another discipline

1060
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:09,880
this person

1061
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:13,390
we had just won a CTF and when she was

1062
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:16,660
pregnant with this little person she was

1063
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:19,509
in a homeless shelter so when we look

1064
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:21,509
across our socioeconomic backgrounds and

1065
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:23,800
what we normally see in rooms like this

1066
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:26,890
we need to take a broader approach

1067
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:31,000
because we are not going to keep getting

1068
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:33,730
by with mostly male mostly white bug

1069
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:36,010
hunters around the world that is not

1070
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:38,339
actually going to solve our labor market

1071
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:41,500
crisis this is one of the most obvious

1072
00:44:38,339 --> 00:44:43,569
areas for us to expand now I will say

1073
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:46,240
one thing about this I've given you a

1074
00:44:43,569 --> 00:44:49,200
ton of information in this talk I would

1075
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:52,750
love for you guys to ask me questions

1076
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:54,250
about the stuff in this talk not about

1077
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:56,020
diversity inclusion even though I'm

1078
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:57,819
ending with it because guess what I

1079
00:44:56,020 --> 00:45:03,700
don't do diversity inclusion for a

1080
00:44:57,819 --> 00:45:06,339
living hire professionals who do and the

1081
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:09,310
last thing I will say is that we're

1082
00:45:06,339 --> 00:45:09,960
running a bug bounty buffet coming up in

1083
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:14,799
October

1084
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:18,339
so hack in the box is doing a what's

1085
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:20,650
called driven to pone competition and it

1086
00:45:18,339 --> 00:45:22,779
is a lot like pone to own in that there

1087
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:25,270
are a selection of targets but what's

1088
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:27,339
different about it is that vendors are

1089
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:28,960
invited and they can follow their own

1090
00:45:27,339 --> 00:45:32,380
vendor disclosure rules

1091
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:34,630
hackers can choose there's the driven to

1092
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:37,210
pone set of rules which are the 90 plus

1093
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:40,030
90 plus 90 rules which is basically you

1094
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:42,640
give the vendor 90 days to fix it you do

1095
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:44,500
a courtesy pause of 90 days for everyone

1096
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,609
to deploy the patch and then you do a

1097
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:49,089
courtesy pause and then you release

1098
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:50,440
everything open-source why because we're

1099
00:45:49,089 --> 00:45:53,078
trying to train up the next generation

1100
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:55,390
of people who can find and exploit these

1101
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:57,190
vulnerabilities ideally so that they

1102
00:45:55,390 --> 00:46:01,900
come to work for organizations to

1103
00:45:57,190 --> 00:46:04,630
prevent them so with that I will take

1104
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:07,420
any questions thank you wow thank you so

1105
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:08,589
much doesn't she deserve an awesome big

1106
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:12,480
round of applause

1107
00:46:08,589 --> 00:46:15,369
I think we're so lucky this is really a

1108
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:17,410
great a bonus surprise and and they were

1109
00:46:15,369 --> 00:46:17,750
lucky to be able to hear you today speak

1110
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:19,910
on

1111
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:21,770
bounty programs Katie so thank you so

1112
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:23,299
much really appreciate you stepping in

1113
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:26,120
at the eleventh hour and for your

1114
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:28,490
informative talk so now we have about

1115
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:31,370
five minutes left for questions before

1116
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:33,589
we go for coffee break we have two

1117
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:35,210
prizes to give away ones for the most up

1118
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:37,790
loaded question and one is for your

1119
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:39,260
favorite question so first I'll throw it

1120
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:40,040
open to the floor and then I'll go to

1121
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:41,840
Toledo

1122
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:44,660
so anyone any questions from the floor

1123
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:53,770
for Katie yes sir at the back with the

1124
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:56,600
red shirt hi do you prefer to open

1125
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:59,509
bounty program to the public or to

1126
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:04,130
private if it's public what's the issue

1127
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:06,050
that could be faced when open to public

1128
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:07,790
I believe that bug bounties should only

1129
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:09,800
be embarked upon with mature

1130
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:11,320
organizations who are already used to

1131
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:14,300
receiving vulnerability reports

1132
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:17,180
I believe that private bug bounties are

1133
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:19,940
mostly used as a tool to get people on

1134
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:22,160
to bug bounty platforms right and it

1135
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:24,950
mimics this sense of safety that you

1136
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:27,049
have with a traditional pen test but you

1137
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:28,279
typically will not get a lot of

1138
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:30,170
attention from the researchers

1139
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:32,510
especially if you're offering sort of

1140
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:35,150
lower amounts of money in the private

1141
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:38,390
program then a lot of public programs

1142
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:39,980
will offer right and it's lower amounts

1143
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:41,569
of money for low-hanging fruit and it's

1144
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:42,800
a lot of duplicates and everything like

1145
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:46,340
that so they know that they'll probably

1146
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:48,020
put in the work but not get paid so the

1147
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:49,910
answer to your first question is you

1148
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:52,330
know private versus public in terms of

1149
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:54,649
bug bounty I believe public is better

1150
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:55,730
because I believe that organizations

1151
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:58,580
should be mature enough to handle

1152
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:59,750
regular vulnerability reports and what

1153
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:02,319
was your second question can you ask an

1154
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:02,320
sorry

1155
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:09,980
was the issue or challenge that could be

1156
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:12,890
faced if open to publics

1157
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:16,880
ah okay issues and challenges open to

1158
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:19,910
the public well volume right dealing

1159
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:23,440
with your major bottleneck labor force

1160
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:27,020
which is not bug hunters but triage

1161
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:28,640
finding trusted triage partners if you

1162
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:30,349
don't have triage personnel yourself

1163
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:32,690
that you're willing to constantly train

1164
00:48:30,349 --> 00:48:34,490
and maintain is going to be a challenge

1165
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:36,170
but yeah it's usually signal-to-noise

1166
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:38,109
now if you've done your due diligence

1167
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:40,760
you cut down on that signal-to-noise

1168
00:48:38,109 --> 00:48:42,589
problem quite a bit because there aren't

1169
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:46,430
a lot of duplicates there isn't a lot of

1170
00:48:42,589 --> 00:48:48,020
spam okay next question okay great so

1171
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:49,669
we'll come to the questions on slide oh

1172
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:51,170
we have two questions which have equal

1173
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:52,700
number of votes the highest number of

1174
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:54,760
votes so that they're right behind you

1175
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:57,470
oh they're three now oh goodness

1176
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:58,730
okay all of them with six votes all of

1177
00:48:57,470 --> 00:49:01,250
them anonymous so you're not going to

1178
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:07,690
get your prize why don't you pick one

1179
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:07,690
Katie okay Oh shall I read it out to you

1180
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:15,789
I'm gonna stage I'm not I'm not very

1181
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:19,129
coordinated okay so let me just see um

1182
00:49:15,789 --> 00:49:20,210
maybe we can take two if you keep no not

1183
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:21,650
really because I didn't have a bathroom

1184
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:23,420
break before it okay so that's done now

1185
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:25,010
we're doing okay I tell you what make

1186
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:27,619
the second one because it's got seven

1187
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:29,809
votes okay okay all right is it now the

1188
00:49:27,619 --> 00:49:31,940
top one be nice it's and back doors both

1189
00:49:29,809 --> 00:49:33,650
are inherently bad in the wrong hands

1190
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:35,210
why would the government having a

1191
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:36,650
private exploit be better than them

1192
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:39,950
implementing backdoors and common

1193
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:43,660
software implementing backdoors hurts

1194
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:46,009
everyone for a very very long time

1195
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:47,720
having one exploit that may or may not

1196
00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:50,720
get killed in the next version of

1197
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:53,450
software is a much smaller problem and

1198
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:55,939
it doesn't inherently make that software

1199
00:49:53,450 --> 00:50:00,558
insecure for everyone what's that answer

1200
00:49:55,940 --> 00:50:02,230
that question I hope it did no crypto

1201
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:04,540
backdoors anyway

1202
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:06,280
okay one more quick question and then

1203
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:08,350
everything will have to happen after the

1204
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:11,200
coffee / bathroom break yes sir this

1205
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:13,810
gentleman here I'm then right here and

1206
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:15,580
then Katy you get to pick which gets the

1207
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:19,359
price oh okay all right

1208
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:21,819
hi yeah so my question is how is the

1209
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:23,950
buck bunty balanced on the other end of

1210
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:29,500
the rope with regards to racing the

1211
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:32,020
development teams competence like a lot

1212
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:35,440
of companies spend a lot with regards to

1213
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:36,850
back bug bounty programs but what are

1214
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:40,060
they doing on the other end like

1215
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:41,740
internally with their dev teams that is

1216
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:44,920
a great question and that actually is

1217
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:47,560
dependent vendor to vendor so not all

1218
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:49,869
vendors take those bugs as the learning

1219
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:53,500
opportunity that they really are the

1220
00:50:49,869 --> 00:50:56,020
most the lot of the advice that I give

1221
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:57,910
to vendors is when they say I'll look at

1222
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:59,859
this bug it came into our bug bounty

1223
00:50:57,910 --> 00:51:02,410
program thank goodness we paid that

1224
00:50:59,859 --> 00:51:04,650
person a thousand dollars and I said but

1225
00:51:02,410 --> 00:51:07,810
it's you know missing authentication

1226
00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:10,210
what why did you need to pay a stranger

1227
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:14,710
to tell you that right so anyway with

1228
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:16,270
that I'm gonna call it done yes unless

1229
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:18,070
somebody wants to like film a very

1230
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:20,560
unfortunate accident on stage no no

1231
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:22,540
we're done I think we're done it's okay

1232
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:24,310
I'm supposed to pick something yes so

1233
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:26,109
out of the two gentlemen who picked who

1234
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:27,670
asked you questions which one deserves

1235
00:51:26,109 --> 00:51:29,830
the price or both of who they boast is

1236
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:32,020
reprisal okay well then why how you both

1237
00:51:29,830 --> 00:51:33,319
get pride Thank You sama thank you a big

1238
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:36,409
round of applause for Katie

1239
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:36,409
[Applause]
