00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:28,220
hello every way good happened thank you

2
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:30,650
for supporting our topic

3
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:34,790
our topic is otherwise mutations a

4
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:39,110
semester for various protists okay next

5
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:41,510
about us and commuting kitchen proto

00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:58,879
security research and proto Francine

10
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:59,390
Shen's is a security in nature his suka

11
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,449
died

12
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:09,350
Krupa to research and proto security

13
00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:13,130
research my topic is for past the

14
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:16,820
firstly proto stake Genesis secondly

15
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:19,869
attacker Werner both drivers certainly

16
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:24,410
advanced mutagens passing and finally

17
00:01:19,869 --> 00:01:28,190
calculation okay about the world is

18
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:32,750
passing and there were less passing has

19
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:36,880
many advantages for example no vesicle

20
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:40,340
connect use no user in their

21
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:43,369
interrelation are required nor any

22
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:48,020
network connection is record as long as

23
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:50,810
their target is and is running you can

24
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:56,479
detect ur target being attacking maybe a

25
00:01:50,810 --> 00:02:00,200
mobile TVs and IOT TVs or a world module

26
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:02,690
under a car San Paulo The Sartorialist

27
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:06,020
driver passenger

28
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:10,220
turkey the devices crash to custards

29
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:14,450
attack and the overflow buffer overflow

30
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:19,160
because the payload is in the air so the

31
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:24,980
my cos crash okay

32
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:29,840
so firstly proto stake and Isis o 2001

33
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:33,620
belong to tur datalogger proto is is

34
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:36,440
earlier - proto third station use or MAC

35
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:41,210
address to community quickly sir

36
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:46,240
respondent under Rule 11 proto defends

37
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:52,490
three types or phrase management frames

38
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:55,550

45
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:27,320
frame and ACK frame of the control frame

46
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:29,780
okay next address tax six petals six

47
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:33,880

00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:48,650
management tester to total frame format

51
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:51,800
and deserves is there real files for

52
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:58,190
example frame counters text to battles

53
00:03:51,800 --> 00:04:03,730
Derrick's and ID text to metals okay so

54
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:03,730
secondly attack of verbal Trevor's

55
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:12,260
talking a society information elements

56
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:18,789
as an example SSID in for support is up

57
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:20,358
to 32 petals and super super minimal of

58
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:28,300
terror petals

59
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:32,359
sir enter proto supports a maximum of is

60
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:36,860
250 fill petals so we can construct a

61
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:42,310
panel device or ruin more than 32 petals

62
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:45,830
and the least 250 fell petals to test

63
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:49,939
because the driver is pythons or proto

64
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:52,789
stack buzzer driver can also added a

65
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:57,259
proto-tool function if the driver does

66
00:04:52,789 --> 00:05:03,139
not protect Trevor and the exception

67
00:04:57,259 --> 00:05:08,479
handling ETL caster colonel our driver

68
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:11,990
to crash we can choose their information

69
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:16,719
elements after frame for fasting taxing

70
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:22,550
for example supported the ritz

71
00:05:16,719 --> 00:05:25,039
honno-ji stories and p.m. frame the

72
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:32,449
picture is part of the information

73
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:35,959
organized after we can frame different

74
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:38,509
types are different types of frame

75
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:43,189
boria's country different information

76
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:47,089
elements 2000 proto certain term minimum

77
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:51,529
and maximum of is ornament certain

78
00:05:47,089 --> 00:05:55,399
information fills long long or short

79
00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:57,889
healers in starting taxing it stable

80
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:59,419
stable of the frame contains its own

81
00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:02,199
certain information

82
00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:02,198
ornaments okay

83
00:06:03,969 --> 00:06:11,180
there are until limit where types of

84
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:13,729
proto's you to todo a line is no

85
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:17,439
exceptions and he'll standard in the

86
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:24,079
able to total and produce is limited to

87
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:27,019
source and 304 battles interval of the

88
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:30,019
MTU is learn some of the ordinance of

89
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:33,499
mac header and louis after in

90
00:06:30,019 --> 00:06:42,069
crepitation it's not constant for

91
00:06:33,499 --> 00:06:49,279
example WEP is 2003 2346

92
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:58,759
wpa tkp his tools source and 358 and the

93
00:06:49,279 --> 00:07:02,590
WPA AES is 2354 in this case so my

94
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:09,060
future will limit either empty ovals to

95
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:16,979
around 1050 Enver okay so watch demo

96
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:21,970
this this is our classes windows kernel

97
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:24,340
or flow variability we stand or

98
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:28,270
constructs the payload the tutor windows

99
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:30,969
by finite car a network air when windows

100
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:50,469
resource payload is it will directly

101
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:53,919
custard kernel war flow okay sir nice

102
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:58,360
nurse ortley or the one seed notation

103
00:07:53,919 --> 00:08:01,830
something okay so earnest proto suppose

104
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:08,280
many standards satellites you - toda-ay

105
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:13,630
you - total NP and so in standards as

106
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:21,190
improving of the in speed frequency band

107
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:23,310
and panda base with so Trevor Pradesh oh

108
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:26,350
sorry

109
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:30,130
with third driver projects of proto

110
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:33,580
standard upgrade our vendor travel

111
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:36,460
secondly development which through the

112
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:39,479
grid or smart father and different the

113
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:43,290
device support is the different proto

114
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:49,330
standards at how different function

115
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:53,310
naturally it's or information tax carded

116
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:57,070
by their frames are not the same

117
00:08:53,310 --> 00:09:01,959
therefore is fast spice face further

118
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:05,589
specified trevor activist passing should

119
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:07,680
be performed for the proto frame

120
00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:12,970
information elements supported by

121
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:14,620
devices in addition to mutation there is

122
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:17,940
fairly is

123
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:21,600
that's supported it's necessary to

124
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:25,560
mutate or to party the fields and

125
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:31,810
however the process of mutation try to

126
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:37,150
comply with the rules after proton for

127
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:41,260
example we constructor payload of the

128
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:49,959
rich information elements we can clearly

129
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:53,500
see the piece of the puzzle so recent

130
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:56,830
set of turtle proto standard is update

131
00:09:53,500 --> 00:10:02,700
you to todo one that some first check

132
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:08,020
under reserving frame for example is mr

133
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:13,180
ridd information elements Israel does

134
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:20,130
not major always not recover this this

135
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:27,359
frame will no be password ok sensor hair

136
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:27,360
standard proto has been upgraded if will

137
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:38,700
you feel once or ever to reserve our

138
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:42,910
famous to task for posture FCS chick

139
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:45,900
we will first complete with the proto

140
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:51,850
had a standard but we can also reserve

141
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:56,740
photo to texture proto's robustness but

142
00:10:51,850 --> 00:11:06,790
their limitation of that will be much

143
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:11,470
hair ok so P so P can frame contents of

144
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:14,760
P I am frame T am caucus and so a proper

145
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:18,700
response does not answer pecan frame

146
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:23,910
contest or Q as capital e information

147
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:27,529
ornaments so proper response content or

148
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:35,120
requested information elements said may

149
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:40,300
been requested by protestation next Dino

150
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:43,730
mutation for a 4/4 frame Tigers have

151
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:47,949
some information elements parts of 302

152
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:51,399
total and proto superstition

153
00:11:47,949 --> 00:11:56,329
specification have some type information

154
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:58,850
lecture frame body so we can make

155
00:11:56,329 --> 00:12:02,660
mutation in the film body information

156
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:10,029
format and knowing in from information

157
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:15,589
format in this table information this

158
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:19,149
protocol PCM availability so protocol

159
00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:23,329
chip has a pack of init process to

160
00:12:19,149 --> 00:12:25,339
reserve pica frame so RS information

161
00:12:23,329 --> 00:12:28,370
ornaments of the beacon frame is an

162
00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:32,870
encrypted syndication information

163
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:40,160
elements include resn verson

164
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:45,500
t ki p hogg aes tag and a km so

165
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:50,149
therefore the will of a km tax is 0 and

166
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:56,480
1 if protocol reserved tax with a km

167
00:12:50,149 --> 00:13:07,449
will 250 file it will be dinner service

168
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:12,500
attack in addition we can also Pro from

169
00:13:07,449 --> 00:13:15,250

00:20:08,379 --> 00:20:13,519
okay good afternoon everyone

245
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:18,349
next let me explain the state machine in

246
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:19,970
2000 or 2001 and data in the agasshi

247
00:20:18,349 --> 00:20:22,609
needs to be performed us through

248
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:25,070
multiple states and easily roughly

249
00:20:22,609 --> 00:20:27,460
divided into three states because they

250
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:30,529
still one means a state that does not

251
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:32,509
require too much interaction state to

252
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:35,599
means multiple packets

253
00:20:32,509 --> 00:20:37,820
deputies status tree means kippo

254
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:40,220
connection and responder in the access

255
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:43,519
level the station next I will introduce

256
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:47,169
the importance of a state machine but

257
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:50,029
it's cussing how to faster station

258
00:20:47,169 --> 00:20:52,159
firstly let's consider the difference

259
00:20:50,029 --> 00:20:55,399
the PDF as a gaseous pond and a photo

260
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:57,619
station in Moustakas station sends

261
00:20:55,399 --> 00:21:00,469
requests the frame o2 at a certain point

262
00:20:57,619 --> 00:21:03,529
the Gazette upon understand response

263
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:06,559
Fremont to station justice in a response

264
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:08,419
promoted station does not work we need a

265
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:11,119
station to send request the free

266
00:21:08,419 --> 00:21:12,710
activity then we can query the error

267
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:15,738
response to photo station

268
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:19,159
Pajaro file station what we need is just

269
00:21:15,739 --> 00:21:22,340
the effector cell phone which has sniff

270
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:27,440
frame from ma station and the sender

271
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:29,689
response frame and this is a simple

272
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,299
integration in interaction with the

273
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:35,539
station and also the first step to

274
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:38,418
create a state machine our fake self on

275
00:21:35,539 --> 00:21:41,299
the broadcaster the car frame so the

276
00:21:38,419 --> 00:21:43,779
station can find a certain point when

277
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:47,029
the sacristan ponder receives the probe

278
00:21:43,779 --> 00:21:49,609
requests the farm station the intervals

279
00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:52,369
in the probable response to station

280
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:54,859
which contains our arrow payload and the

281
00:21:52,369 --> 00:21:58,189
fuzzy is starting similarly we can

282
00:21:54,859 --> 00:22:01,009
construct the next station status

283
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:04,220

Association one console charging the

285
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:07,809
state machine we must pay attention to

286
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:10,940
the particles

287
00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:13,549
specifications including the rest and

288
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:15,890
channels but we can also to the outside

289
00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:19,250
because fuzzy is orange

290
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:23,750
I expected an unexpected critical upon

291
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:27,860
the test similarly before attacking da

292
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:30,500
ba da repair - we already created a

293

00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:39,170
attention to the responsible problem

295
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:41,330
between particles and particles pimply

296
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:43,760
hosts different a network occurs and the

297
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:46,070
different doses will support different

298
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,230
arrests and the particles how do we

299
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:50,270
ensure the connection between the he was

300
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:53,090
and the target is the most conservative

301
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:55,520
because if the do us and the target do

302
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:57,649
not respond to each other even if your

causing a dosa attack although the

339
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:43,509

340
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,860
the float test Florida is annoying

341
00:24:43,509 --> 00:24:47,440
protocol vulnerability

342
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:48,340
vishka the net detected he divides over

343
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,880
a function table

344
00:24:48,340 --> 00:25:10,360
IPS but this vulnerability is on t

345
00:24:51,880 --> 00:25:13,139
degree Popeil WPS okay in fact the fast

346
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:16,629
tester has a lot of technical things but

347
00:25:13,139 --> 00:25:19,209
the difficulty of black balls in the

348
00:25:16,629 --> 00:25:21,519
greater than the white box adult pay

349
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:24,340
attention to detail and the be familiar

350
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:27,490
with the protocol then crater i use an

351
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:31,049
in the father okay it's a cushioning

352
