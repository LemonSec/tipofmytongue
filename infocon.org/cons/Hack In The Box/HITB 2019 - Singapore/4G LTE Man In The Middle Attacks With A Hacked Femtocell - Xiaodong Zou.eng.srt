1
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:24,220
hello everyone my name is Sheldon and

2
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:27,820
this talk is about 4G LTE and ourselves

3
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:30,490
and man in the middle deck

4
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:35,410
it's my second time to give an English

5
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:43,960
speech so I try to speak slowly and

6
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:49,419
clearly let's see the agendas

7
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:54,400
I will briefing introduction myself and

8
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:58,630
then talking about LTE land-run security

9
00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:02,500
in the real world and then I will talk

10
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:08,290
about how to route 40 femtocell and give

11
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:16,240
some details of the design of hacking

12
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:21,490
box focus on as when hacking so Who am I

13
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:27,179
I'm a hacker and a half since I am a 13

14
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:32,500
so this is my lifelong hobby to do

15
00:01:27,179 --> 00:01:36,340
telecom security research i'm

16
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:41,800
intrapreneur and educator in the daily

17
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:44,649
life and I do the security research and

18
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:47,490
spare time so when I go home or when I

19
00:01:44,649 --> 00:01:52,240
have some free time I do

20
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:56,949
hacking about telecom and I founded a

21
00:01:52,240 --> 00:02:00,669
very small private college called high

22
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:08,979
team Institute and they focus on IT

23
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:11,369
technologies so let's go into today's

24
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:11,369
talk

25
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:19,770
this is my collection of small small

26
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:19,770
sales I have more than a hundred of them

27
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:26,670
y:i tea industry because is femtocells

28
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:29,740
but in the telecommunication industry

29
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:35,140
these are called small cells

30
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:39,970
and some of them Santos I'll visit other

31
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:45,630
NATO little band and some called Pico

32
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:52,810
cell and nano cell microcell zero and

33
00:02:45,630 --> 00:03:00,670
this is my hallway pts this is a

34
00:02:52,810 --> 00:03:03,880
commercial pts actually in this picture

35
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:12,489
there are two of them this one Huawei

36
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:18,040
PBU and this one the same so why

37
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:20,670
purchase so many small cells it's mainly

38
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:29,130
because they are very cheap and very

39
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:29,130
easy to get from taobao.com and I

40
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:40,090
purchased more than 100 is for

41
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:45,910
statistics and for collection of the

42
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:49,060
older versions of Reyes and after all I

43
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:53,770
can using all this muscle to build up

44
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:58,210
our telecom labs in my college for

45
00:03:53,770 --> 00:04:03,520
training and for research so what I

46
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:07,900
discovered in the real world here in the

47
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:18,840
table you can see something interesting

48
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:28,150
is very few 40 small cells have IPSec

49
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:34,409
enabled and nearly all the positions

50
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:34,409
have default local measurement password

51
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:50,710
you see when the 2:04 gsm the cells

52
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:58,179
nearly all of them are using Internet as

53
00:04:50,710 --> 00:05:04,000
backhaul but 40 only have 5% that is

54
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:08,620
because the operator we have some

55
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:13,600
principle I said they should not use

56
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:19,210
third parties network as backhaul

57
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:28,110
so most of them using their own for my

58
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:33,520
probe private network as we want to hack

59
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:38,530
for this motel the first problem we so

60
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:44,200
face it is we can easily get them from

61
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:47,169
trouble but really work properly because

62
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:51,130
they are using private network as

63
00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:57,219
backhaul since 4G internet backhaul

64
00:05:51,130 --> 00:06:03,909
it is hard to get that's why I'm trying

65
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:08,910
to build up proxy server this is the 4G

66
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:12,630
LTE network and logical architecture and

67
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:18,190
this is a run the radio access network

68
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:27,360
and this you note B is the P space

69
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:33,010
station and the this is more detailed of

70
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:36,070
logical architecture for small cells we

71
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:41,789
can see there are three more devices

72
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:46,930
here just for small cell access networks

73
00:06:41,789 --> 00:06:48,580
the first one is a CTW which means a

74
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:56,160
security gateway

75
00:06:48,580 --> 00:07:00,630
is provide IPSec to authentication and

76
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:07,870
encryption of the communication between

77
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:11,440
home may not be and Mme this communities

78
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:17,320
also called femtocells or small cells

79
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:21,640
and the second one is ACS is Auto

80
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:28,180
configuration server since there are

81
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:31,500
maybe in China maybe more than 40,000

82
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:36,190
small cells and in a big city

83
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:40,600
we need to management and two men

84
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:50,320
managed by Auto config server and the

85
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:58,110
running at TR 6 9 and the last one is a

86
00:07:50,320 --> 00:08:06,430
TMP gateway which provide aggregation of

87
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:11,400
astronomy and all as when you so there

88
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:15,940
are two protocols here whereas when you

89
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:22,109
which carries the user plant data and

90
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:27,870
the other one is as one Yi is for

91
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:27,870
control plan is for us signaling

92
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:39,880
so why focus on small sell securities

93
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:44,359
because more than 50 cellular traffic's

94
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:46,550
is consumed indoors and the most paid

95
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:51,350
applications are expected to be used

96
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:57,859
indoors and there will be a huge amount

97
00:08:51,350 --> 00:09:01,370
of small sales in five years all these

98
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:05,180
small cells are very cheap and not so

99
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:08,030
secure and could be physically

100
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:11,839
physically touched by attackers

101
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:19,069
that's why focus on a small cell

102
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:24,460
security the back hole of the small cell

103
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:29,330
is also part of the access network so

104
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:34,970
let me give you some briefings most of

105
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:39,770
the backhaul of small cell using X 1

106
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:44,590
which means if on a palm so there will

107
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:49,069
be a Cooper UTP or fiber maybe to onu

108
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:58,640
visually the access point of the expand

109
00:09:49,070 --> 00:10:07,250
a network and some of them may be fewer

110
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:16,689
than x1 is Fijian or appear on these are

111
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:20,660
the operators private Transnet work and

112
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:23,350
very few scenario they are using

113
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,350
Internet

114
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:40,439
so there are flaws in the small cell

115
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:51,060
back home because IPSec is optional

116
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:51,060
during a 3gpp the asthma management plan

117
00:10:52,800 --> 00:11:06,699
should be protected by IPSec but in case

118
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:12,280
the environment is trusted IPSec is is

119
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:17,380
an operator optional so in the real

120
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:21,189
world the protein the practical since

121
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:26,610
external network is secure so the

122
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:33,370
operator consider it as trusted network

123
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:38,589
and network cable either fiber or cooler

124
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:40,510
from the small cell to the OAU which

125
00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:46,270
could be a hundred meters long

126
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:51,160
I was just ignored by the operators so

127
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:57,370
they they see all of this as trusted

128
00:11:51,160 --> 00:12:01,150
network so they do not provide IPSec

129
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:05,020
protection and which cause the network

130
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:09,670
traffic's in most of the cables are not

131
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:13,150
protected so which means they are all up

132
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:22,709
in text and open to man in the middle

133
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:27,339
attack now let me introduce some of

134
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:34,839
small cells this one is from Ericsson

135
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:36,499
and it's called a Pico cell because all

136
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:41,079
of the

137
00:12:36,499 --> 00:12:41,079
small-cell the front of South in China

138
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:52,758
they how to obey the the use of the

139
00:12:48,729 --> 00:12:57,859
operators so the China Mobile defined as

140
00:12:52,759 --> 00:13:07,100
a standard of Pico cell which means it

141
00:12:57,859 --> 00:13:19,279
have about 250 V the power of the Pico

142
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:22,819
cell and this line you don't need you

143
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:26,839
don't need to do any work to root it

144
00:13:22,819 --> 00:13:31,998
because it come with a root shell and as

145
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:37,039
SD is opened so when I fire with the

146
00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:47,109
default username and the password is SSH

147
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:56,499
I can just log in and here you can see

148
00:13:47,109 --> 00:14:02,509
the password and the shadow file and

149
00:13:56,499 --> 00:14:08,779
here the interesting thing is the 22 the

150
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:14,899
presented who is opened to all the

151
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:19,779
interface which means if I have a local

152
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:27,049
connection a local root access to this

153
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:29,689
small cell then I can access I can gain

154
00:14:27,049 --> 00:14:33,769
root access for all the other of

155
00:14:29,689 --> 00:14:40,159
femtocells in the same network through

156
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:43,149
through the one interface here you can

157
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:48,710
see a line interface as a wine interface

158
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:52,460
so I can gain root access from

159
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:57,100
interface and through an I can access

160
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:57,100
all other Ericsson femtocells

161
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:11,480
and this one is my favorite one is

162
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:18,950
called canva combi this one is from top

163
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:27,740
three small cylinder in China and it is

164
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:33,230
small easy to carry but by default there

165
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:39,820
is no internet no network access either

166
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:41,450
a telnet or SSH so I have to open it and

167
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:47,270
from the board

168
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:54,680
I can see UART printed here so I tried

169
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:59,470
to use this UART to your USB and I can

170
00:15:54,680 --> 00:16:06,279
get to your are Kiki device from this

171
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:11,390
sixteenth one of them is from a system

172
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:16,550
running CPU age and the other one is CPU

173
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:20,209
l the CPU age is well protected

174
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:27,020
I don't have the username and password

175
00:16:20,209 --> 00:16:35,890
but the CPU l when I connected using

176
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:47,740
Pico calm and here I get the root prompt

177
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:49,910
so by explore the file dir of the system

178
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:52,610
in the root directory

179
00:16:49,910 --> 00:17:01,179
I found these files

180
00:16:52,610 --> 00:17:01,179
and there is a gate foul and sinful

181
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:10,069
which I can use to just get the file

182
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:14,389
from the other system the CPU age so I

183
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:16,459
guess the password and the shadow and I

184
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:20,480
modified the password and the shadow

185
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:26,179
file and using cinephile to send the

186
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:33,169
file back so I changed the password of

187
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:41,990
the other system and also using the same

188
00:17:33,169 --> 00:17:46,730
method I cooperated the RCS this RCS to

189
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:55,090
the CPU LC system and modified to add

190
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:59,750
eternity and sshd so I get your shell

191
00:17:55,090 --> 00:18:06,639
from local interface local network

192
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:06,639
interface so it's kind of easy and

193
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:25,070
there is question about how do I know

194
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:29,320
the directory structures well there is

195
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:34,700
another flaw of the local measurement

196
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:40,010
system is using web interface there is a

197
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:46,580
floor so I can download that every

198
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:50,200
directory in the file system I just by

199
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:57,740
insert a command to the local management

200
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:59,960
interface so that they will compress the

201
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:03,170
directory and copy it to the web

202
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:10,330
directory and then I can download it

203
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:18,860
from the web interface and this one is

204
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:23,389
from ZTE maybe this is a large the

205
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:31,939
motional largest small cell vendors in

206
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:39,470
China so it also routed and this one is

207
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:42,590
from wowie since it's very sustainable

208
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:45,170
to talk about hobby so I'm not going to

209
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:48,800
the details of this one and this one is

210
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:53,890
from downtown also my favorite event

211
00:19:48,800 --> 00:20:00,220
because this is various more devices I

212
00:19:53,890 --> 00:20:07,610
can carry it everywhere in my backpack

213
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:11,630
but the code since I have disassembly

214
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:14,649
the ollie from where the code of this

215
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:14,650
one is awful

216
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:23,200
what we can get when we routed the

217
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:30,390
Thunder cell first

218
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:35,380
we can see all the SMS or in plain text

219
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:40,750
in 40 networks SMS delivered a two ways

220
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:48,580
one is our nos which is using the

221
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:56,100
signaling channel this one and C using

222
00:20:48,580 --> 00:21:06,189
an ass download transfer and this is the

223
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:12,059
plain text of the SMS and then another

224
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:19,929
kind of SMS delivery methods of SMS our

225
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:25,480
IMS which means via voice over LTE you

226
00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:38,350
can see here about sleep it says sip and

227
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:46,679
SMS actually the same thing we can see

228
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:46,678
the syntax of SMS this is SMS from Bank

229
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:59,129
and about the phone call when the user

230
00:21:53,649 --> 00:21:59,129
the subscriber I have a voltage enabled

231
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:10,480
we can see all the SIP n are here and

232
00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:18,789
you can save it using a third-party a

233
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:20,730
player to play this phone call and of

234
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:29,010
course we can see all the internet

235
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:29,010
transfer obeys CPU

236
00:22:30,139 --> 00:22:41,158
and compromise femtocell

237
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:45,179
can act as an MZ catcher a more at the

238
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:50,789
long side in the catcher so we can get a

239
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:59,700
IP of the subscriber MZ sometime I me I

240
00:22:50,789 --> 00:23:04,260
or GPS locations but if they if if a

241
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:07,590
subscriber have voted in a boat we can

242
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:13,860
get more more detailed personal

243
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:19,470
informations here you can see we taught

244
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:21,049
and we can get the phone number phone

245
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:30,149
number

246
00:23:21,049 --> 00:23:41,000
yes the phone number and the MZ the IP

247
00:23:30,149 --> 00:23:41,000
address and cell ID and and I'm a yeah

248
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:52,399
so when the subscriber handed over to

249
00:23:50,039 --> 00:24:00,809
our femtocell

250
00:23:52,399 --> 00:24:04,379
they will perform sits register during

251
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:19,139
these procedures all these informations

252
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:21,480
will transfer in a safe protocol how to

253
00:24:19,139 --> 00:24:24,120
route a femtocell versa

254
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:28,679
we should purchase a working femtocell

255
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:32,729
and they try to get root shell and after

256
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:38,240
week a little shell we should to try to

257
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:41,840
get the IPSec keys if the IPSec is

258
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:45,110
enabled after

259
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:54,970
we could reverse dropping the all the

260
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:59,810
network traffic's and if you could

261
00:24:54,970 --> 00:25:02,930
program maybe you could prefer my in the

262
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:08,629
middle attacks and I try to attack the

263
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:15,470
core network the tools to route a

264
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:23,000
femtocell yes we have digital meter this

265
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:26,780
one is for the tab to test to test the

266
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:40,430
yard he pins and this one is for your

267
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:47,240
ERT this is for JTAG and the pass high

268
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:49,610
rate is for Emir enumerate the pins of

269
00:25:47,240 --> 00:26:01,160
the UART and jtagulator

270
00:25:49,610 --> 00:26:05,080
immune enumerate jtag and UART pins if

271
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:11,900
not if all the above and not working we

272
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:17,870
the last thing we can do is so the flash

273
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:21,520
chip off and using this flash programmer

274
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:25,729
just read out the firmware and try to

275
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:28,820
decryption and the disassembly it and

276
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:33,800
modify the firmware and flash it back

277
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:42,169
and the soda so that I see the flash

278
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:47,950
back to the board most of the from the

279
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:54,830
cells are using the SOP 48 and Huawei

280
00:26:47,950 --> 00:27:01,730
and the ZTE using top-50

281
00:26:54,830 --> 00:27:10,939
56 the software to route stand aside

282
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:14,810
about include TR o 69 SES server are

283
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:19,300
using jinni ACS is to update firmware

284
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:25,940
and upload modify the configuration and

285
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:35,330
era and the QEMU open OCD is for attack

286
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:39,940
debugging and so that's all now we have

287
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:47,169
a compromiser Thunder cell which is not

288
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:47,170
very big for example this one a combi I

289
00:27:47,530 --> 00:28:02,240
this battery pack and 4040 internet a

290
00:27:56,870 --> 00:28:04,090
loader which can provide the internet

291
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:07,790
access to the backhaul

292
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:12,189
you can pack all this in your backpack

293
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:18,820
and we go to some somewhere for example

294
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:26,480
start rocks and tear on the femtocell

295
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:31,550
and to see the phone nearby two guys I

296
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:34,370
said in especially they have a vote on a

297
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:37,220
board so you guys had a telephone number

298
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:46,060
the phone number of everyone nearby is

299
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:46,060
about a four to maybe 50 meters nearby

300
00:28:49,420 --> 00:29:01,250
well how to make a good head femtocell

301
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:04,310
portable if the fungal cell come comes

302
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:06,800
with Internet backhaul then you are

303
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:12,470
lucky you just need a battery pack

304
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:13,669
and portable for the rotor but sometimes

305
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:20,060
you're not lucky

306
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:23,800
so you you will get working some

307
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:28,909
yourself but with a private backhaul

308
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:31,520
what you can do is just add an Internet

309
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:36,770
access point it will this private

310
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:41,590
vehicle after this you can carry the

311
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:45,320
femtocell everywhere you want after this

312
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:49,760
you should say maybe I could connect

313
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:52,419
more not just this one and I need more

314
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:58,450
Thunder cells

315
00:29:52,420 --> 00:30:03,980
so how can you connect more femtocell

316
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:09,940
and after you can connect more of the

317
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:15,500
tons of cells maybe you should think by

318
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:20,270
Oliver swapping why not to do some in

319
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:30,620
the middle attacks so this is the idea

320
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:34,000
of hacking box of s1 come from but if

321
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:39,050
you are unlucky you get a femtocell

322
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:42,980
which is not working anymore mostly

323
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:46,520
because they are using private backhaul

324
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:51,140
but you get in you get this from

325
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:55,150
internet from Taobao so you cannot put

326
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:58,400
in place it into the private network or

327
00:30:55,150 --> 00:31:01,880
it has a internet than hope as the

328
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:07,640
operator disable the access of this time

329
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:11,630
to sell so you the thing only you can do

330
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:14,150
maybe to build up using this right time

331
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:16,770
to sell to people have a test

332
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:21,420
environment to

333
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:25,790
test telecom security or I would hear

334
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:29,910
security which means you can use this

335
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:35,030
sample cell as a you note B and you how

336
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:35,030
to set up your own call network and

337
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:55,800
using the your own SIM card and so after

338
00:31:51,620 --> 00:32:06,059
we figure out we need an internet access

339
00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:06,659
point after the design of the access

340
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:10,860
point

341
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:17,490
I have find that there there are more

342
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:23,129
wide range of scenarios most of them are

343
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:28,410
attacking scenarios so it's not only the

344
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:36,300
femtocell these private backhaul not

345
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:41,190
owning this but you can using it at any

346
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:46,860
backhaul result IPSec protection which

347
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:49,110
means you may not get the you know to be

348
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:52,760
you may get the access further you know

349
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:56,159
to be and but you can physically

350
00:32:52,760 --> 00:33:00,750
physically attached the backhaul the

351
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:06,679
cable of the backhaul then you can

352
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:11,990
perform this attack for example my call

353
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:16,710
base station my cross station in power

354
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:24,809
and at the top of a power and they have

355
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:30,210
fiber and connections a fiber cables may

356
00:33:24,809 --> 00:33:40,649
be in your buildings or you can touch it

357
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:46,740
so you can perform this and if there are

358
00:33:40,649 --> 00:33:49,709
the are IPSec protection but you can use

359
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:55,230
the femtocell or the base station you

360
00:33:49,710 --> 00:34:05,279
can also have this man in the middle

361
00:33:55,230 --> 00:34:10,109
attacks so what we are talking about is

362
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:14,010
hacking the the interface here the S

363
00:34:10,109 --> 00:34:19,799
line interface this is a signaling this

364
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:31,309
is the data but it's only one line one

365
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:35,429
cable so we could attack it the protocol

366
00:34:31,309 --> 00:34:39,079
in the back hole is not only in the user

367
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:44,700
plan and the control plan but also

368
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:54,619
network management based HTTP and HTTPS

369
00:34:44,699 --> 00:35:01,160
and IP sex sometimes so this one is a

370
00:34:54,619 --> 00:35:08,190
back hoe the implant as a backhaul and

371
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:14,118
the hacking box of s1 I name it so it

372
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:17,750
has to are they 545 opposed it has a

373
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:17,750
using slot and

374
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:36,480
have a mini pcie 4G module so we can

375
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:41,460
have an Internet access and there are

376
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:44,250
two modes of the hacking box one is get

377
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:50,390
away mode and the other is transparent

378
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:53,760
mode the Keathley mode you need to

379
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:57,420
modify you need to be able to modify the

380
00:35:53,760 --> 00:36:02,900
configuration of the you know to be to

381
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:11,220
change the IP address of the mm EE to

382
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:16,980
the IP address of the hacking box and I

383
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:20,580
modify the source code from SRS LTE to

384
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:23,460
beautiful is a gateway this canary is

385
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:27,200
just working like a home node big

386
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:30,540
gateway which offers a control plane

387
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:38,310
aggregation and user playing aggregation

388
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:43,770
sometime after the aggregation it will

389
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:51,029
enable the Mme the year was the core

390
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:54,150
network to see a cluster of to sell many

391
00:36:51,030 --> 00:37:01,290
central cells as owning vines and to

392
00:36:54,150 --> 00:37:06,839
sell there for you can add as many as

393
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:13,410
you want but the core network cannot

394
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:17,970
discourage and by using t3 mode we can

395
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:26,339
perform my in the middle attacks as I AP

396
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:28,980
and GPU here is some little details

397
00:37:26,339 --> 00:37:31,100
about home you know the period very

398
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:33,489
aggregation

399
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:39,669
[Music]

400
00:37:33,489 --> 00:37:45,890
most of the femtocells or small sales

401
00:37:39,669 --> 00:37:57,199
networks in the real world they have

402
00:37:45,890 --> 00:38:00,618
this device why the operators and this

403
00:37:57,199 --> 00:38:03,279
device because the van will reduce the

404
00:38:00,619 --> 00:38:07,130
signaling trailer for the core network

405
00:38:03,279 --> 00:38:10,009
so this is a you know to be this is

406
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:14,630
another you know to be both of them has

407
00:38:10,009 --> 00:38:15,829
two connections wiseass van Mme the

408
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:20,809
other is s on you

409
00:38:15,829 --> 00:38:27,619
so after aggregation to Mme only one

410
00:38:20,809 --> 00:38:32,709
link and another link to the s DW this

411
00:38:27,619 --> 00:38:32,709
prior provide a user plan based transfer

412
00:38:32,739 --> 00:38:46,689
so all we should do to is to build up a

413
00:38:40,729 --> 00:38:59,589
very simple ATM big gateway for the

414
00:38:46,689 --> 00:39:04,759
aggregation after aggregation so we can

415
00:38:59,589 --> 00:39:11,719
provide the access for as many Samuel

416
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:19,369
cell as you want and another mode is

417
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:21,979
transparent mode so in some scenario you

418
00:39:19,369 --> 00:39:24,349
cannot you do not have the ability to

419
00:39:21,979 --> 00:39:25,999
modify the configuration of the you know

420
00:39:24,349 --> 00:39:29,769
the B so you cannot change the IP

421
00:39:25,999 --> 00:39:29,769
address of the enemy

422
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:38,240
well so maybe you need that the

423
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:42,980
transparent mode in this mode we can

424
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:53,950
only perform my in the middle attack on

425
00:39:42,980 --> 00:40:03,310
you the plan so let me explain this the

426
00:39:53,950 --> 00:40:10,730
key point here is to how kernel module

427
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:14,960
it's a PPF filter to unpack and repack

428
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:23,120
that you keep he you protocol that the

429
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:28,880
packet so if you find a TCP packet which

430
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:33,970
contains a address of your target and

431
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:37,310
maybe your target a webserver a bank or

432
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:43,810
Facebook I don't know so you find this

433
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:48,320
and you're using the kernel module to

434
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:54,460
repair key impact that the header of the

435
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:58,880
IP and then I he can forward to your

436
00:40:54,460 --> 00:41:06,500
mind in the middle server and the

437
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:14,150
response back here so you should modify

438
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:17,870
the the IP address to the original like

439
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:23,780
Facebook server address in modified days

440
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:29,960
and you add the gtp head to the packet

441
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:31,950
and then forwarded to the you know the

442
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:35,020
be and it'll be a to the UE

443
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:35,020
[Music]

444
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:46,640
maybe you can perform the manual in the

445
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:52,400
middle attack using DNS so when you find

446
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:54,709
there is a DNS lookup and you can change

447
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:59,539
the DNS server that the IP address of

448
00:41:54,709 --> 00:42:04,569
the DNS server to your own DNS server so

449
00:41:59,539 --> 00:42:11,709
you can give a fake IP address back

450
00:42:04,569 --> 00:42:18,079
after modified the IP address and the

451
00:42:11,709 --> 00:42:23,779
gtp had back and send it back for the

452
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:31,910
subscriber thus you can perform das

453
00:42:23,779 --> 00:42:36,049
paste man in the middle attack oh you

454
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:40,959
shouldn't maintain a map in the memory

455
00:42:36,049 --> 00:42:48,769
about the IP address and the tid of the

456
00:42:40,959 --> 00:42:54,529
of the TCP packet so they say the detail

457
00:42:48,769 --> 00:43:00,558
of the transparent mode the limitation

458
00:42:54,529 --> 00:43:06,499
of the hacking box if you're working in

459
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:09,190
a transparent mode only you can only did

460
00:43:06,499 --> 00:43:15,218
you a user plan datatex

461
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:18,170
you can perform so it's very hard to

462
00:43:15,219 --> 00:43:27,709
attack the control plan attack because

463
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:36,469
of the integrity check of the memory to

464
00:43:27,709 --> 00:43:38,538
the UE so you cannot break the integrity

465
00:43:36,469 --> 00:43:41,660
check you cannot perform the

466
00:43:38,539 --> 00:43:45,039
man-in-the-middle attack to the control

467
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:45,038
plane and

468
00:43:45,819 --> 00:43:53,480
you can notice s provide more you know

469
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:56,650
the bxs in this mode you know

470
00:43:53,480 --> 00:44:04,220
transparent mode because you cannot

471
00:43:56,650 --> 00:44:09,109
perform the aggregation of the van

472
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:12,890
Mme ye protocol but you know Keithley

473
00:44:09,109 --> 00:44:18,440
mode not only you can perform a user

474
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:23,299
plan attacks but you can also from the

475
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:26,540
limited of a control plan attack in the

476
00:44:23,299 --> 00:44:33,190
user plan attacks if the user have the

477
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:33,190
voter enabled sometimes you can also

478
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:47,439
modify or manipulate the SIP package

479
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:47,440
which contains the SMS or phone calls

480
00:44:50,799 --> 00:45:01,490
so in the Echidna mode become performant

481
00:44:57,650 --> 00:45:09,640
and all the marido in the middle attacks

482
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:14,270
we can in 40 Archie environment but very

483
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:19,160
little attacks on the control plan

484
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:23,690
because integrity integrity check cannot

485
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:28,520
be broken if you don't have a very

486
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:34,849
successful account and network but if

487
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:39,920
you use a half of the diameter I access

488
00:45:34,849 --> 00:45:45,470
point for the HSS you can access a

489
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:49,180
memory and you can get all the keys from

490
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:55,669
HSS then you can perform the full

491
00:45:49,180 --> 00:46:05,160
control plan attacks okay that's

492
00:45:55,670 --> 00:46:17,730
about a hacking box of aztlán so that's

493
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:20,460
all about today's talk and a catchment I

494
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:23,910
see that like you had maybe six to seven

495
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:27,450
here I see that you had like six to

496
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:29,970
seven different femtocells I think you

497
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:33,060
played with them so how many of them had

498
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:34,439
the backhaul access or or did it happen

499
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:36,540
that in the beginning when you try to

500
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:39,090
plug it to the network maybe you had

501
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:41,040
backhaul access but but after some days

502
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:43,080
or some time operator recognized that

503
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:46,259
okay maybe this is a stupid device and

504
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:48,020
then he removed you from the access so

505
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:51,120
did it happen something like this or

506
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:59,900
could you comment on all this yes it

507
00:46:51,120 --> 00:47:03,810
happens I have in the picture I have

508
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:08,610
more than I think 70 femtocells

509
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:11,370
but among all of this they have maybe

510
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:17,070
three or four of them have backhaul

511
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:21,779
access from the internet and but that

512
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:25,200
you can see the 3G or 3G some no cell

513
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:30,870
they are very small and more than half

514
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:36,230
of them have internet as backhaul but as

515
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:43,319
time going on going after one year

516
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:45,560
nearly 30 percent of them lose access to

517
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,560
the

518
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:56,839
security gateway a same thing happened

519
00:47:50,119 --> 00:48:03,910
to the 40 Thunder cell among four of

520
00:47:56,839 --> 00:48:08,890
them one is losing access after maybe

521
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:12,740
Naima's so the operator

522
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:19,460
really do some security check but not so

523
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:21,859
often so I have two questions first of

524
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:23,839
all funnily enough I she works on the

525
00:48:21,859 --> 00:48:26,749
original design for these femtocells

526
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:28,849
back in the early 2000s as part of

527
00:48:26,749 --> 00:48:29,839
Vodafone I worked with Huawei in

528
00:48:28,849 --> 00:48:32,119
alcatel-lucent

529
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:35,799
to design some security form and it's

530
00:48:32,119 --> 00:48:38,839
interesting to see how it's not evolved

531
00:48:35,799 --> 00:48:39,920
one of the requirements that was put in

532
00:48:38,839 --> 00:48:42,980
was that there was going to be a

533
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:45,740
location lock in these devices so GPS

534
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:47,359
etc to make sure that you couldn't put

535
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:49,399
it in a backpack and walk around with it

536
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:51,499
or take it to other countries it doesn't

537
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:55,999
seem to me like you're finding anything

538
00:48:51,499 --> 00:48:58,970
like that now are you finding GPS locks

539
00:48:55,999 --> 00:49:02,988
inside the home no none of them in China

540
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:07,160
but I know as some of maybe nearly all

541
00:49:02,989 --> 00:49:12,170
of them neither all the femtocell South

542
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:16,180
in u.s. they have location locked some

543
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:19,430
of based on to care some of this IP or

544
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:20,749
neighbor cell ya know and radio

545
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:23,210
fingerprint was your thing they're

546
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:24,589
supposed to be using that's interesting

547
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:26,390
so and the other one which is

548
00:49:24,589 --> 00:49:29,359
potentially a controversial question is

549
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:31,058
in all your analysis have you found

550
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:39,230
anything that looks like backdoors

551
00:49:31,059 --> 00:49:45,739
inside any the femtocells there are too

552
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:51,140
many vulnerabilities in the binaries so

553
00:49:45,739 --> 00:49:53,960
I cannot find the device back door maybe

554
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:56,250
some of them I will really back doors I

555
00:49:53,960 --> 00:50:01,030
don't know

556
00:49:56,250 --> 00:50:04,620
thank you do we have any more questions

557
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:04,620
in the floor before we move on to slider

558
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:11,890
thank you my question is similar to what

559
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:15,540
the gentleman before me just asked I

560
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:18,520
wanted to understand has there been any

561
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:21,940
improvements or evolve or evolving in

562
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:24,970
the security because it seems that this

563
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:27,610
is very the status that the femtocells

564
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:29,770
are in at now the way you've described

565
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:31,900
them they seem to be quite the same as

566
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:34,330
what they were like five ten five years

567
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:36,340
ago for example when femtocells starts

568
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:39,790
first started being used in 3G networks

569
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:42,730
so how is it that you know no no

570
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:44,920
improvements have been made or are we

571
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:47,670
are you looking only at old products or

572
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:54,960
how how new is your newest femtocell

573
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:59,080
that you tested some of them are very

574
00:50:54,960 --> 00:51:03,660
very new so I bought this Thunder cell

575
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:09,040
maybe Arabic from Taobao or from the

576
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:15,180
outsource company of the operators we

577
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:15,180
have some samples have left after

578
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:27,130
project the survey surveys so the burden

579
00:51:21,490 --> 00:51:32,729
I research a very new but I cannot find

580
00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:37,900
any improvement of security but in the

581
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:41,500
2g 3G because most of them are using

582
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:46,720
Internet and backhaul I could find some

583
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:49,390
of them have IP address log hard

584
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:54,939
protection which means if you are using

585
00:51:49,390 --> 00:51:58,779
this yeah another promise you connected

586
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:59,350
you can connect it to the circuit we

587
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:05,050
heard a gateway

588
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:12,279
but the handshake stop sometimes after

589
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:15,920
the stuff after sometime so it cannot

590
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:24,580
perform the real connection to that

591
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:30,950
video connect to the core network yes so

592
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:34,930
the main main point about the HB OS a

593
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:40,250
hacking box I think other working with

594
00:52:34,930 --> 00:52:44,089
the femtocell Montaigne yeah

595
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:48,230
maybe a business area maybe your company

596
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:54,470
so I you know war in the roof or on a

597
00:52:48,230 --> 00:53:03,230
war and the the cable may be in a corner

598
00:52:54,470 --> 00:53:05,959
and a band stairs to maybe to the when

599
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:08,830
you where they're located maybe in the

600
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:16,780
basement I don't know so so you can

601
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:22,310
change the cable modified the cable

602
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:28,610
sensi senior company or the the

603
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:34,279
government you have to control so you

604
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:36,440
don't need to buy from a table all don't

605
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:41,480
you don't need to purchase these Thunder

606
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:44,330
cells because in five years there maybe

607
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:48,890
my name is most cells and near you you

608
00:53:44,330 --> 00:53:54,529
can I cite some of them so all you need

609
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:57,379
to do is just to implant this hacking

610
00:53:54,530 --> 00:54:00,770
box I have another question

611
00:53:57,380 --> 00:54:03,740
so some of the vulnerabilities you you

612
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:06,259
described earlier on our relate or are

613
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:08,020
depending on you knowing the username

614
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:09,790
and password

615
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:12,070
they probably default or easy to guess

616
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:14,110
what if they were actually implemented

617
00:54:12,070 --> 00:54:16,600
in the network where the operator has

618
00:54:14,110 --> 00:54:19,050
Depot has a very good strong part of a

619
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:21,730
security policy and it's not easy to

620
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:27,010
mean you don't know the user name and

621
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:31,000
password are you still able to yes if

622
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:33,340
you have enough time sooner or later you

623
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:36,370
will get full control of this device

624
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:40,900
even if there's a strong policy yes how

625
00:54:36,370 --> 00:54:45,810
so maybe several days or maybe a

626
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:47,560
bomb-ass okay you just keep trying yes

627
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:51,250
okay thank you

628
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:52,600
I think we have a few minutes left if

629
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:56,080
there are any more questions on the

630
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:58,210
floor no ok can we perhaps answer

631
00:54:56,080 --> 00:55:04,990
there's a couple of hi voted questions

632
00:54:58,210 --> 00:55:07,170
on the screen there okay the first line

633
00:55:04,990 --> 00:55:13,359
how much they cost

634
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:19,060
well it's just the cost of the small

635
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:23,560
cell in in China I can buy one of them

636
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:29,770
may be nearly 200 yen it's about 30 US

637
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:34,240
dollars in Taba so you have a you know

638
00:55:29,770 --> 00:55:38,890
to be purchased from internet and

639
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:42,129
there's a core network it's just using

640
00:55:38,890 --> 00:55:46,509
your PC's or your PC server and then you

641
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:55,540
need a SIM card reader and some of the

642
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:58,650
some blank SIM card so that's all second

643
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:58,650
one how can i video

644
00:56:03,099 --> 00:56:11,500
well I think they cannot detect right

645
00:56:09,319 --> 00:56:11,500
now

646
00:56:11,589 --> 00:56:21,700
they cannot detect the man-in-the-middle

647
00:56:14,089 --> 00:56:21,700
attacks but they could maybe find some

648
00:56:22,329 --> 00:56:39,349
some of the signal from the legitimate

649
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:44,829
legitimate PDS because when a user when

650
00:56:39,349 --> 00:56:50,930
I use a handle from yourself to another

651
00:56:44,829 --> 00:56:55,309
cell located nearby they will report to

652
00:56:50,930 --> 00:57:01,460
the core network the urban original cell

653
00:56:55,309 --> 00:57:08,510
ID tracking error code so maybe the

654
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:12,440
carrier cool notified after they do some

655
00:57:08,510 --> 00:57:26,980
big data research or something like that

656
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:30,890
I think we've got time for one more yes

657
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:38,569
the vendors really provide updates to
