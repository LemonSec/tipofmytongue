1
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:21,640
welcome everybody to my talk so I'm

2
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,189
actually like my final stage of PhD so

3
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:33,040
in few months I'll be a doctor so I can

4
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:34,300
get rid of this education so firstly

5
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,129
thanks for the audience like who

6
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,129
actually voted for the talk and also the

7
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:40,059
hack in the box team for inviting me

8
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:42,730
thank you so much

9
00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:45,910
I was also here last year talking about

10
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:48,849
LT self-organizing networks and it was

11
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:51,129
well received and then I see lot of bugs

12
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:52,809
being addressed in the standards and

13
00:00:51,129 --> 00:00:54,820
also with the operators and even

14
00:00:52,809 --> 00:00:56,640
basement vendors like trying to fix

15
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:59,080
these problems

16
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,780
so this year I'm actually trying to talk

17
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:03,670
on 5g so let's go a little bit into the

18
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:07,600
future and then the kind of attacks that

19
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:11,050
we expect in 5g or we tried actually in

20
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:17,310
in our labs and then that we think that

21
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:19,360
might be a problem in 5g networks so

22
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,550
just to give an overview of what's

23
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,440
coming up so I try to give how 5g

24
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:26,710
security looks and what kind of 5g

25
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:28,420
security we can expect and then directly

26
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:31,000
move on to the vulnerabilities that we

27
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:33,940
found in 5g protocols and the kind of

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,890
impact it creates and how we fix them

29
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:41,679
talking to so many baseband vendors or

30
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:44,350
GSMA or even 3gpp okay so I don't really

31
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,030
have to tell the kind of hype that 5g

32
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:48,789
has created these days everybody is

33
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:51,520
talking about it if I think it has the

34
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:55,720
biggest hype in the in the whole like in

35
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:57,910
this 2019 like in this 21st century so

36
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,410
basically it's I believe that it's a

37
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,420
it's a it's a technology that's for

38
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:03,250
machines to communicate not for humans

39
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:05,380
like all these days like we have been

40
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:08,530
making phone calls sending messages and

41
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:11,379
everything like using 2g 3G or 4G like

42
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:13,269
this was like quite convenient for us

43
00:02:11,379 --> 00:02:15,819
like we made so many calls like this and

44
00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:17,860
that but five just not about like making

45
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:19,988
calls or like I mean there's no point of

46
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:22,330
like developing a new technology and

47
00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:24,459
then just having it for your voice calls

48
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:28,840
or some things which we already do it

49
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:29,830
these days so like there are I I would

50
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,420
say like there are

51
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:34,600
different kinds of people like who say

52
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:36,670
we already have 5g and somebody has been

53
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,560
between like maybe or maybe not and

54
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:41,559
somebody is like no we don't really have

55
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,260
IG and so I fall into the third category

56
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,820
so we don't really have 5g now or if you

57
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:48,700
want to know the kind of like status of

58
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:50,739
5g networks today there are certain

59
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:53,079
countries like for example South Korea

60
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:55,900
or some parts of Japan and some parts of

61
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,720
Scandinavia they're trying to implement

62
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:00,400
like or like do some testing on 5g

63
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,310
networks but basically like there are

64
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,020
like two types of 5g networks that could

65
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,330
be established the first one is like the

66
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:10,030
non standalone mode where you have the

67
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:11,920
5g radio which is like pure 5g radio

68
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,750
which is which is completely different

69
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,600
technology when you compare to 4G and

70
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:19,360
the core network is completely based on

71
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,579
what is existing on 4G networks or LTE

72
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,880
networks then the second one there is

73
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:27,220
standalone mode which is just dedicated

74
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,500
for 5g so you have a new 5g core network

75
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:32,260
you have a new 5g radio network so

76
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:34,300
everything is kind of new and everything

77
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,100
is based on what utilisation technology

78
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,510
and all this stuff so like new

79
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,480
technologies being entered into the

80
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:42,609
standalone mode so now I think people

81
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,760
are only able to witness the non

82
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:48,010
standalone mode so it still takes a few

83
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:53,590
years to actually get this implemented

84
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:55,870
so basically like 5g is we have like so

85
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:58,450
many applications like in the future for

86
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:00,700
example like smart cars or even critical

87
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:03,190
infrastructure or even controlling

88
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,238
remote devices telemedicine or telemetry

89
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:07,510
is like we have thousands of

90
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,700
applications coming up and like

91
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:11,679
controlling or operating these devices

92
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:14,670
from the mobile operators infrastructure

93
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,108
and having technologies like

94
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:21,130
virtualization or even software-defined

95
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:22,659
networking network slicing or having

96
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,310
these kind of technologies implemented

97
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:26,040
in the core network and trying to

98
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:28,479
control all these applications

99
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,750
it's huge interconnection of so many

100
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,490
things and that's what is 5g about and I

101
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:36,520
think we are driving in this direction

102
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:39,010
so maybe five years from now or even it

103
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,719
could take longer depends on how quick

104
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:42,400
the carrier's are implementing so there

105
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,810
is like we have a new kind of technology

106
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,429
being

107
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:49,990
implemented in the operators core

108
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:52,480
network and it is like we can easily

109
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:54,280
expect that there could be more attacks

110
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,930
or more new one alert abilities that

111
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,270
could happen in the future so there's

112
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:01,660
lot of work which is coming up in 5g

113
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:03,789
that's what I wanted to say if we look

114
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:05,230
the kind of security requirements on 5g

115
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,910
they are really strict

116
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:10,240
they have like so many requirements

117
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:12,100
because when you compare to LTE which

118
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,860
was proven to be like more secure

119
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:16,360
compared to 3G or 2g so obviously when

120
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,950
you are designing a new technology you

121
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,970
have like more strict requirements

122
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:23,860
trying to achieve for the future so we

123
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:25,480
have like new use cases so this security

124
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,220
requirements is built on three three

125
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,770
things so the first thing is like new

126
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,750
use cases for example like the broadband

127
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:33,250
and the media we have like all the

128
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:36,190
message data applications that we are

129
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:40,540
using which require high speed then we

130
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:43,600
have smart driving even automated

131
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:45,520
applications like then we have critical

132
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,820
infrastructure for example like Public

133
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,409
Safety applications or government

134
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:53,860
applications or even controlling the our

135
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:56,169
city management traffic control then we

136
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:58,390
have like sensor devices there are for

137
00:05:56,169 --> 00:06:00,729
example in agriculture or monitoring

138
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:03,099
buildings surveillance

139
00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:05,140
so all these applications like have

140
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,220
their own application requirements and

141
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:09,520
which will be controlled from the

142
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:11,650
network side then we have at the LTA

143
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,840
security requirements in terms of over

144
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:16,719
there encryption or integrity protection

145
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,159
of the messages or not only the control

146
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,169
messages but also the data messages

147
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,810
which are exchanged over-the-air so LT

148
00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:24,700
has like proven to be really secure in

149
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:28,750
terms of encryption integrity protection

150
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:30,460
of data data messages then we have like

151
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:33,100
I said we have the new technologies like

152
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:35,530
NFV network function virtualization then

153
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:37,270
software-defined networking or you could

154
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:40,690
also like just put it like network

155
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:42,789
slicing where we are trying to bring the

156
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:44,440
virtualization technology into network

157
00:06:42,789 --> 00:06:46,870
operators infrastructure which never

158
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:49,780
happened before and this could be

159
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:51,520
something very interesting where the

160
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:53,469
network operators hardware is actually

161
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,740
shared with third party applications

162
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:57,700
this could bring up more more problems

163
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:00,220
actually so

164
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:03,219
and the way how operators manage this

165
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:05,200
control this I think will define the

166
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:08,110
kind of 5g security people see in the

167
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:11,560
future so it could get worse it could

168
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:16,000
get really best it depends on how the

169
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:18,100
operators do implement this I just try

170
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,260
to put in a simple way like the kind of

171
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:23,140
elements the security or the kind of

172
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:24,789
elements that we find in 5g network so

173
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,890
on the left side like we have the cell

174
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:29,470
infrastructure like we are all aware of

175
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:30,849
this which has devices then it has base

176
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:32,470
stations so there are like different

177
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,940
type of base stations like central

178
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:38,470
distributed so we don't really want to

179
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:40,300
get into that so in terms of like mobile

180
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:41,830
devices like they are not anymore

181
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,780
just smartphones like there are

182
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:45,880
different like they could be also cars

183
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:47,770
they could be smart homes they could be

184
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:50,050
any kind of sensor devices for example

185
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:52,990
maybe you must have heard narrowband IOT

186
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:54,880
devices or machine type communication

187
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:57,130
devices so it's going to be more and

188
00:07:54,880 --> 00:08:01,090
more different variety of devices that

189
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:02,350
are holding modems 4G or 5g modems then

190
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:04,810
we have different type of base stations

191
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:06,490
and the security model between them is

192
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:08,890
actually defined by these parameters

193
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:10,480
like there is authentication which we

194
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:12,880
call authentication and key agreement

195
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,590
protocol in 3gpp terms then we have

196
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,390
encryption of the data then we have

197
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:19,060
integrity protection of data and then

198
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:21,479
signaling messages and then we have like

199
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:24,340
privacy which is like trying to hide

200
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:26,860
location of the user or location of the

201
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:29,859
device or or even the identity of the

202
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:32,440
device for example like MC and IMEI then

203
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:36,490
we have resilience which quite improved

204
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:38,620
from 4G to 5g so like what happens like

205
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:42,850
if somebody tries to misuse certain type

206
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:45,490
of messages which are even which could

207
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:48,880
be even played with without having any

208
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:50,860
kind of authentication then we have like

209
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:54,960
different device identifiers like I said

210
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:56,830
MC IMEI or Tim C so this could be like

211
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:00,310
protected these are like really

212
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:01,960
protected well in in 5g or let's say

213
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:05,020
let's talk about like in C which is the

214
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:06,400
most attractive factor actually so it's

215
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:09,220
it's the permanent subscriber identity

216
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:11,319
and it's protected in 5g there's a new

217
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:13,360
mechanism called supey so

218
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,370
which is like trying to hide or use

219
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,740
public encryption to actually encrypt

220
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:20,050
the MC and then send it over the air to

221
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:22,899
the operator so but this is again an

222
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:24,459
optional feature in 5g so we really have

223
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:27,310
to wait and see if operators do

224
00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:31,239
implement this because it takes quite

225
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:33,250
some time or like an effort to to place

226
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:37,690
a public key in your SIM card and then

227
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:39,220
do this public key encryption then on

228
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:41,740
the net moving on the network side like

229
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:44,589
we are trying to bring the applications

230
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:48,009
more on to the base station so this

231
00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:50,829
actually increases speed then again like

232
00:09:48,009 --> 00:09:52,329
how operators manage this is something

233
00:09:50,829 --> 00:09:54,250
really we have to wait and see

234
00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:55,508
then on the core network like I said we

235
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:58,389
have different technologies like

236
00:09:55,509 --> 00:10:02,170
virtualization for example at stake

237
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:03,639
let's take a simple case where let's

238
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:06,009
take any third party application

239
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:09,399
provider for example like uber so they

240
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:10,600
get access or or for example like here

241
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:13,769
we see like thousands of different

242
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:16,740
devices and maybe operator could design

243
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:19,300
20 different slices and each slice is

244
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:21,130
dedicated for one type of application or

245
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:23,290
let's say one slice is being dedicated

246
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:25,660
for agricultural applications because

247
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:28,240
those sends our device is located there

248
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:30,160
really require different kind of quality

249
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,350
of service or different kind of battery

250
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,459
monitoring techniques or or like it's

251
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:36,490
completely different from traditional

252
00:10:33,459 --> 00:10:37,959
smartphones so each slice will hold

253
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:41,500
different kind of security features and

254
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:43,810
even quality of service or even any kind

255
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:48,220
of parameters like there are responsible

256
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:49,540
for security on the other side the

257
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:52,060
internet which is based on the diameter

258
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:54,219
protocols we are not going into that but

259
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,719
I think there's a talk on this one so

260
00:10:54,220 --> 00:11:00,790
maybe you will find more interesting

261
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:02,740
features on this ok so there are like

262
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:05,529
lot of elements which are involved in

263
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,910
the whole 5g architecture but I would be

264
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:08,649
mostly talking on the over-there

265
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:09,939
interface which is between the phone and

266
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:13,509
the base station which has always been

267
00:11:09,939 --> 00:11:15,339
my interesting area so we found some new

268
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:18,880
new problems there and then let's try to

269
00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:21,279
see what they are but before going that

270
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,980
let's see how security between this

271
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,750
mobile device it may not be a phone but

272
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,670
it could also

273
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:28,770
any kind of device which has a more

274
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:32,099
imminent and how the security has

275
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:33,360
evolved between these two entities in

276
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,040
the beginning like there was no mutual

277
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,020
authentication 2g was really bad

278
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,730
then in 3G there was a mutual

279
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:41,460
authentication between phone and the

280
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:43,260
base station but although it did not

281
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,790
eliminate the fact that rogue base

282
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:47,880
stations can exist in mobile networks

283
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:49,319
even today even in 5g it's possible to

284
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,110
set up a rogue Bay station but how

285
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:54,390
successful would that be it depends on

286
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:55,950
some implementation flaws and there are

287
00:11:54,390 --> 00:12:00,240
also some standard cross which could be

288
00:11:55,950 --> 00:12:02,040
exploited on 4G there was also the same

289
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,620
mutual indication which was taken from

290
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:06,959
3G but slightly enhanced then there was

291
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:09,560
additional integrity protection for

292
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:11,190
signaling messages trying to prevent

293
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,170
man-in-the-middle attacks

294
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:14,940
so it was like quite successful in terms

295
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:17,339
of encryption and dignity production of

296
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:20,160
these messages but there were still many

297
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:23,070
attacks which happened that that could

298
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:26,610
do location tracking or even fraud

299
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:28,170
attacks on voice or LT packets quite was

300
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:30,720
like there were a lot of attacks which

301
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:31,819
were happened on 4G for the last five

302
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,410
six years

303
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:36,030
moving on to 5g we have the similar kind

304
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:39,300
of mutual authentication but slightly

305
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:41,430
enhanced then we have integrity

306
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:44,310
protection for data messages which is

307
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:48,150
again an optional feature in 5g because

308
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:50,910
if you go back to 2017 there was one one

309
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:53,819
attack where web redirection attacks

310
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:57,630
could happen when data is not integrally

311
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:59,430
protected on LTE so this was provided

312
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:02,520
but still again it's optional

313
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:04,680
so 5g actually brought up this feature

314
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:07,800
of protecting MC but it's still left

315
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:09,300
optional there are like several reasons

316
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,130
for that there could be government like

317
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:14,010
regulation laws which don't allow

318
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:18,930
prepare or like hiding the MC on on the

319
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:20,939
air so 5g is like super complicated in

320
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:22,319
terms of like getting this so many of

321
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,930
the security features have been left

322
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,760
left optional so it's again up to the

323
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:32,880
basement vendors or even operators like

324
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:35,160
to to get them in practice so MC catches

325
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,950
so this is not a new name anymore like

326
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:41,060
people are aware of it

327
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:42,769
so many countries still use it now they

328
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:44,779
have like four GMC caches which to

329
00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:46,190
directly attacks on on the forge

330
00:13:44,779 --> 00:13:48,620
interface they don't really do the

331
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:51,800
downgrade but they can possibly do on

332
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:53,180
the forge interface so if we if you look

333
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,660
at this identities which are like two

334
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:59,359
most important parameters or like

335
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:01,010
information leak leaks which could which

336
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,620
somebody could actually get over their

337
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:06,860
interface then on 2g both we're like

338
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:09,889
could be acquired then on 3G yes also

339
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:13,130
it's possible to acquire MC and IMEI but

340
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:15,110
on LTE like they try to protect one of

341
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:16,310
the identifiers like so if you don't if

342
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:19,279
you do not do any kind of authentication

343
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:21,260
you cannot get the IMEI of any device

344
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:24,529
even if you are operating a rogue base

345
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:26,209
station but in 2015 like we were trying

346
00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:29,089
to play with some devices so there was

347
00:14:26,209 --> 00:14:30,920
some kind of MIS implementation by many

348
00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:32,690
of the basement vendors they could not

349
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,990
implement what exactly was said in the

350
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:38,690
standard so we could still exploit or

351
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:40,160
acquire the IMEI from devices even

352
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:44,029
without having any kind of security

353
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:46,480
protection then on 5g both of these

354
00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:48,829
identities are concealed so it's

355
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,390
standard wise it's not possible to get

356
00:14:48,829 --> 00:14:52,699
MC and I am here if correctly

357
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:54,410
implemented on 5g networks so we were

358
00:14:52,699 --> 00:14:57,670
trying to see out there like any other

359
00:14:54,410 --> 00:15:00,110
possible ways that you could still

360
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:03,949
identify devices on mobile networks or

361
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:05,240
identify subscribers even so on that we

362
00:15:03,949 --> 00:15:07,370
were like trying to find different

363
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,500
vulnerabilities or reading 4G protocols

364
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:13,160
or new 5g protocols so I will come back

365
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:14,990
to that in a moment so so just looking

366
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:18,110
at 5g security obviously it has to be

367
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:20,060
stronger than 4G I hope it is but we

368
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:22,870
will will have to really wait and see

369
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:25,189
like what kind of attacks might happen

370
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:27,079
then there are like similar security

371
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:29,089
algorithms in terms of encryption and

372
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:31,040
dignity protection they are really doing

373
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:32,529
good so if they are based on a yes and

374
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,469
then they are also thinking about having

375
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:38,870
256 bit encryption algorithms so but

376
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:41,970
this is still in discussion so we really

377
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:43,350
have to wait for the future so

378
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:45,600
so some of the attacks which were

379
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:47,100
actually fixed on LT for example like

380
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,930
there are downgrade attacks which could

381
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:51,150
be done by just sending one simple

382
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:53,099
message to the phone or there are even

383
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:54,750
the denial of service attacks just based

384
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,420
on like sending a simple message and

385
00:15:54,750 --> 00:16:00,060
then the device stays in limited service

386
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:02,520
mode for like until you restart the

387
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:04,619
device or even location-tracking where

388
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,030
it's possible to directly obtain GPS

389
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:08,130
coordinates from the phone without doing

390
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:09,930
any kind of authentication so these

391
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:11,640
attacks were actually fixed for the last

392
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:14,280
three four years and then they do not

393
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:17,490
they should not happen on 5g if they are

394
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:19,050
correctly implemented so what we the

395
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:20,970
basic assumption is here is like if

396
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:24,660
something is not detected on 4G it's

397
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:26,430
obviously copied to 5g so if if some

398
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:28,890
attacks did not were not detected or

399
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:31,109
like people missed it on 4G so it means

400
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:32,939
like because 5g is built mostly on the

401
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:34,800
4G protocols there are like some

402
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:37,140
enhancements but mostly on the radio

403
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,000
then on the core network but majority of

404
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:41,610
the protocols the way they operate the

405
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,340
state machines are similar maybe they

406
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:46,710
really support different applications

407
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:49,380
for example like v2v applications or v2x

408
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:51,030
application they are supported in 5g so

409
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:54,150
this could be something again

410
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:55,620
interesting so if you are wondering like

411
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:57,090
if there are any kind of fake base

412
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:59,370
station attacks which already happened

413
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:01,680
on 5g maybe you could refer to this

414
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:05,520
paper which exploits some authentication

415
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:07,919
protocols in in 5g networks this was one

416
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:12,300
year ago so I just put it here for some

417
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:14,699
information ok so going to the the new

418
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:16,619
vulnerabilities on 5g networks so there

419
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:20,040
is something called capabilities in the

420
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:22,229
in the mobile networks so every device

421
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:24,060
which has a modem has some capabilities

422
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:25,770
I'm not talking about the capabilities

423
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:29,429
of the operating system like apps

424
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:31,440
processor or the RAM or or the screen

425
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:32,880
size so I'm not talking about this I'm

426
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,550
talking about the capabilities of the

427
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,490
modem which as a normal user we cannot

428
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:40,230
see there could be like two different

429
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:42,330
type of capabilities each modem is

430
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:44,460
holding you could call them like

431
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:48,980
coordinate four capabilities for example

432
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:52,230
like does the does the device support

433
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:54,630
voice calls or does this device support

434
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:55,090
like data support or SMS support or what

435
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:57,280
kind of

436
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:58,959
purity algorithms it supports so this is

437
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,730
referred as like corner for capabilities

438
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,070
then there are like radio access

439
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:05,230
capabilities just by the name we can say

440
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:08,050
that this is something to do with the

441
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:10,240
radio for example like what kind of

442
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:13,230
frequency band it supports what kind of

443
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,760
like TX and rx parameters it supports

444
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:18,610
the physical ed parameters or even the

445
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,200
Mac layered parameters so or even does

446
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:22,090
it support like the MIMO like

447
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,100
multi-input multi-output technology on

448
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:25,870
LT or even does it support carrier

449
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:29,080
aggregation or there is something also

450
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:30,939
called category category is like every

451
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:34,510
device has a category for example if we

452
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:39,010
take I phone X it has a cat 16 if you

453
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:41,560
take Samsung Galaxy 4 from 2009 or

454
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:43,720
something it has like cat 8 so the

455
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:47,020
higher the technologies and the higher

456
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:50,200
the category okay so these are some of

457
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:53,350
the capabilities and then we were trying

458
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:56,890
to exploit or see what can we get out of

459
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:58,600
these capabilities this is like a

460
00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:01,480
Bioshock phase like where you have

461
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:03,870
expanded version of capabilities so

462
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:06,760
different parameters like for example

463
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:08,770
here if you see like this device

464
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:11,050
actually supports maybe this is a mobile

465
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:13,180
phone actually so it also supports 2g

466
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:14,830
and 3G so when it is actually

467
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:17,110
communicating to the network it would

468
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:19,030
send its core network capabilities to

469
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:21,459
the network and then it was off it would

470
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:24,280
also indicate that it supports mobile

471
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:27,160
class station class mark 2 which means

472
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:29,830
like it supports 2g technology and then

473
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:31,990
3 also says that it supports like 3G

474
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:34,149
technology so it's like indicating what

475
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:36,190
I support and then based on that I

476
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:37,930
received the service or if you look here

477
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:40,360
something called voice domain preference

478
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:42,730
and UV usage setting which says like

479
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,409
does the device required voice call

480
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:45,760
support or does it does it have the

481
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,930
voice call support because then it

482
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,600
should support like all the voice

483
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:52,000
cortex-m are codecs and everything if

484
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,250
you take a USB data stick it doesn't

485
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,500
really do the voice calls so it doesn't

486
00:19:54,250 --> 00:20:01,090
indicate this this kind of capabilities

487
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:03,580
some 5g specific capabilities for

488
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:08,080
example like v 2x connected cars if you

489
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:09,110
see something here like so v 2x p c5

490
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,199
which means the

491
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:15,070
this device or this modem has the v2x

492
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,720
capabilities and then it it can activate

493
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:19,610
the v2x

494
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:22,580
services if it's up if the network

495
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:24,229
supports then there are other

496
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:26,330
capabilities like cellular I what is

497
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:28,670
specific this came in the last series of

498
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:31,310
LT these are really I what is specific

499
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:33,950
so typical features that I bought the

500
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:36,290
modems required for example like keeping

501
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:38,770
off for several days because they only

502
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:40,490
transmit few bytes of data now and then

503
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:43,100
there are like different capabilities

504
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:45,170
for each device then we have radio

505
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:47,449
access capabilities which mentioned here

506
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:49,130
it says like you a category 4 then there

507
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:51,230
are other parameters like physical layer

508
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:52,910
parameters army RF parameters and

509
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:56,000
measurement parameters like what kind of

510
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:58,520
bands what kind of measurements it can

511
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,440
do when can it exactly send this so

512
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:05,360
there are like thousands of parameters

513
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:07,040
like even more and don't really have to

514
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:12,379
know everything but at least some of

515
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:13,879
them that we tried okay so so what when

516
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,620
are these capability is actually sent so

517
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:19,610
this is a basic registration procedure

518
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:21,050
in the in the mobile network so first it

519
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:22,729
starts with the registration request

520
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:25,399
where it's actually sending coordinate

521
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:27,920
for capabilities then it does the

522
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:30,140
authentication and security then the

523
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:32,600
core network says that get back the

524
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:34,310
radio capabilities so it would send a

525
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,500
request to the capabilities then it

526
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:38,389
would send the radio access capabilities

527
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,760
then this radio access capabilities are

528
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:42,320
actually stored on the core network

529
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,600
because for the next time maybe if the

530
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,070
base station requires it would the the

531
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,260
core network can actually send the

532
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:51,889
capabilities instead of asking the

533
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:55,520
mobile device then the over there

534
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:57,590
Security establishes between the mobile

535
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,750
device and the base station then it's a

536
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:01,370
successful registration so if we look

537
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:03,470
here like basically the core network

538
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:05,239
capabilities are sent in plain text

539
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:07,850
because it's the first message it always

540
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,320
goes unencrypted so and a passive

541
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:11,000
attacker sitting between the phone and

542
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:13,790
the base station can actually get this

543
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,080
or a rogue bit is somebody trying to

544
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,610
operate a rogue base station can

545
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,919
actually acquire this core network

546
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:20,389
capabilities if we go back if you go

547
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,160
down then there is something called

548
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:22,820
radio access capabilities if we look

549
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,949
here

550
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:27,399
there is no security being set up

551
00:22:24,949 --> 00:22:30,229
established between the mobile device

552
00:22:27,399 --> 00:22:32,359
under 8 under and the base station so

553
00:22:30,229 --> 00:22:34,489
there was already a security between the

554
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:36,978
mobile device and the core network but

555
00:22:34,489 --> 00:22:39,289
there is still not any kind of security

556
00:22:36,979 --> 00:22:41,899
established between mobile device and

557
00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:44,989
the base station so somebody is sitting

558
00:22:41,899 --> 00:22:48,139
between this two entities can actually

559
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:50,719
access this radio access capabilities so

560
00:22:48,139 --> 00:22:52,609
this was some of the the fundamentals

561
00:22:50,719 --> 00:22:54,169
like that how we started like doing this

562
00:22:52,609 --> 00:22:55,698
attack so basically the fact is that

563
00:22:54,169 --> 00:22:58,519
these capabilities can be actually

564
00:22:55,699 --> 00:23:01,489
accessed by rogue base stations they are

565
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:03,769
sent in plaintext over there and then

566
00:23:01,489 --> 00:23:05,899
they were like am implement they were

567
00:23:03,769 --> 00:23:07,129
like mix of sander and implementation

568
00:23:05,899 --> 00:23:10,248
bugs that we which you could have

569
00:23:07,129 --> 00:23:11,839
exploit so we tried like three different

570
00:23:10,249 --> 00:23:14,419
type of attacks so we came up with this

571
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:16,549
tool called MN map and so traditionally

572
00:23:14,419 --> 00:23:17,839
we have n map and then we try to create

573
00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:19,519
something similar for our mobile

574
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:23,208
networks like then we call it like

575
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:24,739
mobile and map then we do some bidding

576
00:23:23,209 --> 00:23:29,209
down attacks like trying to bring the

577
00:23:24,739 --> 00:23:32,299
device down to 2g or even or even 3G and

578
00:23:29,209 --> 00:23:33,919
then try to do some attacks there that

579
00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:36,469
we tried some different battery train

580
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,359
attacks on some of the latest NBI what

581
00:23:36,469 --> 00:23:40,849
devices which are in the market so I

582
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:44,059
would talk about these three attacks so

583
00:23:40,849 --> 00:23:46,698
for this we had some experimental set up

584
00:23:44,059 --> 00:23:50,119
for this so we try to use different USRP

585
00:23:46,699 --> 00:23:52,549
that traditionally I'm used to use USRP

586
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:55,218
and then so we built a complete

587
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:58,099
man-in-the-middle setup where we need to

588
00:23:55,219 --> 00:24:00,199
have one rogue base station and then one

589
00:23:58,099 --> 00:24:01,579
rogue mobile device so this rogue base

590
00:24:00,199 --> 00:24:03,709
station is actually talking to the

591
00:24:01,579 --> 00:24:06,168
victim device which is forwarding the

592
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:08,599
traffic from the victim device through

593
00:24:06,169 --> 00:24:10,429
the to the phone and from this acts as a

594
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:13,609
legitimate phone to the real estate

595
00:24:10,429 --> 00:24:15,319
network so we are like acting as a

596
00:24:13,609 --> 00:24:17,359
man-in-the-middle routing the traffic

597
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:18,949
from this victim device to the

598
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:20,658
legitimate network and then we are

599
00:24:18,949 --> 00:24:25,549
trying to do some modification attacks

600
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:27,109
in between which go undetected so for

601
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:29,749
the Amber for the mobile network mapping

602
00:24:27,109 --> 00:24:34,999
like I also tried to use so many devices

603
00:24:29,749 --> 00:24:35,990
I would go with that very soon software

604
00:24:34,999 --> 00:24:37,550
like there are

605
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:40,429
some couple of open source software's in

606
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:42,200
the market but we have to extensively

607
00:24:40,429 --> 00:24:44,600
like heavily modify them to get this

608
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:49,010
whole sorry to get this whole kind of

609
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:52,879
setup working also timing really matters

610
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:55,160
and then also the interference with with

611
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,340
operating your own base station and with

612
00:24:55,160 --> 00:25:00,140
with a legitimate base station you could

613
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:01,730
also like avoid this with Faraday cages

614
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:04,580
and stuff because people have tried this

615
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:07,640
before but I would I even though we had

616
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:09,350
one I didn't try to use it but but like

617
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,330
in reality like the setup doesn't look

618
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:13,909
like this because this rogue base

619
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:16,040
station stays far away from this rogue

620
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:18,679
UV because like we don't want our own

621
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:21,440
rogue mobile device trying to connect to

622
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:26,179
our own rogue station this could very

623
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:28,970
easily happen so which we tried like

624
00:25:26,179 --> 00:25:33,280
attacks on so many mobile operators like

625
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:36,530
mostly focusing on USA and then Europe

626
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:39,080
so okay so this is the first one would

627
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:41,270
be like the MN map so we have the

628
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:43,669
traditional end map what it's what it's

629
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:45,620
trying to do is like trying to find the

630
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:46,910
live horse on a network and then trying

631
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:49,340
to expose the kind of operating system

632
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:51,440
it has the ports it has and all this

633
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:53,120
information so we try to do similar

634
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,980
things so what we are trying is like we

635
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,919
are trying to identify the maker the

636
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:59,210
model the operating system then the

637
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:06,170
applications maybe the application

638
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:08,290
version of that particular modem so this

639
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:10,850
is this is the kind of tree that I built

640
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:13,790
so first we try to identify who is the

641
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:15,980
basement maker of this modem and then

642
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:18,110
what kind of model it's running so once

643
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:20,179
we know that we try to expand a little

644
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:23,330
bit more find if it's a cellular device

645
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:24,890
or if it's a cellular IOT device if it's

646
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:27,710
a cellular it could be a phone or a

647
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:30,260
tablet or it could be any other device

648
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:31,880
like some other device so if it's a

649
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:33,770
phone it could be either Android or iOS

650
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:35,600
like we could also take other categories

651
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:38,809
other other operating systems but I just

652
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:42,620
keeping it simple if it's an Android

653
00:26:38,809 --> 00:26:46,250
then which kind of smartphone maker is

654
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:48,080
it if it's Samsung hawai or HTC then if

655
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:49,149
it's an I was like is it an iPhone or an

656
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,949
iPad or

657
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:52,539
it's is it also possible to find out the

658
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:55,539
kind of operating system version it's

659
00:26:52,539 --> 00:26:57,940
running then if it's like any kind of

660
00:26:55,539 --> 00:27:00,700
other device then it could be a modem in

661
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:02,919
a car it could be a railway modem it

662
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:04,210
could be a router USB dongle or it's

663
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:06,820
like so we are trying to differentiate

664
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:09,279
or just get this kind of differentiation

665
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:12,718
or identify each device in its category

666
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:15,639
based on the capabilities that we have

667
00:27:12,719 --> 00:27:16,869
if it's in cellular Iwate device then we

668
00:27:15,639 --> 00:27:18,218
try to identify if it's a narrowband

669
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:20,619
because these are the only two

670
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:22,629
categories that exist in the cellular

671
00:27:20,619 --> 00:27:26,109
standards so it could be either of this

672
00:27:22,629 --> 00:27:30,459
if it's this it could so basically it's

673
00:27:26,109 --> 00:27:31,869
up to the user to to have this kind of

674
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:33,339
application like maybe they might

675
00:27:31,869 --> 00:27:36,639
implement narrowband i were to device

676
00:27:33,339 --> 00:27:38,229
for smart meters or smart grids but this

677
00:27:36,639 --> 00:27:40,599
is what is recommended in the standard

678
00:27:38,229 --> 00:27:44,589
so maybe they could use some LTM device

679
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:46,299
for home automation devices so yeah we

680
00:27:44,589 --> 00:27:48,580
were like trying to extract all this

681
00:27:46,299 --> 00:27:50,889
information just based on acquiring the

682
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:52,989
capabilities so we try to set up a rope

683
00:27:50,889 --> 00:27:56,668
a station try to acquire capabilities

684
00:27:52,989 --> 00:27:59,589
from the device and try to analyze them

685
00:27:56,669 --> 00:28:01,330
so you might ask like okay there are

686
00:27:59,589 --> 00:28:04,178
like capabilities which are defined by

687
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:06,849
the standards and are implemented by the

688
00:28:04,179 --> 00:28:09,219
basement vendors then how is this

689
00:28:06,849 --> 00:28:10,779
identification possible like there are

690
00:28:09,219 --> 00:28:13,690
two main things which make this

691
00:28:10,779 --> 00:28:15,039
identification possible because basement

692
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:18,759
vendors like they implement the

693
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:20,440
capabilities differently it's actually

694
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:21,849
optional to implement some of the

695
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,190
capabilities so there will be

696
00:28:21,849 --> 00:28:26,529
differences between different basements

697
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:30,099
which actually enabled us to identify

698
00:28:26,529 --> 00:28:31,719
them then the second one is each target

699
00:28:30,099 --> 00:28:33,129
application requires different set of

700
00:28:31,719 --> 00:28:35,710
applications different set of

701
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:38,769
capabilities for example take an

702
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:40,359
automated car likes a smart smart car it

703
00:28:38,769 --> 00:28:42,549
should have this v2a capabilities

704
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:46,178
enabled or it's it's not it's not a

705
00:28:42,549 --> 00:28:48,190
smart car if we take a phone it's

706
00:28:46,179 --> 00:28:51,399
obvious that you have this voice calling

707
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:53,349
capabilities enabled with that we can

708
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:56,168
actually say what kind of device it

709
00:28:53,349 --> 00:28:58,089
would be or if you take for like USB

710
00:28:56,169 --> 00:29:01,130
data sticks I like I said there is only

711
00:28:58,089 --> 00:29:03,678
data support enabled this could

712
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:06,890
keep some hint that okay this is a USB

713
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:09,020
stick so what we did we try to collect

714
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:12,919
somewhere roughly around like eighty to

715
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:14,960
ninety devices and maybe forty of them

716
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:16,429
are like phones and different phones

717
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,190
from different manufacturers different

718
00:29:16,429 --> 00:29:21,320
basements different versions so whatever

719
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:24,590
we tried we see we see in the market we

720
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:27,350
try to just get them so we have so many

721
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:31,129
base pens so mostly we try to focus on

722
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:33,049
four different baseband manufactures not

723
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:36,289
four but five with Qualcomm then

724
00:29:33,049 --> 00:29:40,610
mediatek then Huawei and Samsung then

725
00:29:36,289 --> 00:29:42,408
Intel so we try to acquire the

726
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:44,840
capabilities of these devices

727
00:29:42,409 --> 00:29:47,539
so apart from phones we also have some

728
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:50,000
routers some laptops some modems from

729
00:29:47,539 --> 00:29:52,158
the cars some other devices from

730
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,140
military which whose capabilities

731
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:56,600
completely are not completely but at

732
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:58,190
least 30 to 40 percent look different

733
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:02,719
from the traditional or commercial

734
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:06,799
devices which we see these days and also

735
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:11,390
some practical devices which are I would

736
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:13,150
be related so yeah we try to collect the

737
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:17,270
capabilities of these devices and then

738
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:19,940
store them as files and then all this

739
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:21,590
like a pcap files and then we try to

740
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:23,840
analyze the information in those

741
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:25,250
capabilities so first we try to find the

742
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:28,340
baseband vendor like who is this

743
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:30,140
baseband guy so if you look into the

744
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:33,230
capabilities like we found certain

745
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:35,450
capabilities that actually differentiate

746
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:38,140
the baseband vendors there is something

747
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:40,940
called e is zero its encryption it's

748
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:43,669
it's it's an integrity algorithm which

749
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:46,490
is present in LTE and it's zero which

750
00:30:43,669 --> 00:30:47,659
means that all the keys are zero so

751
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:49,340
basically they have this kind of

752
00:30:47,659 --> 00:30:51,409
security algorithm in LTE

753
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:52,820
just to allow emergency calls because

754
00:30:51,409 --> 00:30:54,140
like in emergency calls you don't really

755
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:58,879
want to do this encryption and security

756
00:30:54,140 --> 00:31:02,240
nonsense so what we found was all of the

757
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:04,730
basements they actually enabled this e

758
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,830
is zero by default but only the Qualcomm

759
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:09,290
basement was actually disabling this I

760
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:12,260
don't know for what reason but but maybe

761
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:14,000
they try to dynamically enable it it's

762
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:15,020
up to them so again it's it's an

763
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,640
optional feature so

764
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:19,460
it's up to the basement vendor later to

765
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,750
enable or disable it if you look for

766
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,670
example like something called extended

767
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:24,830
measurement capability so this was

768
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:26,660
actually only enabled in media text MA

769
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:28,580
in chipsets and the rest of them

770
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:30,110
actually disabled it okay there are no

771
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:32,149
reasons for this maybe there could be

772
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:34,699
internal reasons why they implement this

773
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:36,470
or why they don't implement this even if

774
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:39,380
we ask them like maybe they won't be

775
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:41,690
willing to share why did they implement

776
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:43,220
or why didn't they implement so we just

777
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:46,880
didn't bother to ask them like why do

778
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:47,930
you have it or why do you not so there

779
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,960
are also different other capabilities

780
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:54,380
like maybe six other more and just

781
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,970
didn't want to show them which maybe if

782
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:58,160
these fail you could reuse the other

783
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:59,990
capabilities just to differentiate them

784
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,750
so the first level would be like trying

785
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:04,430
to identify like who is the basement

786
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:07,580
then once we know the basement it's easy

787
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:11,540
to tell which kind of LTE release it's

788
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:12,610
using if you just look snapdragon for

789
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:15,500
example I take Malcolm

790
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:17,419
they're like Snapdragon 800 series I

791
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:20,860
think there are also even new ones these

792
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:23,990
days maybe in some somewhere around 900

793
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:27,439
okay so if you look into this if you

794
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:29,360
this is a big wiki so Snapdragon 800

795
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,040
series so it would just show you the

796
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:34,639
kind of devices in the market that are

797
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:37,070
actually using this chipset so it it

798
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:39,800
also where it's also available for even

799
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:41,840
other chipsets like high silicon from

800
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,610
Huawei then media tech then xu knows and

801
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,850
then there is also something from the

802
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:50,030
Intel side so basically we try to look

803
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:52,010
into this and then find out a list of

804
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:53,780
devices that are actually using this

805
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:55,670
particular chipset it's still not done

806
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:57,889
like doing the conclusion but we are

807
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:59,900
just half way so we try to find the

808
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:02,600
basement model then like the list of

809
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:04,640
devices then then comes the little bit

810
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:07,459
tricky thing where you identify the

811
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:11,480
device the application of the device or

812
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:13,850
the right device and its application so

813
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,960
there are like differences which which

814
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:16,909
are which could be used to add a

815
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,160
differentiate like cellular IOT devices

816
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:21,380
then cellular devices so there are like

817
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:24,440
certain timers which are only active for

818
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:28,820
IOT devices the rest of them they are

819
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:30,799
like disabled so between phone and other

820
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:32,658
devices like there are some some

821
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:34,730
capabilities which are like voice or

822
00:33:32,659 --> 00:33:36,830
data which is something present only for

823
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:39,980
phones then for others like it's not

824
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:41,840
really enabled if you look mr cortex

825
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:46,669
this is only present for phones it's not

826
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:48,230
really enable for other devices then

827
00:33:46,669 --> 00:33:50,029
sometimes like it makes it simple

828
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:51,980
because like if it's a whoever iPhone

829
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:54,110
it's obviously using a go away baseband

830
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:55,460
if it's a Samsung phone it's using a

831
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:57,769
Samsung basement if it's an Apple then

832
00:33:55,460 --> 00:34:02,570
the only two options like Intel or

833
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:04,370
welcome so it was difficult this was the

834
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:07,009
difficult one trying to identify a

835
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:08,779
difference between iOS and Android there

836
00:34:07,009 --> 00:34:12,079
are certain features like MS assisted

837
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:13,669
GPS or or yeah this this is actually

838
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:16,280
enabled only in Android and it was

839
00:34:13,668 --> 00:34:17,899
disabled in I was devices there are also

840
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:20,089
a couple of maybe one more extra

841
00:34:17,899 --> 00:34:22,098
parameter which is enabled in Android

842
00:34:20,089 --> 00:34:23,629
and then disabled in highways I don't

843
00:34:22,099 --> 00:34:25,790
know the reason but you know I'm I

844
00:34:23,629 --> 00:34:28,639
really didn't bother to ask why but at

845
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:31,339
least this was present in all like some

846
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,960
like 80 devices that we tested there

847
00:34:31,339 --> 00:34:35,899
could be some devices in the market

848
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,849
which might differ but I don't think

849
00:34:35,899 --> 00:34:42,618
that they would be like huge difference

850
00:34:37,849 --> 00:34:45,829
in that so once we identify like this

851
00:34:42,619 --> 00:34:47,869
kind of information it's really know

852
00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:49,369
okay before that like what what can we

853
00:34:47,869 --> 00:34:52,250
do with this but before that like we had

854
00:34:49,369 --> 00:34:54,010
some certain issues for example the SIM

855
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:56,719
card present in the device can actually

856
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:58,460
control the the capabilities or or

857
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:00,259
enabling or disabling the capabilities

858
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:04,460
for example like you insert a SIM card

859
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:06,980
from from Asia you might have the the

860
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:09,680
bands that are supported in Asia enabled

861
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:11,599
maybe once you move to Europe maybe the

862
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,190
SIM card can actually control the

863
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:15,589
enabling and disabling of this

864
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:18,260
capability so that's a bit tricky part

865
00:35:15,589 --> 00:35:24,170
to understand like if this these are the

866
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:27,349
exact capabilities of the device so once

867
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:28,790
we so it's not that we have to be an

868
00:35:27,349 --> 00:35:31,250
active attacker to actually get these

869
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:33,259
capabilities it's also sufficient that

870
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:34,550
you can passively grab the capabilities

871
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:36,170
over there and try to do this

872
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:38,180
identification

873
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:39,710
like I said passive and map also works

874
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:41,120
because like lot of people commented

875
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:42,650
that you have to run

876
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:45,350
the base station to do this it's not

877
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:46,850
really necessary because if if you go

878
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:48,680
back to the registration procedure you

879
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:51,440
saw that the capabilities are exchanged

880
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:55,040
in plaintext so it's quite simple to get

881
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:57,260
get them in in being a passive mode so

882
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:59,620
it's possible to link the MC to these

883
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:02,060
capabilities and then associate or

884
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:04,029
associate these fingerprints to the two

885
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:06,740
different kinds of people

886
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:09,710
once it's also possible to get the

887
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:11,959
operating system version I think I

888
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:14,000
didn't put it I disabled the slide maybe

889
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:15,590
if you are interested there's a big

890
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,880
version of the paper coming up in the

891
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:19,640
end of the slides maybe you couldn't

892
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,440
actually refer there so it's also

893
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:24,290
possible to launch some target specific

894
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,690
attacks then the other nice thing we're

895
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:27,950
doing is like we are trying to make this

896
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:29,660
so this whole thing is actually like

897
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:33,620
automated so we would like to share this

898
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:36,379
tool then if somebody is interested so

899
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:37,580
if you want to play around with this we

900
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:41,630
would also like share the whole

901
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:44,600
capabilities list we have just trying to

902
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:46,220
hide the MC and IMEI devices or like

903
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:52,009
identifiers from these traces and then

904
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:54,100
share them ok the second type of attacks

905
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:57,950
that we try it on this capabilities was

906
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:59,540
the bidding down so normally like if you

907
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:01,460
are buying an LT phone so you obviously

908
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:04,670
obviously like expect that you get high

909
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:07,010
speed you get like 4G data which is

910
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:12,350
better than to G and C G far far better

911
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:14,090
than 2g and 3G and yeah so it's kind of

912
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:15,500
bidding down we tried was okay this is

913
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:19,660
the basic registration procedure I'm

914
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:22,010
bringing it back again so if we see that

915
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:24,500
the capabilities are actually sent

916
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:25,850
before actually setting up the security

917
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:29,450
between the phone and the base station

918
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:31,069
so being a man-in-the-middle what we try

919
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:34,189
to do is like we try to modify these

920
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:36,080
capabilities and then forward it to the

921
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:37,460
base station and from there these

922
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:39,020
capabilities are sent to the core

923
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:42,470
network and then they are stored there

924
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:45,100
for until you restart your device which

925
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:48,200
we rarely do I guess

926
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:50,870
so if you try to modify the capabilities

927
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:53,210
here if they go undetected like neither

928
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:54,710
the base station nor the north the phone

929
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:56,810
not the core network can actually

930
00:37:54,710 --> 00:38:00,740
take this so what we what we are exactly

931
00:37:56,810 --> 00:38:04,099
trying to modify is so this is a trace

932
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:05,890
from a field-testing phone if we if we

933
00:38:04,099 --> 00:38:08,690
look one of the operator is trying to

934
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:10,220
acquire the device capabilities before

935
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:12,050
setting up the security mode command I

936
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:15,109
mean this procedure doesn't have to be

937
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:16,700
in this way it could also be that you do

938
00:38:15,109 --> 00:38:19,390
the security mode command in the first

939
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:22,160
place and then request the capabilities

940
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:24,319
this procedure I mean this sequence is

941
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,848
different in different networks but

942
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,740
majority of the networks that we saw

943
00:38:25,849 --> 00:38:29,320
they try to bring the capabilities first

944
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:31,790
and then do the security which is

945
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:35,000
leading the way for a man-in-the-middle

946
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:37,400
to do the modifications there so what we

947
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,510
are exactly trying to modify we are

948
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,970
trying to modify the category

949
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:42,560
information then we are trying to modify

950
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:44,089
carrier aggregation and MIMO

951
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,279
technologies so basically we are trying

952
00:38:44,089 --> 00:38:48,740
to set the cat to the lowest category as

953
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:50,390
possible so if you take an iPhone X

954
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:54,049
device like I said I said it has my cat

955
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:56,690
16 so if you set it to cat 1 so it would

956
00:38:54,050 --> 00:39:00,800
receive the service that is a cat 1

957
00:38:56,690 --> 00:39:02,480
devices entitled to you're trying to

958
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,890
disable the carrier aggregation and my

959
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,109
more these are the two important

960
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:08,000
technologies that are in in LT that are

961
00:39:06,109 --> 00:39:10,250
responsible for the high speed that we

962
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,500
have today if the device is not

963
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:15,530
supporting this then you are actually

964
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:17,690
like losing the speed we try to remove

965
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:20,630
frequency bands telling that it doesn't

966
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:22,300
support certain LT frequency bands we

967
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:27,080
also removed certain capabilities like

968
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:28,460
SPS scheduling or our word CH

969
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:30,500
compressions

970
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:32,750
so for voice or LT because like it's

971
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:35,839
it's a HD voice so you need some kind of

972
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:37,670
compression technology supported in the

973
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:39,890
modem so if you are trying to disable

974
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:41,780
that it's it conveys to the network that

975
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:44,240
this device doesn't support any voice

976
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:46,220
over LT features then you can also like

977
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:48,109
remove the v2x capabilities that the

978
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:52,098
device is supporting so basically what

979
00:39:48,109 --> 00:39:54,080
happens in this case is like when you

980
00:39:52,099 --> 00:39:55,400
remove when you modify this capabilities

981
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,830
like you are actually downgrading the

982
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:02,450
service that this device is should

983
00:39:57,830 --> 00:40:06,170
receive so in some in some tests like

984
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:07,790
what we did so so without the man in the

985
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,539
middle like there was a normal speed of

986
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:10,999
like 48

987
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:12,949
PS I mean if you're talking about like

988
00:40:10,999 --> 00:40:14,689
the theoretical speeds that are possible

989
00:40:12,949 --> 00:40:17,479
on LT like it's also possible to get 1

990
00:40:14,689 --> 00:40:20,419
Gbps speed theoretically on an LTE

991
00:40:17,479 --> 00:40:22,698
network but like in normal commercial

992
00:40:20,419 --> 00:40:26,328
like day-to-day daily networks that you

993
00:40:22,699 --> 00:40:28,039
just maybe 60 Mbps or 100 Mbps it

994
00:40:26,329 --> 00:40:29,539
depends on the country also so I was

995
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:32,150
trying some attacks in Germany and then

996
00:40:29,539 --> 00:40:35,779
maximum we could get in peak hours was

997
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:37,429
like 48 Mbps some with an iPhone 8 then

998
00:40:35,779 --> 00:40:40,009
what we saw with the man in the middle

999
00:40:37,429 --> 00:40:41,900
was like once we set the category to

1000
00:40:40,009 --> 00:40:43,609
different category when we downgrade the

1001
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:48,529
category what with the speed we receive

1002
00:40:43,609 --> 00:40:50,959
is like two MVPs and then when we try to

1003
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:53,059
call the device instead of directly

1004
00:40:50,959 --> 00:40:55,549
having the voice call on LT each cell

1005
00:40:53,059 --> 00:40:57,199
the device was being sent to 2g network

1006
00:40:55,549 --> 00:40:59,749
to do the voice call and then return

1007
00:40:57,199 --> 00:41:01,640
back to the LT network and then

1008
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:04,189
handovers like we're actually made to

1009
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:06,348
Cugini 2g base stations or even 3g base

1010
00:41:04,189 --> 00:41:08,569
stations because that device was not

1011
00:41:06,349 --> 00:41:10,189
supporting certain LT frequencies which

1012
00:41:08,569 --> 00:41:12,169
are present in the surrounding I mean

1013
00:41:10,189 --> 00:41:13,848
you're actually trying to fake the

1014
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:16,969
capabilities but the device actually

1015
00:41:13,849 --> 00:41:19,489
supports it in this case the phone has

1016
00:41:16,969 --> 00:41:22,489
other mobile devices nothing controlled

1017
00:41:19,489 --> 00:41:24,409
because it just follows what the base

1018
00:41:22,489 --> 00:41:26,359
station is telling to do so if it says

1019
00:41:24,409 --> 00:41:30,159
like go to 2g network even though it

1020
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:32,449
supports like a LT frequencies it just

1021
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:36,289
it's just a slave which is trying to

1022
00:41:32,449 --> 00:41:38,839
obey the master base station so we also

1023
00:41:36,289 --> 00:41:40,309
tried different on different on

1024
00:41:38,839 --> 00:41:41,689
different base bands like for example I

1025
00:41:40,309 --> 00:41:44,390
can be tried mostly on the Qualcomm

1026
00:41:41,689 --> 00:41:46,058
basement because like they are all so

1027
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:48,439
having this man-in-the-middle setup was

1028
00:41:46,059 --> 00:41:51,289
kind of very complicated and it was like

1029
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:53,299
super unstable so we always like depend

1030
00:41:51,289 --> 00:41:55,159
on Qualcomm basement which we are like

1031
00:41:53,299 --> 00:41:59,769
most favorable and then they try to be

1032
00:41:55,159 --> 00:42:02,359
more like have a stable setup at least

1033
00:41:59,769 --> 00:42:06,618
or they easily recognize the kind of

1034
00:42:02,359 --> 00:42:08,479
software-defined radios we are using so

1035
00:42:06,619 --> 00:42:11,299
we are actually down getting the device

1036
00:42:08,479 --> 00:42:13,399
here so basically what I want to convey

1037
00:42:11,299 --> 00:42:15,199
is like you're actually attaching a

1038
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,059
smart phone to the network like an I

1039
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:19,579
were to device so basically I were to

1040
00:42:17,059 --> 00:42:21,890
device would go off or it doesn't really

1041
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:24,560
it need speeds like kbps

1042
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:26,600
so this smartphone once it's after this

1043
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:30,009
attack it would receive the kind of same

1044
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:32,930
service that an IOT device is receiving

1045
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:35,810
we tested this attacks on like so many

1046
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:37,700
networks like 22 out of like 32 networks

1047
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:41,710
are are following the procedure that

1048
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:45,080
actually I showed here so they do the

1049
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:48,680
capability transfer first and then do

1050
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:51,380
the security which allows this man the

1051
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:53,569
middle to succeed and the capabilities

1052
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:56,450
were actually staying there at the core

1053
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:59,770
network so every time we connect to the

1054
00:42:56,450 --> 00:43:02,689
network or we send messages we are still

1055
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:05,120
being under the influence of those those

1056
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:06,620
modified capabilities unless you restart

1057
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:09,680
the device your capabilities are not

1058
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:11,990
recent and then in the absence of the

1059
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:15,500
attacker I mean and then you don't get

1060
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:16,939
back to the normal operation so

1061
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:19,070
sometimes like it's also possible that

1062
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:20,600
there are like certain elite SIM cards

1063
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:22,460
like sometimes if you have an allele

1064
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,950
you're working for the operator so you

1065
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:26,990
get a different SIM card which has which

1066
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:29,180
obviously receives more speed even

1067
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:33,500
though if you are in a big big vest or

1068
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:35,180
on a heavy crowd but even that doesn't

1069
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:38,150
work because radio is kind of the

1070
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:41,060
bottleneck for this high-speed services

1071
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:43,130
that we should receive an LT so if you

1072
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:45,620
are trying to kill this radio part or

1073
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:46,790
like modify the radio part it doesn't

1074
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:49,370
matter like if you have an elite SIM

1075
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:52,040
card or you're the CEO of your carrier

1076
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:55,180
company you will definitely lose the

1077
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:58,070
service or your service is downgraded

1078
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:59,990
you might ask why the operators are

1079
00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:02,720
actually doing this or why the standard

1080
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:06,529
is actually mentioning that capabilities

1081
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:08,029
can be sent before security so some some

1082
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:10,490
reasons for example like to do better

1083
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:12,110
optimizations for better connectivity

1084
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:14,750
that was the reason that we found in

1085
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:16,760
standard but like I said 22 out of 32

1086
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:18,230
networks are actually or like there are

1087
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:21,250
like 10 other networks which are doing

1088
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:24,260
the opposite so they are somehow

1089
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:26,000
exempted from this kind of attack when

1090
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:27,740
they are doing I would say like why not

1091
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,150
you also follow the same procedure and

1092
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:32,540
then try to avoid this attack in the

1093
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:34,170
first place then the third one was the

1094
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:36,390
battery in attack

1095
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:41,160
so there are like new type of devices

1096
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:43,020
like narrowband IOT devices they're gold

1097
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:45,210
I mean the use of these devices like

1098
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:47,130
once they try to send some data I mean

1099
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:48,990
once they register to the network they

1100
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:51,240
try to send some data to the network and

1101
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:53,430
then they can actually go off for a

1102
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:55,680
couple of days or even more depending on

1103
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:58,290
the configuration so they go off and

1104
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:00,270
then automatically turn on after maybe

1105
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:01,980
one week and then try to send data again

1106
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:03,920
so this is some of the devices that we

1107
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:06,030
see in like smart meters or even

1108
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:08,250
agriculture sensors or something like

1109
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:11,130
this so basically what we try to do is

1110
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:13,350
like we try to modify the coordinate for

1111
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:15,480
capabilities of this device trying to

1112
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:18,200
say that this device doesn't support any

1113
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:21,270
kind of power saving mode capabilities

1114
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:25,230
which means that the device cannot go

1115
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:26,940
off so the network thinks that this is a

1116
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:28,680
normal device this is not this is not an

1117
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:30,570
I were to device so it does not

1118
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:33,990
configure that River the device to

1119
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:37,590
actually go off once it's once its job

1120
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:41,129
is done so the device stays on on and on

1121
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:44,580
for like several days for example at

1122
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:46,950
least like in our case like it was like

1123
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:48,779
13 days the device was on and then all

1124
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:50,399
its battery is actually drained so we

1125
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:52,230
are actually talking about I would

1126
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:55,260
invite G we are talking about IOT

1127
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:58,140
devices that would stay untouched for

1128
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:59,700
like ten years of battery life but it's

1129
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:01,350
with this kind of attack like we can

1130
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:04,439
actually drain the battery within like

1131
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:06,000
maybe five six days and then and then

1132
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:08,090
that the important thing here is like

1133
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,470
the attack is actually persistent

1134
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:10,680
because like once the modification is

1135
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:12,180
done

1136
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:14,430
the attacker can go home and the attack

1137
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:17,279
stays active for like until the devices

1138
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:19,020
that the battery strain and the network

1139
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,880
not the network not the device can

1140
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:27,210
actually recognize that something a

1141
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:29,880
modification has actually happened okay

1142
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:31,710
so coming to fixes so we actually

1143
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:33,330
reported it to GSM a and then they

1144
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:36,120
handed it like very smoothly and then

1145
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:38,009
trying to get it to 3gpp and get it

1146
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:39,750
fixed as early as possibly I think it

1147
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:44,550
took overall like two months to get the

1148
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:46,960
whole fix done we also like have the CVD

1149
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:49,240
if you want to check it out and then

1150
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:51,640
there are so the actual fix was that

1151
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:54,629
this capability should be only sent to

1152
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:57,279
the network after establishing security

1153
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:59,410
like I said many of the base stations or

1154
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:02,589
like hundreds different base stations we

1155
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:05,558
tried there there is a configuration

1156
00:47:02,589 --> 00:47:07,569
problem / implementation problem we are

1157
00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:09,190
not really sure because many of the

1158
00:47:07,569 --> 00:47:11,950
operators like did not disclose this to

1159
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:14,319
us so I think they would require some

1160
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:17,259
time to actually fix this problem in the

1161
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:18,970
base stations or it could also require

1162
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:22,180
some changes in the core network again

1163
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:26,828
and I'm sure like this would take a lot

1164
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:30,940
of time to actually get it fixed so

1165
00:47:26,829 --> 00:47:32,950
coming to the like like the admin map is

1166
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:35,800
still possible even on 5g even though if

1167
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:38,140
this fix is allowed because like the

1168
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:40,089
first mess the first message to the

1169
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:42,129
network is off is actually sent in

1170
00:47:40,089 --> 00:47:43,660
plaintext so somebody who is trying to

1171
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:47,020
acquire this coordinate for capabilities

1172
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:48,879
can still do this and map on even on 5g

1173
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:50,770
networks and we are still having a

1174
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:53,710
discussion with the TPP like trying to

1175
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:55,720
get this fixed but but I think it will

1176
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:58,180
take surely some time because there are

1177
00:47:55,720 --> 00:48:02,049
even other priorities for example more

1178
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:07,359
on the five key use cases and everything

1179
00:48:02,049 --> 00:48:09,880
which which will take some time so yeah

1180
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:11,380
so that was the talk and then yeah if

1181
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:43,119
you have any questions I'm actually open

1182
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:46,299
and thank you I'm kidding first one is I

1183
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:48,280
was I was kind of well not shocked at

1184
00:48:46,299 --> 00:48:50,740
how it's hard to get initial shock but

1185
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:53,049
when you say did you scan it also you SL

1186
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:56,189
on us operators because they don't

1187
00:48:53,049 --> 00:48:59,570
really appreciate such things so ah

1188
00:48:56,190 --> 00:49:04,070
micro CT is the

1189
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:09,830
have you informed them ahead of running

1190
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:12,110
their scans and super question is work

1191
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:17,380
were there any operators who noticed

1192
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:20,270
your scans or blind and anything

1193
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:24,410
no no operators actually noticed is

1194
00:49:20,270 --> 00:49:25,670
because like we try to keep the ID okay

1195
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:28,509
the other thing is like nobody is

1196
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:30,800
looking into this even though they are

1197
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:32,240
because like I was a black hat and then

1198
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,730
most of the security with the u.s.

1199
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:36,709
operators is on the core network trying

1200
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:38,900
to see what's happening with the

1201
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:40,430
firewalls or with the web interfaces and

1202
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:43,520
everything so nobody is actually looking

1203
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:45,319
into this part so I think they're free

1204
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:47,120
and then we have like the freedom to do

1205
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:49,520
it and then as long as we don't get

1206
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:54,230
caught or like it go into trouble you

1207
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:57,110
should agree with you but okay I got a

1208
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:59,300
couple more if I can still speaking

1209
00:49:57,110 --> 00:50:02,360
about that tech number one when you say

1210
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:04,970
that with the mall by land map

1211
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:07,520
you couldn't I mean you show that you

1212
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:10,759
were able to fingerprint the devices

1213
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:14,480
looks let's say and speaking about the

1214
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:18,140
Cellular's as far as I know this depends

1215
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:21,560
if for example they're a minor he how to

1216
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:24,140
say his shield or it assign a public IP

1217
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:28,130
address to the device so don't you think

1218
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:30,529
I mean how has been they be behave of

1219
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:33,170
your scam because for example if you go

1220
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:35,900
to my country we got for an imino and

1221
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:38,000
two of them they assign you a public IP

1222
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:40,070
address the other one our private IP

1223
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,980
address an internal one to the handset

1224
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:46,960
but the fourth one is public but it's

1225
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:49,730
not sure it is it's not message no

1226
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:51,470
behaviors no but we are trying to we are

1227
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:52,610
not dealing with the eyepiece here we

1228
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:55,399
are trying to operate a rogue

1229
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:57,290
PlayStation which would just trick the

1230
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:59,180
mobile device to send its capability so

1231
00:50:57,290 --> 00:51:01,100
we don't we're not coming from the

1232
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:04,879
internet side but we are going on a

1233
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:08,799
radio side okay my last one speaking

1234
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:11,410
about our other numbered shoe

1235
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:13,810
I've right so bad wait my hands I keep

1236
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:17,589
my favorite understand test with real

1237
00:51:13,810 --> 00:51:20,440
networks for the ta-dum grade yes how

1238
00:51:17,590 --> 00:51:22,960
it's been the test on the real night and

1239
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:25,480
I mean when you were the triangle tech

1240
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:29,110
number two in order to do dumb grade on

1241
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:31,630
real operators and did you spot anything

1242
00:51:29,110 --> 00:51:34,240
you know where they were just keeping to

1243
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:36,310
watch of the logs of the IP and anything

1244
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:38,919
on the radio network actually it's very

1245
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:41,110
difficult to spot it because like once

1246
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:44,980
we just try to operate this in for like

1247
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:46,860
few minutes or or at least it mostly we

1248
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:49,570
do it in the night so when it's like

1249
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:52,450
when we have the complete freedom to do

1250
00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:54,870
or I mean it's really difficult to spot

1251
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:57,129
it like it's unless like you have like

1252
00:51:54,870 --> 00:51:59,859
highly specialized equipment like the

1253
00:51:57,130 --> 00:52:02,140
military equipment really because

1254
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:04,510
speaking about the European ones I'm a

1255
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:07,720
good friend to the sea to the CSO and

1256
00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:09,430
CIA sort kpn in Netherlands and they do

1257
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:12,129
have a top security team I think it's

1258
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:15,100
the only Oh Aminu in Europe that they do

1259
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:17,440
their job so did you took the chance I

1260
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:19,630
think I saw also Netherlands any

1261
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:23,310
feedbacks from there or any other or

1262
00:52:19,630 --> 00:52:25,840
anything no nothing wow it's highly

1263
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:28,150
impossible to detect this one unless you

1264
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:30,160
are like if you have some kind of like

1265
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:32,260
passive scanning device that trying to

1266
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:34,839
monitor this but most of the time we are

1267
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:38,080
not trying to for example like we we

1268
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:40,930
spoof identities which are really like

1269
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:42,430
legitimate if you're like spoofing some

1270
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:44,140
random identities this could might

1271
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:47,440
trigger an an arm but if you are trying

1272
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:48,879
to be like very realistic yeah this does

1273
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:51,220
this goes like most of the time

1274
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:53,830
unnoticed so but I don't believe like

1275
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:57,009
somebody's scanning there this traffic

1276
00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:59,770
actually I remember their reserves from

1277
00:52:57,010 --> 00:53:01,780
Philip Lenoir with LTE back five years

1278
00:52:59,770 --> 00:53:03,340
ago at the canal I think in the box and

1279
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:05,440
we have scanners all the world for all T

1280
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:07,240
there are second boxes but by the time

1281
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:08,950
you finish this analysis we should may

1282
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:11,709
might have finished the attack and gone

1283
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:14,319
home actually so it takes a bit of time

1284
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:17,170
to do this analysis get some result okay

1285
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:19,510
so this is not something expected by the

1286
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:21,790
time like we are actually leaving the

1287
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:25,990
place thank you

1288
00:53:21,790 --> 00:53:29,200
so I have one question and one sort of

1289
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:31,750
word of caution the question is did you

1290
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:34,000
try different devices from different

1291
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:36,280
regions and different devices from

1292
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,680
different operators to see if the UE

1293
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:42,130
difference is varied across those

1294
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:44,350
regions and operator companies yea

1295
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:46,750
actually like bands is one of the main

1296
00:53:44,350 --> 00:53:49,120
thing which married a lot but we are not

1297
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:50,890
majorly like depending on the bands but

1298
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:52,540
certain capabilities like the

1299
00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:54,910
measurement capabilities which we also

1300
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:56,890
use they're also different when you are

1301
00:53:54,910 --> 00:53:58,899
looking on European and then Asian

1302
00:53:56,890 --> 00:54:00,970
phones so we also try to grab from

1303
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:03,820
phones from Korea Japan and then try to

1304
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:05,560
see how different they are so there are

1305
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:07,780
like lot of differences but we try to

1306
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:10,000
design the nmap trying to eliminate

1307
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:11,710
those capabilities which might cause

1308
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:15,070
some disturbance in the in the mapping

1309
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:17,200
so we try to eliminate most of them and

1310
00:54:15,070 --> 00:54:18,700
then but you never know like maybe in

1311
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,200
the future there might be a device which

1312
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:23,200
could again create a problem something

1313
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:25,270
like this so the nice thing would be

1314
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:27,040
like we always try to update this with

1315
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:28,330
new devices and then so that's where

1316
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:30,700
like we are trying to keep it open so

1317
00:54:28,330 --> 00:54:33,370
people can actually if you have a new

1318
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:34,990
device and maybe I don't I might not be

1319
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:37,240
able to get that so you upload the

1320
00:54:34,990 --> 00:54:39,759
capability and then it really helps to

1321
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:41,470
build the in map in a bigger way so we

1322
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,510
really need this reference model as

1323
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:47,470
bigger as possible to get better

1324
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:49,990
detection and the word of caution is I'm

1325
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:52,270
in also the head of security for DEFCON

1326
00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:55,870
and in a past life I used to work for

1327
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:57,610
Vodafone and we routinely scan for this

1328
00:54:55,870 --> 00:55:00,400
kind of behavior during def cons and

1329
00:54:57,610 --> 00:55:02,530
other events it is absolutely possible

1330
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,990
to detect this in a targeted fashion

1331
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:07,180
it's not possible to detect the tree in

1332
00:55:04,990 --> 00:55:08,890
the forest so if you're right inner city

1333
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:10,839
randomly doing stuff you are pretty safe

1334
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:12,580
yeah once you've popped up on the radar

1335
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:14,890
and people know that you're doing stuff

1336
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:18,819
and they can target you they absolutely

1337
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:20,980
can detect it but so be cautious but

1338
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:25,140
yeah in certain areas yes it's possible

1339
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:25,140
but we try to avoid those and then

1340
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:35,000
if I would like put something up in the

1341
00:55:28,579 --> 00:55:36,140
deaf corner like yeah okay thank you

1342
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,420
very much

1343
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:40,848
we are running a little bit short on

1344
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:42,770
time but if we come quite a few

1345
00:55:40,849 --> 00:55:47,390
questions on slider I don't think being

1346
00:55:42,770 --> 00:55:50,869
address no this is this is possible yes

1347
00:55:47,390 --> 00:55:55,759
it will replace yeah then once again if

1348
00:55:50,869 --> 00:55:57,619
your phone is a stationary no it's

1349
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:59,690
during the registration the capabilities

1350
00:55:57,619 --> 00:56:01,970
are transmitted so they do not want to

1351
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:03,740
repeat the procedures again so even if

1352
00:56:01,970 --> 00:56:05,270
you are like I handed over the based

1353
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:06,470
that the capabilities are transmitted

1354
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:10,450
from one base station to the other

1355
00:56:06,470 --> 00:56:13,310
instead of the device sending it again

1356
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:16,450
then it's how I trying tomorrow the

1357
00:56:13,310 --> 00:56:19,310
under eyes in this make my way to sir I

1358
00:56:16,450 --> 00:56:22,250
don't know like what OS they would come

1359
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:23,869
back maybe we have to check we have to

1360
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:28,730
test the ways and then we can yeah

1361
00:56:23,869 --> 00:56:30,619
comment on that okay I think everyone at

1362
00:56:28,730 --> 00:56:35,869
lunch for any longer so I think we have

1363
00:56:30,619 --> 00:56:40,069
a clear winner for the questions a clear

1364
00:56:35,869 --> 00:56:43,690
monopoly they won't want to claim

1365
00:56:40,069 --> 00:56:43,690
ownership for the top question here

1366
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:57,618
thank what if you run the sim card it

1367
00:56:55,520 --> 00:57:01,460
worlds to eat worms to another country

1368
00:56:57,619 --> 00:57:03,319
you know or it updates something Kevin

1369
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:09,800
you're doing the registration again yes

1370
00:57:03,319 --> 00:57:14,569
it would send them that ok to ask this

1371
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:17,780
top question here no one and the gif

1372
00:57:14,569 --> 00:57:19,060
will go to me thank you very much thank

1373
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:21,120
you very much

1374
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:21,120
