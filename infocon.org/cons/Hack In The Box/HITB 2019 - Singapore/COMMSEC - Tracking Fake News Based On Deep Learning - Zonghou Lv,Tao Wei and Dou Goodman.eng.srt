1
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:25,300
I'm a researcher from by dou X knob and

2
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:28,060
I'm just interested in AI scourge under

3
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:31,599
natural language progressing today my

4
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:33,869
topic is News best active

5
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,869
learning

6
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:41,559
well my protection consists of these

7
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:43,530
five captors so nice guy right to the

8
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:46,239
point

9
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,879
with the rapid development of the

10
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:52,449
intellectual information determination

11
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:54,729
has become more and more convenient we

12
00:00:52,449 --> 00:00:59,500
enjoying the convenience but also suffer

13
00:00:54,729 --> 00:01:04,110
some risk in military public opinion tax

14
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:08,939
had become more and more common attacks

15
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:12,130
purposefully fabric edge of story

16
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:15,939
fabricated rumors and effect news this

17
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:20,399
nature occurs widely spread across the

18
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:24,070
internet such as Twitter and the richard

19
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:29,130
often natural public opinion has a bad

20
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:34,509
impact on in diverse companies and the

21
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:38,350
stock market or online short attack is a

22
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:41,740
typical public opinion attack in the

23
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:45,729
past few years many where long public

24
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:48,640
companies have suffered many short

25
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:53,979
attacks and least attacks

26
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:58,530
company's stock price down sharply open

27
00:01:53,979 --> 00:02:02,310
shelters poster alarmers news poster

28
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:06,130
faculty was about tacky teacher company

29
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:10,810
than a windsor companies to start price

30
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:13,750
down first to first to the bottom this

31
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:17,769
is the shortest way out by a lot of

32
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:21,670
stocks after a period of time when the

33
00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:25,930
stock price recovers these store sales

34
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:29,730
we are immediately immediately stay out

35
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:33,180
these stocks so this shows

36
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:41,089
we'll make a profit from the techni in

37
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:45,110
this company's stock price more moreover

38
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:49,400
some attacks fabricate fake news about

39
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:52,739
individuals with some social influence

40
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:56,700
so as that they can ask for some money

41
00:02:52,739 --> 00:03:00,930
on to protect to protect a personal

42
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:04,160
reputation Compu company instil pride

43
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:07,500
under the stoppage of the stock market

44
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,510
basis so lester a to tracking other most

45
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:13,950
odd course

46
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:18,560
however this rumors and vacuous are most

47
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:22,109
only alarmers under each neck effective

48
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:26,519
discriminate information to identify is

49
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:32,549
also also it's so challenging to track

50
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:36,269
the fake news unfortunately we have

51
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:39,930
found that each other has a distinctive

52
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:43,769
writing style ensuing in the nav stable

53
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:47,880
there are two Twitter's file by

54
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:51,410
different authors we can distinguish the

55
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:55,799
author's identity from the writing style

56
00:03:51,410 --> 00:04:00,120
as shown in the right variable and the

57
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:03,859
writing style can be divided into these

58
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:09,090
neighbors such our next game character

59
00:04:03,859 --> 00:04:12,450
scientists under scim managers yeah

60
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:14,840
for example different people have a

61
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:18,180
diverter preference for the usage of

62
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:21,149
awards some people like using some

63
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:24,030
certain words under different people and

64
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:29,700
I could use the knocker using different

65
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:33,599
words so we can identify this author by

66
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:36,740
the word frequency and the more

67
00:04:33,599 --> 00:04:40,820
generally we can attract the news by

68
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:45,470
the by this writing style

69
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:52,420
and there are many networks about this

70
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:57,410
problem so let's now look at this master

71
00:04:52,420 --> 00:05:00,320
in this new network the problem of

72
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:03,380
tracking the animals of course in

73
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:07,340
defining us all the sheep are

74
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:12,020
initiatives each row contains the stop

75
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:16,340
this restart problem also if our ship

76
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:20,299
attribution is really a problem deserved

77
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:24,020
research each identified as odd course

78
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:29,240
also from a given historical condense

79
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:30,919
and all the verification is also an

80
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,470
interesting problem

81
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:39,050
it's verifying whether the authors of

82
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:42,650
articles are same a lot and all the

83
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:49,700
casting is to cluster add costs of the

84
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:54,080
same others so to better to better track

85
00:05:49,700 --> 00:06:01,340
anonymous of course we can come by these

86
00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:04,700
approach to three start problems well

87
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:07,669
all the sleep illnesses a is a

88
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:12,140
long-standing problem and it was

89
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:17,120
initiated by the work Oh masterda under

90
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:20,330
wallace in 1964 according to the

91
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:23,630
timeline we can divide divide this

92
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:27,020
problem into three structures in early

93
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:30,320
2000s and papers are proposed a master

94
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:32,750
of stylistic under content futures are

95
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:37,190
these two researchers and manually

96
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:43,520
instruct mexico character scientist and

97
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:45,080
the Scimitar features around 2000 to

98
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,229
turn the

99
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:52,280
some stars routes proper semester and

100
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:54,559
gram and released master has proved to

101
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:59,508
help improve the to be the most

102
00:06:54,559 --> 00:07:03,619
affect your features under in recent

103
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:07,039
years with the back through of deep

104
00:07:03,619 --> 00:07:09,799
learning the master passed on the plenty

105
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:16,279
networks who was proposed for the old

106
00:07:09,799 --> 00:07:19,748
ship attribution well this existing a

107
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:23,479
message to have abreast social Commons

108
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:27,219
unfastening the master of stylistic and

109
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:32,719
the content features taken as effort to

110
00:07:27,219 --> 00:07:35,899
manually extract features it's so so

111
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:39,169
difficult to us next and master most

112
00:07:35,899 --> 00:07:44,209
effective features so the performance is

113
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:49,179
poor and the master Eric Ingram repaired

114
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:52,879
repairing our text into high high

115
00:07:49,179 --> 00:07:59,208
dimensional under space vector so the

116
00:07:52,879 --> 00:08:02,479
performance is still an immature under

117
00:07:59,209 --> 00:08:06,199
the master based on deep learning have

118
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:11,409
obvious or calm it can can be applied to

119
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:11,409
all the vegetation under also category

120
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:20,059
so we are purpose novel master for

121
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:26,109
authorship attribution analysis to make

122
00:08:20,059 --> 00:08:30,409
up for his shortcomings Fastnet is

123
00:08:26,109 --> 00:08:34,458
unifying the master for first

124
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:37,818
recognition for the Western verification

125
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:41,388
and the rest castering it has achieved a

126
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:44,208
big success in computer vision it

127
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:48,399
inspired by the fascination we proposed

128
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:55,040
a unified master for all the super

129
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:57,370
analysis so our best on the tip Learning

130
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:02,809
Network are mastering them and mapping

131
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:06,649
from text to compact the dimensional you

132
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:08,390
can in space the mapping embers and

133
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:11,750
texture into

134
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:18,230
the surface Recife with the radius Oh

135
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:20,920
one under center orangie in this you can

136
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:26,120
you could eat in space distance

137
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:29,029
indicates texture minority as shown in

138
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:32,680
this figure there are three others and

139
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:36,200
each other's houses three ad costs a

140
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:39,290
text of the same others have a small

141
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:45,260
distance and no text of the distinct

142
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:49,269
author has not distance to organize the

143
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:54,310
vision about mentioned we define the

144
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:57,550
rectifying our subnet but at first

145
00:09:54,310 --> 00:10:00,969
achieve that consistent consists of

146
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:06,290
ankle approach you and are negative as

147
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:08,570
ankle is that factor texture rapportive

148
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:15,529
is a text of the same author as the

149
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:19,160
anchor and the negative is a text of the

150
00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:24,589
different oak incur from the different

151
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:28,930
also from the ankle so our members is

152
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:33,140
really text into the unit in space

153
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:38,510
initially is each text will be embedded

154
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:43,220
in into three random points on the

155
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:47,060
surface of the sea fear so the distance

156
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:49,850
between the anchor until the lecture is

157
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:57,349
the uncertain related to the distance

158
00:10:49,850 --> 00:11:00,529
between the anchor under lecture tools

159
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:05,540
spirit to the anchor and reporter from

160
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:08,570
the lecture we purpose to net loss

161
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:11,569
function how this showing in the right

162
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:15,220
figure this noise function

163
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:18,160
aims to net the squared Euclidean

164
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:22,230
distance between

165
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:24,930
anchor under the lecture oh great

166
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:27,180
the squared you couldn't you could eat

167
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:31,890
in distance between the anchor under the

168
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:36,839
pot you to pet supports as an anchor and

169
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:40,290
reporter from the lecture we induce

170
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:47,670
imagine it's just an academic of the

171
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:51,240
support vector machine so we defined the

172
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:57,380
Trib net loss function as the L for each

173
00:11:51,240 --> 00:12:01,230
tube net if in fact we suspect they're

174
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:06,450
equal the squared Euclidean distance

175
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:08,640
between as a sum of merging under the

176
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:10,950
square that you can in this distance

177
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:13,920
between the ankle and the supportive

178
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:17,190
should the peak should be not greater

179
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:19,920
than the unit square that you can

180
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:23,670
insistence between the anchor under the

181
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:27,750
nature so there are difference between

182
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:34,380
its two value is lost value and the

183
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:37,680
minimum of this value is zero best are

184
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:40,860
based on their previous triplet and

185
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:45,959
attributed loss function we proposed a

186
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:51,410
novel model edge texture ensuing is

187
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:56,490
feature the input of the model is giblet

188
00:12:51,410 --> 00:13:01,469
it consists of ankle I put you under

189
00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:05,190
lecture under the output observed model

190
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:10,170
is three unity empathy they are

191
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:13,830
processed by ultra norm so this is

192
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:20,069
retexe the will be embedded into three

193
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:23,310
into the surface of severe so under the

194
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:28,730
loss function is the true blood loss

195
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:31,579
it's it's to spare it can sprout

196
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:35,070
supportive and the

197
00:13:31,579 --> 00:13:38,660
anchor from the lecture

198
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:42,000
impact in particular the different

199
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:46,319
people at work is the flexible and

200
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:53,880
optional next we will discuss the

201
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:57,120
section of these deep networks okay we

202
00:13:53,880 --> 00:14:01,579
will discussed the nature of these three

203
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:07,350
deep networks in fast text CA Engram

204
00:14:01,579 --> 00:14:12,269
scientists trusting fast text is a fast

205
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:14,250
and nitrate model and its effect here

206
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:17,040
for the problem of text or

207
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:21,600
classification ensuing in the right

208
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:26,219
figure the network of fast tester has

209
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:30,660
three layers and her it'll just one step

210
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:34,310
lymphoid hidden near the imputed food

211
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:37,620
the input features are embedded under

212
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:42,439
under averages true from the hidden

213
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:46,459
variable so fast texter has newer

214
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:52,800
complexity and higher computation

215
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:56,489
efficiently CAA Ingram has been proved

216
00:14:52,800 --> 00:15:00,620
to be effective network for authorship

217
00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:06,779
attribution assume in the right figure

218
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:11,300
the input is correct angwa under this

219
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:15,529
model consists of embedding

220
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:15,529
convolutional under max phone unless

221
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:22,380
Houk and the convolutional net

222
00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:26,540
convolutional neural network has made

223
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:31,800
great progress in text classification

224
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:36,839
CAA Ingram Hal higher complexities and

225
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:40,819
first text but experiments show it has

226
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:40,819
higher motor performance

227
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:51,110
compared with seeing Ingram santak

228
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:56,189
seeing introduce some text never

229
00:15:51,110 --> 00:16:00,180
features as input a soui is the right

230
00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:04,410
figure scientist seeing consists of two

231
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:10,589
embedding to convolutional under one max

232
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:13,980
pooling layers so such as all scientists

233
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:18,450
has a high complexity and high model

234
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:24,180
performance and CA Ingram for the

235
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:27,780
authorship attribution inclusion for

236
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:32,400
these three deep networks if the network

237
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:35,540
has higher complexity then it has a

238
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:40,800
higher performance as shown in the table

239
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:43,319
first extra has a no-account xtg and no

240
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:48,270
performance we know that when the data

241
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:52,980
stage is when the size is not sure to

242
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:55,470
accelerate the training the training of

243
00:16:52,980 --> 00:17:00,170
the model some performance of the motor

244
00:16:55,470 --> 00:17:05,160
of the model can be a square faster so

245
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:08,459
fast text is shouldn't for not larger

246
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:13,800
size on the contrary

247
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:19,280
sian text has higher complexity and the

248
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:24,569
higher performance so it's suitable for

249
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:28,199
smaller size that the section of deep

250
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:33,510
network can be determined by there are

251
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:41,430
test size so income for mice which was

252
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:46,800
CA in Ingram as our deep network in

253
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:50,550
summary we propose a normal mode model

254
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:52,919
as texture it uses subject knows

255
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:57,809
function and

256
00:17:52,920 --> 00:18:02,270
keep network of CAA Angra next row we

257
00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:08,040
will discuss truly distillation strategy

258
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:13,110
given there are 100 or others and each

259
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:20,629
others have 100 or odd course so each

260
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:29,899
each other has 998 meaning triplets and

261
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:32,520
also has 9.8 been in triplets so is

262
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:39,240
impossible possible to use all the

263
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:44,960
children to train model so to accelerate

264
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:48,870
the model training we have to propose

265
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:53,809
effective tribulations to blatant action

266
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:59,668
strategy so next we will discuss our

267
00:18:53,809 --> 00:19:03,830
novel strategy such as reading section

268
00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:03,830
and the dynamic connection

269
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:14,010
firstly let's briefly introduce Radames

270
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:17,790
next strategy this strategy are

271
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:22,340
rademenes next triplets are suing on the

272
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:26,178
net first only for each other we

273
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:30,809
randomly steps next alarm org and

274
00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:33,809
culture pairs and the quantity is

275
00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:38,428
proportional to the number of least

276
00:19:33,809 --> 00:19:41,580
others ad costs under its it's time to

277
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:43,910
exceed the maximum of these authors are

278
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,909
cost

279
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:52,250
secondly for each snack cedar or

280
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:56,940
Anchorage appear we randomly select a

281
00:19:52,250 --> 00:20:05,669
certain number of negative to recompose

282
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:06,630
to bless and so read an action is simple

283
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:10,290
about the

284
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:16,680
snack teacher or triplets maybe not

285
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:22,770
efficient for the motor training so is

286
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:28,950
so Lester it was next to propose select

287
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:32,820
your effective to bed strategy when

288
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:37,170
climbing the mountain if we mostly work

289
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:40,550
on the flat road we want you to work a

290
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:45,710
longer distance to reach the mountaintop

291
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:51,470
so inspired by a mountain climbing we

292
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:51,470
proposed a dynamical nection strategy

293
00:20:52,580 --> 00:21:04,560
firstly a desert is eveni under adam

294
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:09,780
divided into alarm all petitions then

295
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:14,040
for each for four for each partition we

296
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:18,060
snagged anchor posture pairs as the

297
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:21,090
radium strategy then for each neck to

298
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:23,840
the anchor pot your pair we're Adam any

299
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:30,689
snacks

300
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:34,020
we're Adam is next we wish to the first

301
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:37,070
reconstruct an actual Candice this kind

302
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:42,510
of the shooters satisfy is following

303
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:45,810
condition there are squared unit in

304
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:48,930
distance between the ankle and

305
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:51,750
selectively should be not great the

306
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:54,750
answer under some of the Machine under

307
00:21:51,750 --> 00:22:00,210
the squared you can against distance

308
00:21:54,750 --> 00:22:03,720
between the anchor under the polio and

309
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:07,970
aster will we were retinas neck when

310
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:11,100
actually from these candidates so

311
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:15,630
listless enacted or triplets have a

312
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:18,750
positive impact under lost value so

313
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:21,410
there are efficient triplets

314
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:26,780
[Music]

315
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:31,170
next we will choose our experiments

316
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:34,160
before the experiment we prepare a test

317
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:38,400
site as follows

318
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:42,630
firstly we crowd articles from edge

319
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:48,540
websites such as who showed our new

320
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:53,190
intercom and so on and then we processed

321
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:57,629
the raw data for example we remove

322
00:22:53,190 --> 00:23:02,280
incomplete and dublicate at course from

323
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:05,760
the raw data and we also remove the

324
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:11,670
duplicate others as among multiple

325
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:15,210
websites and to make to make across

326
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:18,710
truly alarmers within each teacher the

327
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:25,290
author information in article such as

328
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:34,250
Auslan which had ID finally outside had

329
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:42,990
about 100 under 30 thousand articles and

330
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:48,570
3 sound under 600 others we use test now

331
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:54,680
p40 as the GPU 10th floor and the chorus

332
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:58,710
as the platform of 40 planning we all to

333
00:23:54,680 --> 00:24:03,420
explore how our master fest against the

334
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:08,340
other message we win the winner number

335
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:11,790
of others increases also sort of--sort

336
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:18,929
either by the number of odd cause

337
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:26,310
firstly then we choose top 5 top 20 top

338
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:30,270
50 top 100 200 500 top went down to

339
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:32,620
enter top to sound others as our waters

340
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:37,090
with technique

341
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:40,299
besides to balance the lumber of the odd

342
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:45,820
costs for each other we choose no more

343
00:24:40,299 --> 00:24:52,389
than 100 articles and the trained

344
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:54,610
history space is aids to to to stress

345
00:24:52,390 --> 00:25:00,510
stress and so certainly compare our

346
00:24:54,610 --> 00:25:04,330
master with with a semester we use f1 to

347
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:13,408
evaluate different master in Alsip

348
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:18,460
attribution and our best 9 as follows

349
00:25:13,409 --> 00:25:24,010
CAA in Guam CA in world and in Guam as

350
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:27,250
VM the first to master our best on deep

351
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:30,250
learning and technology and the last

352
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:38,919
master applies their features of

353
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:42,400
character Ingram we can look at the chip

354
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:46,620
latest action strategy is critical in

355
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:52,570
our master so firstly we compare these

356
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:56,459
two to latest election strategies

357
00:25:52,570 --> 00:26:00,780
I was showing in turn left figure

358
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:04,570
dynamic election strategy has a

359
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:07,899
significant improve improvement over a

360
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:15,189
rhythm section strategy especially when

361
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:19,440
the lumber authors is not next let's

362
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:25,260
compare our master with us bestnice

363
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:30,039
suing in the right figure compared

364
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:34,450
column a to and with compared kilometer

365
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:39,330
with the column 4 and column 5 we can

366
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:45,030
see our our nerville master has better

367
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:45,030
f1c a in wood under CA Ingram

368
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:54,159
compared a club to is Clum six the

369
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:59,400
Ingram SVM help 8f was an hour lower

370
00:26:54,160 --> 00:27:06,309
master wenzer number of Ossus is 50 or

371
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:10,150
100 and Y in the her honor her our

372
00:27:06,309 --> 00:27:13,450
master has obvious at around stirs than

373
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:20,470
other best night was a number of others

374
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:26,440
is not finally our net Sumner has them

375
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:32,730
might rise our work in this week will

376
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:38,850
have made some contribution as follows

377
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:38,850
firstly we design truly the best master

378
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:48,610
and its proper to be effective

379
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:53,370
besides we build the first Chinese the

380
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:57,790
SS for all ship and all initiatives and

381
00:27:53,370 --> 00:28:01,030
we design a if in fact YouTube needs an

382
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:07,000
action strategy and it is proved to be

383
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:08,520
effective under appearance so that our

384
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,580
elements to have better performance

385
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:18,240
other as nice especially you when Saddam

386
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:24,309
of the also is not you and in the future

387
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:28,270
we will experience more tests and the we

388
00:28:24,309 --> 00:28:30,340
will further optimize the tips learning

389
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:35,260
that works under the triplets nection

390
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:38,439
strategy i also we will apply our master

391
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:47,429
in also castering under other

392
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:47,429
verification so that's all thank you

393
