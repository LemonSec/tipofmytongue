1
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:43,190
Vig csq today we'll be talking about car

2
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,480
hacking main easel so this would be a

3
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:47,379
biggie let's talk on how we actually

4
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:50,959
build this easel within a month's time

5
00:00:47,379 --> 00:00:53,000
right so for today's contents you'll be

6
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,190
talking about the object is how we got

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,559
started how we built the prototype the

8
00:00:55,190 --> 00:01:02,360
test bench and how we actually hacked

9
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:05,690
the prototype and the next steps okay so

10
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:08,450
I'm Alena this is my teammates paces and

11
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:11,060
train young we are from the castorini

12
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:13,970
quota this out with Angela so we have a

13
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:16,399
total about 18 members and Counting so

14
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:18,500
we are part of the wider cyber security

15
00:01:16,399 --> 00:01:20,539
community group called division zero in

16
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,539
Singapore and recently we had a

17
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:25,759
partnership with a srg the automotive

18
00:01:23,539 --> 00:01:27,800
security research group and we run the

19
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:32,210
Singapore chapter there is a meetup

20
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:35,590
group online that you can find ok you

21
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:38,300
object this so it's everybody know that

22
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:40,430
the cars in Singapore it feels very

23
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:42,408
expensive so the main purpose of

24
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:44,119
starting the car security Quattro was to

25
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:47,479
enable and facilitate learning on

26
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:49,180
automotive surface greedy and one of the

27
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:51,950
main goals is to facilitate and promote

28
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:53,810
automotive cybersecurity awareness so we

29
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,790
do so by organizing villages and

30
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:59,960
conferences such as InfoSec in the city

31
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:04,040
as well as ITB and to actually perform

32
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:05,809
outreach activities so we would like to

33
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,660
actually empower like my security

34
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:11,450
enthusiast by getting hands-on

35
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:13,280
experience to in order to do that we

36
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:15,410
actually build a working test bench to

37
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,110
cover the automotive security testing

38
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:19,609
and cyber-physical testing itself so you

39
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:23,480
can see that we actually use real car

40
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:24,980
parts for our easel and ultimately we

41
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,170
like to contribute either a or

42
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:29,810
automotive cyber security industry

43
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:33,230
itself through research and community

44
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:35,299
engagement and ultimately we would like

45
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:38,209
to conduct proper responsibility

46
00:02:35,299 --> 00:02:41,060
disclosure to any respective vendors for

47
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:43,970
any volunteers form so can I have a show

48
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:45,489
of hands who here drives to work of who

49
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:49,040
he owns a car

50
00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:50,280
ok cool so in the next video

51
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,140
imagine this

52
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:57,209
if this happens to you while you are

53
00:02:52,140 --> 00:03:00,869
driving home okay so we actually did a

54
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:03,990
we play attack on our prototype Kyle

55
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:07,500
itself this part I he or she from the

56
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:11,520
specific vehicle we are driving normally

57
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:14,340
about 20 30 km/h so as you can see the

58
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:17,370
speedometer Andy way up here meter

59
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:21,600
actually increases but we actually drive

60
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:24,690
a enormous V so at times you may see

61
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:27,930
that the speedometer returns to normal

62
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:31,440
speed like 30 kilometers power because

63
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:33,930
the ECU D etre ECU is also sending

64
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:37,079
continuously sending the right speed and

65
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:39,660
we are also sending our spoofing packets

66
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,459
in there so funny in order to maintain

67
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:43,859
like the spoofing we actually have to

68
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:47,970
send data faster than the etre ici you

69
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:49,230
do actually achieve this so you can see

70
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:52,230
the charger chrome it has power wise

71
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:55,950
actually the maximum okay so we all be

72
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:57,420
going through all of this true building

73
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:00,709
the prototype and getting started later

74
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:03,149
alright so this is how we got started

75
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:07,200
all right so this is actually just a

76
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:08,730
very simple overview of what we were

77
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,738
looking at all the guys that we were

78
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:13,109
following true and this was what we got

79
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:16,019
so these are different for the coaster

80
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:17,700
oh that's in the car and what we

81
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:20,519
actually want to focus on today is the

82
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:22,919
can bus itself below it right below the

83
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,630
can bus occasionally here's a Kennedy so

84
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:26,789
Kennedy is just like an extension of Ken

85
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:29,370
can usually transmit it bites

86
00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:34,530
whereas kind of the increases it it

87
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:36,390
allows for 64 bytes instead right so how

88
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:39,000
to access the canvas is using the obd2

89
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:43,140
apart hope you part is like thing of it

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,900
s like your USB you just insert into the

91
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:47,520
pot and then you'll be able to like the

92
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,909
Gnostic messages of it and that's how

93
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,280
the car mechanics Indy different in like

94
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:55,229
any technician will be ought to read and

95
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,479
you'll unless they got any errors in the

96
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:59,310
car yes how they actually read it well

97
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:00,688
the two main points that you want to

98
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:03,449
point out to you today you see

99
00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:05,849
ten high and you can low pins so a spin

100
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:07,739
six and pin 14 so actually over here

101
00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:09,628
yeah but you will see like let's say if

102
00:05:07,739 --> 00:05:11,128
you come up close to our easel you all

103
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:17,849
see that it's only like two Wireless is

104
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:20,069
connected to our transceiver so these

105
00:05:17,849 --> 00:05:22,709
this is how like I can pack it looks

106
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:26,279
like next time we'll show you obviously

107
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:27,569
like an example of how it looks like in

108
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:29,879
the more important parts here is

109
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:32,879
actually the identifier you can ID which

110
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:35,849
is a unique identifier it represents a

111
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:37,259
master's priority and also it shows it

112
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:39,808
actually corresponds uniquely to the

113
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:41,429
different car components and the next

114
00:05:39,809 --> 00:05:44,219
one is important is the data line code

115
00:05:41,429 --> 00:05:49,498
pretty sure which contains all the

116
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:51,149
important portions sorry I did a few all

117
00:05:49,499 --> 00:05:55,199
right so over here you can see an

118
00:05:51,149 --> 00:05:58,889
example so Sok is the interface because

119
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:02,069
we connect the can transceiver from our

120
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:07,469
computer over to the ECU then the C can

121
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:09,209
ID and the see data fill this we

122
00:06:07,469 --> 00:06:13,619
actually met out the different car

123
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:16,829
components from the popular car model

124
00:06:13,619 --> 00:06:19,639
that we were testing out on so in race

125
00:06:16,829 --> 00:06:22,679
we can she see the fast scan which is

126
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:27,349
more which she caters to more of the

127
00:06:22,679 --> 00:06:31,198
important modules like the ischium and

128
00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:33,628
the blue part is actually the Lost

129
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,689
Weekend or quite beacon so is for

130
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:40,199
slightly less important functions in car

131
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:42,119
the purple dye no I know a human custom

132
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:45,949
module is important because it's like a

133
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:45,949
gateway between the esken and the beacon

134
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:53,369
so now we'll be talking about pure how

135
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:55,438
we actually build the prototype so we

136
00:06:53,369 --> 00:06:57,929
identified the fillet essential parts to

137
00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:00,149
build a status test bench one of the

138
00:06:57,929 --> 00:07:03,119
main important things is the electronic

139
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:04,499
control you need which is the ECU yet

140
00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:06,389
you allows connection towards the

141
00:07:04,499 --> 00:07:09,959
instrument clusters as you can see over

142
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:12,509
here and it for the interim Acosta's

143
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:13,820
they actually displays the speed the RPM

144
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:16,340
so we actually allows

145
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:18,469
thing and we play attacks we also have

146
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,840
another portion another part their

147
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:22,220
behavior actually just police the

148
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,950
emission key cylinder and the

149
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:27,620
immobilizer itself so yeah she provides

150
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:29,390
the starter initial signal for ECU so in

151
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:31,190
the future we hope to just turn the key

152
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:32,930
and be able to start the whole easel

153
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:35,870
through the key itself so it'd be more

154
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:38,600
realistic and part of the analysis tools

155
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:40,540
that we use is the cannibal it's a small

156
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:43,010
piece of device over here which allows

157
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:45,050
communication between USB you can and

158
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:48,140
the clan transceiver chip provides the

159
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:50,720
differential transmit capability and a

160
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:56,930
PC via capability from the bus to the

161
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:58,640
controller so from pieces last slide you

162
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:01,460
can see that it's the home mapping order

163
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:04,849
diagram this is the paths that we comedy

164
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:07,280
on right now so the ECU the ECM the PCM

165
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:09,740
power train control module the ECM is

166
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,960
the engine control module the instrument

167
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:14,750
cluster the reason why is purple is

168
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:17,239
because it is X as a gateway to allow

169
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:19,460
both fast can and body can to

170
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,470
communicate between each other so the

171
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:23,690
body can itself it's for devices that

172
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:26,690
are really so like dog control your last

173
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:28,370
critical portions so hence it's actually

174
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:30,710
easier for us to map out the whole thing

175
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:34,340
to visualize the whole part of the car

176
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:37,010
itself so we actually chose to build a

177
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:39,800
test bench for various reasons one of it

178
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:41,150
most importantly is safety testing on a

179
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:43,039
real car like what we did earlier on

180
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:47,090
it's actually very quite interest

181
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:48,680
because you have no certainty of what

182
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:51,380
the results could be so the vistas are

183
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:54,560
unpredictable and the cost of fighting

184
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:56,570
an extra car is nothing expensive and we

185
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,750
actually triggered some errors when we

186
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:02,600
actually did a replay attack so what an

187
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:03,830
end emotion the testamentary allows us a

188
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,710
better showcase RVs outs for

189
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:08,330
presentations and it's easier for us to

190
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:10,430
correlate the parts for the different

191
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:15,020
can idea is to simulate an actual

192
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:18,079
vehicle itself so the final design was

193
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:19,540
an it was placed on the easel it was

194
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,280
actually a joke because

195
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:24,589
jinyoung actually come very recently and

196
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:26,510
then he loan us this easel it was used

197
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:29,620
to put his wedding photo but

198
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:33,079
this is now a prototype display and then

199
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:35,930
our carpets are pretty oh it's a cheap

200
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:39,319
cheap officer to purchase this over

201
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:42,920
carpets because we are non profit group

202
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:44,660
we find ourselves and it does not have

203
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,939
connect that feature connected car

204
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:48,589
vehicle features but it's a key

205
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:52,699
essential for members to understand can

206
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:54,110
bus functionality and previously we set

207
00:09:52,699 --> 00:09:56,630
up all the instrument clusters on the

208
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:59,149
table itself which is her so we took

209
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:01,459
about one to two hours to dismember all

210
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:05,060
the wires and plug it back in back in a

211
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:07,040
back pod as you can see there and most

212
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:11,209
of the time we had refri wires we broke

213
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:13,910
many wires and it's not is is not

214
00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:16,310
efficient for us to actually put it on

215
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:18,949
just the tebow itself so we decided more

216
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:21,979
everything up for testing purposes and

217
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:23,689
showcase presentation purposes so now

218
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:42,370
we'll show you how we actually have to

219
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:44,480
put a tight sorry the mics okay yeah so

220
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:45,529
Elina already just mentioned about the

221
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,170
compound

222
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:50,089
maybe I should've put it my back thought

223
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:51,740
about some of the components and every

224
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:53,389
piece together the reason why we put up

225
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:56,870
on the e so so now that's about how we

226
00:10:53,389 --> 00:10:58,339
can actually make use of the setup

227
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:01,910
itself to actually figure out how the

228
00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:03,380
car works so with that we had to have a

229
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:05,510
systematic way over here dealing with

230
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:07,250
instead of just poking around randomly

231
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:09,740
so the first thing we did was actually

232
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:12,980
look at what other can messages there

233
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:14,899
are being there are being done by an

234
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:17,540
actual vehicle and then after that we

235
00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:18,740
try to replay these messages on the test

236
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:20,240
patch itself see whether we can figure

237
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:22,130
out what each of these messages actually

238
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,069
mean I know to figure out whether it is

239
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:26,360
other functionality also based on all

240
00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:28,010
these things we also try to do some

241
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,389
fuzzing so we look at the package

242
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:32,000
self-referred of school for create our

243
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:35,120
own packets to be able to find out

244
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,740
things that maybe we maybe from the car

245
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,010
itself beyond allowed to actually do but

246
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:41,630
programmatically you could do it yeah so

247
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:42,950
we also want more people to be able to

248
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:45,980
work on one machine as you can see it's

249
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:48,020
a bit hot for maybe one for many people

250
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:51,620
to work on one device on its own so they

251
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:53,900
say instead of a way to use a Raspberry

252
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:55,010
Pi and SSH inside to be able to many

253
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:58,010
people looking at what's actually

254
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:59,620
happening and decide what it can get off

255
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:01,939
the reverse engineering process itself

256
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:03,590
so we are the designated videographer

257
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:05,390
all the things that we do we don't

258
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:07,280
really see the response directly on site

259
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:09,380
on our computers itself because as you

260
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,180
see it manifests on the computer and

261
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:13,100
from the car itself or on the dashboard

262
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,660
so that's why we kind of need to do this

263
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,820
timeline correlation in terms of the

264
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:20,360
messages that come out as well as what's

265
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:23,300
actually happening of the card so so

266
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:25,190
yeah we of course can be more than boil

267
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:27,650
down to three different three three

268
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:28,970
steps cat does retrieve an actual

269
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:30,800
vehicle that we play on a test bench

270
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:32,540
that's the first step second of all so

271
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,780
I'll fussing you know once we find out

272
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:36,920
this bunch of ten IDs that is IDs are

273
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,810
appearing they seem to be doing

274
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,000
something we recall what's taking place

275
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:43,670
and then after that we try to reverse a

276
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,310
GG of credit do stuff to each other

277
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:47,810
bytes there's only so much that we can

278
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:49,729
do we kind of brute force some of these

279
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:51,439
parameters and once we think we

280
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:52,970
understand what these mean which is put

281
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,170
these packets into a particular flower

282
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:56,360
and replay to see whether it actually

283
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:58,250
has that intended effect and then we

284
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,660
compare our database based on all these

285
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,580
Kennedy repeat the process and

286
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,870
ultimately we have a good understanding

287
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,990
of a see what's happening in the

288
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:07,280
communication bus on the vehicle itself

289
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:10,040
so we're gonna go to a demo

290
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:12,319
these videos are there in case in case

291
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:22,010
the demo doesn't work like always this

292
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:23,540
things happen regularly alright so what

293
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:26,750
you're seeing on the screen right now is

294
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:28,310
the Raspberry Pi that's connected to the

295
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:31,040
test bench that we have in front over

296
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:32,959
here on the ESO so I'm gonna go through

297
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,969
some of the software that we use that's

298
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:37,010
open source that we use to actually do

299
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:38,810
this process so first up we mentioned

300
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:41,930
that a cannibal and so this can

301
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:44,359
transceiver that we got actually it's a

302
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:46,069
phases through the computer through a

303
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,750
little bit through a down interface and

304
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:52,120
this is done over USB

305
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:55,029
so the first thing set it up as a as a

306
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:57,770
device

307
00:13:55,029 --> 00:14:00,320
okay so you will see that is actually

308
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:01,760
aps-c SSL 1001 in that we gave to it and

309
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,560
it appears as an air interface which we

310
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,510
can communicate over there

311
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:08,209
however in this I said that it's

312
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:09,920
actually on the USB so there's so what

313
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:13,040
we did was I said Jesus this this

314
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:18,560
package called 10 utils as far as canvas

315
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:20,029
UT iOS you can just get it can - yes if

316
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,739
you get it'll come with a suite of

317
00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:23,390
different kind of tools that allow you

318
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:25,430
to set this up as well as the render the

319
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:26,720
vase so don't think that the library

320
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:29,120
that's used to actually the program is

321
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,850
used to actually do the net way

322
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,140
interfaces called SL can be if you

323
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:35,600
present do you see that there's a bunch

324
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:38,600
of commands it's just simple specifying

325
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,760
what it's the mount rated speed and TTY

326
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,500
USB that is connected to it so we really

327
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,089
done that for you here sort of you know

328
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,640
we don't really minimize the amount of

329
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:48,980
hiccups we say release show that is

330
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:50,480
connected so once it's connected you can

331
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:52,370
see if you come up and you see there's a

332
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,500
blue light flashing on the device itself

333
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:56,060
that's just an indicator that there's

334
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,730
some transmission going on because it's

335
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:00,020
connected to an actual canvas so how do

336
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:02,029
we actually see what's happening on a

337
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:04,640
camp as well there's a few tools so the

338
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:06,980
first one it's not can dump a bunch of

339
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:10,970
things just gonna tell you that you can

340
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:12,500
can dump what's happening on Kent SL 10

341
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:13,670
zero which is all interface itself and

342
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,640
when you press until you see a whole

343
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:18,170
bunch of messages so why does it useful

344
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,819
is because well if you can lock what's

345
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:21,529
happening and we put in a flower we can

346
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,790
do a grep and we can use scratch we can

347
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:24,950
do analysis to see actually what's in

348
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:26,719
each of the columns inside however this

349
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:28,640
is pretty cumbersome and it's not really

350
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,870
good for life testing so what we use is

351
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:37,610
something called can sniffer here's a

352
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:46,910
flag - see - give it some color and we

353
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:49,160
specify again SL can 0 can 0 0 ok right

354
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:50,480
so can sniffer a small for life testing

355
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,980
it doesn't have the same kind of it

356
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,880
doesn't capture it doesn't display all

357
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,620
the packets are actually happening

358
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,870
because of the time refresh rate itself

359
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,040
however was highlighted in red are

360
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,870
things that are actually actively

361
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,420
changing in the bytes so as mentioned

362
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:03,890
before by pieces you can see the can

363
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,650
idea across the data fields the IDs

364
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:07,760
represent something some some function

365
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:11,810
of the car is happening

366
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:13,580
it's like the RPM or whether is the door

367
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:14,989
lock or something like that and the data

368
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,370
is sample control like that what's

369
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,480
actually happening in terms of the

370
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,130
parameters of what's happening in that

371
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,200
so we have a bunch of IDs and you have a

372
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:22,310
bunch of idea an idea of what is

373
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,250
actually changing but nothing is

374
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:27,050
happening if we do this on a live car we

375
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,550
actually see is we correlate this with

376
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:29,839
the videos and we see I say what's

377
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:31,640
happening so we do a screen capture or

378
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,230
what's happening here together with must

379
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,760
videoing in terms of us while we're

380
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:37,910
driving the car and some of the things

381
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:41,810
that are happening so for example I

382
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:46,910
would I have a Ken done so if you see

383
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:48,979
this this there's this file called gem

384
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:51,439
dump this actually do a lot louder we

385
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:53,120
generated when we drove the car and we

386
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,630
actually got a dump so if you look a bit

387
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,980
inside this is what hello like so this

388
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:59,689
just your messages inside

389
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:01,460
once you have in this format we have

390
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:03,410
something called can player which mister

391
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:04,670
allows you to replay all these messages

392
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:07,579
so you got so our testbench arisen

393
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:11,959
driving anytime for example but what we

394
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:14,690
what we can do is is we can use can

395
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:17,660
player which is another path can you

396
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:19,130
tell us itself okay see them so the help

397
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:21,890
will show you that you can actually put

398
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:23,390
the input file as you can give it an

399
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:26,060
input file and what happens okay I

400
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:33,940
should do something here this let me

401
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:36,020
switch on can sniffle so that's okay 0

402
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:37,730
okay so you can see what's happening on

403
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:40,879
the canvas and this is what happens if I

404
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:42,710
replay the thing itself so this is

405
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,120
simulating what's driving and all the

406
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:46,400
canned messages that are happening right

407
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:48,649
if you look at the custom meter you'll

408
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,000
see needles not to move you'll see the

409
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,530
speed will change this is simulating

410
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,980
driving when you move from parking brake

411
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:55,910
the parking always to drive and other

412
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:58,610
things that happening putting on the

413
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:59,840
seat bill and not but what not based on

414
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:02,240
this and true light really just

415
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,070
eyeballing quite a lot we can try to

416
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,080
guess like when I do something why is

417
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:07,520
the thing that's changing over there and

418
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,260
this is quite a lot after so we get a

419
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,210
few people they focus on a few of the

420
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:13,730
IDS and we try to compare based on the

421
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:16,580
videos once what we think could be the

422
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:19,100
case right so this will run for quite a

423
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:21,560
while so I'm just gonna stop maybe have

424
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:24,169
some what you can come

425
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:25,970
see that's quite quite a lot Kendall so

426
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:28,610
actually you'll be able to see some of

427
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:33,380
the functions that will be happening so

428
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:35,659
based on that what we then come up if

429
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:40,060
it's a database of all these ten IDs so

430
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:43,940
what we do is that all those is that we

431
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:45,590
came up with our own C program to be

432
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:47,270
able to store these things and just very

433
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:49,939
automatically on the replay some of

434
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:52,190
these some of these messages inside

435
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:54,920
yourself so these are specific pillows

436
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:56,900
that would represent what is happening

437
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:59,300
in so let me just show you some of these

438
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:06,410
examples so let me do a chance there

439
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:07,850
again - CSL can 0 all right so these are

440
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:11,840
the things that again happen in a car

441
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:15,169
nothing much let's go for visual one

442
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:17,300
okay so desert dem so often one of our

443
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:18,830
courses that demoed the RPM change so

444
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:21,139
what is gonna happen rpms or revolutions

445
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:26,120
for a minute it's just gonna show the

446
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:28,460
needle moving from 0 to 8,000 rpm all

447
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:30,679
that all the while I didn't go back to 0

448
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:32,240
and this just shows all you see it's not

449
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,290
the whole bunch of messages you just see

450
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,180
one particular message that's actually

451
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:36,530
coming out right now compared to when

452
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:38,420
it's not doing anything so I mean this

453
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:40,250
is demonstrating actually okay we figure

454
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:44,630
out at this idea that he responsible for

455
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:47,450
this so I think another more visual one

456
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:48,920
is also the gear change so you have any

457
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:50,390
gears inside the car sometimes you may

458
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,370
not be able to activate some of these

459
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:54,680
things like based on the handle itself

460
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:57,020
sometimes just disable but you know some

461
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:58,310
programming the like an ID to catch you

462
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:00,680
switch all of them on you can actually

463
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:02,210
but it's at this point is just a visual

464
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,250
display tester it doesn't really affect

465
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:06,680
the car but there's some ways that it

466
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:08,780
could leave to do other things in the

467
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:10,850
car like the off parameters are not

468
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:14,600
actually available for you to control in

469
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:17,330
the car system itself yeah if you want

470
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:19,010
to find out more and play for our our

471
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:21,050
our setup here we all we have a booth

472
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:23,030
over there so this is I just say for the

473
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:24,409
demo we have a lot more to show but this

474
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:26,120
is the idea of the methodology that we

475
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:28,760
go to compile the database and then

476
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,860
ultimately design ways that we can think

477
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,960
would be potentially dangerous and

478
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:35,790
things that an attacker may want to do

479
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:41,010
that would affect the driver itself

480
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:41,010
yeah I'm gonna switch back to slides

481
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:09,399
yeah

482
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:11,020
so some observations are the things that

483
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,730
we conduct based on our reverse

484
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,889
engineering and compiling this database

485
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:16,930
is that wow it's really easy to do like

486
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:19,480
we did it in a man like what Nina

487
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:21,040
mentioned just being curious about some

488
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,880
of the things it's a broadcast net what

489
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,500
you don't have to do any crypto

490
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,320
verification and your authentication

491
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,490
whatsoever these vehicles on the road so

492
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,860
watch if you're in the car able to

493
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:31,270
access through these two wires you could

494
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,379
probably do quite a lot of things that

495
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:34,950
would mess with the mice I am now

496
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:37,360
infested by infested car or something

497
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:39,040
but yeah you could probably think of

498
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,770
creative ways of using this search you

499
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:44,440
distract the driver or make it dangerous

500
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:45,700
for the driver itself the things that we

501
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,080
actually be able to test for the replay

502
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:51,730
attacks at the spoofing replay attacks

503
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:53,439
in terms of just dumping out can I can

504
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:55,780
dump itself in every playing it's moving

505
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,600
it's just for the specific IDs that were

506
00:21:55,780 --> 00:22:01,000
interested in the impact of the text on

507
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,530
vehicles of humans mentioned already the

508
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,290
replay attacks on vehicles can be that I

509
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:07,300
want that error code that can break the

510
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:08,920
vehicle can make it really hard for the

511
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,899
driver to actually control our vehicle

512
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:12,100
that's not spoofing itself unnecessarily

513
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,120
fear in the driver when you see

514
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,290
something that you don't understand

515
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,330
what's happening while you're driving at

516
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:18,129
a high speed this can create unnecessary

517
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:23,290
risk for the driver and the driver and

518
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:24,040
the people around him yeah so we already

519
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:28,600
mentioned a Vig

520
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:30,340
and fortunately managed to cause an

521
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,840
engine check light to happen as well so

522
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,310
this is one of the dangers of testing on

523
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,399
an actual vehicle it's competin a test

524
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:38,530
bench but if you are able to control

525
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,910
even the engine this engine check light

526
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:42,730
and what count messages inside could

527
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:44,620
affect the car in ways that we wouldn't

528
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:45,610
know about yeah and this is some of the

529
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:49,860
things that we work on nothing more

530
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:52,659
research on as well yeah

531
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:56,169
so now we'll be talking more about our

532
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:59,590
next steps future plans is to continue

533
00:22:56,170 --> 00:23:00,610
working on this particular ECU so there

534
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:02,500
are some things that we haven't tested

535
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:05,260
and are still in the meets of testing

536
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:07,630
you wishes the UDS command the unified

537
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:09,010
dynastic services quote so that it's how

538
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:10,600
can a low-speed

539
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:14,440
actually control the bricks of the car

540
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:17,139
can actually kill the ECU by Sonny ECU

541
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:19,240
visit commands we are also working on

542
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:22,240
key fob attacks which I'll show later

543
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:24,220
and we are basically we just purchased

544
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,200
the immobilizer we are trying to

545
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:28,300
reprogram the vehicle identifier number

546
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,220
or the VIN of it because we actually

547
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:32,710
purchase it from different castes so it

548
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:34,930
will not work directly with this ECU so

549
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:37,570
either we reprogram the ECU or the

550
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:41,170
immobilizer to actually make the whole

551
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:43,570
thing work right so for the key fob

552
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:45,790
attacks because we only had the car for

553
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:48,070
one day these are the things that

554
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:50,920
actually we found out operates on two

555
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:53,169
different frequencies so it's 433

556
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:55,270
megahertz and we actually because of the

557
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:59,020
immobilizer that we bought the other key

558
00:23:55,270 --> 00:24:00,700
that we had operates on 315 megahertz so

559
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:03,520
there are two frequencies being used for

560
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:06,580
this particular comic and in France on

561
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:09,340
PSK so and how we actually found out is

562
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:11,500
because we use PQRS on the extreme right

563
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:14,980
hand side of the picture itself you can

564
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,790
see two peaks on the frequency shown on

565
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:19,630
G qrx

566
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:22,149
and we actually used RTO as the lasting

567
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:24,940
one and played our F so the idea as the

568
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:27,850
Oni is only able to receive signals and

569
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:29,290
then the equine access a charmer as you

570
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:31,629
can see on your Hicks yourself the

571
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:34,149
universal video hacker there is a lot of

572
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:35,920
noise when we press when we execute the

573
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:38,500
code Emme when we press the key so

574
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:40,990
basically the car cannot receive any

575
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:43,300
signals at a part of time and we use the

576
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:45,310
you are historic picture the unlock

577
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:47,980
signals as well and the bleed RF to

578
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:49,720
actually transmit of this because they

579
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:53,770
are F is dual frequency you can actually

580
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:55,330
do that so we are in the midst of

581
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:57,910
planning for prototypes room right now

582
00:24:55,330 --> 00:25:00,780
we hope to be able to work on more

583
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:04,200
connected vehicle function version

584
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:07,230
the under the si SAE level three to five

585
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:09,750
and true that we can work on adaptive

586
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:12,210
cruise controls a cc or the advanced

587
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:14,850
driver assistance systems a das that

588
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:16,500
runs on Ken which we will be able to

589
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:19,050
control and modify some of the features

590
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,790
on it and ultimately we want to work on

591
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:22,710
autonomous vehicles and contribute

592
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:27,030
towards the safety regulations of the ad

593
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:29,160
industry right so some key takeaways

594
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:31,230
from this presentation as you all know

595
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,610
cars are increasingly connected security

596
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:36,720
by design should be implemented for all

597
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:39,929
vehicles which we actually see now on

598
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,400
most latest car models mapping out

599
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:42,780
attack surface aware should be

600
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,250
identified before setting up a test

601
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:45,540
bench so this is one of the key things

602
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:48,120
that we do not do and we were running

603
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:50,790
around in circles thinking of which

604
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:52,290
parameter to actually attack first so

605
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:54,420
this is actually pretty essential if you

606
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:55,980
want to be your own test bench and for

607
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,750
future vehicles we actually reduced the

608
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:59,970
ethics of a zero by performing that word

609
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:02,010
segregation to isolate connected

610
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:05,670
components to control the automobile

611
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:08,400
itself right so if you're interested in

612
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:12,210
car security do come and join us we run

613
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:14,460
on a weekly meet up business and we

614
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:19,380
actually do a lot of hands-on on our

615
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:22,970
test bench itself right thank you so

616
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:22,970
much Grady are you going crazy

617
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:33,840
thank you much a warm round of applause

618
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:36,480
please for the group we've run out of

619
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,399
time so unfortunately we don't have too

620
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,050
much time for Q&A but I really wanted to

621
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,420
acknowledge at least the most up voted

622
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:43,919
questions simply because this is this

623
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:47,090
question has received the highest number

624
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:50,010
of votes ever all day today twelve votes

625
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:51,840
for this question from John how to

626
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:53,820
prevent this vulnerability so if you can

627
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,709
spend thirty seconds to answer that

628
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,490
really quickly because we have to go to

629
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:58,410
the next speaker

630
00:26:56,490 --> 00:27:01,290
which vulnerability are you talking

631
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:05,220
about a replay attack John here in the

632
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:07,080
audience because you get a prize - yeah

633
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:09,240
okay which one the ability are you

634
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:11,139
refresher of you donut right answer here

635
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:15,670
sorry

636
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:17,380
spoofing so there are a lot of four

637
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:19,030
letters Komodos right you can actually

638
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:20,260
do the replay attack on four letters

639
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:22,270
come orders because there's a lot of

640
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:24,010
encryption and different types of

641
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:25,930
protection being placed on the ECU

642
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:28,180
itself so you can actually do that on

643
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:31,960
the actual vehicle for this replay

644
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:33,670
attack so but the further purpose of

645
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,530
this presentation we actually use an oka

646
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:38,680
so that we can actually simulate and

647
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:41,230
know what we are doing with for to

648
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:43,000
understand because we come from a black

649
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:45,190
box approach we don't know what will

650
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,080
actually happen to the car so this if

651
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:48,880
you have helps us to better understand

652
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:50,560
it but we place attack replay that type

653
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,180
will not actually work on letters come

654
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:56,169
all those for some other because with

655
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:58,060
this type of prevention in the ECU also

656
00:27:56,170 --> 00:28:00,910
wasn't Nolan that newer vehicles may be

657
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:02,429
