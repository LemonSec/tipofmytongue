1
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,300
so the last time I'm I'm mistaken the

2
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:52,300
time shown here so I I speed up a lot

3
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:55,000
and so I I left a lot of time for

4
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,010
questions and this time still a lot of

5
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,469
time for questions

6
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:01,809
definitely so also you can see on the

7
00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:05,199
PowerPoint there the first answer is 1

8
00:01:01,809 --> 00:01:08,729
a.m. but since he had some family issue

9
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:11,048
I'll present this PowerPoint for you

10
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:14,080
before for him

11
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:16,630
so today's today's topic is how to

12
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:23,170
detect facial manipulation image using C

13
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:26,530
and so facial manipulation in today's

14
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:33,330
world in my equals 2 tip fakes face web

15
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:38,259
face to face face app so much popular

16
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:41,259
like face face manipulation tools it's

17
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:45,119
very I mean this top is quite hot since

18
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:48,700
everyone think this is very interesting

19
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:54,489
technology then plan make very funny

20
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:57,190
stuff so in academia or or in this area

21
00:01:54,489 --> 00:02:01,259
with way just quiet facial manipulation

22
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:06,628
and actually break down to many other

23
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:10,840
many other subfield some of our facial

24
00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:14,349
some of our paste and copy and paste

25
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:18,910
detection some of our image resizing

26
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:24,099
detection but now here we as a text

27
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:28,209
orientated topic we split this as a two

28
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:33,129
major subtopic a wine is face swapping

29
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:36,819
it's a with these face we're being

30
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:39,429
contained just like contains technology

31
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:41,730
of scientific face web these kind of

32
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:45,190
technology and then we will talk about

33
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:49,299
more traditional technology face margin

34
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:56,280
so by first merging I many means the

35
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:59,760
technology that then is so it's called

36
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:03,230
oh maybe our turn to the other side and

37
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:06,980
I'll see the name sorry

38
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:10,170
so let's look at what the figs can do

39
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:17,660
recently so I'll show you some video we

40
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:17,660
download it from the YouTube so I think

41
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:24,290
so

42
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:31,140
from the actually you can search many

43
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:35,010
video or material on the Internet

44
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:38,190
there people use this technology to make

45
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:43,140
some funny video they make the use

46
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:46,670
Nicolas Cage information and make just

47
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:49,730
replace the actor in the video or movie

48
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:54,690
so you can see Nicholas Cage everywhere

49
00:03:49,730 --> 00:04:01,560
so and also some other famous actors and

50
00:03:54,690 --> 00:04:07,079
actresses and all of the video seems

51
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:10,739
quite natural if you do not observe them

52
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:15,150
very closely and work discreetly you

53
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:18,239
cannot actually see is a manipulation

54
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:19,858
artifacts so in this video there's an

55
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:24,000
artifact you can see some of the frame

56
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:27,599
haven't been changed this my because of

57
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,990
the mists detection for the turkey face

58
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:38,370
a little talked about why this will

59
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:43,080
happen and this is also you can see when

60
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:46,350
the talkee talkee talkee a person raised

61
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:50,340
his hand and blocks on the part of the

62
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:56,340
face the face detector cannot detect the

63
00:04:50,340 --> 00:05:01,260
Denmark and which was results the mist

64
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:09,390
replacement or the thief's on frame or

65
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:15,719
as a rigid has original okay here's some

66
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:18,630
there's also James and curry but this is

67
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:22,920
but this not this is not face weapon

68
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:25,800
technology is more like doing a average

69
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:29,550
operation by summing two subjects face

70
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:31,890
together and and gets a face that

71
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:35,970
possess both subjects face

72
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:40,080
characteristics you can see the outcome

73
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:44,670
on the right he looks like curry and

74
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:51,270
James and at the same time and this is

75
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:54,650
also an another example so this example

76
00:05:51,270 --> 00:06:00,120
shows there a fist marching sometimes

77
00:05:54,650 --> 00:06:03,719
occurred run into difficulty because if

78
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:06,960
the two subjects adds face there is too

79
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:10,830
much I cannot actually get the average

80
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:13,909
face very precisely so you can see it's

81
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:17,280
not their natural on the right picture

82
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:19,320
so so this way these examples will get

83
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,840
you a sense of so what's the

84
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:26,099
technologies of all about and why can

85
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:30,090
achieve and so these technology we think

86
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:32,220
that as today's multimedia were evolving

87
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:37,039
so fast there we trust the information

88
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:43,080
on the Internet so especially is a video

89
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:47,400
since the picture or the voice is our

90
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:49,890
less takes less credit for why it why

91
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:54,080
presents people rely more and more on

92
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:57,060
video but now video is more subject to

93
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,640
very powerful editing tools like deep

94
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:02,970
fake in phase margin these tools are

95
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:07,650
already part of the open API provided on

96
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:11,550
the internet so now we will see how

97
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:15,620
these technology are in front of the

98
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:20,970
current detection de systems will take

99
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:24,420
so we look at some on my open API

100
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:28,980
the facial recognition system from

101
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:32,640
Microsoft Azure we use their open API to

102
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:34,680
detect the so we give them we feed the

103
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:40,320
system where is real images from Nicolas

104
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:43,590
Cage and the defect generated face so

105
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:47,490
the system sink there it's kind of 86%

106
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:51,780
of that they have 86 confidence there

107
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:55,640
they are the same person which is to our

108
00:07:51,780 --> 00:08:01,289
human observer and it's the same people

109
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:04,560
so it fools the system we also look at

110
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:08,400
the Amazon it abased cloud service and

111
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,560
even higher confidence so the system

112
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:23,390
itself also made a very confident

113
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:27,540
mistake so how how deeply made it happen

114
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:32,189
we look at the code you read and we and

115
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:34,440
a lot of difficulty really move e we

116
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:39,500
summarize some characteristics and want

117
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:42,349
to show you the first is a defect

118
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:45,440
swear victims face in every frame

119
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:49,670
independently so it doesn't take

120
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:53,280
consideration it doesn't take the like

121
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:57,199
frame interdependencies the information

122
00:08:53,280 --> 00:09:00,050
on time series as part of the generation

123
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:06,930
generating process generation generating

124
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:11,189
material so it's more a more focused on

125
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:15,390
the natural how natural it looks in the

126
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:19,650
specialist but in in 3d space or aura

127
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:22,560
can see in 2d space and the second

128
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:25,319
characteristic it there it's not unto

129
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,859
end so by this we mean that the

130
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:33,120
generation the fake face generation

131
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:34,560
process consists of several sub sub

132
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:39,930
stages

133
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:43,290
the first stage is to use human or face

134
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:46,050
face stem our detector or something to

135
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:50,670
detect the target face from the source

136
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:56,609
video and to get a set of subject of

137
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:59,790
image data sets and and of course it's

138
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:03,060
we can have both the real faces and the

139
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:06,060
fake faces and since in the second stage

140
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:10,768
there since we have the Institute a set

141
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:14,099
of face data sets we can use deep

142
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:16,620
learning technology to learn the mapping

143
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:21,149
relationship between the real face and

144
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:25,129
fake face and - yeah by the in other

145
00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:31,019
word just train the neural network to

146
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:35,310
convert a face to be faced with some

147
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:38,819
correct with some expression or with

148
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:41,008
some with some carrot East

149
00:10:38,819 --> 00:10:46,589
characteristic of the face unchanged

150
00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:50,069
we changed subjects appearances and in

151
00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:53,579
in the third stage after we trained the

152
00:10:50,069 --> 00:10:56,370
different model we feed the system our

153
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:59,459
feet dip fake ways unseen data unseen

154
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:03,449
images from subject we want to replace

155
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:07,800
and then we can generate the face we

156
00:11:03,449 --> 00:11:11,069
want from people from P person and and

157
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:13,469
replace the and use the technology to

158
00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:17,430
paste the face back to the source video

159
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:24,870
and complete the fake video generation

160
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:28,339
process so the start and I want to talk

161
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:34,410
about the third characteristic is there

162
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:36,689
now this video of this technology now

163
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:40,410
only money manipulates the central face

164
00:11:36,689 --> 00:11:45,889
area so so it's because its objective is

165
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:47,969
to detect or to fake mostly the facial

166
00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:50,880
expression or

167
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:54,110
face appearances it doesn't care much

168
00:11:50,880 --> 00:12:00,210
about video background it doesn't change

169
00:11:54,110 --> 00:12:02,790
the other places this might give us an

170
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:05,220
additional actually detecting maybe

171
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:08,849
maybe it's a kind of vulnerability of

172
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:12,690
this technology and the third

173
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:15,690
characteristic is we find this

174
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:19,200
technology the digital remodel here they

175
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:20,940
use is the auto is an autoencoder also

176
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,660
week from recently there are more

177
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:27,630
advanced deep learning architecture some

178
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:30,870
things they used can again with self

179
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:33,270
attention and some some of them use the

180
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:38,850
information from time series they add

181
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:42,569
areas TM or some 3d convolution the

182
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:44,910
imaginative better performance but we

183
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:49,410
think they still have the vulnerability

184
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:53,819
of the deep fake only up is not only an

185
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:55,500
autoencoder a little we will elaborate

186
00:12:53,820 --> 00:13:01,710
more wise they possess the same

187
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:04,320
vulnerability also this is a brief

188
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:11,460
introduction for how they generate such

189
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:14,900
face if we want to since we have a lot

190
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:22,200
of time I'll get the get deeper

191
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:24,630
so I mentioned how to train deeply model

192
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:28,220
they learns the mapping relationship

193
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:33,000
between the source phase to the target

194
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:37,650
to the target phase the auto into coder

195
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:40,410
here is actually a two-stage process so

196
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:45,060
as you can see the PowerPoint let's say

197
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:48,689
the they say we have two two subjects

198
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:52,469
here person a and person B by using by

199
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:56,190
using the phase detector together the

200
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:59,360
face a face information out and cut them

201
00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:01,990
up into pieces so we can get to a

202
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:09,150
dataset that containing two label

203
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:14,280
and use an encoder my encoder I mean to

204
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:17,560
say to compress the image information

205
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:21,339
from higher dimension to smaller

206
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:28,000
dimension with with less information

207
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:30,640
loss so the auto encoder based diffic

208
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,880
have the character characteristic like

209
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:37,750
they actually use some part of the same

210
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:42,010
weights in encoder err encoder stage

211
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:45,520
because they want to encode person a and

212
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:48,910
person B face at least in the same

213
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:52,810
manner or in a similar a similar manner

214
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:56,650
that has some similarity and this is the

215
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:59,290
basis that late for later the decoder to

216
00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:05,380
take to comprehend is a compress the

217
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:13,240
information back to the higher dimension

218
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:16,300
data and so with this encoder in the

219
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:19,960
first stage to compress person a and

220
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:23,469
person B is picture into a into a

221
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:28,210
compressed representation the training

222
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:31,140
process then trains decoder a and

223
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:34,740
decoder B to map the compressed

224
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:39,430
information to the original a and

225
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:41,950
original B so by gradually feeding the

226
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:45,489
information mapping relationship are

227
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:48,520
using back propagate back propagation we

228
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:51,100
can learn such a set of weights that can

229
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:55,300
map from the compressed representation

230
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:59,350
to person a and person B using to

231
00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:04,750
decoder so now we have like why why

232
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:07,990
encoder to decoder and this will will

233
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:11,340
let us achieve the face generation phase

234
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:11,340
generating to process

235
00:16:18,449 --> 00:16:29,559
so I use the autoencoder we can convert

236
00:16:25,479 --> 00:16:35,349
personal a personal aids face to a

237
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:39,399
person bees face as for how to wait how

238
00:16:35,349 --> 00:16:44,559
do we paste the generated face back to

239
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:46,389
the target video so so it's also here

240
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:49,259
the technology actually use kind of a

241
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:53,919
more traditional technique it's called

242
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:57,459
potion image editing so potion image

243
00:16:53,919 --> 00:17:00,939
editing is it was proposed like several

244
00:16:57,459 --> 00:17:03,039
many years ago it just a cat it

245
00:17:00,939 --> 00:17:08,289
calculates the whole image creating

246
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:11,919
information it had it formulates the

247
00:17:08,289 --> 00:17:15,398
gradient characteristic and to give the

248
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:19,209
car to to sum up a set of constraints

249
00:17:15,398 --> 00:17:22,688
and this constraint will dictates the

250
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:25,959
fade the image merging process to keep

251
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:30,039
the merging area or we say the boundary

252
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:34,090
between the unedited unedited area and

253
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:36,970
the edited area there the boundary can

254
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:42,149
be very smooth with the color

255
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:48,340
information texturing information we

256
00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:51,428
remain or we can say untouched so if you

257
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:56,619
are interested in how they implement

258
00:17:51,429 --> 00:17:58,720
such merging or we say potion image

259
00:17:56,619 --> 00:18:12,369
editing you can search on I it's kind of

260
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:16,059
public so so we talked about how to

261
00:18:12,369 --> 00:18:20,168
generate deep fake images in detail and

262
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:22,899
now let's look at how phase margin is so

263
00:18:20,169 --> 00:18:25,059
since face merging I said it's a more

264
00:18:22,899 --> 00:18:27,030
traditional it's a kind of more

265
00:18:25,059 --> 00:18:31,350
traditional

266
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:31,770
image processing technique so no no deep

267
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:36,719
learning

268
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:38,940
no no artificial intelligence here but

269
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:42,470
this listing thing actually plays very

270
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:45,330
well we later we find that the theta

271
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:48,570
theta effect by this technology is

272
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:52,860
actually harder to detect we don't know

273
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:58,530
why for now but this technology that it

274
00:18:52,860 --> 00:19:02,669
used use human or face detector to first

275
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:08,430
dig deep get to subjects face out and

276
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:13,410
they use 10 or a triangulation it's a

277
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:16,290
technique that can cut on the base on

278
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:19,410
the basis of detecting face detect face

279
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:22,980
them are men are in information with

280
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:29,010
this coordinator he cuts the face into

281
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:35,780
several sub triangles yes triangle this

282
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:40,460
triangle will then be feeding to sum or

283
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:48,240
average in operation to calculate the

284
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:50,130
how they how they contained content how

285
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:54,750
to paste all these triangular all

286
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:57,830
together so the new position they have

287
00:19:54,750 --> 00:20:02,100
is actually the average position from

288
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:06,210
subject a and some subject P and finally

289
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:10,139
it will have the final image that

290
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:13,380
process the characteristic from all of

291
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:20,850
the participants which is the baby's

292
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:24,690
face and the the other face but actually

293
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:30,439
can you can use more as many human face

294
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:30,440
you can and now here we only least two

295
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:43,539
so let's get to how to detect it since

296
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:46,600
actually there's other research work and

297
00:20:43,539 --> 00:20:49,720
these are also presentation like have

298
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:53,850
shown cybersecurity conferences they

299
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:56,650
also the computer vision based k'temeré

300
00:20:53,850 --> 00:21:01,120
conferences have proposed some of the

301
00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:07,990
solution here represents a simple and

302
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:12,489
effective cm method we think that with

303
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:16,240
fish with image manipulate by the people

304
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:18,730
we think that this technology affected

305
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,250
the lower level features and also the

306
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:23,309
higher feature higher level features we

307
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:27,549
think the ceiling is a very powerful

308
00:21:23,309 --> 00:21:30,908
feature extractor and classifier so we

309
00:21:27,549 --> 00:21:42,460
want to try how how this technology work

310
00:21:30,909 --> 00:21:45,760
in this problem so so so for the tip

311
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:49,360
fake teeth fake data since its

312
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:53,650
manipulates the center of face area with

313
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:59,860
other area unchanged way we use face

314
00:21:53,650 --> 00:22:08,130
detector to detect and actually using a

315
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:14,039
peek or background or people 240z is

316
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:17,830
sensing her to repeat we will see

317
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:22,330
testify to see boundary between the face

318
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:31,350
variant part about here okay

319
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:35,379
say so the term conspiracy here is a

320
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:37,299
very simple thing we only use three tool

321
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:42,130
illusion on the air and I've shaved very

322
00:22:37,299 --> 00:22:48,360
fine detention accuracy it's like it's

323
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:48,360
like pasta train for half hour

324
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:55,470
okay um this is it so if every was a

325
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:58,169
very easy task

326
00:22:55,470 --> 00:23:01,260
perfect we also say if this is not the

327
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:07,410
only solution we also do some

328
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:15,230
architecture of tuning this one is at

329
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:15,230
least a false test out elusive with 38

330
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:29,190
Pacific century the 1900 face virgin so

331
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:33,300
like 16 solution solution on layer 3 by

332
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:37,380
3 and Sony - about ocean air and so

333
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:41,460
history has resolution then we swap out

334
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:51,060
to fulfill a teenager mention to real

335
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:56,850
text position for students it will use

336
00:23:51,060 --> 00:24:00,149
here for to nest we so there is a there

337
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:04,020
is actually publicly available data sets

338
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:08,700
from victims and attitude 10 download

339
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:16,020
this data from all sources so in this

340
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:19,610
experiment we have 1514 140,000 fake

341
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:23,310
faces in Rufus's frequencies and Rufus's

342
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:28,469
with this topology and high quality

343
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:32,129
images this is 20 different from

344
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:35,070
prophecy typically a day we want to

345
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:39,480
that's the desire to be more positive

346
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:44,149
and for the business age we used for

347
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:48,300
face which is f double PhD face and

348
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:53,480
ultimate database the internet for taste

349
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:56,178
face recognition Theory Alice yes almost

350
00:24:53,480 --> 00:25:02,740
it's kind of what you want proportion

351
00:24:56,179 --> 00:25:06,049
who don't have to do uninsured angry use

352
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:06,880
part of this portion here to get the

353
00:25:06,049 --> 00:25:11,690
fake faces

354
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:17,419
this is here also variability and

355
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:19,850
service on resonance atom they use they

356
00:25:17,419 --> 00:25:23,350
use the same preferred process strainer

357
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:27,860
process technique we use launched ataxia

358
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:32,269
to detect human faces happen out as a

359
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:37,070
final journalism and with larger body

360
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:42,610
boss and family will use the foreign

361
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:47,629
currency to be sharing this condition a

362
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:50,658
typical commercial use before entering

363
00:25:47,630 --> 00:26:01,760
the machine to the model to enhance the

364
00:25:50,659 --> 00:26:04,970
presentations is a real world so I just

365
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:10,129
opted about how the safest solution

366
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:19,010
actually performed well how it is and to

367
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:24,760
test positive 8 and this one so so the

368
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:28,760
lives it's all about say public where

369
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:32,389
public available service first system

370
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:37,940
they may have a digital tech such

371
00:26:32,389 --> 00:26:42,580
differences so always thought about we

372
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:45,470
solve are facing so this is actually

373
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:49,129
what we use the entire fishery is

374
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:53,510
assistant the also the advanced

375
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:57,909
architecture Provost special special

376
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:57,908
villainous called trippin balls

377
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:09,460
so the loss here is tripped over the

378
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:14,540
walls here is actually a loss function

379
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:18,200
whose objective is to minimize distance

380
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:22,490
between samples within a label but

381
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:25,400
maximizing the distance between between

382
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:28,070
different labels between samples from

383
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:30,970
different labels so that the institution

384
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:35,000
is even and actually valid parts

385
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:39,050
students to take its difference to make

386
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:44,180
the output very more separable in a

387
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:48,230
shorter definition so it's a very

388
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:58,060
powerful it has very high classification

389
00:27:48,230 --> 00:28:02,420
accuracy but we have shown on the

390
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:05,179
previous slides what was Operation did

391
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:07,580
here if you have dimension system see

392
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:16,640
the big fist refills they have high

393
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:20,620
similarity babies on that ulcer on their

394
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,620
service they also dismiss them up easily

395
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:32,480
so each meeting we only with an open

396
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:35,510
source implementation before on the air

397
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:39,080
usage only use the phase two trophies

398
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:41,930
error with the margin pepper face area

399
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:46,429
and we'll split them as an intercept to

400
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:50,780
to tense the invariants for two levels

401
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:54,110
the same phase and realness with it we

402
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:56,629
use this invariant feature finished as

403
00:28:54,110 --> 00:29:00,050
variable transportation model train

404
00:28:56,630 --> 00:29:03,760
train to follow to learn the stadium

405
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:03,760
real businesses

406
00:29:06,809 --> 00:29:16,840
and the accuracies of actually path

407
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:21,429
Susie so we know ever we might that

408
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:25,779
actually traditional funeral edition of

409
00:29:21,429 --> 00:29:28,029
words although to tax them can be food

410
00:29:25,779 --> 00:29:32,769
but never keep any I'm sure it carries

411
00:29:28,029 --> 00:29:35,710
the difference information from the ring

412
00:29:32,769 --> 00:29:40,029
design defect theta so it has that

413
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:44,350
actually occurs in 1456 over every day

414
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:55,379
for phase Virginians this protein kills

415
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:59,549
this but effective so how show you

416
00:29:55,379 --> 00:30:14,709
detention demonstration for to network

417
00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:19,269
so we take so this short video is from

418
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:22,629
the Thetas entity way between art as

419
00:30:19,269 --> 00:30:25,870
efficient mode on both tradition jersey

420
00:30:22,629 --> 00:30:31,980
real-time inspired but it can detect

421
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:43,479
defect and also try the business is

422
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:47,289
necessary so yep that's the at least a

423
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:54,700
twisted pacifier Serato will teacher

424
00:30:47,289 --> 00:30:56,440
turns web did overall is also working so

425
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:59,980
so it ideal

426
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:05,679
Sony ideal situation it's working so we

427
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:10,390
also wanna see easily in the first many

428
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:18,230
of the video processed visual

429
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:24,200
the ticket is the resizing operation as

430
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:33,880
a commercial operation but only in all

431
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:33,880
detail but there is a small small purse

432
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:45,250
infestation so the 18 inch is the entry

433
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:45,250
represents how two dancers perform under

434
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:58,639
JVG compression so jibiji is actually a

435
00:31:50,660 --> 00:32:02,630
standard picture on Sydney so so in the

436
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:07,310
end we actually can choose the level one

437
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:11,650
to France from the original vision and

438
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:18,530
I'll write as a figure entry shows how

439
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:22,820
to network under the peopIe direct

440
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:28,010
illumination which is default resizing

441
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:28,370
operation so we do picture size or

442
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:31,370
something

443
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:34,429
the OpenCV right big blue dots

444
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:39,639
besides if you don't paint ethical

445
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:39,640
issues use battery interpolation

446
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:58,340
if F calculated see image pixel value is

447
00:32:51,220 --> 00:33:01,190
with the Hutchinson cells so energy we

448
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:04,310
clear on left again see they treat the

449
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:07,790
face dentist master are less sensitive

450
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:12,950
to jpg compression versus the sympathy

451
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:13,760
and even from standard that's at less

452
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:18,300
pressure

453
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:20,670
but as conventional steeper as a more

454
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:28,399
efficient lost in the educational

455
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:36,720
mission mostly our polymerization system

456
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:38,790
performance from various so we see these

457
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,060
two measurement Hampshire different and

458
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:44,970
different vision

459
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:48,600
we also searched the exact process

460
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:51,780
apology each intervention work so the

461
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:59,219
visual information of Evans optimization

462
00:33:51,780 --> 00:34:04,080
said so in GGG GGG GGG mention the image

463
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:10,320
is stated into many small blocks which

464
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:17,630
is eight by eight pieces on and this is

465
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:25,160
a block can be represented and a lot of

466
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:28,860
it relates swallow images by using

467
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:35,089
realistic restaurant did this district

468
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:39,000
for just so the lower the volume press

469
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:42,150
originally time the fire the more

470
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:50,580
harmful disease formation is lost there

471
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:54,389
is a but it was research in this area on

472
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:57,930
the right side is the actual precise

473
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:59,089
without this together before and this we

474
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:09,930
have to this matter

475
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:12,630
almost so to start with so for some

476
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:17,940
reasons to effective methods for

477
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:20,880
detecting defect to save the farm of

478
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:23,140
using the Athenian capture a lot of the

479
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,570
features is next

480
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:27,810
[Music]

481
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:32,310
and control edges as a system to see

482
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:34,830
their titties global robust under fire

483
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:38,360
for this information was simply maybe

484
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:43,170
not captured more hair high levels issue

485
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:47,820
we explain its exist but at least we we

486
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:51,540
have proved a decision can work a work

487
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:55,170
of does this problem also human he not

488
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:57,990
identified fake faces in services but

489
00:35:55,170 --> 00:36:01,860
seeing that although it's pronounced

490
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:07,939
that time to explainable I think we can

491
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:07,940
work on this tool to maybe for instance

492
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:14,220
Cecilia would also experiment with some

493
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:17,430
the drain water like metal day for this

494
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:21,480
research paper also doing the same thing

495
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:23,520
as we do using different data in the air

496
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:26,420
differently also you have the truth

497
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:30,740
peaceful methods deception for

498
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:33,960
institutional we also experimented HGC

499
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:42,180
inception this is our very offensive

500
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:44,850
policy transfer learning results also to

501
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:48,960
the very high levels then so that's why

502
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:52,170
was it will be in systems as years the

503
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:57,030
total refined too much architecture to

504
00:36:52,170 --> 00:37:02,460
need see which is basically it's also

505
00:36:57,030 --> 00:37:05,430
very cool too and all of this is only

506
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:08,430
use single frame information we'd ever

507
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:12,830
use Potiphar who doesn't consider the

508
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:12,830
tank as the inflation tax list

509
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:20,859
[Music]

510
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:20,859
[Applause]

511
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:26,280
so I think now we have a little bit of

512
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:36,240
time for too many before we go to settle

513
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:38,490
any questions on the floor yes so with

514
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:41,810
the advent of the deep vein technology

515
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:50,790
what would be given this with regards to

516
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:57,440
mobile or remote kyc processes so what

517
00:37:50,790 --> 00:38:01,800
is terrorism from custom auto Timothy so

518
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:07,050
obviously really how this adequate

519
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:09,980
technology can be applied to the product

520
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:15,180
[Music]

521
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:19,440
after basically non-banks opinion

522
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:25,129
systems they require people can submit

523
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:28,320
their personal information and that

524
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:34,620
identifies them that they are who they

525
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:37,560
claim so it's a identifications decade

526
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:40,319
it moves them down that is your identity

527
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:44,130
that's the KYC process the banks and

528
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:47,160
payment systems require so using how do

529
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:52,020
you feel that if it has potential cheats

530
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:56,970
subsystem so listening st trade can

531
00:38:52,020 --> 00:39:03,450
choose our system with effective people

532
00:38:56,970 --> 00:39:08,609
doesn't know about T sub C does it have

533
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:12,779
a child it's an actual tank which is a

534
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:14,570
very help describe to the system and the

535
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:18,210
system now

536
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:22,650
the SS though we used to have a fatass

537
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:28,510
for any security to show circumstance

538
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:32,650
and addition the the x-ray from deafness

539
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:36,100
too much about hog body people use these

540
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:43,240
technologies because the debate is

541
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:47,319
actually you here two years ago so so

542
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:52,930
this kinda business we also evolved in

543
00:39:47,320 --> 00:40:04,540
the house request in emissions of the

544
00:39:52,930 --> 00:40:08,649
dragon yes we are breathable you are the

545
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:15,279
video is degraded so the video is heavy

546
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:19,690
25 several things so particular video

547
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:29,530
now is transmitted Muslim by standards

548
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:32,140
like h.264 as if processes mainly they

549
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:34,390
use body frame that they consider the

550
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:40,089
time that the insufficient time I just a

551
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:44,730
actually has made a video stream smaller

552
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:48,990
channels we in this present reduce the

553
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:52,840
gbg compression tube to resemble the

554
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:56,140
solution of our image to play so we find

555
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:59,370
that so we find at least to measure

556
00:40:56,140 --> 00:41:06,490
perform different different theaters

557
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:10,029
digital image decoding s4 but so there

558
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:14,319
is one horse in here so if the video is

559
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:22,090
so degraded or so there is there then we

560
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:25,030
will announcer so why should be 1500 so

561
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:28,060
here we find that if the teaching

562
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:32,380
profession level drops sufficient levels

563
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:34,390
to help me become president is one we

564
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:36,960
find the image itself is actually very

565
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:42,980
far and interesting

566
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:48,530
Hector cannot detect it we see mrs. I

567
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:48,530
don't know if then less my perspective

568
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:58,730
here the questions from the throne it's

569
00:41:55,170 --> 00:42:03,630
not will go to the description on Idol

570
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:05,550
to the topless series tool available to

571
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:07,619
the general public to detect or deter

572
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:21,599
places we will fake exactly this

573
00:42:07,619 --> 00:42:25,829
technology for mutation so this is also

574
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:29,010
a typical case where people leave final

575
00:42:25,829 --> 00:42:32,309
choice to any and system because humans

576
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:33,869
healthy human are observed in handsome

577
00:42:32,309 --> 00:42:37,640
and that's the end

578
00:42:33,869 --> 00:42:41,849
- detective ourselves so we actually

579
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:44,790
open the search actually opens was the

580
00:42:41,849 --> 00:42:48,270
services and if you had so people take

581
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:54,660
point I didn't leave the lady's

582
00:42:48,270 --> 00:43:01,460
apartment but I am provide to provide it

583
00:42:54,660 --> 00:43:05,670
to chemicals to again return the results

584
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:14,520
the API will tell you whether human

585
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:20,849
faces scored see how babies with a

586
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:26,190
search engine feels so there is to it

587
00:43:20,849 --> 00:43:28,349
can be used for vision we also think

588
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:33,960
that also that we have detected

589
00:43:28,349 --> 00:43:37,869
classified but the next the next to mean

590
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:43,479
to explain I think there that's the most

591
00:43:37,869 --> 00:43:47,799
like Peter forensics there cannot jump

592
00:43:43,479 --> 00:43:52,089
into conclusion so promptly maybe we

593
00:43:47,799 --> 00:43:57,430
need more reasonable process I say this

594
00:43:52,089 --> 00:43:58,839
is a good question to target I think we

595
00:43:57,430 --> 00:44:04,269
still have a long way to talk to

596
00:43:58,839 --> 00:44:06,719
determine even without XE it is exactly

597
00:44:04,269 --> 00:44:14,859
the effective tool

598
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:27,759
who is the entity group right ok the

599
00:44:14,859 --> 00:44:34,469
next question similar profiles pahala I

600
00:44:27,759 --> 00:44:40,299
think means the star from star is equal

601
00:44:34,469 --> 00:44:47,969
divisions result time he used two

602
00:44:40,299 --> 00:44:53,319
different jobs 28 electrical nationals

603
00:44:47,969 --> 00:44:57,329
also there is a first time for the image

604
00:44:53,319 --> 00:45:09,329
here is parts for soon as religiously

605
00:44:57,329 --> 00:45:09,329
watch image here in it

606
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:24,819
experiments probably into the head start

607
00:45:17,849 --> 00:45:31,900
to get to this the best of all the best

608
00:45:24,819 --> 00:45:35,939
car the technical equipment so so yeah

609
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:39,489
we used to worry about the time testers

610
00:45:35,939 --> 00:45:42,940
the full bottle to take a guess when I

611
00:45:39,489 --> 00:45:48,700
actually prepared for

612
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:50,280
certain parts or fishnet see his

613
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:55,859
fearlessness

614
00:45:50,280 --> 00:46:01,990
sister-sister complicated architecture

615
00:45:55,859 --> 00:46:06,130
so but even told Latimer it only takes

616
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:09,779
about five seconds for one prediction

617
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:14,740
and if you want to speed up there again

618
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:19,599
you can stack up the goods - just use -

619
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:24,700
we first GP over gradually so the time

620
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:29,109
is very quick we do almost real-time in

621
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:32,649
image real-time video system and

622
00:46:29,109 --> 00:46:38,190
everything giggles phone just like the

623
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:44,650
video I showed there with red red trend

624
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:52,750
with a red handle so it's seen as the

625
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:56,470
best reading program for now it's the

626
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:59,349
best so I am asking we also look at

627
00:46:56,470 --> 00:47:01,049
other the University and we are

628
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:06,579
traditional one step

629
00:47:01,049 --> 00:47:08,490
lieutenant the image image the

630
00:47:06,579 --> 00:47:13,390
information in the parcel information

631
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:16,740
the image times them and also other I

632
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:23,170
think there's the baby tears no test

633
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:29,140
operation of energy by heavy my message

634
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:34,089
this is what the narrowest what what we

635
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:37,299
desire because a baby the short on sale

636
00:47:34,089 --> 00:47:40,450
they cannot find just to sleep your

637
00:47:37,299 --> 00:47:43,869
score but as a desert that literally is

638
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:46,250
a bunch of extra skeletal road they will

639
00:47:43,869 --> 00:47:51,080
determine is real thing

640
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:58,250
of course the literal monster to give

641
00:47:51,080 --> 00:48:05,330
you more information so you can price as

642
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:07,670
well leader what's up Oh th how can we

643
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:22,670
differentiate it's a real image to

644
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:31,640
training all students only as a human we

645
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:35,780
don't you mean she's a baby I have very

646
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:39,160
experienced training so I don't use I

647
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:42,820
[Music]

648
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:47,390
personally I think I solved a daycare

649
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:53,230
rages as a pure observer again was

650
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:58,790
dismissed but true human eyes is also

651
00:48:53,230 --> 00:49:02,690
series inspired by children I can negate

652
00:48:58,790 --> 00:49:18,710
some food so I will be the decimal

653
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:24,590
depression change 26 questions e-k-u

654
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:31,900
start killing a green swimming for 331st

655
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:44,750
was fixed

656
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:50,270
so acid pants all right we shall be

657
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:53,630
educated or two that won't follow okay

658
00:49:50,270 --> 00:50:00,140
there might be a sweat they might have

659
00:49:53,630 --> 00:50:14,070
somebody babies if they have such

660
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:18,450
critical wounds as firming is really the

661
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:26,390
priority and image you see there 50

662
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:34,589
images are hello after all beauty is as

663
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:40,620
easy to fix this is the eyes next one

664
00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:47,360

government has hands were very

689
00:52:46,170 --> 00:52:55,050
interesting for a long time so I think

690
00:52:52,619 --> 00:52:57,900
government use this technology to find

691
00:52:55,050 --> 00:53:08,600

information back to their other database

699
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:37,830
to compare so as it's more accessible as

700
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:40,170
everyone show their face back then I
