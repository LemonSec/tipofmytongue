1
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:22,099
so first of all this isn't my usual

2
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:23,930
style of presentation normally I'm

3
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:27,230
disclosing some kind of technical

4
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:29,630
vulnerability and diving deep into the

5
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:31,430
details so this isn't a technical

6
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:35,059
presentation it's more about my

7
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:37,250
experiences in 30 years hacking and how

8
00:00:35,059 --> 00:00:39,320
I've seen things evolve and you know

9
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:42,700
some questions I've got about where

10
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,989
we're going and and where we're being I

11
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,820
also try to lighten up a little bit

12
00:00:44,989 --> 00:01:06,979
apologize if it seems like it's too

13
00:00:46,820 --> 00:01:07,430
light bear with me while we're doing

14
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:11,409
this

15
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:13,460
hands up how many of you are hackers and

16
00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:19,719
how many of you are InfoSec

17
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:21,979
professionals okay interesting crossover

18
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:26,210
how many have you been hacking for more

19
00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:31,840
than 20 years all right so you guys have

20
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:40,610
seen some things like we all have heard

21
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:42,649
so Who am I well back in the 80s and 90s

22
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:46,609
they called me cyber junkie then it

23
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:48,109
became C junkie these days is CJ it just

24
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:52,850
shows that increasingly hackers have

25
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:54,949
become lazy I'm a hacker I'm the VP of

26
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:58,210
cybersecurity strategy octa as Katie

27
00:01:54,950 --> 00:02:01,399
mentioned I'm also a security researcher

28
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:05,240
things like Tesla Model S touch ID

29
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:07,880
Google glass I design hacks for the TV

30
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:11,560
show mr. robot had the head of security

31
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:17,630
at Def Con and I have way too many hats

32
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:20,540
but mostly I just like to break shit so

33
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:25,940
the question I want to ask is how did we

34
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:30,840
get from this to this

35
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:33,470
because this is where we are today well

36
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,550
is it because everything is connected

37
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:38,129
that's probably part the answer

38
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:42,480
everything is connected everything from

39
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:44,130
cars to buildings to toasters is it

40
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,319
because global and social media have

41
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:48,359
given a unprecedented reach for

42
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,208
information you can literally reach out

43
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,860
and touch anyone anywhere in the world

44
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:56,069
doing that before was incredibly

45
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,390
difficult and if you kind of go into the

46
00:02:56,069 --> 00:02:59,579
history of information a little bit

47
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:02,010
later on but you look at the historic

48
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:04,950
methods none of them had the scope that

49
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:06,390
we have available to us today maybe it's

50
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:09,390
because we've been too successful in

51
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:11,700
finding bugs and making tools certainly

52
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:14,220
most of the government archives of tools

53
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:17,190
have been based on the research that

54
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,630
many of us did in the 80s and 90s and in

55
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:22,410
fact even some of the tools that some

56
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:24,989
Wes wrote in the 80s and 90s but maybe

57
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:27,480
we've been here all along and all that's

58
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:32,100
really changed is the volume variety and

59
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:33,810
velocity so cyber information warfare

60
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,239
has changed the battlefield

61
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:37,980
fundamentally nations now have an

62
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,650
unprecedented reach for minimal

63
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:43,440
investment small countries can literally

64
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:46,739
reach out and cause mass disruption or

65
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:49,799
even vast economic damage to much

66
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:52,829
greater greater powers attacks can be

67
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:55,470
launched without any human life risk or

68
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:58,739
I mean as long as you're not within

69
00:03:55,470 --> 00:04:01,109
reach of a Hellfire missile I guess but

70
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:03,150
the reality is like you can have a guy

71
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:06,000
sitting in a building halfway around the

72
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:09,090
world causing disruption in the United

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,090
States and tracing and identifying that

74
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:14,040
person is incredibly difficult

75
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:16,320
ammunition is cheap and targets are

76
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,358
readily available the number of bugs and

77
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,700
systems is expanding exponentially

78
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:23,010
we still haven't come up with a good way

79
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:25,800
to deprecate old software and old

80
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:28,409
software equals targets we also don't

81
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,690
really understand how to classify those

82
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:34,680
vulnerabilities in this context very

83
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:38,090
well waging an asymmetric warfare has

84
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,090
never been easier

85
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,319
so we understand the cyber aspect of

86
00:04:42,599 --> 00:04:46,580
cyber warfare

87
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:49,889
we have attacks happening all the time

88
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:53,940
from the emerging attacks like things

89
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:56,900
like Stuxnet through to just a few days

90
00:04:53,940 --> 00:05:00,060
ago the u.s. attacking Iranian shipping

91
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:01,979
hey we know that we can reach out

92
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:05,340
exploit a vulnerability and cause

93
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:07,530
disruptions to a system so that's not a

94
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:09,810
massive problem and I think a lot of the

95
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:11,969
models we have in place are actually

96
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:14,610
starting to tackle that as we improve

97
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:17,250
bug bounties as we improve vulnerability

98
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:19,500
disclosure we are starting to make some

99
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:21,500
of these targets harder yes skills are

100
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,449
getting lifted up but at the same time

101
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,710
things are getting better but we don't

102
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:28,680
really understand very well is

103
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:33,030
information warfare and we're already in

104
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:35,069
the age of information warfare Hey many

105
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:38,130
people say that encryption was going to

106
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:40,710
end the Golden Age of second I disagree

107
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:42,630
I think we're now in the Platinum age of

108
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,830
second because if you look at the

109
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:47,610
collection methods that are available

110
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:49,580
now I don't need to go and tap into your

111
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:52,229
underwater cables I can still do that

112
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:54,419
but the same time all I need to do is

113
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:56,669
send you an app that puts cat ears on

114
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:57,960
you and you're gonna go and download all

115
00:05:56,669 --> 00:06:00,539
the information from all your friends

116
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:04,289
and upload it to me I have in my pocket

117
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:07,500
a phone which can take photos close to a

118
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:10,280
mile away automatically OCR the text and

119
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:13,319
then upload it to a foreign nation

120
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:18,330
well uncertain they're not doing this

121
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:19,860
for evil purposes the capability is kind

122
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:22,560
of terrifying and it changes the

123
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:25,830
physical security paradigm I tested this

124
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,319
out by going to certain locations in the

125
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:30,240
US and found that I could essentially

126
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,270
breach perimeters by photographing

127
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,759
inside sensitive spaces from viewing

128
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:39,210
areas because the zoom is so powerful

129
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:41,639
and this technology isn't bound to any

130
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:44,609
one nation this is technology and you

131
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:46,710
can't stuff it back in the bottle data

132
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:49,289
drives influence and influence is now a

133
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:49,739
weapon well-designed information warfare

134
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:52,050
can

135
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:54,300
pains are self-propagating and

136
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,729
highly-effective truly asymmetric

137
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,500
methods of tack many of you have seen

138
00:06:56,729 --> 00:07:01,380
the memes that were used to influence

139
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:04,620
elections across the world if you get it

140
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:07,259
right if you make a targeted piece of

141
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:10,680
information it will spread by itself and

142
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:12,840
it will change minds and that is a new

143
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:16,259
form of weaponization it's attacking on

144
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:18,989
the cognitive level but there's a key

145
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:20,160
point here and that is it's hard to get

146
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,940
right because you have to use

147
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,240
intelligence

148
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:26,340
they've been some spectacular failures

149
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:28,430
where people have tried this attempt

150
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:33,719
tried this information campaigns as

151
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:35,610
Fargo is in Vietnam where because of a

152
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:39,150
lack of understanding of the targets

153
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:41,580
they failed there was a very famous one

154
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:44,520
that the Grug likes to mention as a note

155
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:47,030
where the u.s. dropped leaflets of

156
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:49,620
pictures of Vietnamese girls in bikinis

157
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:51,840
with Vietnamese text under it asking

158
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:55,110
what is your girl doing now the idea

159
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,840
being to discourage the Vietcong and

160
00:07:55,110 --> 00:08:00,180
have them surrender lay down their arms

161
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,400
and go and check on their girls but the

162
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:05,070
effect was they looked at these pictures

163
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,560
and thought what are they doing to our

164
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:10,409
women we must fight harder to stop them

165
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,960
from doing this and in fact they doubled

166
00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:18,780
their efforts so getting it right is

167
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:21,500
hard we've come a long way in a really

168
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:24,568
short time information has evolved from

169
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:27,539
simple printing presses through to

170
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:31,319
modern telephony systems through to

171
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:34,409
things like television radio and now

172
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:37,560
social media information has become

173
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:42,289
personal it is in your hand it's

174
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:42,289
tailored for you and it's on 24/7

175
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:49,010
individuals now have more influence than

176
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:52,100
leaders of state the example shown here

177
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:55,620
if you look at Katy Perry's followers

178
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:58,640
she Dwarfs either Teresa may or Donald

179
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:01,350
Trump perhaps for a good reason

180
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,930
but when

181
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:06,360
you start to ask people how does this

182
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:08,310
influence affect their decisions but you

183
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,290
see the statistics there 70% of

184
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:11,729
Millennials said they're more excited

185
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:14,610
about doing things when their friends

186
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:15,870
agree with it and 68% of them said they

187
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,850
don't make major decisions decisions

188
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:20,520
without discussing it with people they

189
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:22,920
trust I have already seen targeted

190
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,840
campaigns in the u.s. going after

191
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,719
Millennials to discourage them from

192
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:29,940
voting in the 2020 election because they

193
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,160
understand how some of these groups have

194
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:37,860
fragmented and they're driving wedges

195
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:41,430
into the those fractures so what are the

196
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:44,370
strategies with information warfare you

197
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:47,430
can attempt to distort you can attempt

198
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:50,010
to dismiss real facts you can attempt to

199
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:52,439
distract from the reality you can

200
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:55,020
observe an attempt to leverage the

201
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:58,020
fractures and population an increase

202
00:09:55,020 --> 00:10:01,410
polarization or you can attempt to

203
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:04,400
dismay and terrify and I'll focus on the

204
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:09,709
last one with a kind of simple example

205
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:11,819
but first how do you influence well a

206
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:15,180
country you can influence through

207
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:17,550
diplomatic ties through international

208
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:20,430
links through the military or through

209
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:22,439
their economic connections business

210
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:25,109
isn't that different you influence

211
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:28,790
through business deals PR and

212
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:30,780
advertising mergers and acquisitions or

213
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:34,770
research and development in capital

214
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:38,339
instruments this is why as I mentioned

215
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:41,640
before you can leverage prejudice

216
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:44,550
misinformation and fear to turn a simple

217
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:46,680
information bug that would normally not

218
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:49,650
qualify for a bank bounty that would

219
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,479
normally be marked as won't fix to

220
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:55,230
display information that can cause

221
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:58,290
critical damage to a nation would you

222
00:10:55,230 --> 00:11:00,890
fly on an airplane or get in a car if

223
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:05,670
that came up on the entertainment unit

224
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:07,439
really any hands up anyone it's

225
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:09,120
incredibly easy to do we used to make

226
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,430
jokes in the nineties about popping up

227
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,810
messages on screens and suddenly now

228
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:14,810
it's a critical vulnerability

229
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:22,620
as a result of this hackers are now

230
00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:25,769
legitimate targets we regularly see

231
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:27,779
information the news about attackers

232
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:30,959
who've been labeled as enemy combatants

233
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:33,839
being taken out and in quite a few cases

234
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,550
they will deserve it right if you go and

235
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,649
involve yourself in somebody else's war

236
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:40,410
you shouldn't be surprised when they use

237
00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:44,130
the methods of war to remove you from

238
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:49,199
the battlefield but the same time it's

239
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:51,750
kind of a disturbing change possibly the

240
00:11:49,199 --> 00:11:56,010
reality is we've been here for a long

241
00:11:51,750 --> 00:12:00,000
time in the seat in the in there like

242
00:11:56,010 --> 00:12:01,139
mid to late 80s the CCC or specifically

243
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,790
a group called the DOB

244
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:09,649
from the CCC was stealing information

245
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:12,300
for the KGB on American nuclear

246
00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:13,949
inventions and development but also

247
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:16,079
stealing information from the KGB and

248
00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:20,550
the information was being sold back and

249
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:24,719
forth the net result was a member of the

250
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:27,620
killer of the CCC was found burnt to

251
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:31,949
death a short distance away from his car

252
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:34,560
without his shoes in a field with a

253
00:12:31,949 --> 00:12:39,569
perfect circle of burnt drafts around

254
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:42,018
him verdict suicide so apparently he got

255
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:45,029
out of his car threw his shoes away

256
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:48,750
walked into a field that spontaneously

257
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:51,420
combusted the reality is if you play

258
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:53,490
these games don't be surprised when they

259
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:56,670
use the tactics that they're used to

260
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:59,339
using to remove you from their field of

261
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:01,410
operation and it's been going on for a

262
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:03,779
long time as I said before the only

263
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:09,750
difference now is the volume velocity

264
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:12,959
and variety so how do we defend against

265
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:15,029
this well we now need to start thinking

266
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,160
about vulnerabilities from three angles

267
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:18,959
instead of just one instead of just

268
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,339
thinking about it's a software

269
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,189
vulnerability and what's the cyber

270
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:24,450
impact we need to think about what's the

271
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:27,480
cyber impact

272
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:30,060
what's the physical impact does this low

273
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,800
vulnerability have the effect to allow

274
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:36,529
me to do something in the real world and

275
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:39,750
what's the cognitive impact does this

276
00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:41,070
CBS score one vulnerability that lets me

277
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,889
pop up a message on an infotainment

278
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:46,980
system allow me to send a message that

279
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:48,510
could cause mass panic and fear and can

280
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:52,019
I do it to multiple places at the same

281
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:53,699
time because if that's the case then we

282
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:57,060
need to rethink how we're addressing it

283
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:59,279
and that comes to the whole idea of

284
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:02,310
classification of vulnerabilities we

285
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:05,000
need to rethink it right now the way we

286
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:07,768
classify vulnerabilities is based around

287
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,959
control of systems so something that

288
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:11,519
gets a really high score is something

289
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:14,670
that allows you to have remote control

290
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,690
of a system but the reality is there's

291
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:18,209
more to it than that

292
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:19,500
and because we're allocating our

293
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:23,550
resources to address vulnerabilities

294
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:25,260
based on this current model it means

295
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:28,469
some of the most serious vulnerabilities

296
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:31,069
in today's age are remaining unpatched

297
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:34,470
or are still getting marked as won't fix

298
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:37,680
when I went digging through the CVE

299
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:38,940
repository the number of informational

300
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,010
vulnerabilities that are out there that

301
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:43,769
are still open is genuinely terrifying

302
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:46,380
and I've had no shortage of fun

303
00:14:43,769 --> 00:14:48,630
abilities that I can play with to pop up

304
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:51,449
strange messages on random systems

305
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:54,660
random networks I encourage you to take

306
00:14:51,449 --> 00:14:57,060
a look yourself so how much has changed

307
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:59,819
in the last 10 years so much has changed

308
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:01,170
the last 10 years you know are at much

309
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:04,649
of our impact comes from this control

310
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:07,670
system idea the pitch is much bigger low

311
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:10,160
bugs can no longer be assumed to be low

312
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:12,180
informational bugs may actually be high

313
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,779
displaying the wrong message at the

314
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:18,180
right time could be critical so now we

315
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:22,500
need to apply context and intelligence

316
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:25,589
to how we classify bugs if you get a low

317
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,449
bug what does it mean does it give you

318
00:15:25,589 --> 00:15:30,750
an opportunity to do something else I

319
00:15:27,449 --> 00:15:33,630
have personal experience with this the

320
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:36,240
Tesla Model S almost all of the

321
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:37,930
vulnerabilities I found were either low

322
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,089
or medium

323
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:42,790
but by chaining together a bunch of low

324
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:47,350
vulnerabilities I was able to gain

325
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:50,319
remote control of the car Tesla

326
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:51,940
originally struggled to see what the

327
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,560
issue was because they were all low and

328
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:55,540
they were allocating their resources

329
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:58,449
based on things that were either medium

330
00:15:55,540 --> 00:16:00,599
or high and I had to eventually show

331
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:03,790
them the impact of chaining these bugs

332
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:07,770
that's an example from just a few years

333
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:07,770
ago there are plenty more out there

334
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:14,319
there are people working to change this

335
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:16,300
landscape and I like to call them agents

336
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,580
of change one of those my good friend

337
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:24,219
Katie another one is a good friend of

338
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:26,980
mine called Sarah Katie has been working

339
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:29,110
on renegotiating the Wassenaar agreement

340
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:31,270
for those of you that don't know the

341
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:34,000
Wassenaar agreement is a treaty between

342
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:36,189
countries that controls the distribution

343
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,140
of certain types of material it was

344
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:39,820
designed to stop control their

345
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:43,000
distribution of munitions or at least

346
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:45,130
limited and and software was added

347
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,100
because software was now seen as a

348
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:50,470
legitimate weapon it's thanks to the

349
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:53,290
work that Katie's done that you don't

350
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:54,970
have to fill out an export license or

351
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:57,849
application for vulnerability disclosure

352
00:16:54,970 --> 00:17:00,580
or incident response but there's a ton

353
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:04,000
more work to be done and I would call on

354
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:05,860
all of you in other countries to try and

355
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,920
involve yourself in this process and

356
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:11,438
provide support because if we don't get

357
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:14,050
a handle on this pretty soon we're gonna

358
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:16,630
find ourselves living in a world where

359
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:20,020
every time we walk across a border with

360
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:22,390
a laptop it gets inspected and we faced

361
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:24,849
with a print potential of arrest because

362
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:28,270
our tools of our profession and now

363
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:30,100
classified as weapons and the reality is

364
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:32,470
that's not going to help anyone because

365
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:34,919
bad guys don't listen to those two inks

366
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:37,630
and in fact most of them already have

367
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:39,670
tradecraft for how they distribute this

368
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:42,490
information without having to expose it

369
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:44,530
so all it will do is inhibit white hat

370
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:48,960
research and then inhibit the people who

371
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:51,950
are trying to defend Sarah

372
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,210
has been working on disinformation and

373
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:56,940
I'll show in a minute some of the work

374
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:59,580
that she's been doing they've formed a

375
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:01,619
working group that's looking at how this

376
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:04,019
information is distributed how

377
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:07,139
information campaigns are structured and

378
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:08,809
how we can counter them because it's

379
00:18:07,139 --> 00:18:12,539
actually a lot harder than you think

380
00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:14,639
stopping a cyber campaign is as simple

381
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:17,279
as either patching the vulnerability or

382
00:18:14,639 --> 00:18:19,709
filtering out the traffic but that

383
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:21,990
doesn't work with information because

384
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:24,330
once an information campaign is in full

385
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:27,899
swing if somebody let's say the

386
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:29,850
government steps in and pushes down hard

387
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:31,830
there's evidence that shows that

388
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:33,779
actually increases the velocity of the

389
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:36,539
campaign because people get more

390
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:39,330
entrenched and push back harder so there

391
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:41,429
are inflection points that we need to

392
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:44,399
learn about that allow us to redirect

393
00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:46,799
change or counter these campaigns and

394
00:18:44,399 --> 00:18:48,600
the work they've been doing is in

395
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,610
identifying that and you'll see in one

396
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:53,459
the next slides I'd also like to give a

397
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:55,439
shout out to Pablo Brewer from SOCOM and

398
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:58,139
the Donovan group who has been

399
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,059
sponsoring and providing a lot of

400
00:18:58,139 --> 00:19:02,100
insights to much this work and helping

401
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:06,418
us get this work up leveled into the

402
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:08,759
right places this is what they've

403
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:11,850
produced I wouldn't try to read it now

404
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:14,070
it's way too much information to just go

405
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:16,668
over in a slide but what it does is it

406
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:19,710
breaks down information campaigns into

407
00:19:16,669 --> 00:19:23,190
artifacts and these artifacts allow you

408
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:26,610
to understand at what stage a campaign

409
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:29,279
is at and what the right countermeasure

410
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:31,590
might be to counter that campaign at

411
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:33,450
that stage it also allows you to

412
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:35,490
understand the kind of campaign you're

413
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:38,249
facing and potentially give you some

414
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:40,230
insights the origin of it the framework

415
00:19:38,249 --> 00:19:42,090
is actually pretty similar to the attack

416
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:52,259
framework that InfoSec has been using

417
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:54,779
for a while so conclusion hacking is

418
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:57,029
actually always been part of warfare

419
00:19:54,779 --> 00:20:00,450
it's just had different names for

420
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:01,690
different periods of time we've always

421
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:04,539
been the

422
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:06,929
tool to do this because unlike the

423
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:09,730
people who get trained in universities

424
00:20:06,929 --> 00:20:13,509
we're passionate about it and we eat

425
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:16,240
sleep and drink security and we think

426
00:20:13,509 --> 00:20:19,419
outside the box in a way that's kind of

427
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:22,149
dangerous to some people hackers will

428
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:23,919
always be the best equipped offense but

429
00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:29,649
they'll also always be the best equipped

430
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:32,259
at their defense we as hackers also have

431
00:20:29,649 --> 00:20:35,018
to work on building the right landscape

432
00:20:32,259 --> 00:20:37,480
so that there's less risk and that we

433
00:20:35,019 --> 00:20:40,740
build trust and that means we have to be

434
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:44,080
really careful about irresponsible

435
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:48,789
research and dropping O'Day's on

436
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:51,908
companies or driving fear in industries

437
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:54,940
actually just serves to hurt us because

438
00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:56,830
without that trust we've seen as the

439
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:59,590
enemy and we don't want to be seen by it

440
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:01,509
as the enemy by everybody it also shuts

441
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:03,939
doors and stops us from being able to

442
00:21:01,509 --> 00:21:06,070
work with different industry groups on

443
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:07,210
different projects especially the more

444
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:09,428
sensitive industries

445
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:12,309
I'm personally have experienced

446
00:21:09,429 --> 00:21:14,799
firsthand irresponsible research being

447
00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:16,299
dropped in one area and projects that

448
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,490
I've been working on shutting down in

449
00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:20,830
another this is something we have to be

450
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:23,409
careful of and the last thing is that as

451
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:26,199
hackers we need to recognize that our

452
00:21:23,409 --> 00:21:29,440
actions have a greater impact than ever

453
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:32,740
before you can literally now get killed

454
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:37,600
for doing the wrong thing so choose

455
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:39,190
wisely now I seem to have rattled

456
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,039
through these slides a lot faster than

457
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:44,649
anyone was anticipating I hope people

458
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:46,720
appreciate the extra coffee Burton part

459
00:21:44,649 --> 00:21:51,279
of that was to give a chance for people

460
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:53,560
to ask more questions so questions

461
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:54,230
anyone

462
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,319
[Applause]

463
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,319
[Music]

464
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:07,290
so mark um going back up to the slides

465
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:09,300
on um sir Dean and publish um framework

466
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:12,389
um one of the things that they talked

467
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:15,360
about the last time they talked about

468
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:18,450
this was that it was really important to

469
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,100
recognize the misinformation early in

470
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:22,680
the campaign and that there were certain

471
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:24,990
key points things that you had to be

472
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:29,100
aware of or or be right on top of in

473
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:29,820
order to divert misinformation or block

474
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:33,120
it entirely

475
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:36,169
um can you speak to what you think those

476
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,610
points might be I I can't actually say

477
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:40,620
in detail what the points are because

478
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:44,000
there's not my area of expertise it's

479
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:48,060
why I blatantly ripped off their slide

480
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,890
but I have put links and so that once

481
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:52,590
the decks uploaded you can go to their

482
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:55,140
site and see this but it's absolutely

483
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:57,959
true because these information campaigns

484
00:22:55,140 --> 00:23:00,240
build momentum and there are points

485
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,400
where you can influence them and change

486
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,890
direction but if they get too much

487
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,570
momentum it gets increasingly harder to

488
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:09,210
stop them and you have to use

489
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:11,370
increasingly more drastic measures to

490
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:13,740
try and counter them the worst thing

491
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:15,810
ultimately is to try and stop a campaign

492
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:18,870
that's in full swing because at that

493
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:21,270
point almost anything you do can add

494
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:23,280
fuel to it especially if it's a divisive

495
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:25,290
type of campaign where they're trying to

496
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,330
say that the government is doing

497
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:29,250
something bad or a particular group is

498
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:31,379
doing something bad because then they

499
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:34,500
simply take any action as censorship and

500
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:37,920
proof that what it was saying was was

501
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:40,260
strong so what I will say is that the

502
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:42,870
things that you do to change it really

503
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:45,750
do depend on how the campaign started

504
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:47,760
and where it started but these campaigns

505
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:51,600
are becoming obvious the campaign

506
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:54,270
against Millennials for the the 2020

507
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:58,050
election were picked up by my teenage

508
00:23:54,270 --> 00:24:00,960
daughter she was browsing through a

509
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:03,060
tumblr and browsing through Instagram

510
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,000
and seeing these memes coming out and

511
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:07,659
she came to me and said dad this looks a

512
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,590
lot like some of the stuff I he

513
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:15,220
you rambling on about to Mum and she was

514
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:19,149
right I mean essentially what it was was

515
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:22,000
a meme that said you should not expect

516
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:24,130
your candidate to win your candidate

517
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,380
will not make it through the primary you

518
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:30,550
should show your displeasure by not

519
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:33,480
turning out to vote and you know we will

520
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:37,659
understand the impact that had in 2016

521
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:39,970
when Bernie Sanders voters refused to

522
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:43,090
turnout in despair because their

523
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:45,130
candidate selected it massively skewed

524
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:47,290
the potential results of the election

525
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:47,740
and so the same thing can easily happen

526
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:50,139
again

527
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:52,390
we haven't addressed the underlying

528
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:55,600
problems we haven't healed the

529
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:58,240
underlying fractures and these people

530
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,370
are smart they're observing and they're

531
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,770
tuning their campaigns based on the

532
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:05,770
fractures they see and driving wedges

533
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:08,770
into them so some of what we have to do

534
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:10,300
is about healing the overall system and

535
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:12,280
closing these fractures but some of it's

536
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:14,470
recognizing when these things start

537
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:16,990
spreading that they really need to be

538
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:19,060
nipped in the bud early things that fill

539
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:22,060
me with dismay is when I hear social

540
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:24,909
media sites saying yeah we recognize

541
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:26,980
that this is misinformation but we think

542
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:28,810
there's value in not censoring it so

543
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:31,120
we're going to let it continue that's

544
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:34,110
the worst thing popping a message

545
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:37,540
underneath something that says this is

546
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:40,840
potentially misinformation that doesn't

547
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:45,100
help actually with some campaigns it

548
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:48,490
helps the campaign what the answer is is

549
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:51,159
difficult and our good friend Sarah and

550
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:53,170
Pablo are working on this and but why I

551
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:55,330
would say is we all need to better

552
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:57,400
understand how information is used and

553
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:59,949
we all need to understand better the

554
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:02,500
value of information the fact that we're

555
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:04,750
willing to trade all of our personal

556
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:08,170
information including very clear

557
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:10,780
biometric information just to get a pair

558
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:13,840
of cat ears in a photo is terrifying to

559
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:17,070
me and many people have asked me what I

560
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:20,429
thought the face app campaign was about

561
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:24,179
face app essentially effect harvest

562
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:26,910
more than 150 million faces across the

563
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:28,500
world well if you consider one of the

564
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:31,080
greatest technical problems that's being

565
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:33,690
worked on cross countries its facial

566
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:35,610
recognition the biggest floor in it

567
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:39,270
right now is that every model that's

568
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:41,399
being built has massive bias issues so a

569
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:44,670
facial recognition model built in China

570
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:46,830
is great at recognizing Asian faces but

571
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:50,280
sucks at recognizing any other race and

572
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:53,100
the same goes for the West the only way

573
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:57,899
that you can fix that is by having a

574
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:59,159
much bigger unbiased data set and many

575
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,540
people have said well why can't they

576
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,670
just go into Facebook and collective

577
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:05,670
well the reality is on an information

578
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:08,460
campaign if you have to go out and

579
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:10,650
collect every piece of information you

580
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:13,860
are expending the effort and it's no

581
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:15,750
longer really good ROI if on the other

582
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:17,760
hand you can send out a single artifact

583
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:21,510
and have everyone send the information

584
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:24,420
to you now you're cooking and now you're

585
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:27,780
getting some real intelligence whether

586
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:30,000
or not the face app stuff was directly a

587
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:31,350
information gathering campaign from

588
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,910
Russia I don't think anyone can say

589
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:35,428
without knowing from the inside of the

590
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:38,970
company but I will say is it definitely

591
00:27:35,429 --> 00:27:44,420
built the best non-biased

592
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:44,420
facial data set I have seen anywhere

593
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:53,610
next question you go back to hawk Bart

594
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:55,620
actually is the CCC guy because I'm

595
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:57,389
going to ask is something that again

596
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:59,129
maybe it's not a question to you or to

597
00:27:57,390 --> 00:28:01,530
us that we know the stuff but it's to

598
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:02,820
the audience because I was touched by

599
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:05,490
the example that you made through your

600
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:09,360
daughter I was hacking with Pengo is

601
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:10,890
there a live guy a hot part are we were

602
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,919
look at the like at the end of the

603
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:16,980
eighties so I'm old it's 25 a keg and

604
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:21,210
son and son ah I think a few people you

605
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:25,350
guys know that be because of thanks to

606
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:30,630
these two two guys the cyber war a word

607
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:33,040
is started like that in 1986 and not now

608
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:35,380
is not anything brand new

609
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:38,260
also digital forensics started from

610
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:41,200
there because from this incident our are

611
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:43,990
one of the most great books in the world

612
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:46,780
is the Google is my cliffy by cliff or

613
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:48,820
stole so I'm going to ask about like you

614
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:53,200
too as to the audience how many of you

615
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:55,810
know this book because in Asia that that

616
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,060
there is a huge lack of history of

617
00:28:55,810 --> 00:29:01,899
information security and that kink and

618
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:04,629
everything that this you are a new hero

619
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:08,170
I just met I didn't know so how much

620
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:09,820
about you are alive but you explained

621
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:13,090
the things that all over the audience

622
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:15,760
should understand and learn and apply

623
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:18,970
back to everything they did in the past

624
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:21,340
them and why they are here and and I'm

625
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:26,040
kind of sure that your keynote without

626
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:28,120
or is going to help as I hope

627
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:30,670
anything the audience to change their

628
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:34,389
life in another way so what I want to

629
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:36,550
ask you is why we keep on not to

630
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:39,040
learning from the past mistakes in the

631
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:41,350
history because everything is flame back

632
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:44,520
again and again is the same shade as the

633
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:48,580
same mistakes is the same things why

634
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:50,650
they still don't understand so I think

635
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:52,720
there's a lot of answers to that first

636
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:54,730
of all I don't think it's just an Asian

637
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,950
problem that there's a lot of knowledge

638
00:29:54,730 --> 00:30:01,060
of history because if you ask the same

639
00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:03,010
question right I asked a very well-known

640
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:07,179
German researcher friend of ours

641
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:09,700
and he could only vaguely answer what

642
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:12,280
this was this is not a problem

643
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:15,580
to any specific region this is a problem

644
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:17,110
across the whole industry and so to the

645
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:20,889
first point how many of you have read

646
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:25,570
Clifford stoles Cuckoo's egg yeah a few

647
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:31,810
of you okay that's good what about the

648
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:34,990
stock net book again a couple I think

649
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:37,120
the problem is we have been incredibly

650
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:39,130
successful in creating an industry it's

651
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:42,070
an industry that grows exponentially

652
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:43,930
every year and we have people coming in

653
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:46,780
who are new

654
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:49,420
they don't like many of them identify

655
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:51,310
themselves as InfoSec professionals so

656
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:53,560
they don't learn about the hacker

657
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:54,669
histories and things because they don't

658
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,830
see themselves as hackers they see

659
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:58,780
themselves as infoset professionals it's

660
00:30:56,830 --> 00:31:00,520
a different identity with a different

661
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:03,520
set of rules and a different set of code

662
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:05,200
that's not a bad thing but we need to

663
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:07,000
start combining some of the knowledge

664
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,610
because you're absolutely right you know

665
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,920
I'm tired of making posts on Twitter

666
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:15,100
saying the 90s called they'd like their

667
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:16,960
bug back because right it's a harsh

668
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,879
reality that we keep seeing the same

669
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:23,380
things over and over again because we

670
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:25,150
keep forgetting the lessons Hey just two

671
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:28,860
weeks ago I was dealing with a problem

672
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:32,560
because of war dialing because a

673
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:35,350
company's historically used to divide up

674
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:38,710
sensitive systems into different hunt

675
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:41,290
groups and away from their main numbers

676
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:42,730
so that was harder to find them they've

677
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:44,950
stopped doing that because they don't

678
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:47,620
think a known does it and so you use

679
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:50,080
these old techniques and suddenly you're

680
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:52,000
finding diamonds that don't have any

681
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,399
good authentication and let you straight

682
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,770
into simple systems and those simple

683
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:58,540
systems have no protection because why

684
00:31:56,770 --> 00:32:01,060
would you protect a printer or why would

685
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:02,440
you protect a fax machine and you know

686
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:04,389
those of you who are at the talk

687
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:06,760
yesterday well know exactly why you

688
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:08,890
protect a printer or a fax machine hey

689
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:12,010
at the end of the day anything man makes

690
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:13,930
man can hack and if we don't keep

691
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:16,060
reminding ourselves of this we're going

692
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:20,200
to keep getting caught short the other

693
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:21,490
issue is people are too rigid in some of

694
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,620
their ways of thinking and that's where

695
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:25,720
I think the hacker history can help hey

696
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:28,540
just because it doesn't have an obvious

697
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:31,450
API doesn't mean it isn't vulnerable I

698
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:34,030
have routinely hat supermarkets with

699
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:36,160
barcodes because most barcodes are

700
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:38,470
connected to Windows machines and you

701
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:41,860
can send a barcode that tells to turn on

702
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:43,330
the keyboard emulation and then you can

703
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:46,000
push another Parker through that sends

704
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:47,740
commands and off you go a little work in

705
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,950
like 90% of the supermarkets out there

706
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:55,270
hey anything that users can have input

707
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:56,230
to can be attacked and the results of

708
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:59,590
those attacks

709
00:32:56,230 --> 00:33:01,630
can be quite surprising because there's

710
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:04,779
no cyber defenses to stop that from

711
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:06,549
happening and so I think the problem is

712
00:33:04,779 --> 00:33:10,679
just this influx of new people and

713
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:12,850
somehow we have to become archivists and

714
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:15,490
preserve this knowledge and bring it out

715
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:19,299
I myself have been asking people

716
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:23,860
questions right here is a one how many

717
00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:26,679
of you have heard of the eight lgm two

718
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:29,769
people did you know the eight lgm

719
00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:31,600
essentially started the whole concept of

720
00:33:29,769 --> 00:33:34,840
buffer overflows in sun equipment and

721
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:37,149
that they wrote almost all of the early

722
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:40,840
sun exploits they were all in the most

723
00:33:37,149 --> 00:33:48,809
prolific hacking groups of the 80s and

724
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:52,629
90s yeah yeah and I know them quite well

725
00:33:48,809 --> 00:33:55,750
but many people don't undertake having

726
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:57,760
seen flourished almost as much as the

727
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:59,769
American hacking scene did and around

728
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,879
the same time and because we're

729
00:33:59,769 --> 00:34:03,639
forgetting these things

730
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,990
we're losing chunks of history as well I

731
00:34:03,639 --> 00:34:07,719
was really delighted to see the book

732
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:09,219
come out about the CDC and I want to see

733
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,899
more of these kind of books come out I

734
00:34:09,219 --> 00:34:12,428
want to see this knowledge captured and

735
00:34:10,899 --> 00:34:15,069
I want to see it become mandatory

736
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:16,510
reading in universities so people could

737
00:34:15,069 --> 00:34:21,310
learn where we came from

738
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:23,470
because there's a famous quote about not

739
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:24,668
forgetting the mistakes that if you

740
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:30,279
don't learn from the mistakes of the

741
00:34:24,668 --> 00:34:30,759
past you're doomed to repeat them next

742
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,589
question

743
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,569
how about we move on to the slide Oh

744
00:34:32,589 --> 00:34:37,139
series of questions we have got a number

745
00:34:34,569 --> 00:34:39,819
over there let's bring it up to the main

746
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:42,240
screen I think the first one maybe a

747
00:34:39,819 --> 00:34:42,239
quick one

748
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:47,649
[Laughter]

749
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:51,000
well technically given that when he's

750
00:34:47,649 --> 00:34:56,190
typing most of the time it's actually a

751
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:59,589
Macromedia flash animation of one of the

752
00:34:56,190 --> 00:35:03,490
researchers or technical assistants like

753
00:34:59,589 --> 00:35:04,810
for example myself typing maybe not but

754
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:06,939
I tell you he probably has a better

755
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:09,210
grounding in stuff now than anyone else

756
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:11,520
I've come across

757
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:13,410
all right moving on to the next one

758
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:19,170
which is now actually the highest voted

759
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:20,970
question yeah so this is the problem the

760
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:22,530
reason it was so successful is because

761
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:24,870
we don't understand the value of our

762
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:27,600
data and we are willing to surrender it

763
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:29,880
for trivial prices and a lot of the time

764
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:32,759
we disassociate ourselves from the

765
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:34,380
impact so we go WOW you know what it's

766
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:38,040
only a bit of facebook information why

767
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:40,740
should I care well you should care

768
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:43,170
because if you are enabling someone to

769
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:45,930
build a profile that includes you and

770
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:48,810
your friends bad things could happen now

771
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:53,040
there's a really good real-world example

772
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:55,410
of this have any of you heard of the

773
00:35:53,040 --> 00:36:01,980
story of the Golden State Killer getting

774
00:35:55,410 --> 00:36:04,230
caught so the Golden State killer was a

775
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:05,970
serial rapist and murderer that was

776
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:09,000
actually a police officer when he was

777
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:11,609
doing it but decades ago no one had

778
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,280
caught him but they did have DNA samples

779
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:17,070
and so what they did was they went to

780
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,510
the DNA databases that all of you are

781
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:21,840
submitting to find out what your

782
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:25,020
percentage of race are and they went

783
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:29,040
mining and they found distant family

784
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:32,430
members of this killer by partial

785
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:34,259
matching DNA profiles and from that they

786
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:36,870
were able to identify a group of people

787
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:39,690
likely related to him and then they were

788
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:44,069
able to drill in and find him that's the

789
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:46,320
risk of a relational database that links

790
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:46,980
you to everybody else well in that

791
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,020
context

792
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:50,720
maybe the outcomes a good one you know a

793
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:52,920
killer got taken off the streets

794
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:55,230
consider that in terms of an

795
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,180
intelligence operation if a nation-state

796
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:58,920
is able to build a profile that knows

797
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:01,620
who you talk to when you talk to them

798
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:04,050
and can link you several links down the

799
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:06,660
line you may not be exposing yourself

800
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:08,880
but you may be exposing your family your

801
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:12,629
friends all sorts of other people and

802
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:16,140
once that data goes out you can't get it

803
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:18,330
back I don't care what gdpr says thank

804
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:20,390
you try going knocking on the door of a

805
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:24,339
Russian company and tell them hey

806
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:24,339
gdpr gives me the right to be forgotten

807
00:37:24,999 --> 00:37:29,450
not gonna work

808
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:31,009
hey and we have the same problem with

809
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:34,368
other countries with a different privacy

810
00:37:31,009 --> 00:37:36,319
laws if you give up that data you have

811
00:37:34,369 --> 00:37:38,180
almost no idea what it can be useful and

812
00:37:36,319 --> 00:37:39,829
this is what I meant by it we need to

813
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:42,319
understand information warfare better

814
00:37:39,829 --> 00:37:44,960
because that means understanding the

815
00:37:42,319 --> 00:37:47,420
impact of surrendering this data so that

816
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:50,089
we can better communicate to people one

817
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:53,529
of the best defenses that we can build

818
00:37:50,089 --> 00:37:56,779
is if we can recognize our own citizenry

819
00:37:53,529 --> 00:37:58,759
against disinformation if you can arm

820
00:37:56,779 --> 00:38:00,829
them with knowledge on how to recognize

821
00:37:58,759 --> 00:38:03,279
these artifacts how to recognize these

822
00:38:00,829 --> 00:38:06,650
things and what to do when they see it

823
00:38:03,279 --> 00:38:09,349
that's the most effective way way more

824
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:13,190
effective than coming in with censorship

825
00:38:09,349 --> 00:38:17,119
or overreach to try and stop things from

826
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:19,430
happening thank you let's how about

827
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:22,309
let's take one more question and we'll

828
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:24,739
wrap it up for the second question the

829
00:38:22,309 --> 00:38:34,999
second highest voted it's the one on top

830
00:38:24,739 --> 00:38:36,529
now or if you like whichever question

831
00:38:34,999 --> 00:38:40,038
you prefer

832
00:38:36,529 --> 00:38:41,930
it's tough because I'm British and III

833
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:43,279
sympathize with my government and I

834
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:45,078
understand what they're trying to do

835
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:51,369
well I suppose was someone by government

836
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:53,150
I wish some of them would go away but I

837
00:38:51,369 --> 00:38:57,680
you're not gonna get me saying anything

838
00:38:53,150 --> 00:39:00,049
else I am British after all I understand

839
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,519
what they're trying to do this and anti

840
00:39:00,049 --> 00:39:04,069
radicalization is a really tough problem

841
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:04,669
I'm actually working on it from a

842
00:39:04,069 --> 00:39:08,058
different angle

843
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:10,309
um I don't think government driven

844
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:13,430
campaigns are likely to be very

845
00:39:10,309 --> 00:39:16,220
successful because they can just be

846
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:18,109
twisted and used to drive and fuel some

847
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:19,669
of this stuff may help in some small

848
00:39:18,109 --> 00:39:22,308
cases but I don't think it's the

849
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:24,170
solution that we're looking for and what

850
00:39:22,309 --> 00:39:26,660
I'm working on is trying to build a

851
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:29,599
curriculum to be taken into schools to

852
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:32,629
teach the kids about this sort of stuff

853
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:34,200
but also a second set of curriculum to

854
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:37,620
teach teachers and pair

855
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:40,080
how to recognize when kids are a showing

856
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:42,210
cyber potential because we actually need

857
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:43,950
to start hiring these kids early and

858
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:46,560
putting them into classes with they're

859
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:49,859
trained because those kids are the

860
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:50,400
future of our defense in in in the years

861
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:53,310
to come

862
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,750
and if we don't filter them out they're

863
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:56,820
gonna end up making the mistakes that I

864
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:59,520
made and many of you made as hackers

865
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:02,070
right it's only but that by the grace of

866
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:06,000
God that I'm not in jail for some of the

867
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:08,760
things I did as a kid I the mistakes you

868
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,610
make as a kid today can have way more

869
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:13,110
penalties and so we have to catch these

870
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:15,180
talented kids before they express

871
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:19,740
themselves in a way that expresses them

872
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:22,049
in to jail the same time we need to also

873
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:23,310
teach parents and teachers how to

874
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:25,710
recognize the stuff because they're not

875
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:28,140
equipped to deal with it but if we can

876
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:30,300
teach them the signs to look out for we

877
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:32,549
can help give them the tools to do

878
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:34,350
something about this and I think it's at

879
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:36,330
that level that you're going to have

880
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:40,560
much better impact or dealing with

881
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:41,759
radicalization all right I think that

882
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,920
wraps us up for the question and answer

883
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,260
session mark thank you very much for

884
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,450
kicking us often amazing start a day to

885
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:52,030
edges we're about collage

886
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:57,899
[Applause]

887
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:57,900
I just had one last thing

888
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:05,889
