1
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:18,560
yeah hi welcome to my dog thanks for

2
00:00:13,549 --> 00:00:21,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming maybe short intro</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about me and my</font>

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:25,460
my colleague so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm actually I'm having</font>

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:29,899
a small cutie<font color="#E5E5E5"> convulsively 41 I usually</font>

5
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:33,320
speak German I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cissp as I might</font>

6
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:37,070
know something about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cutie you know</font>

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:40,280
and yeah my colleague in this research

8
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:42,109
JP drop animo saw he couldn't be here

9
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,530
today because the eternities at the

10
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:52,100
beach or something yeah so good choice

11
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:54,769
for him and bill just<font color="#E5E5E5"> before we start</font>

12
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,809
some props so<font color="#E5E5E5"> wyd actually dude if we do</font>

13
00:00:54,769 --> 00:00:58,640
this research was actually when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> met a</font>

14
00:00:56,809 --> 00:01:01,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">blackhead last year their thoughts were</font>

15
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,670
not dead interesting and so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> started</font>

16
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:06,980
looking to the signal source code also

17
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:09,680
to of mr. systems for like 15 cm of the

18
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:12,320
box<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to some colleagues exchanged</font>

19
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,020
idea to that actually now I can add more

20
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:21,949
people like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> mention and skylines and</font>

21
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:24,619
everyone so yes so signal we want to

22
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:28,450
look a bit on signal most secure

23
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:32,930
messenger ever like on the internal on

24
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:35,150
the attacks or face packs and that's it

25
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:37,580
we found and some things we found which

26
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:40,310
are might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhat interesting after</font>

27
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:42,560
that of course we give some conclusions

28
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:45,880
but you can show your so signal

29
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:50,600
messaging app for be all you know it

30
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:56,720
hope you use a signal<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay basically</font>

31
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:59,419
everyone so yes then you're no signal

32
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:02,450
what can do much messing app mr. systems

33
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:04,790
Moxie Marlinspike and friends so it was

34
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:07,040
text secure before and she<font color="#CCCCCC"> was to apps</font>

35
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:09,530
and they got merged textsecure as a

36
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,780
messaging app and signal<font color="#CCCCCC"> bread phone</font>

37
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:14,090
what the voice<font color="#E5E5E5"> and calling at it what's</font>

38
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:16,749
merged now its signal and they have a

39
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:20,030
lot of implementations for android iOS

40
00:02:16,749 --> 00:02:23,049
also chrome death of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's</font>

41
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:27,040
normally regarded as a very trusted to

42
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:30,910
like Snowden and roasted and other

43
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:34,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">popular people it's popular among</font>

44
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:38,710
activists<font color="#E5E5E5"> and yet the senior ski here is</font>

45
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:42,220
actually information<font color="#E5E5E5"> returns in unique</font>

46
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:45,220
milliseconds form a data request from CP

47
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:50,020
FBI also so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> say they don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so much</font>

48
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:52,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">data so yeah somewhat secure so security</font>

49
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:54,160
promises of signal are of course like

50
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:56,650
end-to-end encryption you don't need to

51
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:01,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">trust the back end or the transport of</font>

52
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:05,950
signal so even against active network

53
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:08,560
attackers confirm a service yet empty

54
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:10,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">the code is perceived as somewhat high</font>

55
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:15,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">quality there was no major security</font>

56
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:19,020
issue so far and they have apparently

57
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:22,600
reproducible builds a network so um

58
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:24,970
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> sickness modern signal so it's</font>

59
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,310
the protocol signal protocols used in

60
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:30,580
facebook Messenger of its own son on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

61
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:33,610
official mode it's used by what apps

62
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:37,300
it's apparently<font color="#CCCCCC"> sought by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Google</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> aloes</font>

63
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:40,480
and something to mode so they licensed

64
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:43,290
after a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other messengers meant to</font>

65
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:49,200
them actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> user base is quite large</font>

66
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:52,780
beyond the signal and yeah so encryption

67
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">I will just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go all briefly because we</font>

68
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,900
could talk for hours properly about all

69
00:03:54,430 --> 00:04:00,100
the crypto stuff that's going on there

70
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:03,340
so we skip the details but unlike the

71
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:06,640
base of signal x3d HTC<font color="#CCCCCC"> hammered key</font>

72
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:09,340
agreement is quite complicated key

73
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,890
agreement you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have several keys actually</font>

74
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:15,700
40 appears if long-term and ephemera

75
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:18,010
keys and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a less involved a sort of 250</font>

76
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:21,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">Hammond and the key derivation and they</font>

77
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:29,050
mix all these I keep into it to derive a

78
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:31,090
shared secret yeah interesting here is

79
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:35,220
and they're technically you sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

80
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:39,869
trick for so this one time quickie

81
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:42,300
the problem in messengers are that if

82
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:44,730
the one part is offline you cannot

83
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:47,040
really do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> e Hammond because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

84
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:49,350
part is offline you cannot use a

85
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,910
classically feminine because you have to

86
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:53,430
wait for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the round trip and everything</font>

87
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:56,100
code not very convenient so what they

88
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:58,350
did is they<font color="#CCCCCC"> stole one part of the DV</font>

89
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,800
Hammond already on the server as a

90
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:04,050
freaky so Bob would already have

91
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,720
completed his as part of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> seven what</font>

92
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:08,850
is this interesting very convenient very

93
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:14,040
efficient but you will see later why

94
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:16,280
this is actually interesting so let's

95
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:19,220
hash keys<font color="#E5E5E5"> and signal or double ratchet</font>

96
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:23,010
used to double wretched that's basically

97
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:26,250
it the messages have unique keys and

98
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:29,090
this divergence actually like advancing

99
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:32,760
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of like forward secrecy</font>

100
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:37,200
you cannot<font color="#CCCCCC"> go every first message from</font>

101
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:39,200
party<font color="#E5E5E5"> as in UTC</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Hammond so this is so</font>

102
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:43,500
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they've asked compromise</font>

103
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:46,080
and half messages are sort of safe when

104
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:49,050
the keys are deleting from the device of

105
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,330
course attentions work similar there's

106
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:54,000
each attachment as a different crew

107
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:59,180
pookie so it's yeah quick quick good

108
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,770
actually yes so Moxie Marlinspike

109
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:03,360
actually wrote a blog post and set up a

110
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:09,620
signal actually the signal second

111
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:14,310
protocol<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually like their</font>

112
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:16,560
intellectual properties who you cannot

113
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:20,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">call you a particular</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> speaking of cycle</font>

114
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:23,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">read that but the signal live protocols</font>

115
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:25,740
used in a lot of other<font color="#CCCCCC"> applications so</font>

116
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:29,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay these are like the basic second</font>

117
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:33,090
protocol but actually wait that wasn't

118
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:34,830
all right because what about all the

119
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:36,719
other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like how are the other</font>

120
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:40,080
attachments actually encrypted like what

121
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,330
that it was a group to use for that our

122
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,729
audio and video streams encrypted and

123
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:47,609
how doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> choke is checking work on</font>

124
00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:48,330
this in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tetris and so on I would this</font>

125
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:50,669
group message

126
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:53,340
work we only talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 121 scenarios</font>

127
00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:55,530
so these are sort of code to

128
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:58,948
documentation the developers just did

129
00:06:55,530 --> 00:07:05,119
what they start to arrive yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> which is</font>

130
00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:09,180
actually also quite interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> often so</font>

131
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:11,580
just shall we get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> so signal it's not</font>

132
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:15,360
easy center right it has a server so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

133
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:17,310
can see if two devices are end-to-end to

134
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,430
enter enter encrypted communication but

135
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:23,580
they use the signal servers for

136
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:25,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">attachments they also use signal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

137
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:29,250
Tesla actually taught<font color="#E5E5E5"> an N</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of them</font>

138
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:31,199
there's a certain amazon s3 and the

139
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:33,090
messaging service<font color="#CCCCCC"> i seem to be run by of</font>

140
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,490
whisper systems FFF and to end

141
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:36,780
encryption actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's suppose that</font>

142
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:43,529
the second service do not need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

143
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:47,400
trusted get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it the code base for signals</font>

144
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:49,800
quiet which would say large and it has a

145
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:54,419
lot of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> implementations for iOS</font>

146
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:56,550
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Androids there are libraries as a</font>

147
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:59,008
reference implementation for the service

148
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:02,250
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the protocol itself you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

150
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:09,180
hundred thousand lines of code and for

151
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:10,770
only signal but we may need look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

152
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:14,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">Android app and there the software stack</font>

153
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:17,190
is even larger if you look look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all</font>

154
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:20,520
these things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i use and they could</font>

155
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:22,620
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> reduces the curve 25 from the jaw</font>

156
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,628
breaker tripped oh so that's quite

157
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:29,849
dinner they did not do their own crystal

158
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:31,919
which is actually good I<font color="#CCCCCC"> guess and so</font>

159
00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:38,069
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can see it there's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

160
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:40,948
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's in there so an epithet we</font>

161
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:42,659
go find a major security bug before us

162
00:08:40,948 --> 00:08:44,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we know of there were some and</font>

163
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:48,810
elevates they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> minor security issues</font>

164
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:51,810
fixed and and they already act some some

165
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:57,839
key<font color="#E5E5E5"> compromised and replay attacks</font>

166
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:59,760
discussed in cydia basically so maybe a

167
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,230
more interesting part like what's

168
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,380
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> tech our scenario here</font>

169
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:07,150
signal<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I basically two scenarios once</font>

170
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:11,770
the network attacker classical like<font color="#E5E5E5"> man</font>

171
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:14,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the middle active or passive so yeah</font>

172
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:17,410
we can inject and modify messages and

173
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:20,380
try to sabotage stuff that sort of

174
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:24,280
server like the pre keys<font color="#E5E5E5"> so classic</font>

175
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:27,700
scenario and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's actually let's say</font>

176
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:29,110
more interesting scenario from a text

177
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,450
point of view if you're the malicious

178
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:34,060
appear so you can actually have to

179
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:36,400
crypto key so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can talk the encrypted</font>

180
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:39,750
protocol and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can send media</font>

181
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:42,730
attachments and you can can basically

182
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:46,030
yeah do a lot more stuff than<font color="#CCCCCC"> offensive</font>

183
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:49,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">word a man-in-the-middle attacker and</font>

184
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:51,880
this is like often overlooked and design

185
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:55,840
of crypto protocol and could do that's

186
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:59,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">just I would say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so yeah as you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can see</font>

187
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:01,540
50 square picture of the cyclic code and

188
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:04,689
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of stuff particles in</font>

189
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:06,819
signal so if you talk about a text<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

190
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:09,790
your face doesn't matter where the code

191
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:11,260
comes from so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a lot of code</font>

192
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:15,209
that's actually not really under control

193
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:18,160
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the signal and the six of developers</font>

194
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:19,960
you can see that that an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android you</font>

195
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,980
have like five hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> thousand lines of</font>

196
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:27,820
code and iOS they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> little sort of</font>

197
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:31,090
left but you have web RTC am you have to

198
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:33,490
say okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> preferences last coat but most</font>

199
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:36,670
of it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> open SSL and multiple is not</font>

200
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:39,520
used so to be fair that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

201
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:41,949
such a<font color="#CCCCCC"> difference but to a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff</font>

202
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:45,750
you have a web components and decode

203
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:51,460
images that dude low level stuff

204
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:54,400
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> a trip to so maybe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> often</font>

205
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:56,920
terms of the text surface like I want to

206
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">have no messenger half that but still we</font>

207
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,390
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> like okay how can I be</font>

208
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:03,699
attacked current how can someone using

209
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:05,260
messenger be attacked there's no

210
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:08,370
mitigations really like a note

211
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:13,210
sandboxing between media passes and the

212
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:15,470
the messaging part and on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Android</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has no</font>

213
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:18,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">hardware keister use</font>

214
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:20,670
yes and basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> we cannot even prevent</font>

215
00:11:18,119 --> 00:11:21,990
that media files are parsed from unknown

216
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:25,139
sources so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can just add your own</font>

217
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:30,420
signal sent you stuff and your<font color="#CCCCCC"> android</font>

218
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:33,959
device so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> our set yep so we</font>

219
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:35,849
have some dependencies a a lot of stuff

220
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:38,368
external constantly added so they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

221
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:41,220
how gifts they have disappearing

222
00:11:38,369 --> 00:11:43,619
messages they have I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> now more</font>

223
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,839
media types they can can use so it's

224
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:52,619
getting larger and larger not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only the</font>

225
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:56,160
messaging anymore still there's one

226
00:11:52,619 --> 00:11:58,679
thing most important thing of course if

227
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:01,589
you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> check the fingerprints you're</font>

228
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:04,619
in the clear anyway so they might vary

229
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:07,699
stuff but still I don't think a lot of

230
00:12:04,619 --> 00:12:15,209
people do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually that are not</font>

231
00:12:07,699 --> 00:12:19,170
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> experts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yep thing called</font>

232
00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:21,569
breaking recovery so signal so if one if

233
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:24,719
specialty<font color="#CCCCCC"> of with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the session key got</font>

234
00:12:21,569 --> 00:12:26,639
compromised<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the device the protocol</font>

235
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,519
should be sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> self-healing because</font>

236
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:35,309
when a wretched steps forward this key

237
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:38,910
should be like replaced but if you look

238
00:12:35,309 --> 00:12:41,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">at really it yeah the assumption is that</font>

239
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:42,990
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacker only speeds one key and not</font>

240
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:49,860
the other key the root key that is

241
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:56,850
actually the KD KD f keys oh yeah that's

242
00:12:49,860 --> 00:13:00,839
that's sort of questionable so color

243
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:04,589
coming to the extra things we found yeah

244
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:07,019
we had a very tedious process like like

245
00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:09,389
we love having and the controlling

246
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:12,089
execution and building models and

247
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:16,589
encrypt analysis and lots of stuff JP

248
00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:19,139
did a lot of go<font color="#CCCCCC"> all to the blockchain 22</font>

249
00:13:16,589 --> 00:13:21,929
ricotta once we found and that's

250
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:25,620
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> not true we actually we're not</font>

251
00:13:21,929 --> 00:13:27,059
really knowing what we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing no we</font>

252
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,610
were not really planning what we were

253
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:31,719
doing so

254
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:34,630
seriously we did not have rigorous

255
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:37,690
process and like we also did not<font color="#E5E5E5"> audit</font>

256
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:42,160
signal so we we did not just automated

257
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:44,640
to basically use auditing techniques we

258
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,740
look down to the code and this manual

259
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:52,449
menu search for box and for four senses

260
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:54,910
we're interesting so of course when you

261
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:57,760
look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that from experience you follow</font>

262
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:59,980
the input you follow the data you follow

263
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:03,400
the educators especially in protocols if

264
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:08,220
i follow back classes that are in

265
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:11,199
grabbing languages very prevalent and

266
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:13,710
and we look at the server the<font color="#CCCCCC"> client</font>

267
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:18,760
code we did not look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the server code</font>

268
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:20,680
yet so when also of course we look at

269
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:23,439
the protocol but not at the calling

270
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:25,750
which is no WebRTC so probably not what

271
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:31,150
people other people will have looked at

272
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:35,160
that already so um basic tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

273
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:38,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">recalls I found chrome extension very</font>

274
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:40,980
very good if you want to do like test

275
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:43,750
shuffle signal guess is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to my mind lines</font>

276
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:46,600
it's pretty nice it's written in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java</font>

277
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:49,720
use the original signal its limitations

278
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:54,220
to libraries yes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we wrote our own</font>

279
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:58,779
stuff written in<font color="#E5E5E5"> part so um maybe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

280
00:14:54,220 --> 00:15:00,370
the first thing we found we found a

281
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:03,700
bypass of the mac that protects

282
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:05,200
attachments in android and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

283
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,580
interesting thing because apparently

284
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,400
people are not looking for integers

285
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:12,580
closed in<font color="#CCCCCC"> java code which they should</font>

286
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:15,339
because even if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't like directly</font>

287
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:18,730
cause memory corruption like in c code

288
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:20,860
or and other<font color="#E5E5E5"> languages the integer</font>

289
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:24,040
overflow we found here actually allows

290
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:28,150
up to like bypass a check so it hurts

291
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:30,930
the program logic logic we found them on

292
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:33,730
israel so here so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the there's the</font>

293
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:37,540
encrypted file and attached<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it is a</font>

294
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:41,320
mac address make its a Mac assisted to

295
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:43,410
the neck and this makes the message

296
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:46,930
authentication code

297
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:48,969
they subtract the length of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

298
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:53,410
length of file and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's sorta tune in</font>

299
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:57,699
and Indian Java is 32-bit so<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 can be</font>

300
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:59,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">more than 32 bits in length so they can</font>

301
00:15:57,699 --> 00:16:03,490
be like four gigabytes or if you go

302
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:06,690
about 2 to the early happens so this

303
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:10,180
where you would actually wrap around so

304
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:14,019
later on it will use this remaining<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

305
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:16,769
to read all the data at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

306
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:19,899
attachment and calculate a Mac<font color="#E5E5E5"> from that</font>

307
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:23,769
so it will see if that they'd has been

308
00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:26,980
modified so what we did is we hope you

309
00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:31,060
can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> it here you can we attached it's</font>

310
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:36,430
exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 gigabytes of padding through</font>

311
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:39,250
the file and this results<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a related</font>

312
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:42,430
data being like the original size so

313
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:44,589
here only<font color="#E5E5E5"> the original first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> X</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pipes are</font>

314
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:51,670
actually checked and the rest is not

315
00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:58,329
checked but<font color="#E5E5E5"> process later on so yes it's</font>

316
00:16:51,670 --> 00:17:00,430
that actually feasible yes because the

317
00:16:58,329 --> 00:17:05,198
attachments are downloaded using HTTP

318
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:07,389
and HTTPS a thing called a compression

319
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:10,390
come HTTP compression context impression

320
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:12,939
so if you attach four gigabytes of faith

321
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:15,459
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the message until your gzip</font>

322
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:18,699
compression it will reside on my 22 form

323
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:20,730
megabyte that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> too good four gigabytes</font>

324
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:23,079
compress constituted<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 megabytes so it's</font>

325
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:26,410
totally feasible to Center to a mobile

326
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:28,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">device and we take like in the</font>

327
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:34,570
background like some minutes to sort of

328
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:39,570
unpack that but it works so yeah you

329
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:43,659
cannot the result you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see here</font>

330
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:45,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically we got an exception where we</font>

331
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:47,590
did that will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> together and exceptions</font>

332
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,660
and that padding exception so basically

333
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:53,709
we were bypassing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> integrity check</font>

334
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:56,200
and next to my pain goes wrong so we

335
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">thought okay that's pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nice maybe we</font>

336
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,850
can do

337
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,650
original attack which are to be not very

338
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:10,159
working because we didn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any back</font>

339
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:10,160
channel so that was unfortunate till we

340
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:18,050
discovered<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they were actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

341
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:22,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">a EF</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CBC for to encrypt the attachment</font>

342
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:25,290
the problem with a a CBC encryption mode

343
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:27,480
is that you can like mess with the

344
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:33,690
ciphertext and with the outcome so it's

345
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:35,670
a mellow busy property so basically you

346
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:37,950
can repeat encrypted blocks and they

347
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:41,460
will decrypt fine sort of you can even

348
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:45,390
if you know the plaintext what you can

349
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:48,660
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to a up to change and force</font>

350
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:52,640
every second block of the encrypted data

351
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:55,500
to be something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you want what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> else</font>

352
00:18:52,640 --> 00:19:00,200
known plaintext attack but still quite

353
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:03,120
interesting so um yeah we have tis a

354
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:05,640
little demo because there were people

355
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:10,020
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> claiming that it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

356
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:13,890
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> feasible to attack so we had to</font>

357
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:16,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">do this little demo sound works let's</font>

358
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:18,930
see so first of all we just like repeat

359
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:22,100
the content which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is interesting for</font>

360
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:22,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">audio messages</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

361
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:51,930
as you can see the last part of the

362
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:54,090
message has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been repeated so this is</font>

363
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:55,440
just plain stupid<font color="#E5E5E5"> straight forward</font>

364
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:57,570
reserves<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay let's just repeat the</font>

365
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,880
message to see what happens if you

366
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:02,429
actually know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a voice message if</font>

367
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,900
you actually know what's spoken so you

368
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:17,960
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> even more interesting because you</font>

369
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:40,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">can now try to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shop up the file this</font>

370
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:43,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">receipt so the impact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is eternity is it</font>

371
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:45,960
bad it's not super bad but a<font color="#CCCCCC"> good test</font>

372
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:51,960
so maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you settle</font>

373
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:53,220
quickly take tonight the<font color="#E5E5E5"> party yes so</font>

374
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,900
apparently if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know something about</font>

375
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:56,460
what work transmitted you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

376
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,260
kinds of interesting things something

377
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:01,020
about this and lives with binary data

378
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:04,050
could also get interested in<font color="#CCCCCC"> certain</font>

379
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:08,910
stage fright into media pass or so from

380
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:12,600
cross context<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay then we found some</font>

381
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:14,640
sort of quark which is yeah it's it's

382
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,649
not it's not a vulnerability but it

383
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,960
selects a very strange property of the

384
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:20,940
crypto protocol if you set your public

385
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:25,650
key to<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero actually the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sales shed</font>

386
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:28,830
secret will also be<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero so what does</font>

387
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:30,870
that mean so you could set you publicly

388
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:34,290
20 someone want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to communicate with you</font>

389
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:36,179
will get a predictable share secret so

390
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:42,149
the encryption and was not really

391
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:44,160
working anymore and you could argue okay

392
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:45,780
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean you could also publish</font>

393
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:49,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">your messages if you want to want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

394
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:50,970
attack yourself or if you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to appear</font>

395
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:54,750
still other

396
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:58,380
do differently and it's very easy to

397
00:21:54,750 --> 00:22:02,700
just discard to see ok so<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe maybe</font>

398
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:05,330
you should do that also with mine might

399
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:07,799
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> some kind of Dinan a deniability</font>

400
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:13,320
issue on this breaking news conference

401
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:17,789
also killed by it so yeah but most<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

402
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:20,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">those that wanna fix it oh yeah then if</font>

403
00:22:17,789 --> 00:22:22,500
you think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> using the signal</font>

404
00:22:20,419 --> 00:22:24,870
reference implementation so if you'd

405
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:27,360
like for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> a test and it's demo</font>

406
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:31,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">coded provided with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that very careful</font>

407
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:33,809
because actually yeah there are some

408
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:38,340
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> on it so there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are some some call</font>

409
00:22:33,809 --> 00:22:40,770
bags and they we found type confusion

410
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:59,340
there we found<font color="#CCCCCC"> integers with peep</font>

411
00:22:40,770 --> 00:23:01,460
overflows interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so you have a</font>

412
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:06,330
lot of stuff so if you using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> C</font>

413
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:08,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">example so be careful another</font>

414
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:11,580
interesting that is found in signal<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

415
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:17,700
an underflow or in the RTP code for

416
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:19,949
calling of signals it's actually a bit

417
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:22,620
of ways because this package is actually

418
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:24,720
not exploitable beyond the crash because

419
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:27,629
it said it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> shadowplay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> another back</font>

420
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,870
or more left by the same overflow like

421
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:36,600
twice still it was quite an interesting

422
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:39,330
so can you see that yeah it's here in

423
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">the bottom the payload length is</font>

424
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:42,990
actually calculated from the packet

425
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:44,760
length minus the RTP header so what they

426
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:47,100
forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> to check the cross the detective</font>

427
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:49,408
is actually large enough to actually

428
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:52,559
have a header so if the package is like

429
00:23:49,409 --> 00:23:55,350
one by long it will underflow and the

430
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:57,178
payload leg will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be like negatives which</font>

431
00:23:55,350 --> 00:24:00,418
of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> not good later on it gets</font>

432
00:23:57,179 --> 00:24:01,760
thrown into an H max we'd have some very

433
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:04,880
large

434
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:08,629
out of palm trees and and so on all

435
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:12,500
kinds of weird stuff happens here but as

436
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:14,660
I said isn't really explorable but you

437
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:19,970
could at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> use it to crash a remote</font>

438
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:25,790
signal something yes speaking of

439
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:28,760
crashing we quite find some some things

440
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:31,270
that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting so signal Android</font>

441
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:34,910
users lips gear for media decoding and

442
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:39,260
this is actually get all box on lips

443
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:45,410
gear will hurt you we have an example

444
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:49,340
here so just make something for crash to

445
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:56,540
check<font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exportable but signal thing</font>

446
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:59,030
will actually receive a message boo boo

447
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:01,879
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Android 7 from last year</font>

448
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:04,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">apparently triggered some kind of back</font>

449
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,620
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Android we just solve a problem</font>

450
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:09,560
because as soon as this is the androids

451
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:11,659
up it was that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> signal again and it</font>

452
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:15,230
will crush again so basically your

453
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:16,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">Android devices sort of bricked if</font>

454
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:19,700
you're not able to I don't know

455
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:22,399
intercept boot and delete delete signal

456
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:27,230
from that so it's yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm quite an</font>

457
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:29,780
interesting thing internally I think it

458
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:32,150
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> more like hitting an insertion so</font>

459
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:35,270
it's not a common back<font color="#E5E5E5"> or something hit</font>

460
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:37,070
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> back and Android more or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> less but</font>

461
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:43,720
triggered by signal I think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

462
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:51,399
quite interesting example another

463
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:57,710
another<font color="#CCCCCC"> buck that's actually interesting</font>

464
00:25:51,400 --> 00:26:02,890
is actually in the chrome extension for

465
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:02,890
signal let me see

466
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:16,419
up here one here

467
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:44,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay the don't we what interesting and</font>

468
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:49,240
is the demo<font color="#E5E5E5"> demo effects so i get i have</font>

469
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:52,890
to sort of show that nature except if it

470
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">crashed already maybe</font>

471
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:18,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can try to show that later</font>

472
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:21,439
it's basically basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> a crash in</font>

473
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:26,000
cyclic chrome extension if it receives a

474
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:28,010
bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> s e-g so we took us like 10 minutes</font>

475
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,200
to create an SVG to create your<font color="#E5E5E5"> end a</font>

476
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:36,280
crash surrender with an out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of memory</font>

477
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:40,030
condition and yeah in the CG parsing the

478
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:44,050
pointer shows<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually if you have any</font>

479
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:47,300
exportable back in the SVG partner of

480
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:49,250
chrome this will actually give you

481
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:50,990
access to all the signatures because it

482
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:53,120
would crush the crust the extension or

483
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:54,950
in any way exploit the<font color="#E5E5E5"> extension exploit</font>

484
00:27:53,120 --> 00:28:00,830
a renderer and set render out all the

485
00:27:54,950 --> 00:28:03,850
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> messages so basically sandbox and</font>

486
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:07,429
anything is not having<font color="#E5E5E5"> you in that case</font>

487
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:10,909
so maybe for autumn more interesting

488
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:14,600
thing we looked at the protocol we

489
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:17,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually found a method we play for that</font>

490
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:20,270
I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of complicated maybe</font>

491
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:22,879
and maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember I talked about this</font>

492
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:27,740
week 3 b.h and the pre keys they used to

493
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:31,280
speed up<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Chiefs change and a key</font>

494
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:33,470
derivation so<font color="#E5E5E5"> normally these keys are</font>

495
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:35,180
like one time because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course if you</font>

496
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:36,950
do a DC Hammond and the values are

497
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:41,140
repeated you will get the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> shared</font>

498
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:43,270
secret and you will get you can replay

499
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:48,610
messages that are like encrypted and

500
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:51,050
integration checks with that so

501
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:54,350
therefore the messages are one-time

502
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:56,840
freaky except for<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of these keys and</font>

503
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:59,750
this is the last resort key or however

504
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:01,639
you want to call it seemed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font>

505
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:04,610
perfect<font color="#CCCCCC"> mechanism against all so in the</font>

506
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:08,060
code there's this or actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> called</font>

507
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:09,620
medium<font color="#E5E5E5"> chunky and so there's this the</font>

508
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:12,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">Society of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ski so if this is</font>

509
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:15,439
encountered I mean when I cannot<font color="#E5E5E5"> sit on</font>

510
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:18,530
the femur but and so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is encountered</font>

511
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:23,170
it will not delete the key from its key

512
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:23,170
store it allows it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be reused</font>

513
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:30,670
so yeah as I said so when I want to send

514
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:32,290
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> message to someone else I will and</font>

515
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:34,980
then never talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> him</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at her before I</font>

516
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:37,300
will fetch his freaky from the server

517
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:39,550
completed if he Hellman and quit my

518
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:41,110
message and send my public if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

519
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:43,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">haven't values together with the</font>

520
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:47,139
encrypted message to Bob he will also

521
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:51,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">complete the diffie-hellman on his side</font>

522
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:53,320
and can decrypt my message so and then

523
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:58,300
the keys removed except for the last

524
00:29:53,320 --> 00:30:02,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">resort so um this means if you could</font>

525
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:04,419
replay if you could replay that where if

526
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:10,270
you could repeat that good yeah we'll

527
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:12,130
say it they try to prevent it but lemme

528
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:14,110
let's first look how<font color="#E5E5E5"> does such a message</font>

529
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:16,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">look like so basically you have the</font>

530
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:20,020
encrypted message here<font color="#E5E5E5"> on Drive which is</font>

531
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:24,669
the encrypted<font color="#E5E5E5"> packet X and on the left</font>

532
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:27,280
are the values<font color="#E5E5E5"> that Alice public values</font>

533
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:31,270
analysis a base key<font color="#CCCCCC"> primary</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> key of her</font>

534
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:33,310
let's identity<font color="#E5E5E5"> GE the time quickly ID</font>

535
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:35,440
that is used when the pre here<font color="#E5E5E5"> DD</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

536
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:37,690
registration for some value these are

537
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:41,380
used to complete the key exchange on Bob

538
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:43,150
Spartan are sent by Arabs so it's a

539
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:45,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">message</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> McDonald message encrypted</font>

540
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:47,890
message and key exchange message so

541
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:50,980
interestingly in signal and the current

542
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:53,200
implementation the key exchange part is

543
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:55,300
not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> integrity check so there's a</font>

544
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">message authentication code on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a message</font>

545
00:30:55,300 --> 00:31:00,280
but it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this part so basically</font>

546
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:04,389
if your<font color="#E5E5E5"> man in the middle and can just</font>

547
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:08,710
modify this<font color="#CCCCCC"> way these values and create</font>

548
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:13,450
arbitrary like random sessions in Bob's

549
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:15,400
tea store or session store which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

550
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:19,900
useful to<font color="#E5E5E5"> us so you can create like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fake</font>

551
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:23,860
sessions so for replay they try to

552
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:26,440
prevent<font color="#E5E5E5"> a replay by not doing key</font>

553
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:28,629
agreements from known like public very

554
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:30,340
base keys from an attorney<font color="#E5E5E5"> will not</font>

555
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:36,550
create the same session twice for the

556
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:37,419
same key and also they<font color="#CCCCCC"> will not remember</font>

557
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:39,490
this

558
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:45,330
if the encrypted message part is

559
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:49,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually not decrypted correctly so</font>

560
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:52,060
interestingly they only can remember

561
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:54,700
through the number of sessions days so

562
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:57,040
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> 40 sessions they will forget the</font>

563
00:31:54,700 --> 00:32:00,120
old one so if you're able to create fake

564
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:02,950
sessions you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can push out the validation</font>

565
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:04,389
and this means actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can like</font>

566
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:08,410
curse the session from the session store

567
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:12,790
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it good place also the valid</font>

568
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:14,650
ciphertext maybe if I go back here you

569
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:17,590
need two valid subtext in this part of

570
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:20,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">the message but interestingly this does</font>

571
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:22,120
not have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be related</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to this part</font>

572
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:25,030
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're connect multiple</font>

573
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:26,860
sessions and parallel and it will try

574
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:29,980
all of these sessions if one of them can

575
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:31,750
actually recruit that message so you can

576
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:35,050
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a method for another session</font>

577
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:38,020
I'm going session and have it have it

578
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:40,600
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottle it with something from a</font>

579
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:46,540
new session so<font color="#E5E5E5"> better you can get around</font>

580
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:50,469
that check yes so to<font color="#CCCCCC"> recap so no</font>

581
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:52,120
integrity checks popped up and check if

582
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:53,530
the equipment needs to be knocked apart

583
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:57,689
and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a limit on the sessions</font>

584
00:32:53,530 --> 00:33:01,629
needs so if you combine<font color="#CCCCCC"> it we could</font>

585
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:07,420
force forces sessions to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be only created</font>

586
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:09,100
with the last resort<font color="#CCCCCC"> key we actually put</font>

587
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:11,260
out the session state that we want to

588
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:14,020
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> replay by creating the sixth</font>

589
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:17,550
session and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to record</font>

590
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:23,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">those messages that should be replaced</font>

591
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:27,220
so I can show it demo actually like we

592
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:29,710
first did this research we had added emo

593
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:34,840
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a toy clients but I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> knowledged like</font>

594
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:40,440
this morning to actually do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> um I</font>

595
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:40,439
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the humor out again</font>

596
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:53,490
what so because I don't trust Adam oh

597
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:55,679
god I recorded it actually in order to

598
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:57,780
show you on the way home so what I did

599
00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:00,810
is I created a simple man in the middle

600
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:03,960
server for signal of course I had to

601
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:05,429
break<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tlm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tlf for that but I mean a</font>

602
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,710
man-in-the-middle scenario of course you

603
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:13,110
can assume that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the signal service alike</font>

604
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:14,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">compromised so and I've used the command</font>

605
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:24,420
line client to send messages to this

606
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:26,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">signal app on my phone so we yeah we</font>

607
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:28,200
have just this<font color="#E5E5E5"> good very little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff it</font>

608
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:29,790
will accept stuff men I sent missions

609
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:31,980
never replay this is the message it

610
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:34,920
should never be replaced I'm sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

611
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:37,080
the shaky wanna see but yeah so

612
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:39,540
basically the message is like going to

613
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:44,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">the main the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> middle and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there never</font>

614
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:48,690
replay so what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> will now now what is</font>

615
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:52,380
also now<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessary for some obscure</font>

616
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:57,870
reason is that you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reset the</font>

617
00:34:52,380 --> 00:35:01,410
session so basically people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

618
00:34:57,870 --> 00:35:03,210
reset the session the details can

619
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:05,640
explain to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you in more detail</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> balance</font>

620
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:07,740
yeah you have to reset the situation so

621
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:09,900
maybe the network was<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought to thought</font>

622
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:16,250
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to reset the session so we</font>

623
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:18,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually do that then we can send hello</font>

624
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:21,230
and you can send actually another

625
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:21,230
message

626
00:35:37,859 --> 00:35:43,288
so we sent the next message so what

627
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:46,558
we're doing what we're doing now is

628
00:35:43,289 --> 00:35:49,470
we're sending more than 40 messages

629
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:51,660
where we actually when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> enacted</font>

630
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:53,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">man-in-the-middle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we actually we capture</font>

631
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:59,249
we modify 40 messages sent<font color="#CCCCCC"> for master</font>

632
00:35:53,940 --> 00:36:01,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">box and add the new fake session set to</font>

633
00:35:59,249 --> 00:36:03,089
it we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that to be able to push</font>

634
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:09,439
out the<font color="#CCCCCC"> original session so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

635
00:36:03,089 --> 00:36:09,440
replay it so that's what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing now</font>

636
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:20,910
so will I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> messes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one two three you</font>

637
00:36:16,769 --> 00:36:23,488
<font color="#E5E5E5">can see there's actually receiving that</font>

638
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:25,230
the network is not really great yeah so

639
00:36:23,489 --> 00:36:27,599
instead of now waiting<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the 40</font>

640
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:35,970
messages I would just actually skip that

641
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:39,480
part so the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> part which should be</font>

642
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:42,390
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Co actually work so we</font>

643
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:44,339
received some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these messages until we</font>

644
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:46,470
now we should already have exhausted the

645
00:36:44,339 --> 00:36:48,779
sessions store and pushed out this

646
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:52,799
session we want to replay we're doing it

647
00:36:48,779 --> 00:36:54,539
so now it<font color="#CCCCCC"> sounds like 42 messages that</font>

648
00:36:52,799 --> 00:36:57,150
were modified and transmitted without

649
00:36:54,539 --> 00:37:00,359
the signal client knowing or recognizing

650
00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:05,339
that even if it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> verified and the</font>

651
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:09,598
<font color="#CCCCCC">identity so yeah you with that so if we</font>

652
00:37:05,339 --> 00:37:12,450
now send another message actually I<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

653
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:16,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">just send some message task it should</font>

654
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:20,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">also our men</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in miniature will replay</font>

655
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:23,249
message you see here the message was

656
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:26,279
replayed actually to never repaid

657
00:37:23,249 --> 00:37:29,749
message that was not that percent in the

658
00:37:26,279 --> 00:37:33,410
first place<font color="#CCCCCC"> would work with plate and</font>

659
00:37:29,749 --> 00:37:33,410
insert it into the conversation

660
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:47,190
yes so that I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably most</font>

661
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:52,290
interesting thing because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

662
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:55,290
protocol attack maybe it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just some</font>

663
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:57,090
laughing<font color="#E5E5E5"> some quirk it's also not really</font>

664
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:58,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">runner ability was an interesting things</font>

665
00:37:57,090 --> 00:38:02,340
or maybe someone has an idea about that

666
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:04,680
and when you receive an audio file /

667
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:08,300
signal on Android it will actually open

668
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:11,910
a web server on localhost HTTP server

669
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:14,040
and like unencrypted stream stream the

670
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:16,770
audio files to the media play on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android</font>

671
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:19,200
we will connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to local all some random</font>

672
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:21,830
port with a random URI and will stream

673
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:24,810
that unencrypted to to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing and</font>

674
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:29,640
the URI is really random so we couldn't

675
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:31,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">guess it but get the reef feel right so</font>

676
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:33,750
if you have any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information</font>

677
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:35,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">about our information these or your</font>

678
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:38,400
random number generator is broken you

679
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:41,430
actually can intercept or get to the

680
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:47,520
audio attentions from other apps yeah

681
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:49,319
which is interesting through so now you

682
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,810
can also have other attachments we

683
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:55,340
didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at that but</font>

684
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:55,340
interesting point<font color="#E5E5E5"> of for future research</font>

685
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:03,780
yes so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually quite quite</font>

686
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:06,930
interesting so maybe to come to an amp

687
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:10,470
so sickly has a huge code<font color="#E5E5E5"> page it's</font>

688
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:13,200
largely<font color="#E5E5E5"> and under any life so we did not</font>

689
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:15,959
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> audit we just pump come back so</font>

690
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,669
it's not complete we do tend our free

691
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:22,440
time because we were interested in

692
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:24,630
between signal and we would expect a lot

693
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:27,180
more boxes somebody would really do a

694
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:30,870
very thorough audit of steps I guess so

695
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:32,970
so that protocol stuff and yet actually

696
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:35,190
the general point 12 races actually that

697
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:36,419
the secure messengers are not secure if

698
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:38,790
they are based on all these components

699
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:42,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">and they have no not mitigations no</font>

700
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:46,350
isolation or sandboxing no nothing dead

701
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:48,390
and so one bucket<font color="#E5E5E5"> to not currently and</font>

702
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:51,450
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually think one of the main</font>

703
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:55,098
points not about studio signal and surf

704
00:39:51,450 --> 00:40:06,598
but of all the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> things also</font>

705
00:39:55,099 --> 00:40:17,520
yeah thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you thank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much any</font>

706
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:21,030
questions from the floor it depends on

707
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:25,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">the scenario you are using it for so</font>

708
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:27,960
classic object thingy depends<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean if</font>

709
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:31,680
you're if you're afraid of an tackle it

710
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:34,890
has this using zero days to get you

711
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:37,589
you're not safe probably for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the average</font>

712
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:44,640
person I would say it's not more unsafe

713
00:40:37,589 --> 00:40:48,210
than other messengers<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

714
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:51,390
I said that the message headers were not

715
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:55,500
validated lamb what would<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen if i</font>

716
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:58,828
send a message if I obsession with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

717
00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:00,270
recipient the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I send message with the</font>

718
00:40:58,829 --> 00:41:02,460
header of someone else will it show up

719
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:07,190
in his application as though the other

720
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:07,190
one sending I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> because it's like</font>

721
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:12,960
there's auto registration ID and the

722
00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:16,259
session<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like fix to this</font>

723
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,880
communication party as far as I know so

724
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:22,609
it should not have a method for someone

725
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:22,609
else because the keys were one match so

726
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:29,880
for audiophiles was there any indication

727
00:41:26,369 --> 00:41:31,950
why was streaming from a HTTP server on

728
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:35,099
localhost rather than a local media

729
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:38,790
player or any better more logical method

730
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:40,859
I don't know no that's why I put it up

731
