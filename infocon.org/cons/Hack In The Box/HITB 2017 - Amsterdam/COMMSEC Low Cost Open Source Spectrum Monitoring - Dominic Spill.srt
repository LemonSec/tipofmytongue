00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:14,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">stomach still thank you very much for</font>

2
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,970
the introduction I that's exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

3
00:00:14,959 --> 00:00:22,279
I've come<font color="#E5E5E5"> here to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about is open</font>

4
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:24,380
source spectrum monitoring I work<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a</font>

5
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:27,890
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> called grateful gadgets so this</font>

6
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:31,160
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> me in case one can't see my face this</font>

7
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:34,280
is what I look like I work on open

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,750
source hardware and software I mostly

9
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,019
work on things like uber tooth which

10
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:40,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">serve Bluetooth sniffing tool great set</font>

11
00:00:39,019 --> 00:00:44,149
which the Hubble hacking tool were

12
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:45,739
working on a moment and hacker s which

13
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:47,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the software defined radio peripheral</font>

14
00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:49,038
that I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> many of you have heard of</font>

15
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:52,010
and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> they may have mentioned in</font>

16
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,840
the previous talk but I'm not sure and I

17
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:56,358
wrote a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little site called FCC i/o which</font>

18
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,309
is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> colored in this in this slide</font>

19
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:01,399
deck tool but is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I might</font>

20
00:00:58,309 --> 00:01:02,599
try mention it once or twice about open

21
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:05,330
source intelligence when it comes to

22
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,610
radio devices so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some of the</font>

23
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:09,649
products we make and specifically today

24
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:12,259
I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be using hacker f which is</font>

25
00:01:09,649 --> 00:01:16,250
this big one in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle it's a</font>

26
00:01:12,259 --> 00:01:19,310
software-defined radio it has a kind of

27
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:21,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">one megahertz 26 gigahertz tuning range</font>

28
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:23,840
it grabs 20 megahertz of bandwidth and

29
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,670
it's all open source including the

30
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,860
hardware<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the firmware and what we're</font>

31
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:29,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here is we've written some</font>

32
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,439
custom firmware to do some interesting

33
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:36,020
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can go and play with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

34
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:39,139
what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> spectrum monitoring well as as</font>

35
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:40,670
the interruption said you someone plants

36
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,200
the device within your organization you

37
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,430
want to be able to look for<font color="#CCCCCC"> anyone be</font>

38
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,710
able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it you want to know it's</font>

39
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:47,899
there you won't have a real really good

40
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:49,908
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of whether or not those devices</font>

41
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:53,930
have been put there what are people in

42
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:55,369
your organization bringing in sometimes

43
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:58,579
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to specifically locate them</font>

44
00:01:55,369 --> 00:02:01,640
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not necessarily the the direct</font>

45
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:03,460
theme of this today that is suddenly

46
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:07,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">possible using some of these techniques</font>

47
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:09,649
and what we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is monitor the</font>

48
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:11,540
spectrum around us for new and different

49
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:13,730
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> now if you working environment</font>

your Wi-Fi

56

so are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you doing anything to monitor the</font>

57
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,980
fact that someone might bring in a

<font color="#E5E5E5">over unlicensed 900 megahertz or four</font>

60
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:36,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">three three</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bands do you know if people</font>

62
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:40,239
whether you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> even know if someone</font>

63
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:42,490
did that and and brought that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

64
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:47,660
capability into your<font color="#CCCCCC"> organization and</font>

65
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:48,950
potentially do you care<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I mean the</font>

66
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">people who should care are large</font>

67
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:53,839
organizations it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> part of</font>

68
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:58,700
monitoring your your perimeter

69
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:00,170
monitoring your security it's there are

70
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:03,619
all there are companies that will show

71
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:06,920
you solutions to do this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not a</font>

72
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:09,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">brand new concept or anything in fact</font>

73
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">the previous speakers work for bastille</font>

74
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:13,820
and i believe that's part of their

75
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,459
offering and you know they there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

76
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,570
sorts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different ways to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do this what</font>

77
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:20,420
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at now is some of the</font>

78
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:21,620
available tools to go and look at the

79
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:25,549
spectrum around you and your

80
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:27,320
organization we use it specifically for

81
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:30,110
reverse engineering within great scope

82
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:32,060
gadgets we like doing once reverse

83
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:34,670
engineering and hardware hack radio

84
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:37,910
hacking and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll pick up a device</font>

85
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:39,649
and we'll we'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this little piece</font>

86
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:41,390
of IOT gear in front of us and we'll

87
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:43,370
switch it on and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then the first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

88
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:45,798
is well what protocols are talking

89
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:48,500
what's at communicating over and you can

90
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:52,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">not always trust the box I mean we have</font>

91
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:55,130
seen while<font color="#E5E5E5"> at Electric skateboards that</font>

92
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,048
had a controller and the controller had

93
00:03:55,130 --> 00:04:00,500
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> switcher note that said Bluetooth and</font>

94
00:03:57,049 --> 00:04:02,120
Wi-Fi and when you switched<font color="#E5E5E5"> it into the</font>

95
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,040
bluetooth mode it was definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

96
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bluetooth when switching</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the Wi-Fi</font>

97
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:09,230
mode it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bluetooth and the bluetooth</font>

98
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:13,190
mobile some proprietary 2.4 gigahertz

99
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:15,470
and we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> no idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a rich</font>

100
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:16,430
o'healey and my crimes work from a

101
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:20,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple of years ago they did a great</font>

102
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:22,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">desk on talk on it but they they were</font>

103
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:24,919
baffled by this for a short time before

104
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,330
they pulled<font color="#E5E5E5"> out a hacker s and started</font>

105
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:28,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at the spectrum and saying well</font>

106
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:29,900
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is probably 2.4 gigahertz if</font>

107
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,030
they've claimed to be Wi-Fi and

108
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bluetooth so maybe we look there and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

109
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,770
seen

110
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:36,299
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can switch back at them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> forwards</font>

111
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:38,310
and it's definitely something going on

112
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:41,220
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then they might cry and looks at the</font>

113
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:42,600
screen that looks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> bluetooth and so</font>

114
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,000
then he<font color="#CCCCCC"> was able to start decoding it</font>

115
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:48,330
and things like that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the fact</font>

116
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">that Mike had my crown had the ability</font>

117
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:53,039
to look at the screen and visually

118
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:55,530
identify<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bluetooth from a from an FFT</font>

119
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,870
which is pretty much what I'm going to

120
00:04:55,530 --> 00:05:00,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">show you today that i also have that</font>

121
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:02,190
ability but hopefully we're moving

122
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,229
towards a place<font color="#E5E5E5"> where other people have</font>

123
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:07,350
the ability or automated tools<font color="#CCCCCC"> too and</font>

124
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:09,960
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the the focus of where we</font>

125
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:14,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to get to starting from from this</font>

126
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:16,919
baseline so the other people are right

127
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:18,180
the bottom here<font color="#E5E5E5"> are radio operators if</font>

128
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,250
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick show of hands anyone got</font>

129
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:24,030
there amateur radio license in their

130
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:25,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">room so handful of people ok so I'm</font>

131
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:27,630
reliably informed that if you start

132
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:30,900
transmitting on a on a channel<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

133
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:32,190
shouldn't be the amateur radio operators

134
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,380
will be the first people to track you

135
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:36,060
down significantly before the FCC or

136
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:39,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ofcom or whoever your governing body is</font>

137
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:42,510
amateur radio operators are fantastic at

138
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:43,860
finding interferers quickly and they get

139
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:46,140
it i think they get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> kick out this kind</font>

140
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">of ability to monitor wide bands of</font>

141
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:49,229
spectrum because they can look at who is

142
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:50,880
transmitting and maybe whether or not

143
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:54,390
they should be transmitting and are

144
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:58,140
baying the rules so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way we're going</font>

145
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:59,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do this is really three steps we're</font>

146
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,650
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a software-defined radio</font>

147
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,739
we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to perform an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> FFT and then</font>

148
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:08,549
we're going to plot the output of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ifft</font>

149
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:10,680
this is not particularly new<font color="#CCCCCC"> RTL has</font>

150
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,990
anyone got one of these ltrs dr dongles

151
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,060
the little TV tuners excellent there's a

152
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:17,040
tool called RTL power which will pretty

153
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,690
much do this for you you combine that

154
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:21,090
with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> python script called heat map and</font>

155
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:25,680
it generates images for you that show

156
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:30,630
you a broad kind of sweep of spectrum

157
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:32,970
and where the power is and and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said</font>

158
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:34,200
previously this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a new audio power and</font>

159
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:36,960
heat map which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show you in a second</font>

160
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:40,890
but also this is sat map by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Adam</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Laurie</font>

161
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:43,109
now what Adam did for this was he had a

162
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:44,529
steerable satellite dish mounted on the

163
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:49,269
roof of building

164
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:52,329
and he tuned he he steered the dish

165
00:06:49,269 --> 00:06:54,279
slightly tuned the full sweep of the

166
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:55,599
frequency range of<font color="#E5E5E5"> his receiver looking</font>

167
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:57,999
for power and then tune the dish

168
00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:01,479
slightly again so this this plot at the

169
00:06:57,999 --> 00:07:04,749
bottom of the screen here is west to

170
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:07,719
east to New across the sky and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

171
00:07:04,749 --> 00:07:11,499

173
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:15,939
supply rental I believe and so he looked

174
00:07:14,679 --> 00:07:18,998
for where there was power on there and

175
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:21,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">then he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> made this map of the sky which</font>

00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:32,199

181
00:07:30,729 --> 00:07:34,089
they're probably your communication

communicate on that on that frequency so

190
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,009
someone with money is communicating by

191
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:55,179
their own satellite because they don't

192
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:56,799
wanna use existing communications

193

turn them off before a platoon image but

00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:17,259
this is a scan of what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

spits out an image and this gives you a

to be small devices there's a fair

the the hotel staff came into my room to

242
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:59,800
is wrote our own custom firmware for it

we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right modified firmware for it</font>

245
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:11,040
that sweeps and does that retuning in

somewhere so<font color="#CCCCCC"> retuns takes a sample</font>

00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:17,530
and dumps all these back to the host and

249
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:20,080
this means we don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the round-trip</font>

we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that latency so we can</font>

252
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:26,710
retune much more quickly and in fact we

253
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:28,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">were able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use a modified</font>

254
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:31,030
version of heat map because heat map

255
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,730
assumes that when sweeping from the left

256
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:36,160
to the right of your frequency range it

257
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:38,800
can use time stamps or with a

258
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,600
granularity of one second and we're able

259
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,219
to sweep our frequency range which is

260
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,890
there an accursed of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 gigahertz in</font>

261
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:49,240
about point<font color="#E5E5E5"> 75 of a second so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we need</font>

263
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:54,520

285
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:56,349
about power here we still have some

00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:59,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting things down here this is</font>

287
00:11:56,349 --> 00:12:02,229
very spotty which you cannot see unless

288
00:11:59,589 --> 00:12:03,519
you're as close as I am but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have so</font>

289
00:12:02,229 --> 00:12:07,839
much data you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get in there and</font>

290
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:09,729
look at it so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to receive six</font>

00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:22,029
lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> information to play with but</font>

296
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:23,499
it's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting more</font>

297
00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:27,159
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> potentially to look at this</font>

298
00:12:23,499 --> 00:12:29,139
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> in real time like we I took that</font>

then<font color="#CCCCCC"> spend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest of the day trying to</font>

301
00:12:31,479 --> 00:12:35,499
coax heat map into producing an image

302
00:12:33,309 --> 00:12:38,858
from it which I clearly failed to do at

303
00:12:35,499 --> 00:12:39,789
reasonable power levels turns out it's

304
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:42,689
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> important that you remember</font>

305
00:12:39,789 --> 00:12:44,889
decimals are often negative because

306
00:12:42,689 --> 00:12:48,039
otherwise if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think they're positive</font>

307
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:51,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">everything's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out of range so what I'm</font>

308
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:56,319
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> show you now is a cue spectrum</font>

309
00:12:51,609 --> 00:13:00,220
analyzer which should show up excellent

310
00:12:56,319 --> 00:13:03,659
and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go into my settings and use</font>

311
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:05,619
hacker of sweet 20 megahertz that's fine

312
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:09,129
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spin from one</font>

313
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:10,499
megahertz 26 gigahertz and hopefully

314
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:16,949
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> give us some output on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the screen</font>

315
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:16,949
well that is it's not great is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I</font>

316
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:26,049
was hoping we'd see something will spike

317
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:29,319
you there but essentially this is giving

318
00:13:26,049 --> 00:13:30,909
us real time data I screwed something up

319
00:13:29,319 --> 00:13:34,659
slightly with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Whaley's FFTs</font>

320
00:13:30,909 --> 00:13:36,850
calculated but this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this should be</font>

321
00:13:34,659 --> 00:13:40,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">showing us real time data for that sweet</font>

322
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:44,109
and every line on this waterfall is a

323
00:13:40,509 --> 00:13:46,869
sweep and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting it about just</font>

324
00:13:44,109 --> 00:13:48,549
shy of once a second and so we can start

325
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:49,989
to pick out things in<font color="#E5E5E5"> real time and see</font>

326
00:13:48,549 --> 00:13:51,970
when they're actually transmitting and

327
00:13:49,989 --> 00:13:55,689
and when they're not and it'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be great</font>

328
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:58,149
if this data look good so I'm clearly

329
00:13:55,689 --> 00:13:59,469
not doing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> FFC properly but that's</font>

330
00:13:58,149 --> 00:14:00,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay because hopefully I'm going to be</font>

331
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:03,869
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show another version of the same</font>

332
00:14:00,669 --> 00:14:10,449
thing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clear this is that original</font>

333
00:14:03,869 --> 00:14:16,600
image and we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> zoom way in way in now</font>

334
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:18,969
we go on<font color="#E5E5E5"> because well let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it let down by</font>

335
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:23,499
my tools which obviously is my fault but

336
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:24,579
ok so that's fine q spectrum analyzer is

337
00:14:23,499 --> 00:14:27,129
actually a relatively good way of

338
00:14:24,579 --> 00:14:30,849
looking at this but as it turns out I

339
00:14:27,129 --> 00:14:33,879
can't work it but it might also be

340
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:35,649
interesting to do to use some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

341
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:37,209
tools were used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if anyone's played</font>

342
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:39,549
with software if I'm radio before you

343
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:42,089
probably used a new radio can already a

344
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:43,929
companion you're used to various

345
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:45,699
visualization tools but that are in

346
00:14:43,929 --> 00:14:49,539
there and it might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice to get data</font>

347
00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:50,978
into those and previously what we did we

348
00:14:49,539 --> 00:14:53,829
change your<font color="#E5E5E5"> frequency took some samples</font>

349
00:14:50,979 --> 00:14:55,359
before performs an<font color="#E5E5E5"> FFT which gave us</font>

350
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:58,238
that frequency to power nap that we

351
00:14:55,359 --> 00:15:00,970
could we could plot now the FFT is a

352
00:14:58,239 --> 00:15:03,669
reversible function so we can convert

353
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:05,889
the output of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that power nap back into</font>

354
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:09,039
samples the question is why would we

355
00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:11,829
want to do this when you're receiving

356
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:14,319
radio you bring the radio that you're

357
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:18,008
receiving down to base bands<font color="#E5E5E5"> perform the</font>

358
00:15:14,319 --> 00:15:19,569
FFT and get a series of power values but

359
00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:23,049
what we've got six speakers wide of

360
00:15:19,569 --> 00:15:25,059
radio<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we get lots of small bursts of</font>

361
00:15:23,049 --> 00:15:28,120
samples that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've got down at baseband</font>

362
00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:31,209
so what the inverse fft lets us do is

363
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:33,520
take those SATs and put them next to

364
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:35,620
each other as if we have a six<font color="#E5E5E5"> gig</font>

365
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:37,720
earth-wide<font color="#CCCCCC"> FFT and then we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run the</font>

366
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:40,210
inverse SSD and instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of running it on</font>

367
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,730
small chunks of data lots of times we

368
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:46,240
run it on one big piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of data once and</font>

369
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:50,920
we get back data that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> six gigahertz</font>

370
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:53,680
wide everyone with me so far if anyone

371
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:55,150
with me so far yeah vaguely there are

372
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,250
some there are some hands up in the

373
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:58,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">front from people who are slightly</font>

374
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:04,420
unsure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I know what I'm talking</font>

375
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:10,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">about but this allows us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to view the</font>

376
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:12,459
data in me there we go in some of the

377
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:14,050
tools that we we already know you

378
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:15,460
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> know and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> love so it takes a</font>

379
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:17,020
little while to pre calculate some

380
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:20,080
things we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set up some buffers</font>

381
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:23,890
for the inverse fft hopefully as we

382
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:25,839
didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> just die so it takes it takes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

383
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:27,250
little while to just start<font color="#E5E5E5"> this up you</font>

384
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,860
can't particularly see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just typed</font>

385
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:32,560
but here we<font color="#CCCCCC"> go and so what we should be</font>

386
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:36,279
able to see now is this is again doing

387
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:38,319
the same thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's sweeping over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 6</font>

388
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:42,630
gigahertz wide and it's performing an

389
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:45,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">fft over every 500 kilohertz and then</font>

390
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:47,050
plotting that the using gr<font color="#E5E5E5"> foster so</font>

391
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:48,279
you'll probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> be used to this if</font>

392
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:50,170
you've used software defined radio in

393
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:53,230
the past couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of years to look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

394
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:54,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">signals this will show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you this is very</font>

395
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:58,240
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> at showing you transient signals</font>

396
00:16:54,700 --> 00:17:00,250
and we can see the 2.4 gigahertz section

397
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,470
again again late with looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> stix</font>

398
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:06,160
gigahertz wide here we've got the zero

399
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:07,990
point in the middle so negative<font color="#CCCCCC"> nor</font>

400
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:12,400
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6 that's the 2.4 gigahertz</font>

401
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:14,829
spectrum and various other things down

402
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:18,189
here we're pretty close<font color="#CCCCCC"> to DC</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we get</font>

403
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:20,139
a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of distortion and we'll see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

404
00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:23,130
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure what's that negative two point</font>

405
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:26,189
for any suggestions<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the front row</font>

406
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:28,809
what's down it what is that negative

407
00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:30,010
that's about 900 megahertz I guess so

408
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:31,000
it's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> where that's like if I</font>

409
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,890
have no idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> what around me is</font>

410
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,210
transmitting 900 megahertz potentially

411
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:40,170
the microphone and so we're able to view

412
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:41,299
the data that we had captured as

413
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:44,389
disparate

414
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:47,450
wyd sweeps in kind of almost real time

415
00:17:44,389 --> 00:17:51,219
in in tools we know and were able to

416
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:55,460
identify transient signals this way so

417
00:17:51,220 --> 00:18:04,940
if i run the same thing again but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

418
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:13,879
limit my frequency range say my sample

419
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:16,009
rate is 200 megahertz why now this is

420
00:18:13,879 --> 00:18:19,248
the 2.4 gigahertz band and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's sweeping</font>

421
00:18:16,009 --> 00:18:20,480
the whole thing in<font color="#E5E5E5"> much significantly</font>

422
00:18:19,249 --> 00:18:22,220
quicker than<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because they only have</font>

423
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,230
to do five hops to get the whole thing

424
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:26,690
at 20 megahertz chunk so you can see

425
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:28,009
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are two large Wi-Fi networks going</font>

426
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:30,289
on there's a third which is kind of

427
00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:34,700
quieter if I pull out my phone hopefully

428
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:36,679
I should be able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> fire up bluetooth</font>

429
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:38,450
and have it scan and you'll see it

430
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:40,039
suddenly spits data all over the

431
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,330
spectrum but the interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing here</font>

432
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:43,730
is we're getting the vast majority of

433
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:45,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">that data as opposed to generally just</font>

434
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:47,450
pointing out a chunk of the 2.4

435
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,759
gigahertz band and seeing what comes in

436
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:51,799
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting these these broad packets</font>

437
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:54,080
all over the place so you can tell quite

438
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:56,090
how much to see very<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to see on</font>

439
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,299
the screen with the lights on where you

440
00:18:56,090 --> 00:19:00,889
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the red line up at the top here you</font>

441
00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:02,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">can see those those very transient</font>

442
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:04,369
spikes are showing up and they should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

443
00:19:02,929 --> 00:19:09,019
showing<font color="#E5E5E5"> up in the waterfall as well and</font>

444
00:19:04,369 --> 00:19:10,428
they are very short bluetooth packets

445
00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:12,919
where it's searching for another device

446
00:19:10,429 --> 00:19:14,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">when my phone is trying to connect to I</font>

447
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:19,009
don't know a speaker or something that

448
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:21,769
it's seen before and so it's able to it

449
00:19:19,009 --> 00:19:22,850
puts those across<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole bandwidth so</font>

450
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:26,929
you can see them in the waterfall now

451
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:28,369
and i've restarted the scam can anyone

452
00:19:26,929 --> 00:19:30,379
actually see that was it completely

453
00:19:28,369 --> 00:19:32,090
washed<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok i'm struggling from this angle</font>

455
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:39,619
is not helpful to you so for those those

456
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:40,940
bursts are very quick and they're

457
00:19:39,619 --> 00:19:43,340
transient unless you're looking in the

458
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:46,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">right place I mean 10 years ago when I</font>

the time eight megahertz wide chunk of

it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> strolled past at some point</font>

over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> place so it's probably not such</font>

470
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:11,559
a big deal but last year we were trying

471
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:13,460
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reverse engineer some little wireless</font>

472
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:17,720
quadcopters that were 2.4 gigahertz

473
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:20,990
transmitters and they claimed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be 2.4</font>

474
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:22,520
gigahertz frequency hopping and we were

475
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,809
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use techniques like this to go</font>

476
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,129
and look at the whole band and work out

477
00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:27,290
where they will hop into and which

478
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:28,850
channels they were on them and some so

479
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:31,610
forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we're able to monitor a</font>

480
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:34,820
much wider section of a band and so for

481
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:37,040
this if you're in charge of looking at

482
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:38,960
the radio transmissions around an

483
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,550
organization if you're concerned about

484
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,070
people bringing in 2.4 gigahertz

485
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:45,409
transmitters but uh you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know IOT devices</font>

486
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:47,120
devices that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not supposed to be</font>

487
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,679
bringing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in you can monitor this and you</font>

488
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,719
know that these are your two<font color="#E5E5E5"> valleys</font>

489
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:52,700
Wi-Fi networks so if a<font color="#E5E5E5"> third one pops up</font>

490
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,850
somewhere you might have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> all star</font>

491
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:57,800
asking questions if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see things just</font>

492
00:20:55,850 --> 00:21:01,428
a narrowband transmitter at one point in

493
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:03,139
the in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the frequency range at some point</font>

494
00:21:01,429 --> 00:21:05,630
you know there's a fair chance that that

495
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:07,520
is not it's not Wi-Fi<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not bluetooth</font>

496
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:08,690
so it's possibly some other 2.4

497
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,520
gigahertz transmitter that someone's

498
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:12,140
brought into your<font color="#CCCCCC"> organization and like</font>

499
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,760
maybe it's someone bringing in a little

500
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:16,280
quadcopters play with or<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe at</font>

501
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:20,720
someone exit rating all your company's

502
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:24,440
data but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd want to know which so that</font>

503
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,240
is inverse<font color="#E5E5E5"> FFTs and that's pretty close</font>

504
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:32,090
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end of end of what I actually</font>

505
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:37,100
have to show oh yeah let's try looking

506
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:39,530
at that in in spectrum so there's a

507
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:41,389
slight problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> within spectrum and doing</font>

508
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:45,290
this technique which is in spectrum

509
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:47,570
doesn't support great and 32 bits of

510
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:49,879
frequency range so i have to lie to it

511
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:53,240
and claim that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm a much narrower</font>

512
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:54,740
signal than I am because<font color="#E5E5E5"> otherwise it</font>

513
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,590
doesn't understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 gigahertz of</font>

514
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:59,210
bandwidth this is the widescan that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

515
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:01,790
showed you earlier this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is part of the</font>

516
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:03,620
one a subset of the really wide<font color="#E5E5E5"> swipe</font>

517
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:05,090
sweet familiar so you can see my power

518
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,949
levels are kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of off a little bit but</font>

519
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:08,379
again we can go in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can look at</font>

520
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:11,830
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

521
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:14,560
these packets and you can see there's

522
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:17,470
something transmitting here which is

523
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:19,120
very spotty<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see a reflected</font>

524
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:23,950
image here which is probably an alias of

525
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:27,270
the same thing and hopefully I should

526
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:27,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">got to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> zoom in on some of these things</font>

527
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:38,670
it's really hoping<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to see</font>

528
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:41,530
more detail on these but apparently not

529
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:43,830
so in some<font color="#CCCCCC"> cases what you'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to</font>

530
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:47,320
do is use in spectrum to go and look at

531
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:53,260
and visually identify things like the

532
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:58,090
modulation on these things like try and

533
00:22:53,260 --> 00:23:01,180
alta my power level so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a</font>

534
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:03,399
working demo I'm sorry about that I was

535
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:06,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">really hoping it would be so sometimes</font>

536
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:09,190
you're able to visually from this look

537
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:10,600
at an image and in in spectrum and you

538
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:13,060
can actually look at something you<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

539
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,290
hey it's on this frequency and I see

540
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:16,389
it's on this frequency and the one next

541
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:18,420
like you know it's switching between the

542
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:20,830
two it's probably frequency shift keying

543
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:23,530
if you see that it's a fairly dense

544
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:25,330
block of power across a wide band of

545
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:27,940
frequencies it's quite possibly

546
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:31,389
something like OFDM that that just

547
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:33,280
dumped a fairly solid like well edge

548
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:36,280
flock of power across a number of

549
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,780
frequencies let me try a different file

550
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:40,060
and see if we get any better luck

551
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:43,690
otherwise I will go<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to wrapping up</font>

552
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:49,210
now that looks basically the same

553
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:53,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it this is the 2.4 gigahertz</font>

554
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:55,210
spectrum earlier today and the problem

555
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:59,950
with doing 2.4 gigahertz that hacker con

556
00:23:55,210 --> 00:24:02,470
is it's basically all power so I mean if

557
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:04,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">everyone could have just agreed to turn</font>

558
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:05,320
off all of their devices earlier today

559
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:07,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">for half an hour it would have been</font>

560
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,290
great but sadly I don't think I'm going

561
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:11,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to show this an inspector</font>

562
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:12,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">improperly but maybe I will try and</font>

563
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:17,740
capture a file in my hotel room later

564
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:21,250
and show its people offline<font color="#E5E5E5"> tomorrow so</font>

565
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:23,970
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea there is is we can</font>

566
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:27,280
pick out we can visually pick out

567
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:29,200
packets and data transmission types and

568
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:31,420
look at what kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of radios might be</font>

569
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,850
transmitting and you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fairly</font>

570
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:35,410
good idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> for what's transmitting what</font>

571
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:37,600
type of device it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is from the type</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

572
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:39,070
radio connection it uses quite often and

573
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:43,330
there's a lot a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> low-power</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

574
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:45,790
that were used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> FSK in my FM bands if</font>

575
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:48,879
you go and look at the appropriate bands

576
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:52,690
you'll see things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like gsm and so on so</font>

577
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:54,880
forth so we'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to what basically</font>

578
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:57,430
what they say this presentation is about

579
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,140
is trying to show which tools exist and

580
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:00,190
where we'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take them next so</font>

581
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:02,620
that's what I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about just</font>

582
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:07,630
another minute or two which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we would</font>

583
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:09,879
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to have the capture</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

584
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:11,980
the visualization analysis all-in-one

585
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:15,210
tool we'd like to build an<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source</font>

586
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:17,590
tool preferably that will allow us to

587
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:20,320
receive that<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed agree but gigahertz</font>

588
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:23,110
of bandwidth and then when we want to

589
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:26,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">drill down into you know we identify a</font>

590
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:29,110
signal that looks interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> or or or</font>

591
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:30,580
novels<font color="#E5E5E5"> or different and we can drill</font>

592
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:32,169
down into it and go and go and take a

593
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:35,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of modulation is are</font>

594
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:37,210
using let's do do a spectrum plot to see

595
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:39,610
if we can tell what<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of modulation</font>

596
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:42,040
is using let's try and decode it in some

597
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:44,590
way let's try and take a capture and

598
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:46,389
dump it out to to something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like in</font>

599
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:48,639
spectrum where we can start<font color="#E5E5E5"> playing</font>

600
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:51,490
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> with processing air filtering it</font>

601
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,690
demodulating<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's on so forth the other</font>

602
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:54,460
thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've recently been</font>

603
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:56,020
experimenting<font color="#CCCCCC"> with an antenna switching</font>

604
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:58,630
board for<font color="#E5E5E5"> hack RF that will allow us to</font>

605
00:25:56,020 --> 00:26:00,550
switch up to four antennas on the front

606
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:01,990
end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it from again from the firmware</font>

607
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:04,629
which means we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to perform</font>

608
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:07,390
pseudo Doppler experiments with the

609
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:09,970
using that the same sort of techniques

610
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:12,630
and if we're able to synchronize the

611
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:14,830
switching of the antennas with the

612
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:16,530
dumping of bird the buffers back to the

613
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:18,639
host will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to perform</font>

614
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:20,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">direction-finding at the same time as</font>

615
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">switching that whole band so while you'd</font>

616
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:26,170
lose some performance across the band

617
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:28,899
you'd be able to gain some information

618
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:30,580
about the direction of the signal so

619
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:33,260
that is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not to do this there</font>

620
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:34,639
are three of those boards at the moment

621
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:36,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">once in Scotland the ones in South</font>

Africa<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the other ones on my desk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

623
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:43,990
all three of us need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get on with</font>

624
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:46,389
doing some work with them so I thank

00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:48,830
everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> grayscale gadgets who</font>

626
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:51,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">unfortunately I told about the stream so</font>

627
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:54,350
they're watching now but thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mike</font>

628
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:57,710
taylor and Liz but also<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mike Walters who</font>

629
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:59,780
is who originally came up with some of

630
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:01,610
the concept for hack RF sweep he had a

631
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:03,830
really cool project in math camp last

632
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:07,100
year where he plotted the six gigahertz

633
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:08,870
of bandwidth using UV lasers on a piece

634
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:11,149
of glow in the dark material so you got

635
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:13,100
that onion skin fading effect naturally

636
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:16,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">as the it responded to the UV light</font>

637
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:17,929
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of cool and so thank you</font>

638
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:20,300
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> him thank you till his hard work and</font>

639
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:22,280
Mike everyone else these are probably

640
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:25,100
the two most interesting URLs for this

641
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:27,230
one is a caress where r firmware changes

642
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:30,350
are and all that sort of thing the other

643
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:31,640
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> q spectrum analyzer which does</font>

644
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:33,260
actually give you a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting</font>

645
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,790
view of the spectrum I've clearly

646
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:36,050
misconfigured mine at some point while

647
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:39,350
experimenting over the past couple of

648
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:41,780
days but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> either of those if</font>

649
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:42,980
you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use heat map with a craft</font>

650
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:45,230
sweep at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the moment you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use a</font>

651
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:46,610
modified version that we built<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we're</font>

652
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:49,550
hoping<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that pull request pushed</font>

653
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:50,810
up screen this week and I will<font color="#CCCCCC"> take any</font>

654
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:59,540
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I have two minutes</font>

655
00:27:50,810 --> 00:28:01,760
left so you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be heat map so the</font>

656
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:04,280
spectrum for using the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RDA list</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

657
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:09,230
right there was a gap in between is it

658
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:11,120
due to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rd list years having a</font>

659
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:14,000
gap in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> frequency range or reciprocal</font>

660
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:16,370
so far I mean this is yeah this is a

661
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,550
really you mean this section here yeah

662
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:21,439
it's it's a really big patch to not have

663
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:23,120
anything in it I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> admit there are a</font>

664
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,910
couple of little little things in it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

665
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:28,030
honestly<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I took the</font>

666
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:30,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">RTL SDR out of the packet this morning</font>

667
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:33,100
for the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> time so I have no idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

668
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:35,390
this one has gaps in its frequency range

669
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:40,030
that are causing that problem but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

670
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:40,030
suspect<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's quite a quite band as it is</font>

671
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:43,880
can anyone think of anything is doing

672
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:45,600
one gigahertz and one point for that I

673
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:49,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">would see in this hotel</font>

674
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:52,980
front row I'm looking at you no no it

675
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:54,120
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> just be quiet but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it there is</font>

676
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:58,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">definitely if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you get up close</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to it</font>

677
00:28:54,120 --> 00:29:00,299
some some transmissions in there so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

678
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:02,340
not entirely sure whether the gaps in

679
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:03,960
and receive are on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this radio or if</font>

680
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:10,889
there are any so i can tell you I'm

681
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:11,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">sorry Thanks yeah mark I I'm just</font>

682
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:14,789
curious when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hack are at this</font>

683
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:16,949
sweeping like what's the like the duty

684
00:29:14,789 --> 00:29:19,440
cycle that<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone given frequency that</font>

685
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:23,640
it would it would see so so what we do

686
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:26,429
is most of the we can increase<font color="#CCCCCC"> the duty</font>

687
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:29,640
cycle based on on how much data<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

688
00:29:26,429 --> 00:29:32,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">capture but but reasonably what we do is</font>

689
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:37,950
we tuned to a frequency we we're pulling

690
00:29:32,429 --> 00:29:40,620
pulling back data are 20 meg with 40

691
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:42,240
megahertz let me try that again we're

692
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:46,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">pulling about data at 480 megabits</font>

693
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:49,380
normally and that is made up of 16 k

694
00:29:46,169 --> 00:29:51,960
buses so if you can do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> maps to work</font>

695
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:54,990
out how long a buffer lost what we do is

696
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:58,049
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> tune we wait for two buffers in</font>

697
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:59,669
length which is a very short<font color="#CCCCCC"> time in</font>

698
00:29:58,049 --> 00:30:01,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">order to allow the tuning to settle and</font>

699
00:29:59,669 --> 00:30:03,659
then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just capture one buffer and</font>

700
00:30:01,289 --> 00:30:05,340
we're literally operating on the last n

701
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:08,610
number of samples of that buffer and

702
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:14,129
that buffer is the N in that case is the

703
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:15,870
width of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> FFT thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so it's</font>

704
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:18,600
no more question that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would like to</font>

705
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:21,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">close the comsec for today thank you all</font>
