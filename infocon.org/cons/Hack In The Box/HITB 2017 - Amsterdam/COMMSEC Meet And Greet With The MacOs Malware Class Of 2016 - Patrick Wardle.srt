1
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:14,130
awesome<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so yeah let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">Mac Valor from 2016</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got a lot of stuff</font>

3
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,810
so I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just dive right in as</font>

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,730
Patrick mentioned my name is also

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">Patrick and as he also mentioned as well</font>

6
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,230
I've worked at a variety of acronyms

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,960
places the currently the chief security

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,489
researcher at sabacc so briefly<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cenac</font>

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,869
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> crowd-sourced vulnerability</font>

10
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:32,669
discovery with vetted security

11
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:34,680
researchers we basically have this

12
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:37,169
external team of hackers freelancers

13
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,390
researchers that find lots of bugs and

14
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,699
our customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> IOT devices</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Network</font>

15
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,890
endpoints and mobile apps so if you're

16
00:00:41,699 --> 00:00:46,649
interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in basically getting fine</font>

17
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:50,399
paid to find pretty easy vulnerabilities

18
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:52,559
check out<font color="#CCCCCC"> sanadka calm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so again</font>

19
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm going to talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Mac Bauer</font>

20
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:58,019
from 2016 and just as a side note all

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,398
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> samples or specimens I mentioned in</font>

22
00:00:58,019 --> 00:01:01,320
this talk can be downloaded from

23
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,579
objective-c<font color="#CCCCCC"> com so if you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interested</font>

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">in playing around with some of these</font>

25
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:07,800
specimens we want to follow along check

26
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:10,530
those out<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for each sample</font>

27
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,929
we'll start by talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

28
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,300
infection vector that is how<font color="#CCCCCC"> does it get</font>

29
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,130
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> to end users machines and we'll see</font>

30
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:19,200
that most of these actually require some

31
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,850
sort of user interaction so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user has</font>

32
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be tricked into clicking a fake</font>

33
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:26,640
pop-up or perhaps on an email attachment

34
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,810
of course the more<font color="#CCCCCC"> sophisticated or</font>

35
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,960
advanced hackers are going to be using

36
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:33,330
exploits maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero days but luckily</font>

37
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,030
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mac malware at least that publicly</font>

38
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:39,420
been discovered recently doesn't use

39
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:41,700
such advanced techniques well then talk

40
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,470
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> for each specimen its persistence</font>

41
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,420
technique and in the context<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font>

42
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,940
presentation persistence means the

43
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,250
method<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the malware uses to ensure</font>

44
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">that every time the system</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is rebooted</font>

45
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,910
or the user real augs in that the

46
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,039
malware is similarly or equally

47
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,990
automatically executed by the operating

48
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,600
system I even<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about two years ago</font>

49
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,339
at RSA about 20 or so different

50
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,140
techniques that malware could use on a

51
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,819
Mac to gain persistence but we'll see

52
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:10,288
that the majority of Mac malware both in

53
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:12,269
2016 and even years previous to that

54
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:14,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty much used one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of three techniques</font>

55
00:02:12,269 --> 00:02:16,620
so the most<font color="#CCCCCC"> common is launched damon's</font>

56
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,209
at agents and if you're familiar with

57
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,250
windows malware this technique is

58
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:21,400
essentially synonymous or similar to

59
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,680
windows service

60
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,439
so what you do is you basically create a

61
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,870
property list file or a plist file and

62
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:30,489
you have the path of the binary<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

63
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:34,209
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to execute and then you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> set</font>

64
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:36,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">various keys such as run at load set to</font>

65
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:38,230
true if that's specified the operating

66
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:40,750
system will automatically execute

67
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:42,730
whatever program you specify other

68
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:44,560
techniques<font color="#E5E5E5"> include browser extensions</font>

69
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:46,750
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> plugins a lot of adware uses this</font>

70
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,819
technique and then login items are

71
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:51,430
another mechanism that applications or

72
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:53,500
mac OS malware<font color="#E5E5E5"> can use to persist and be</font>

73
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:57,879
automatically executed every time user

74
00:02:53,500 --> 00:03:00,310
logs in for each specimen will also talk

75
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:02,349
about its features<font color="#E5E5E5"> or goals will try to</font>

76
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:05,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">identify what was the malware created to</font>

77
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:07,510
do now there's basically two main

78
00:03:05,379 --> 00:03:08,950
classes of malware there's nowhere

79
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,709
that's created by<font color="#E5E5E5"> cybercriminals</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

80
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:14,018
then there's malware that's created by

81
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:16,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">nation states so the bowery</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

82
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:17,980
created by cybercriminals is interested

83
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,299
in pretty much money so it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

84
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:21,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">have features such as displaying</font>

85
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:24,310
advertising perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> renting your files</font>

86
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,260
etc while malware that's created by

87
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:29,109
nation state is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be more about</font>

88
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:30,190
gathering information surveillance those

89
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:32,560
kind of things so it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

90
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:35,709
capabilities like monitoring your webcam

91
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:39,370
possibly capturing key log strokes etc

92
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:40,989
etc finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> for each specimen we'll talk</font>

93
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,790
about how to remove it from your system

94
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:44,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we'll see mostly specimens are</font>

95
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:46,810
standalone meaning they're not

96
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:48,790
necessarily integrated or intertwined in

97
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,319
an infected system so<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much you</font>

98
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:52,510
can just delete the binary and their

99
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,888
persistence mechanism of course though

100
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:56,048
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good idea to always fully</font>

101
00:03:53,889 --> 00:03:58,060
read reinstall the operating system if

102
00:03:56,049 --> 00:04:00,220
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are infected because obviously</font>

103
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,349
hackers or malware could always download

104
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:04,510
other malware onto your system so i

105
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:06,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">always recommend people fully restore</font>

106
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:08,888
the operating system if they have a

107
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:11,078
malware in actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's</font>

108
00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:12,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">dive in and start talking about some of</font>

109
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:16,870
the or rather all of the specimens that

110
00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:19,000
appeared in 2016 so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first one was</font>

111
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:21,548
called key ranger this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> discovered by</font>

112
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,800
palo alto networks in<font color="#E5E5E5"> march and it had</font>

113
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:26,109
the honor of being the first fully

114
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:30,219
functional in the wild ransomware for

115
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:32,110
mac OS so in terms of its infection

116
00:04:30,219 --> 00:04:34,300
vector how could users be infected<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

117
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">this piece of ransomware well it turns</font>

118
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,480
out the malware off

119
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:40,210
actually hacked the official<font color="#CCCCCC"> website of</font>

120
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:42,760
a popular<font color="#CCCCCC"> mac</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> BitTorrent application</font>

121
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:44,710
named transmission what they then did is

122
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,570
they infected this application and

123
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:48,969
injected their malicious ransomware into

124
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:50,770
the application bundle so then what an

125
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,690
unsuspecting user would go to the

126
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:55,120
legitimate transmission website to get

127
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:56,380
the BitTorrent application instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

128
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting a pristine copy that would</font>

129
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,719
actually had a copy that<font color="#E5E5E5"> had been</font>

130
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:02,920
infected with transmission now the

131
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,920
attackers actually resize the

132
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:07,390
maliciously infected application so even

133
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,250
if the users had something like

134
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:11,710
gatekeeper enabled which normally blocks

135
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:13,960
unsigned code it would bypass that

136
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:17,500
because again the attackers had resigned

137
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:19,299
the application so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we analyze key</font>

138
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,010
Rangers code we can see what's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

139
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,350
so we start by looking at the

140
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:25,930
application bundle specifically the info

141
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:27,940
dot plist file and in this file is the

142
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:29,590
past the application or binary to

143
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:32,020
execute when the users double click on

144
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:34,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it turns out it points to a binary</font>

145
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:36,039
called transmission<font color="#E5E5E5"> not too surprising</font>

146
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,750
there this is actually the legitimate

147
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,030
transmission binary but it's been

148
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:42,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">modified so if we look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the code at</font>

149
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:44,590
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> beginning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of its main function we</font>

150
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,680
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that they've injected some extra</font>

151
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:50,469
instructions and what it it does these

152
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,230
extra instructions is grab a file called

153
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:55,990
general dot RTF from the applications

154
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:59,380
bundle save<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as Colonel underscore</font>

155
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:01,690
service and then execute that so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

156
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:03,219
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this general RTF file as I</font>

157
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:05,770
mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's in the resource folder of</font>

158
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:07,990
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> application bundle it appears to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

159
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:10,060
an RTF document but if we run the file

160
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:12,040
command on it or look at it<font color="#CCCCCC"> txt bytes we</font>

161
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:16,450
can see no it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a document it's</font>

162
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:18,130
really a mock<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh binary X</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Cuba so we</font>

163
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:19,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">disassembled it or take a closer look at</font>

164
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:21,340
it we can see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> again it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

165
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:24,310
document it's a binary<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's been</font>

166
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:26,169
packed with<font color="#E5E5E5"> upx upx though is kind of an</font>

167
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:27,940
ice pack or at least form our analysts

168
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:31,300
because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can take a file as packed</font>

169
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:33,610
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> uvx run it with you p x dash D and</font>

170
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,710
now we'll unpack the binary so once it's

171
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:38,260
unpacked it's pretty easy to disassemble

172
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:41,020
or analyze and we can pretty much

173
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:42,880
quickly see what it's doing so it does

174
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:47,140
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much two things it encrypts all</font>

175
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:49,090
files that appear under / users and then

176
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:51,729
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks for files that match</font>

177
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:55,388
and file extensions under / volumes so

178
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:57,130
dot<font color="#E5E5E5"> jpg stop documents now for every</font>

179
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:59,020
directory it creates an encrypted file

180
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:01,750
in it creates a plain text document

181
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:03,549
that's called read me for decrypt and if

182
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,470
we look at what this readme for decrypt

183
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:07,360
file has it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> instructions how to</font>

184
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:10,000
decrypt so it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> standard</font>

185
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,979
ransomware but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again just it was the</font>

186
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">first fully functional in the wild rent</font>

187
00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:17,560
where that hit<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mac OS so kind of</font>

188
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:19,270
interesting it's pretty easy to remove

189
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,910
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> your computer you basically just</font>

190
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:23,590
delete the binary as far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I know</font>

191
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:26,380
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no persistence mechanism for</font>

192
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:27,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">this piece of malware because again it's</font>

193
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:30,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">ransomware so it doesn't really need a</font>

194
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:32,200
hang around and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> delete the</font>

00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:37,419
infected transmission application as

00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:39,700
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the next sample I want to</font>

197
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:42,430
talk about is Eleanor and this was

198
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:45,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">discovered in July by bitdefender and as</font>

199
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:48,520
we'll see it's a php-based<font color="#E5E5E5"> backdoor that</font>

200
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:52,210
exposed infected computers as hidden

201
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:54,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">tour services now in terms of its</font>

202
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:57,310
infection vector it turns out that what

203
00:07:54,850 --> 00:08:00,610
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mac malware authors did was</font>

204
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:02,200
essentially take over or recreate an

205
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:05,050
abandoned application that was on Mac

206
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,849
update<font color="#CCCCCC"> com so there was this application</font>

207
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:09,039
called easy doc converter that would

208
00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:11,200
legitimately allow you to convert

209
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,150
documents and I guess that it was

210
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,830
abandoned so the malware authors created

211
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:17,560
a new instance of this application that

212
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:20,760
was just malware so mentioned this was

213
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:23,260
hosted on Mac update<font color="#E5E5E5"> com so again if</font>

214
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,729
legitimate users went to download<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

215
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,500
they thought was a converter application

216
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:30,700
ran it they would have been become

217
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:32,760
infected with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> mower turns out that</font>

218
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:35,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">looks like the malware authors used a</font>

219
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:38,020
development tool called<font color="#E5E5E5"> platypus to</font>

220
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:41,080
create this Mac malware now platypus

221
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:42,458
isn't malicious tool it's just basically

222
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,260
what it allows you to do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> take a</font>

223
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:46,569
script and convert it to a native mac

224
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:48,819
application kind of like pie 2 XE or

225
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:50,920
something like that this is important

226
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:53,260
understand because platypus applications

227
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,630
when they're executed run a bash script

228
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:58,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">called script we can see that in the</font>

229
00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:00,730
application bundle so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually</font>

230
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">the malicious code and since it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a</font>

231
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:04,540
bash script it's very easy to animal

232
00:09:02,769 --> 00:09:06,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's right we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to decompile or</font>

233
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:08,589
disassemble it we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just can open it in a</font>

234
00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:11,199
text editor so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do that we can see it's</font>

235
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:13,509
persisting three different launch agents

236
00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:15,998
obviously the malware authors really

237
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:17,649
didn't care that much about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Stealth so</font>

238
00:09:15,999 --> 00:09:19,779
let's take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a closer look at each of</font>

239
00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:21,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">these three launch agents because each</font>

240
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:26,350
of them is a specific component of this

241
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:28,449
malware so the first launch agent

242
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:31,540
creates a plist or properties file

243
00:09:28,449 --> 00:09:34,389
called calm da<font color="#CCCCCC"> getdropbox dot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Dropbox</font>

244
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:37,118
dot integrity check dot P list and this

245
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:40,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">will execute a application</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or binary</font>

246
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:43,089
named con co<font color="#CCCCCC"> NN and what this binary</font>

247
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:45,579
does is<font color="#E5E5E5"> sets up a hidden door service</font>

248
00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:48,519
and we'll see in a moment this exposes a

249
00:09:45,579 --> 00:09:50,589
interactive PHP back door so we can

250
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:53,889
examine<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the config files based</font>

251
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:55,600
on this tour service or look use a tool

252
00:09:53,889 --> 00:09:57,730
like task<font color="#CCCCCC"> explorer which can show</font>

253
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,759
network connections to understand how

254
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:02,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">the tour service is set up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

255
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:05,049
specifically we can see there's a proxy

256
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:10,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">and a control mechanism locally</font>

257
00:10:05,049 --> 00:10:12,459
listening on port 90 60 and 90 61 now of

258
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:15,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">course the attacker needs to know about</font>

259
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:17,290
the hidden tour service because it's

260
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:20,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be unique for each infection so</font>

261
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:22,110
that he or she can connect to it so the

262
00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:25,329
second launch agent takes care of this

263
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:27,549
it's a binary<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> either script called</font>

264
00:10:25,329 --> 00:10:29,920
check hostname<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it does two simple</font>

265
00:10:27,549 --> 00:10:31,959
tasks what it does<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it encrypts the</font>

266
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,569
name of the hidden tour service and then

267
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:35,949
publishes that to paste in this that

268
00:10:34,569 --> 00:10:38,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">means the attackers can go to paste bin</font>

269
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:40,540
grab that encrypted service name decrypt

270
00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:44,920
it and then connect to the infected

271
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:47,879
computer the final launch agent that the

272
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:50,378
binary or malware persists it's called

273
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:54,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">dbd and if we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at it actually turns</font>

274
00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:56,589
out to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple's signed copy of PHP if</font>

275
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,660
we look at the property<font color="#E5E5E5"> list that</font>

276
00:10:56,589 --> 00:11:00,549
persists this binary we can see it's

277
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:02,769
executed with various command line

278
00:11:00,549 --> 00:11:05,439
parameters including the<font color="#CCCCCC"> S argument</font>

279
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:07,149
which runs a built-in web server so if

280
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:08,980
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at what it's serving up we can</font>

281
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:13,869
see that it's a copy of an open source

282
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:15,220
PHP shell what the shell provides a

283
00:11:13,869 --> 00:11:16,640
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to see but it provides</font>

284
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,860
complete remote control

285
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">over infected computer so it gives the</font>

attacker a remote<font color="#E5E5E5"> shell file explorer</font>

287
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:27,350
script interpreter etc now<font color="#CCCCCC"> the malware</font>

288
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:29,630
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> also distributed with two utilities</font>

289
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:32,060
netcat which we all hopefully know what

290
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:34,160
is and another tool called whoa calm and

291
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:36,680
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> kha is a utility open-source</font>

292
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,530
utility that allows an attacker or

293
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:41,689
anybody to capture video off the webcam

294
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:43,790
so again this malware shipped with the

295
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:46,940
utility<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the attacker could execute</font>

296
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:50,810
via the PHP backdoor to record the user

297
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:53,030
via their web cam it's pretty easy to

298
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:55,430
remove<font color="#E5E5E5"> Eleanor from an infected computer</font>

299
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:58,250
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically just delete the launch</font>

300
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:59,959
agents and the launch<font color="#E5E5E5"> agent p lists and</font>

301
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:04,280
then the computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been essentially</font>

302
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:07,850
disinfected ok the next sample is kidnap

303
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:09,860
this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> discovered in July by ESET it's</font>

304
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:11,780
a fairly standard backdoor though it has

305
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:15,080
an interesting propensity for stealing

306
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:17,720
credentials from the teaching the

307
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:19,670
initial infection vector was not known

308
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,710
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> analysts at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the time wasn't sure how</font>

309
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:23,900
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> got on to Mac computers but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as the</font>

310
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:26,450
quote<font color="#E5E5E5"> said probably via email or perhaps</font>

311
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:28,400
social engineering what was known those

312
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:30,830
distributed as a zip file<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you</font>

313
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,930
unzipped the zip archive it contained a

00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:35,330

that name it's actually screenshot JPEGs

base and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that space at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end does</font>

318
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:43,910
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> means when the user double clicks it</font>

319
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:45,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">they might think they're opening an</font>

image but instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of opening an image in</font>

00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:51,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">a image program such as preview it will</font>

322
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:53,240
actually execute it via the terminal so

323
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,680
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> turns out that wasn't really an image</font>

324
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,450
it was an executable<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when the user</font>

325
00:12:54,680 --> 00:13:00,140
clicks it they would infect themselves

with<font color="#E5E5E5"> keypad later another infection</font>

327

328
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,020
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was essentially the same one that the</font>

329
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:09,260
piece of ransomware we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

330
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:11,060
distributed the malware authors probably

331
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:14,120
the same guys or related<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the same</font>

332
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:17,449
guys hack the transmission website again

333
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:20,180
and modified the BitTorrent application

334
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:22,040
and this time injected kidnap into the

335
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:23,780
application so again when users went to

336
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">download transmission instead of getting</font>

337
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:28,069
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit toward application they would get</font>

338
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:30,220
a bit one application and this piece of

339
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:30,220
malware

340
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:35,790
if we decompile the malicious malware

341
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:38,010
binary that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> injected into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

342
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:40,020
legitimate transmission application we

343
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:42,720
can see it installing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to launch agents</font>

344
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:45,000
we use a tool<font color="#CCCCCC"> such as knock knock which</font>

345
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,040
shows you<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is persisted on your</font>

346
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,900
computer we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see both</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these launch</font>

347
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,329
agents showing up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they both are</font>

348
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:53,699
named<font color="#E5E5E5"> iCloud something again this is</font>

349
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:55,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably just so that the attackers kind</font>

350
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:59,340
of blend into the noise of other Apple

351
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:02,940
utilities we look at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> P lists for</font>

352
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:05,010
each of these pieces of them our we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

353
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,600
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they have this run at load key</font>

354
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,730
set to true<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned if you</font>

355
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,500
specify that run at load key set to true

356
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:12,930
the operating<font color="#E5E5E5"> system will automatically</font>

357
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:15,240
execute whatever you specify so let's

358
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:18,140
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a closer look at these two binaries</font>

359
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,730
now so the first binary is called iCloud

360
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:23,130
sync d and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the main back door</font>

361
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:25,290
component of the Mauer and if we

362
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:27,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">reverse-engineer it we can see what</font>

363
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:29,730
features it has so one neat feature is

364
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,170
it can download and execute<font color="#CCCCCC"> Python</font>

365
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:33,810
script so that's kind of a cool feature

366
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:36,000
to have in a piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> malware it also is</font>

367
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:38,729
able to escalate its privileges although

368
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,320
it does it in a very non elegant way

369
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:42,270
basically just pops up an authentication

370
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,490
prompt asking the user for their

371
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:47,100
password and if the user<font color="#E5E5E5"> falls for this</font>

372
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:49,320
and provides their password then the

373
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:52,410
Mauer will be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to execute at higher</font>

374
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,940
privileges coolest<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing though it has</font>

375
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:55,829
the ability to dump the keychain and it

376
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,510
does this<font color="#E5E5E5"> using an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> open source utility</font>

377
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:59,610
called keychain don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's been</font>

378
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:01,110
compiled into the application so this

379
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:02,790
way the malware is able to grab

380
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:03,870
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's in the keychain which</font>

381
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:07,800
is probably passwords and other

382
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:10,080
sensitive pieces of information the

383
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:12,750
second launch agent execute a binary

384
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:16,640
called iCloud<font color="#CCCCCC"> proc and this binary is</font>

385
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:20,070
simply a copy of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tour de web proxy</font>

386
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:22,680
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> total lab is a project that allows</font>

387
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:24,360
access to tour services via the internet

388
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">without having to use for example the</font>

389
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,260
tor browser so what happens is the main

390
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">back door component the one we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

391
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,980
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the previous slide will</font>

392
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:34,830
connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this component and then it</font>

393
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:36,240
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to connect out via tour so</font>

394
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:38,010
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is basically the malware's command</font>

395
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:42,360
and control mechanism that it does via

396
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:43,920
tour you want to remove<font color="#CCCCCC"> kidnap from an</font>

397
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,930
infected system

398
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,810
again pretty easy you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just unload the</font>

399
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:51,180
launch agents and then you this will

400
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:54,209
kill those processes and then you delete

401
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:57,329
both the binaries and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the two plist</font>

402
00:15:54,209 --> 00:16:00,149
files that they create and then word of

403
00:15:57,329 --> 00:16:02,339
advice from Thomas Reid who's great

404
00:16:00,149 --> 00:16:03,510
malware analyst basically saying hey

405
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:05,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">look this is the second time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

406
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:07,649
transmission application has got hacked

407
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:09,990
and Trojan eyes so like maybe stop using

408
00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:13,380
that unless you're maybe looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for new</font>

409
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:15,149
malware<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next piece of</font>

410
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:17,550
malware is a piece of adware called fake

411
00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:19,380

412

00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:29,579
fake file opener is installed with other

over as I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned the persistence</font>

431
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,160
mechanism was kind of interesting and

432
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,810
there was a quote from Thomas saying

433
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,839
that hey when he detected<font color="#E5E5E5"> this malware</font>

434
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:08,730
and executed it didn't persist in any

common ways what it does do is it

436
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:13,530
registers itself as a document handler

437
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,620
for about 200 different types of files

438
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:19,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">and what this means is if the user at a</font>

439
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:21,000
later time goes to open a file of an

440
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:24,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">extension that the malware has</font>

441
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,859
registered for for example dot 7-zip or

442
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:27,510
something a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little more esoteric that</font>

443
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:30,719
the operating system will automatically

444
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:32,340
execute the malware because the malware

445
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,080
has registered itself as a document

446
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:36,418
handler now the malware can't hijack

447
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,220
existing document handlers so it can't

448
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:41,100
for example register itself as a handler

449
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:42,750
first a PNG images or documents but

450
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">again it chooses all these kind of</font>

451
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,500
esoteric files and eventually when the

452
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,840
user tries to<font color="#CCCCCC"> open one of those the</font>

453
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,290
malware will get executed so kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

454
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,879
neat technique

455
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:55,250
so what's the malware has been executed

456
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">what does it actually do well all it</font>

457
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:59,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is goes and downloads more adware</font>

458
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:02,090
which is really kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of lame so it'll</font>

459
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:04,040
pop up this application that says no

460
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:05,689
application is available to execute this

461
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,490
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is made to look like an apple</font>

462
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:09,560
prompt but in reality this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an hour</font>

463
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:12,650
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the user click search web</font>

464
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:15,590
it'll take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> website max file open</font>

465
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:17,660
org and that website<font color="#CCCCCC"> will get try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

466
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:21,889
the user to install more mad more adware

467
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:24,290
so you know kind of flame annoying to

468
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:26,000
disinfect yourself you simply delete the

469
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:28,280
application binary<font color="#CCCCCC"> behind the scenes</font>

470
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,190
this will unregister all the document

471
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:33,139
handlers and this malware is generally

472
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:35,360
associated with other adware so it's

473
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:37,280
wise to check to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you have any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

474
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,350
those other applications installed on

475
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,639
your system as well and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> so delete</font>

476
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:45,409
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright the last two specimens</font>

479

door but did have some rather

480
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:54,620
interesting features in terms of its

00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:57,260
infection vector it's currently unknown

486
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:06,890
via some sort of social engineering

00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:10,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe emails with attachments or</font>

488
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:13,100
possibly exploits now as we've seen

489
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:15,740
launch agents are the most common way

490
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:17,750
that Mac malware<font color="#CCCCCC"> Persis and Mokes</font>

492
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:22,400
persisting is the launch agent and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we</font>

493
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:24,350
actually look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the application binary</font>

494
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,420
of the malware we can see there's the

495
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:28,580
template for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> launch agent they</font>

496
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:30,830
create and then once the launch agent is

497
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:32,929
created if we dump or enumerate

498
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:35,120
persisted processes again we can see

499
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:38,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there is a new malicious launch</font>

500

501
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:41,570
the malware is decently interesting

502
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:43,580
because it has some kind of neat

503
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:44,960
features you know it supports the

504
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:47,929
standard download and execute other

505
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:50,210
commands or files it has some

506
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:52,790
interesting search capabilities to look

507
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:55,160
for a variety of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Office documents</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

508
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:56,659
capture screen audio and video<font color="#CCCCCC"> which is</font>

509
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of interesting not that common in</font>

510
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:01,340
Mac malware and then also monitors for

511
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:03,770
removable media so if someone plugs in a

512
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:05,510
USB stick on an infected host

513
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:07,940
our can enumerate that and perhaps grab

514
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:10,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">or exfiltrate interesting documents of</font>

515
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:12,980
that yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely a very feature</font>

516
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:14,900
complete piece of malware terms of

517
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:16,670
disinfection this is a little

518
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:19,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">complicated just because the malware can</font>

519
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:21,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">register or install itself using a</font>

520
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:23,030
handful<font color="#E5E5E5"> of names what you can do those</font>

521
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:24,530
just look for any of these names and

522
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:26,720
then once you find the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one that matches</font>

523
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:28,460
you can just delete the binary and

524
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:32,330
delete the plist again it's a standalone

525
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:36,200
piece of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so the last piece</font>

526
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:38,600
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our from 2016 is called complex we</font>

527

all knows russian cyber operations<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

528
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:44,649
kind of hot news topic and a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> mac</font>

529
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:47,419
now our analysts believe that complex is

530
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:51,320
tied to the Russians I think it's like

531
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:55,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">apt 128 yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically it's one of their</font>

533
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:59,510
distributed via an application so a

534
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:01,160
targeted user would get an email with an

535
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:03,590
attachment and the attachment would be

536
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:05,930
an actual application really not a very

537
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:08,209
sophistication and sophisticated in

00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:10,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">Section vector the user was tricked into</font>

539
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:13,040
running the application it would do two

540
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:15,080
things first it would load a PDF

541
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:17,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">document so that the user who thought</font>

542
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:19,129
they were opening a PDF wouldn't be that

543
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:21,530
suspicious but<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind the scenes it</font>

544
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:23,030
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually install them our so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

547
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:29,480
executing the malware one kind of funny

548
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:31,970
thing is that set file command it uses

549
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,410
is only available on developer boxes so

550
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:35,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">if you execute this on a user who</font>

551
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:37,790
doesn't have say<font color="#E5E5E5"> Xcode installed there's</font>

552
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:39,200
a big pop up saying like set file not

553
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:41,270
found so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks like the malware</font>

554
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,040
authors only tested there now we're on

555
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:44,900
their boxes which had developer tools

556
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:47,300
installed so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> writing malware</font>

557
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:49,880
make sure you test it terms of

558
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:51,830
persistence again uses the launch agent

559
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:54,860
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing too surprising or</font>

560
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:57,169
sophisticated here and basically it

561
00:21:54,860 --> 00:22:01,340
persists and execute a file called<font color="#CCCCCC"> kext</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">e which is the malware implements a few</font>

very basic features can download other

will write<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi stage</font>

570
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:20,379
unsophisticated it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just allow them to</font>

571
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,970
enumerate the target and see if it's an

572
00:22:20,379 --> 00:22:23,860
interesting one and then what those do

573
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:25,299
is install a more advanced piece of

00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:48,669
it runs as a standalone launch agent

00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:50,440
again just unload the launch agent and

584
00:22:48,669 --> 00:22:52,179
delete it but again<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is a good</font>

585
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">example of why it's good to completely</font>

586
00:22:52,179 --> 00:22:56,619
wipe your system because if you were of

587
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:58,330
interest to the Russians they might have

588
00:22:56,619 --> 00:22:59,889
installed a more sophisticated back door

589
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:03,549
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just delete this there might</font>

590
00:22:59,889 --> 00:23:06,129
be a way onto your system alright so

591
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:07,929
that was Mac malware specimens from 2016

592
00:23:06,129 --> 00:23:09,699
and since we have about five minutes

593
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:12,940
left I briefly want to talk about

594
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:14,289
generic detections and you might be

595
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:16,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">wondering why are we going to talk about</font>

596
00:23:14,289 --> 00:23:17,859
generic<font color="#CCCCCC"> protections well I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

597
00:23:16,539 --> 00:23:19,600
all aware of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the limitations of</font>

598
00:23:17,859 --> 00:23:21,699
traditional antivirus they're generally

599
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,699
signature-based especially on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mac OS</font>

600
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:26,499
windows now a V products<font color="#E5E5E5"> are actually</font>

601
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:28,269
you know decent they have heuristics and

602
00:23:26,499 --> 00:23:31,299
whatnot but there's really not the same

603
00:23:28,269 --> 00:23:34,090
parity on Mac OS so because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this most</font>

604
00:23:31,299 --> 00:23:35,830
Mac antivirus products cannot detect new

605
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:37,600
Mac malware samples for example all the

606
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:39,399
ones we talked about if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

607
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">believe me just look at the next time a</font>

608
00:23:39,399 --> 00:23:43,238
Mac malware specimen is discovered a new

609
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:45,340
one hop on something like virustotal

610
00:23:43,239 --> 00:23:47,830
which has all the AV engines and you'll

611
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:49,959
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> zero antivirus engines</font>

612
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:51,549
detected or maybe one which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is generally</font>

613
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:54,039
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies that detected it that</font>

614
00:23:51,549 --> 00:23:56,470
proactively pushed out reactively pushed

615
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:57,940
out signature<font color="#E5E5E5"> support so I think we</font>

616
00:23:56,470 --> 00:24:00,279
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> lease discuss generic detections</font>

617
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:03,999
because this is what I want on my<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mac</font>

618
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:06,309
protecting me so the first observation

619
00:24:03,999 --> 00:24:08,379
is that essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> all Mac malware</font>

620
00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:10,239
persist because otherwise if it doesn't

621
00:24:08,379 --> 00:24:12,668
persist you can just reboot your

622
00:24:10,239 --> 00:24:15,039
computer and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you'll have been</font>

623
00:24:12,669 --> 00:24:16,929
disinfected so again persistence is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

624
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:20,320
way that Mac<font color="#CCCCCC"> mauer ensures that it's</font>

625
00:24:16,929 --> 00:24:22,179
reacts acute adem is rebooted so I wrote

626
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">two free tools the first one is called</font>

627
00:24:22,179 --> 00:24:26,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">knock knock and it's basically autoruns</font>

628
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:28,149
but on Mac so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Otto runs on window</font>

629
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:29,590
it shows you everything that's set to

630
00:24:28,149 --> 00:24:31,658
automatically start on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your computer</font>

631
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:33,879
knock knock tries<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the same thing</font>

632
00:24:31,659 --> 00:24:36,580
on neck so I'll show<font color="#CCCCCC"> you for example all</font>

633
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:39,159
launch agents login items kernel

634
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:41,620
extensions etc<font color="#E5E5E5"> now it doesn't say what</font>

635
00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:42,970
is now or<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus not but you know that's</font>

636
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:44,918
up to you to kind of say hey look this

637
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:46,750
is an unsigned launch agent that I don't

638
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:49,240
recognize and then you know take a

639
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:50,860
closer look at it second free tool<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

640
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,330
wrote is called block walk and what it

641
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:54,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">does is it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually monitors these</font>

642
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:56,350
persistence locations and then any time

643
00:24:54,399 --> 00:24:58,059
something goes to persist itself you get

644
00:24:56,350 --> 00:25:00,519
a pop-up so it's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a firewall</font>

645
00:24:58,059 --> 00:25:01,870
for persistence locations and obviously

646
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:03,580
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're running an installer that's</font>

647
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:05,139
fine you know something probably is

648
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:06,580
going to be persisting but if you're

649
00:25:05,139 --> 00:25:08,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">browsing the web or opening a word</font>

650
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:10,600
document and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of a sudden</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it creates</font>

651
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:12,158
a new cron job or launch agent that's a

652
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:15,189
pretty good<font color="#E5E5E5"> indicator that you might</font>

653
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:17,470
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> just been exploited another</font>

654
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:19,570
observation or generic detection I think

655
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:22,630
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be able to flag or detectives</font>

656
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:24,340
ransomware so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the kind of</font>

657
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:27,130
obvious observation that ransomware

658
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:29,019
creates many encrypted files often in a

659
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:31,480
rapid manner so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wrote a simple</font>

660
00:25:29,019 --> 00:25:33,309
utilities that continually monitors<font color="#E5E5E5"> file</font>

661
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:36,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">system and what it does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is it looks for</font>

662
00:25:33,309 --> 00:25:38,889
the rapid created creation of encrypted

663
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:40,659
files by untrusted processes if it sees

664
00:25:38,889 --> 00:25:42,639
this occurring it suspends the process

665
00:25:40,659 --> 00:25:44,440
and pops up alert to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the user saying hey</font>

666
00:25:42,639 --> 00:25:46,719
there's this process that's creating all

667
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,070
these encrypted files and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's you know</font>

668
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,419
it's a little reactive because there

669
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:51,100
might be two or three files that are

670
00:25:49,419 --> 00:25:54,639
encrypted but<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently it's able to</font>

671
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:58,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">generically detect all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Mac ransomware so</font>

672
00:25:54,639 --> 00:25:59,289
kind of neat finally I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

673
00:25:58,149 --> 00:26:01,360
about this a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little more in depth</font>

674
00:25:59,289 --> 00:26:03,610
tomorrow we've seen a variety of Mac

675
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,519
malware specimens that will spy on the

676
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:09,219
user via the webcam or the mic and yes

677
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:11,260
the webcam<font color="#E5E5E5"> LED will go on if the malware</font>

678
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:13,559
is recording you but there's some cool

679
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:15,700
attacks where mauer can piggyback<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to</font>

680
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:18,580
legitimate webcam sessions to

681
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:20,799
surreptitiously record the user and if a

682
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:22,539
piece of malware is hot miking your

683
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,980
computer using the mic<font color="#CCCCCC"> to record what</font>

684
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:25,899
you're saying unfortunately there's no

685
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:27,610
alerts for that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got to wrote</font>

686
00:26:25,899 --> 00:26:29,199
another free utility<font color="#E5E5E5"> that just monitors</font>

687
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:31,449
the mic in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> webcam and if anything</font>

688
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:36,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">tries to access that it just pops up to</font>

689
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:38,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell you what is accessing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that so yeah</font>

690
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:40,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">those tools that I just mentioned and</font>

691
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:42,730
some others are available on my

692
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:44,110
max security website it's all free so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

693
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:46,240
hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> this isn't sound like the sales</font>

694
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:48,789
pitch also all the malware specimens I

695
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,980
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> are available for download</font>

696
00:26:48,789 --> 00:26:53,350
as well I also blog a lot about most

697
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:55,929
zero-day vulnerabilities in the mat

698
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:57,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">colonel new malware samples come out so</font>

699
00:26:55,929 --> 00:27:02,169
if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in Mac malware or</font>

700
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:06,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">Mac security just check it out alright</font>

701
00:27:02,169 --> 00:27:07,600
so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is pretty much a wrap just to</font>

702
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:09,669
reiterate what we covered we talked

703
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">about all the malware specimens that</font>

704
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:14,710
infected Mac new malware specimens that

705
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:17,289
we saw in 2016 and what could<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do</font>

706
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:19,299
obviously it's good to stay updated stop

707
00:27:17,289 --> 00:27:21,789
opening random emails from the Russians

708
00:27:19,299 --> 00:27:23,710
and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a good idea to install</font>

709
00:27:21,789 --> 00:27:26,080
some tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> that provide generic</font>

710
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:28,720
detectives so we have about a minute or

711
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,549
two left there's any questions I will

712
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,559
gladly answer those and if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> get kicked</font>

713
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:35,559
out I will be right outside and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

714
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:40,570
chat<font color="#E5E5E5"> tomorrow anybody questions for</font>

715
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:43,809
Patrick yes hi so you have some really

716
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:46,178
good tools did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you plan to do</font>

717
00:27:43,809 --> 00:27:48,908
like the one really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good security tool</font>

718
00:27:46,179 --> 00:27:51,909
for mac OS because for us users because

719
00:27:48,909 --> 00:27:53,860
i want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to so five of them now and why</font>

720
00:27:51,909 --> 00:27:55,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">not to be just one really really good</font>

721
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:57,820
tool that does everything that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

722
00:27:55,779 --> 00:28:00,309
question so i will call me<font color="#E5E5E5"> out that I'm</font>

723
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:03,070
security researcher<font color="#E5E5E5"> for most and a</font>

724
00:28:00,309 --> 00:28:05,440
enterprise binded business software

725
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:08,019
