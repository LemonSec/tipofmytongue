00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:31,490
to hack in the box at we have a

disconnected AV always gets you I think

6
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:36,309
there's also some echo if you don't mind

7
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:57,980
yes we got screen right so welcome good

of the talk my talk is a couple of

14
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,149
warnings before I get into my talk and

may not like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear but then these</font>

Silicon Valley is coming up later this

23
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:43,440
apron so do watch the show right so I've

24
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:45,450
been doing hack in the box<font color="#E5E5E5"> for many</font>

25
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,880
years now I've been doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> InfoSec for</font>

many years this talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font>

little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of back to the future as well</font>

28
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:55,500
we are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to rewind the tape to 2001</font>

29
00:01:52,560 --> 00:02:00,330
when I got onto<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scene doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> InfoSec</font>

30
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:02,670
in a very ground up way we were all

31
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:04,650
hackers you're all people who innovate

32
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,750
would you know do new things because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

33
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:09,929
love challenges and over these<font color="#E5E5E5"> years</font>

34
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:12,690
until now the whole scene has become

35
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:17,190
very formal very industrialized very

36
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:20,190
businesslike highly politicized and sort

every citizen in the world what I want

40
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:32,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do is kind of take a look at where we</font>

41
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:34,950
came from and where we're going ahead

42
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:38,459
first we will begin with<font color="#E5E5E5"> my favorite</font>

43
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:40,350
topic attacks attacks have been evolving

44
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:43,170
ever since 2001 you know you start

45
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:45,299
popping root shells up until<font color="#CCCCCC"> a point now</font>

46
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:49,589
where attacks have become highly

47
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:51,480
sophisticated beyond several people's

48
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,340
imaginations and only when we see it in

49
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">the field we go like wow this thing also</font>

50
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:59,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">happened yeah we've known attacks of</font>

51
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,510
gotten sophisticated over the neck

52
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:03,270
two days you're going to see a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

53
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:06,630
sophisticated attacks being presented on

54
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:11,100
these stages in this conference what

55
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:14,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the targets from 2001 217 targets</font>

56
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:16,079
have also shifted we began by popping

57
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:19,950
servers then<font color="#CCCCCC"> move to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> applications</font>

58
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,230
desktops browsers we then went to mobile

59
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:26,339
attacks attacks in your pockets and now

60
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:29,910
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the power to attack populations</font>

61
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:33,000
at large<font color="#CCCCCC"> and mass bringing even concepts</font>

62
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:34,859
like sovereignty into question and now

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,530
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we take a look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at the sense over the</font>

64
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,480
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've been trying a lot of things</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">with defense we've been trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

66
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:45,600
prevent several situations we've come up

67
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:48,330
with several measures all of them

68
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:51,420
different from each other but the end

69
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:54,380
goal the effect has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same they</font>

70
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:57,510
all end up getting bypassed there's one

71
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:59,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">defense bypass after the year after the</font>

72
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:01,679
other and I've seen this happen over the

73
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:03,149
years several people say that or we have

74
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,830
this new technology with blinking lights

75
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,920
that's going to put an end<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

76
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:10,320
exploits and yet another hack in the Box

77
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,980
happens and yet the same shells keep

78
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:16,290
getting porked now it's not like you

79
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:18,108
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the defense sucks we've been</font>

80
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:22,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying that but that's not really true</font>

81
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:24,570
this sense is now slightly misunderstood

82
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:26,669
it's time to<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of reset the</font>

83
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:29,190
definition of<font color="#CCCCCC"> defense and that's what</font>

84
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:31,260
the talk is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be if you look at</font>

85
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:34,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">the new types of attacks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are coming</font>

86
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:37,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">there even beyond what we are capable of</font>

87
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:40,140
defending today one great example of new

88
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:42,300
types of<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacks coming up row hammer</font>

89
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:44,460
this is like the first time I read about

90
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:47,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">roham arose mind blown like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wow we</font>

91
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:49,560
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought the RAM preserved memory</font>

92
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,330
integrity it turns out you hammer rows

93
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,460
of ram you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can slip</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Biggs and you can</font>

94
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:56,340
get privilege escalation and now you can

95
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:59,400
weaponize it with JavaScript to you know

96
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:02,010
put things in perspective I mean do we

97
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,169
even have a vague idea of defending

98
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:06,000
against row hammer maybe performance

99
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:08,400
counters or something but truth be told

100
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,440
not we don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> know a certain</font>

101
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,460
situations certain systems are

102
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,979
vulnerable to row him

103
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,508
ring or if it's happening do we even

104
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:19,560
know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been row hammered</font>

105
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:21,180
merrily another<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of not an</font>

106
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,949
exploit but an exploit delivery

107
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,690
technique it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of close</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to my own</font>

108
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:27,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">heart because I pulled it off two years</font>

109
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:29,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago at hack in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> box is stay goes</font>

110
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,039
Floyd I got up on stage and talked about

111
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">how to deliver exploits represented as</font>

112
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:36,419
pixels in an<font color="#CCCCCC"> image this is not an</font>

113
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,370
exploit it's just an exploit delivery

114
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,229
technique but the idea is you're

115
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:43,349
delivering and exploit with some things

116
00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:45,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is presumed innocent a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> JPEG file</font>

117
00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:47,909
and you don't suspect a<font color="#E5E5E5"> JPEG file at all</font>

118
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:51,660
until it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes and owns you and still</font>

119
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:54,680
looks pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> on your screen so what do</font>

120
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:57,509
we do about these things it is actually

121
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,849
let's ask ourselves another question

122
00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:01,949
first let's come to terms with<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

123
00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:04,349
let's come to terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the fact that</font>

124
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:06,330
there will be vulnerabilities there is

125
00:06:04,349 --> 00:06:09,449
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting around that it's a way of</font>

126
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:11,940
life as a systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> evolved there's new</font>

127
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:14,400
features added there's new functionality

128
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:17,930
added this complexity and what

129
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:21,179
complexity brings is what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> term as</font>

130
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:24,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">Nakatomi space if you've been fans of</font>

131
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:26,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">diehard this is a definition that I read</font>

132
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:29,310
on an architecture blog it's got nothing

133
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,580
to do with info sake but Nakatomi space

134
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:34,979
today exists in every complex

135
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:37,650
infrastructure in every complex file

136
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:40,139
format in every complex software in

137
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:43,770
every complex network and it is these

138
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:46,490
gaps that the attackers find they

139
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:49,590
traverse and they hit their targets if

140
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:51,960
we think about preventing<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nakatomi space</font>

141
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:53,669
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even think of that it is an</font>

142
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,880
inherent thing that comes with every

143
00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:59,400
infrastructure take it deal with it what

144
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,759
we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> aware of is that this</font>

145
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:06,539
space can be traversed very effectively

146
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:09,240
by attackers I mean today's attackers

147
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:11,039
succeed because we are not even thinking

148
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,729
about the Nakatomi space we are only

149
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:17,430
reacting to what they do and then try a

fun and games until the industry started

163
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:53,710
reacting to this whole thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> in 2001 the</font>

164
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:55,480
big target was Microsoft like everything

165
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:57,700
happened on Microsoft the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Unicode bar</font>

166
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:00,430
code red and Windows users getting

167
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:02,950
slammed you know those times these were

168
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:07,090
we didn't know it but 2002 was rather a

169
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:10,630
dangerous time<font color="#E5E5E5"> two parallel timelines</font>

170
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:12,820
emerged to parallel reactive timelines

171
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:16,270
emerged and I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about what</font>

172
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:19,690
happens when the reactive approach is

173
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:24,640
taken the reactive approach takes place

174
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:28,810
and is usually wrong so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> one parallel</font>

175
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:31,930
timeline we started piling up against

176
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:35,950
exploitation we started coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

177
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:38,409
all sorts of technologies to mitigate

178
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:41,380
against exploits and new technologies

179
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:44,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">keep being built up at great cost of</font>

180
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:46,720
building them of deploying them of

00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:50,290
troubleshooting them and of adopting

182
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:53,620
them a new animals emerged this animal

183
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:55,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">is called the mitigator the mitigator</font>

184
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:58,240
was conceived<font color="#E5E5E5"> by a friend halvah flakes</font>

185
00:08:55,540 --> 00:09:00,430
he drew the sketch up and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> I colored</font>

186
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,890
it and the mitigator is a

187
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:05,469
well-intentioned but a short-sighted and

188
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:07,480
not terribly effective alligator always

189
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:09,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">working on making exploitation harder</font>

190
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,980
and this is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we say right this is</font>

191
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:14,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">what we say in Explorer development</font>

192
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:16,480
terms that okay exploit mitigations is

193
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:18,699
going to raise the bar to make

194
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,610
exploitation difficult so yeah the

195
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:25,110
mitigator raises the bar until<font color="#CCCCCC"> it sees</font>

196
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:27,250
no more exploits and this is the truth

197
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:29,320
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> InfoSec is about telling</font>

198
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:31,000
stories<font color="#CCCCCC"> and representing stories with</font>

199
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,980
cute animals to drive points forward

200
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,930
because otherwise the Cecil's don't get

201
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:36,640
it they don't get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that oh you</font>

202
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:38,120
have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know register overflowed</font>

203
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,000
nobody give them a meeting

204
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,950
and raising the bar oh I get it now

205
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,990
right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the timelines</font>

206
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:47,720
we've been seeing is slew of exploit

207
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:50,779
mitigation technologies come up only to

208
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,130
be bested by new techniques of attack so

209
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:54,950
where is this going to go is this going

210
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:56,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">to finally solve the problem logically</font>

211
00:09:54,950 --> 00:10:00,320
no because you're not fixing the root

212
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:02,839
cause it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely making harder but</font>

213
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:07,400
it is not a panacea as it has

214
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:09,860
unfortunately been marketed to be so now

215
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:12,140
another parallel timeline going back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

216
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:14,029
2001 and a rather disturbing and a

217
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:17,630
dangerous<font color="#CCCCCC"> train happened and this</font>

218
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:22,700
happened when<font color="#CCCCCC"> Microsoft strikes back</font>

219
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:26,420
this was the agenda in 2001<font color="#E5E5E5"> you remember</font>

220
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:28,279
what happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> in 2001 today we have this</font>

221
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:30,410
whole scene about responsible disclosure

222
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:33,290
and all we're kind of getting a little

223
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:36,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">mature with it but in the early days</font>

224
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:39,170
this was rather an aggressive move this

225
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:42,650
was a memo posted by Scott Culp using

226
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:45,800
rather hard words like Anarchy criminals

227
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:48,199
and safety security is for your safety

228
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:51,500
and security that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have to expose</font>

229
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:54,050
cyber criminals and round them up this

230
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:56,300
was a knee-jerk reaction to Microsoft

231
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:58,370
getting slammed left right and center

232
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:01,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the products of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me being made to</font>

233
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:05,660
look back so what do you do you react<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

234
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:07,640
the slamming the reaction was well there

235
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:11,089
were a few cyber security companies

236
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:14,209
around the time a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of research being</font>

237
00:11:11,089 --> 00:11:15,709
done I was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of in one of those</font>

238
00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:17,660
companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I know firsthand what</font>

239
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:19,010
happened like we would come up with new

240
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:21,589
research would submit the new research

241
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:23,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">and is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a saying oh you cannot do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

242
00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:25,520
you cannot break us you cannot make us

243
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:26,660
look bad and then we would say oh no

244
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,939
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about this at black</font>

245
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:32,270
hat or hack in a box and they say oh you

246
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:35,209
can't do this so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft form an</font>

247
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:37,699
alliance got all of the cyber security

248
00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:41,000
consultants together and said hey if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

249
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:43,850
want our business stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this you</font>

250
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">will report</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only to us and not to</font>

251
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:49,040
outside and under the whole guise of

252
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,960
doublespeak and double sink and you

253
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:54,360
speak this whole organization for

254
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">ternet safety was formed basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

255
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,870
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a cartel it's like okay you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

256
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:00,300
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this you're going to lose our</font>

257
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:02,700
business contracts straight<font color="#CCCCCC"> up so keep</font>

258
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:06,079
it internal keep it closed and let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

259
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:08,490
talk about it the whole propaganda

260
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:11,700
responsible disclosure was floated at a

261
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:17,780
closed doors meeting and then hey loss

262
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:17,780
of signal I wonder if it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> intentional</font>

263
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:26,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay let me try it sits on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my screen</font>

264
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:38,910
pull the plug put the plug back click

265
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:41,930
the slide back on excellent<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft</font>

266
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:47,219
will allow me to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this right</font>

267
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:48,900
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened 2005 Cisco gates some</font>

268
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,840
of you may remember at black hat they

269
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:53,880
sent an aircraft with lawyers literally

270
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:56,520
like taking razor blades to the

271
00:12:53,880 --> 00:13:00,110
presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> binders and stripping out</font>

272
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:02,550
Michael<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lin's disclosures about ipv6</font>

273
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:05,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">issues in cisco routers and this became</font>

274
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:08,219
a real mess lawsuits or<font color="#E5E5E5"> threaten cisco</font>

275
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:10,350
look back conference look bad but then

276
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:13,620
lawsuits or settle but these knee-jerk

277
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:16,260
reactions led to another trend in 2009 a

278
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:18,510
few researchers got up on stage at can

279
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:20,850
sequester and declared that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there would</font>

280
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:22,980
be no more free bugs we are trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

281
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:25,050
research we're trying to submit bugs you

282
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:28,200
treat us badly we are not going to do

283
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:31,229
this anymore<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you want shaft research</font>

284
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:33,620
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna have to pay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for it so if</font>

285
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:36,960
you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at exploit development in 2012</font>

286
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:39,600
things became really crazy it is now the

287
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:41,820
cost of exploitation is very high<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

288
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">is no public domain exploits exploits</font>

289
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:45,990
that being sold in the underground

290
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:48,390
traded hoarded used for commercial

00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:51,000
purposes used for military purposes and

292
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:53,880
political purposes it's now become a

293
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,520
rather shady and sketchy game with very

294
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:58,160
high numbers attributed to it this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

295
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">not how we hope that would be</font>

296
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,030
information was supposed to be free and

297
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:03,990
research was supposed to be free sadly

298
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:06,480
not

299
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:08,399
so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened another reaction the</font>

300
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,550
defenders<font color="#CCCCCC"> tried</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to buy back their bugs</font>

301
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,320
saying okay you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we'll pay you bug</font>

302
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:17,010
bounties if you turn the bugs back to us

303
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:20,339
great concept in principle it was

304
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:22,350
managed very well in the beginning a few

305
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:24,839
companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> got it right like Google got</font>

306
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:28,020
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really right they wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

307
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:30,540
crowdsource security intelligence and

308
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:33,029
basically find the bugs will not only we

309
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:35,250
will fix it we will roll out a patch in

310
00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:38,000
less than 24 hours and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> was the</font>

311
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:40,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">commitment established by Chris Evans</font>

312
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,700
this picture was<font color="#E5E5E5"> taken at one of the</font>

313
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:44,760
heck in the boxes I think two thousand

314
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:46,700
eleven or twelve or I forget when but

315
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:49,950
then something<font color="#CCCCCC"> really crazy happened</font>

316
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:52,350
steak started getting high and you now

317
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:54,930
start bidding higher and higher prices

318
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:57,600
with the one underlying premise that oh

319
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:59,760
we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> keep on bidding higher stakes</font>

320
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,410
because otherwise the researchers are

321
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,740
going to go and sell the bugs to the bad

322
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:06,270
guys truth be told that never happens if

323
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:09,029
you look at human beings there's two

324
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:11,010
types of<font color="#E5E5E5"> human beings those will always</font>

want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the right thing and those</font>

326
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:17,010
would wear inverse of that sex right the

327
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:19,260
people who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to sell bugs to the</font>

328
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:21,000
underground will always sell bugs to the

329
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:23,130
underground that is a fact they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

330
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,350
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be turned over and sell bugs to</font>

00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:27,959
the researchers and people like us<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">sitting in this room will rather keep</font>

333
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:32,609
the bug or even you know burn it but we

334
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:35,220
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> never going to sell this bug to the</font>

335
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:37,470
underground in the underground trade

336
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:40,920
we'd rather disclose it or let the bug

337
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:43,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">died it is not a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> matter of price at this</font>

338
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:46,170
point bug bounties try to fill a

339
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:49,290
reactive need and with this cost

340
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:51,449
escalation under the guise of bug

341
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:53,790
bounties the whole game started back

342
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:55,410
firing a little bit you have bold

343
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:58,920
statements made that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay</font>

344
00:15:55,410 --> 00:16:01,529
you a million dollars for a bug bounty

345
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:03,089
on an iOS bug except this is not being

346
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:05,070
paid by Apple this is being paid by

347
00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:06,570
someone who wants to acquire the bug and

348
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:07,770
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to pay you a million</font>

349
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:09,300
dollars and guess what they're going to

350
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:11,069
do with the bug how is<font color="#CCCCCC"> he going to</font>

351
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:13,620
monetize a million dollars think about

352
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:16,470
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not where we wanted bug</font>

353
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,310
bounties to go my policy on bug bounties

354
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:20,550
is I

355
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:24,510
rather not<font color="#E5E5E5"> play the game anymore and</font>

356
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:26,849
coming back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> more reactive security we</font>

357
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:29,069
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> another situation that has</font>

358
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:32,850
happened over the years the words

359
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:38,460
security has largely been misunderstood

360
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:40,380
and misrepresented as compliance so the

361
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:43,440
first point<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to make is compliance</font>

362
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:45,839
is not security this is a picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

363
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:49,080
my hometown traffic is notorious or the

364
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:51,630
rules or the lack thereof the rule in

365
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:54,480
our hometown is that somebody riding a

366
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:57,000
motorbike must wear a helmet the rule

367
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:00,600
excludes what the rider behind has to do

368
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,779
and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is compliant yes is this is</font>

369
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:06,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">secure he'll know what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will happen as</font>

370
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:08,189
the poor woman falls off<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no</font>

371
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:11,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">protection here but they are compliant</font>

372
00:17:08,189 --> 00:17:12,959
so are all these enterprises who were

373
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,879
compliant they're fully PCI DSS

374
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,400
compliant basically anybody who gets

375
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,980
breached today is fully compliant with

376
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:23,670
all the standards and yet breaches

377
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:26,310
happen so somewhere we kind of made a

378
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:28,890
wrong turn you know security<font color="#CCCCCC"> is turned</font>

379
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:31,470
more towards compliance and I keep on

380
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:35,240
hearing these words<font color="#CCCCCC"> Risk Reduction all</font>

381
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:38,070
the time if you go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a large conference</font>

382
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:41,010
with a big trade show you're going to

383
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:43,889
see a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of security by risk reduction</font>

384
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:47,070
products if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bottom</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

385
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:49,410
all these products all of all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

386
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:51,570
measures being aggressively marketed

387
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:54,590
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically follow only three</font>

388
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:58,260
principles<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're based on rules</font>

389
00:17:54,590 --> 00:18:00,600
signatures and updates all of three are

390
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:02,129
reactive and nowadays you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the term</font>

391
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:05,070
machine learning throne and to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get more</font>

392
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:07,320
VC money but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically you're trying to</font>

393
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:08,939
detect known attacks and then defend

394
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:12,389
against them and then blink a few lights

395
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:15,800
when things happen and the marketing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

396
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:19,410
also kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of been synonymous with this</font>

397
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:21,360
reactive approach in the past we had 12

398
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:22,260
marketing claims by Oracle who claim

399
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,840
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make their</font>

400
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:26,700
software unhackable and guys like david

401
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">Litchfield makes me the product look</font>

402
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,370
like Swiss cheese with number of holes

403
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,370
in them one coming out

404
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:34,899
most every day that nobody's learned

405
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:36,699
from that even today aggressive

406
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:39,370
marketing statements are being made that

407
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:41,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">we are going to protect against 99% of</font>

408
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:43,899
all the malware well guess what the

409
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:46,600
other one percent does it is the other

410
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:49,630
one percent that's going to own you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

411
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:54,070
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the whole reactive nature of</font>

412
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:57,040
exploitation basically existing defense

413
00:18:54,070 --> 00:19:02,470
measures don't match attacker tactics

414
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:03,970
and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> because attackers don't</font>

415
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:06,580
follow<font color="#E5E5E5"> compliant standards and</font>

416
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:11,620
certifications they do whatever the hell

417
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:13,720
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> please let's look at the defenders</font>

418
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:18,250
and what the defense has been doing and

419
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:22,870
let's look at the key person in charge

420
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:26,170
of defense the seesaw sadly the street

421
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:28,629
tells it all today the seesaw is rather

422
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:30,790
set up to be a scapegoat for any

423
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:34,450
failures this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it should have</font>

424
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:39,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">been again rewinding the tape back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

425
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:41,860
2001<font color="#CCCCCC"> IT was booming in 2001 IT was seen</font>

426
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:45,940
as something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would propel the</font>

427
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:48,340
business forward and the CIO position

428
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:51,150
came to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the CEO position got a</font>

429
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:53,709
lot of respect very soon this whole

430
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:56,470
attacks and exploitation and hacking

431
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:58,929
hacking started happening so the CIO

432
00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:01,900
says oh I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want any of this let us</font>

433
00:19:58,929 --> 00:20:03,910
now create a separate role called the

434
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:06,700
chief information security officer and

435
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:11,170
because of this division two things

436
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:15,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">happened infotech was seen as a business</font>

437
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:18,309
enabler infosec was seen as risk

438
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:21,190
reduction guess where the big budgets

439
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:23,440
went the budgets went for enabling

440
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:24,730
business so nowadays you have marketing

441
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,990
and business trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do reckless</font>

442
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:31,840
things with IT and then the seesaw has

443
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:33,850
to basically deal with cover your ass if

444
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,939
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes wrong blame the sea so</font>

445
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:38,320
let's not blame<font color="#CCCCCC"> the recklessness and</font>

446
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:41,890
this is a very disturbing trend because

447
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,908
sadly<font color="#CCCCCC"> infosec is now being viewed as a</font>

448
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:45,190
cost<font color="#E5E5E5"> center</font>

449
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:47,499
and the goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the board members is to</font>

450
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:49,239
keep the cost low and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ellie mentioned</font>

451
00:20:47,499 --> 00:20:51,659
really well that it is the board that

452
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:56,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">has to take notice of the fact and</font>

453
00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:59,440
enable proper defense by empowering this

454
00:20:56,019 --> 00:21:01,989
job function how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this you walk</font>

455
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,929
up to a Cecil and ask them this one very

456
00:21:01,989 --> 00:21:09,669
important question who are scarier

457
00:21:04,929 --> 00:21:11,799
people attackers or auditors choose your

458
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:14,019
defenses who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you really defending</font>

459
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:15,580
against if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're defending against</font>

460
00:21:14,019 --> 00:21:17,109
auditors this is not the conference for

461
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:19,149
you this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to talk for you you may</font>

462
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:20,590
get up and go and have breakfast but if

463
00:21:19,149 --> 00:21:24,719
it is about defending against<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

464
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:27,549
auditors then let's talk then it's time

465
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,470
we made security great again not by

466
00:21:27,549 --> 00:21:32,499
building firewalls so this is not what

467
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:34,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">we want to do we really want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> improve</font>

468
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:37,090
things we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to redefine the</font>

469
00:21:34,509 --> 00:21:41,229
word security we want to remove the

470
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:44,918
definition of compliance and reapply the

471
00:21:41,229 --> 00:21:47,259
definition of defense security is all

472
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:51,700
about defense it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> about compliance</font>

473
00:21:47,259 --> 00:21:53,590
it's time<font color="#E5E5E5"> we first accept this and for</font>

474
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:56,019
this I've kind of laid out seven

475
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:57,988
principles and loosely calling them

476
00:21:56,019 --> 00:21:59,950
seven axioms of security because

477
00:21:57,989 --> 00:22:01,929
principles didn't really fit in the

478
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:05,590
slide and axioms did so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> squeezed the</font>

479
00:22:01,929 --> 00:22:09,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">word in and I have basically created</font>

480
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:12,759
these seven thoughts all these thoughts

481
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:17,139
revolve around one theme that it is time

482
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:19,720
that we started defending ourselves with

483
00:22:17,139 --> 00:22:21,969
proper information and proper

484
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:24,519
intelligence it's all about intelligence

485
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:28,179
driven defense it's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> about making the</font>

486
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:30,249
shift from<font color="#E5E5E5"> reactive to proactive accept</font>

487
00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:33,099
the facts let us now learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to defend</font>

488
00:22:30,249 --> 00:22:35,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">and how do you want to now redefine the</font>

489
00:22:33,099 --> 00:22:38,080
fence first comes the definition of

490
00:22:35,649 --> 00:22:42,389
defense itself that defense doesn't mean

491
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:47,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">risk reduction</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the seesaws job is</font>

492
00:22:42,389 --> 00:22:49,869
defense was trying to look up what the

493
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,419
seesaws job function is and somebody had

494
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:54,249
made this huge mind man this is the

495
00:22:52,419 --> 00:22:56,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">truth this is what Cecil's have to do</font>

496
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:59,260
day in and day out there's this

497
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:01,299
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorts of activities over here but</font>

498
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:04,360
there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> activity</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that clearly</font>

499
00:23:01,299 --> 00:23:08,679
doesn't belong<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this picture and this</font>

500
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:12,668
activity is ninety percent of a time

501
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:15,520
suck in DC source a daily job and this

502
00:23:12,669 --> 00:23:20,529
is compliance it's time that seesaw says

503
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:21,908
that compliance<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not my job once you</font>

504
00:23:20,529 --> 00:23:23,980
relieve yourself of the burden of

505
00:23:21,909 --> 00:23:27,760
compliance you get a lot of spare time

506
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:29,770
and energy and budgets and I do hope

507
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,408
they do allocate ten percent of the

508
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:38,320
budgets for descending the organization

509
00:23:32,409 --> 00:23:41,590
not for being compliant it is time we

510
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:44,649
make an other fork in the road it is

511
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:48,270
time we<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the seesaws role and divide</font>

512
00:23:44,649 --> 00:23:52,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">it into two again the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seesaws job is</font>

513
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:55,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">infosec which is defense it is about</font>

514
00:23:52,149 --> 00:23:57,639
defending against attackers and now we

515
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a new position created called</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

516
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:02,580
chief compliance officer whose job is

517
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:06,279
simply to defend against the auditors

518
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:08,230
this has<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the new cost</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> center pay</font>

519
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:10,360
the piper get the auditors out of the

520
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:12,640
door now let's talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> defense and</font>

521
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:18,600
let's talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about defense properly let's</font>

522
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:20,980
do it right the second principle<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

523
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:24,010
intelligence begins<font color="#E5E5E5"> with collecting</font>

524
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:27,370
everything the NSA<font color="#CCCCCC"> and gchq have taught</font>

525
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:32,440
us<font color="#E5E5E5"> this very well yeah retain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> collect</font>

526
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:34,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">analyze and then process it this context</font>

527
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,940
I mean for an enterprise not for like

528
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:38,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">nations and all kind of not very happy</font>

529
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:41,470
about privacy being compromised at this

530
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:44,350
point but anything within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the realms of</font>

531
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:47,140
being collectible excluding privacy

532
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:49,480
measures should be collected when<font color="#E5E5E5"> today</font>

533
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:51,190
the cost of storage is minimal you don't

534
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:54,309
really have to pay much for storage it

535
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:56,850
is it is costlier to delete than to

536
00:24:54,309 --> 00:25:00,340
retain now what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do with all this</font>

537
00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:03,428
collections keep in mind<font color="#CCCCCC"> that historical</font>

538
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:05,168
data has fantastic value you go back to

539
00:25:03,429 --> 00:25:07,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">the past learn what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has happened and</font>

540
00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:09,990
then build the analysis to defend

541
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:12,789
yourselves for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> future</font>

542
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:16,360
the most important component of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Defense</font>

543
00:25:12,789 --> 00:25:18,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">today is a well-engineered security data</font>

544
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:22,418
warehouse and this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the</font>

545
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:25,120
source of all your intelligence where do

546
00:25:22,419 --> 00:25:26,769
we get this intelligence from now there

547
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,360
again we had some reactive measures

548
00:25:26,769 --> 00:25:30,760
there were companies selling pew<font color="#CCCCCC"> pew</font>

549
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:32,049
maps and we were going to sell threat

550
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,399
Intel and<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh this these guys are</font>

551
00:25:32,049 --> 00:25:35,980
attacking each other and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get these</font>

555
00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:49,870
intelligence comes from within within

556
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:53,169
your enterprise basically all<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need</font>

557
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:56,620
to do is look within analyze things

558
00:25:53,169 --> 00:25:59,110
going on and take a few lessons from the

559
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:00,668
big boys the Google's the Facebook's if

560
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:02,889
you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way their defense is</font>

561
00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:05,740
done it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not done by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> commercial</font>

562
00:26:02,889 --> 00:26:09,850
products sold in the enterprise they go

563
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:13,139
for organic security basically grow it

564
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:15,519
yourself homegrown tools which<font color="#E5E5E5"> are now</font>

565
00:26:13,139 --> 00:26:18,129
wonderfully distributed an<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source</font>

566
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:20,529
by the makers of these tools for example

567
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:23,049
I've been telling see so enterprises how

568
00:26:20,529 --> 00:26:25,029
many of you are using OS queries it is a

569
00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:27,549
brilliant platform you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can basically</font>

570
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:30,490
query anything going on in any process

571
00:26:27,549 --> 00:26:33,279
in your enterprise using a single sequel

572
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:35,049
like language and use this analyze your

573
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:38,289
sources figure out what's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on in</font>

574
00:26:35,049 --> 00:26:40,809
real time build a good blue team around

575
00:26:38,289 --> 00:26:43,029
this put these tools in the hands of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

576
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:45,460
blue team and give them a carte blanche

577
00:26:43,029 --> 00:26:47,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">to defend the enterprise don't get in</font>

578
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:50,260
their way just like we've been making a

579
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:53,289
case for red team's to attack let the

580
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:56,350
blue team's defense unencumbered bring

581
00:26:53,289 --> 00:26:58,600
good talent on support open source grow

582
00:26:56,350 --> 00:27:01,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">your own tools share them improve them</font>

583
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:05,408
learn from them and distribute them out

584
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:07,090

585
00:27:05,409 --> 00:27:09,610
you want to see where you want to get

00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:11,408
<font color="#CCCCCC">good talent don't look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any further just</font>

587
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:13,269
look out in the comsec area and the

588
00:27:11,409 --> 00:27:16,059
tracks you're going to find the talent

589
00:27:13,269 --> 00:27:18,460
if you support these initiatives the

590
00:27:16,059 --> 00:27:22,450
talents could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have come and build a very</font>

591
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:24,880
good defense organization for you

592
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:27,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">but several times</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have this whole</font>

593
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:30,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">distortion of reality is like Oh am I</font>

594
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:31,810
hacked or am I secure however flake made

595
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:33,730
this point in a keynote<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple of</font>

596
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:36,100
weeks<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago is that you can never really</font>

597
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:39,130
tell whether a system is hacked or

598
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:43,449
secure that led<font color="#CCCCCC"> me to my third axiom</font>

599
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:47,440
which I call as Schrodinger's hack let

600
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:50,050
us take a cat put it in a box with

601
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:53,140
poison connected to a Geiger counter and

602
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:56,080
close the<font color="#E5E5E5"> box you don't know if a system</font>

603
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:57,580
is hacked or secure but let's just

604
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,100
accept the fact that it is hacked and

605
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:03,790
secure at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same time every system</font>

606
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:05,800
exists in two states<font color="#CCCCCC"> parallely it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

607
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:08,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you choose to inspect will you</font>

608
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:10,870
learn the truth as to what the state<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

609
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:12,879
the system is I mean this is basically

610
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:16,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">the rationale for penetration testing</font>

611
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:19,180
and what this axiom translates to is

612
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,550
basically test is realistically do<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

613
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:24,340
test with bullshit assumptions today

614
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:26,530
whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm ordered to the pen test you</font>

615
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:28,480
rather have the foregone conclusion that

616
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:31,930
they want to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the system is</font>

617
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:34,270
secure so what kind of testing will come

618
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:35,770
out with this outcome if you want to

619
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:38,230
test and prove that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a system is secure</font>

620
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:40,860
here are the rules this is the testing

621
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:42,970
strategy that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes asked to do</font>

622
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:44,530
wait for a new production<font color="#E5E5E5"> build Oh</font>

623
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:46,000
everything's would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed in next bill</font>

624
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:48,879
don't test now we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to test later</font>

625
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,130
great don't test on products and only

626
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,840
test on uat because production is

627
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:55,230
fragile like a butterfly you know if you

628
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:58,090
can't let it go down<font color="#E5E5E5"> for whatever</font>

629
00:28:55,230 --> 00:29:00,790
perform non intrusive testing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

630
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:02,669
great it's like me trying me getting a

631
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:05,680
massage without the<font color="#CCCCCC"> massager</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> touching me</font>

632
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:07,090
fantastic and then all of these by the

633
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,980
way are out of scope no social

634
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:11,169
engineering no mobile attacks no doing

635
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:12,820
this no doing that great tell that to a

636
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:15,580
real attacker that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is out of scope</font>

637
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:18,159
mind you and lastly<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh test during</font>

638
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:21,340
off-peak hours which basically means 5am

639
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:23,290
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> four a.m. and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only when Saturn is in</font>

640
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:25,659
the right constellation and it's a

641
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:27,820
wetness day and you know you're wearing

642
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:29,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">something orange otherwise</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't test</font>

643
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:31,000
the system is going to keel over and die

644
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:33,910
yeah if you test this way then your

645
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,390
system is secure if<font color="#E5E5E5"> not consider that</font>

646
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:41,190
there is a problem

647
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:43,350
the the force axiom basically if you

648
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:47,850
can't measure some if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't measure</font>

649
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:50,939
something you cannot use security is all

650
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:53,580
about metrics and this was kind of this

651
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:55,049
point had really home last year<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I</font>

652
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:57,299
was listening<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a keynote by Marcus</font>

653
00:29:55,049 --> 00:30:01,168
<font color="#CCCCCC">raynham he made a great point about</font>

654
00:29:57,299 --> 00:30:04,889
keeping matrix and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> metrics do for</font>

655
00:30:01,169 --> 00:30:07,320
enabling<font color="#CCCCCC"> InfoSec matrix basically proved</font>

656
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:09,929
the point of what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing whether</font>

657
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:12,389
you succeeding whether you're failing it

658
00:30:09,929 --> 00:30:14,909
is a way of appreciating the blue team's

659
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:17,730
efforts it is a way for telling the

660
00:30:14,909 --> 00:30:20,520
board<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is what reality is it is</font>

661
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:23,789
the way for telling users what to do or

662
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:27,750
what not to do matrix security without

663
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:29,669
matrix is meaningless security how do

664
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:31,140
you establish matrix with several

665
00:30:29,669 --> 00:30:32,490
factors and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at a few</font>

666
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:34,260
of them it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not enough time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

667
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:37,289
keynote to go through all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the list</font>

668
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:39,030
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically take anything that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

669
00:30:37,289 --> 00:30:41,820
measurable from your<font color="#E5E5E5"> security data</font>

670
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:43,408
warehouse measure it and see where<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

671
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:45,418
trend is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going up is it</font>

672
00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:47,730
going down and what do these up and down

673
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:51,380
trends mean is it improving<font color="#CCCCCC"> things or is</font>

674
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:54,299
it degrading things most importantly

675
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:56,820
matrix are your best defense against

676
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:59,100
bullshit there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of bullshit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

677
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:01,500
there and sad fact is to defend against

678
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:04,289
bullshit you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten times the energy</font>

679
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:06,780
for defending against bullshit than to

680
00:31:04,289 --> 00:31:08,370
produce it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only with metrics that</font>

681
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:10,559
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prove your case in point</font>

682
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:12,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">as a succeeding or failing because</font>

683
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,620
somebody else<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the board will come and</font>

684
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:15,299
say that hey we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move to the</font>

685
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:17,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">cloud and save half a million dollars</font>

686
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:19,799
they're pulling their numbers from their

687
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:21,149
asses but if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have metrics you</font>

688
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:23,220
can't say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a completely</font>

689
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:25,289
bullshit move they say oh we're here

690
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:29,210
prove me wrong and<font color="#CCCCCC"> here's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> numbers to</font>

691
00:31:25,289 --> 00:31:34,679
prove you wrong speaking about metrics

692
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:37,950
it's time we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about users by users I</font>

693
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:39,570
mean not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just the organization's own</font>

694
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:42,150
employees but the organization's

695
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:44,309
customers as well users in the

696
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:48,690
collective sense of anybody who is using

697
00:31:44,309 --> 00:31:49,230
your organization's resources we<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

698
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:51,600
play

699
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:54,870
the users or failure and it is time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

700
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:56,879
kind of change this notion we cannot

701
00:31:54,870 --> 00:32:00,239
continue blaming users for everything

702
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:02,730
now granted users do suck but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> truth</font>

703
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">is it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that one size fits all</font>

704
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:07,890
users we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> treating users with the</font>

705
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:09,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">same thing yeah with my internet banking</font>

706
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:12,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">they'll force me to change my password</font>

707
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:14,370
every month like this aight character

708
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:16,770
bullshit nonsense it's time<font color="#E5E5E5"> we abandoned</font>

709
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:19,530
this type of stupid narrow-minded

710
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:21,840
thinking you have a ridiculously complex

711
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:23,700
password why force me into changing it

712
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,860
every month because<font color="#E5E5E5"> some jackass auditor</font>

713
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:29,220
said so that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> how it should be done</font>

714
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:31,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mean the truth is users if they are</font>

715
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:34,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">not guided properly they're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

716
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:35,490
stupid things concessionaire sport that

717
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:39,770
a user is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pick dancing things</font>

718
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:42,750
over security for any opportunity and

719
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:45,510
technology also is a kinetic enabler for

720
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:47,760
stupidity because if you give<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology</font>

721
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:49,710
to the hands of users then they do fun

722
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,809
things like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> they treat their debit</font>

723
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:56,580
cards how do you defend against such

724
00:32:51,809 --> 00:32:59,520
users but this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> emmys this is kind</font>

725
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:02,820
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem is out there the truth is</font>

726
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:05,730
we as an industry have not made much

727
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:08,220
headway in terms of user hardening

but is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not done a lot about user</font>

730
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:15,719
hardening so how do you do user

731
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:17,580
hardening first you pull<font color="#CCCCCC"> out those</font>

732
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:20,970
metrics from your security<font color="#CCCCCC"> data</font>

733
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:23,040
warehouse you draw a curve and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

734
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:25,919
how your initial curve will look like

739
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:39,900
you are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to divide your user base</font>

to be applied to this one force of the

well-meaning users they will do the

right thing but they are not guided

763
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:40,359
properly it is this one fourth slice

764
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:43,449
your job as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> seesaw is to guide them</font>

765

well and try to shift them to being

proactive users the curve will

767

automatically shift and then let the

00:34:52,690 --> 00:35:03,490
problem coming to axiom number six it is

actively look for attackers let us put

784
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:37,690
bills and seeing where the money flows

785
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:40,030
the idea is not to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop the propagation</font>

786
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:42,280
but to learn and lead us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the greater</font>

788
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:48,190
or where the cartels are apply these

00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:52,330
techniques towards apply these

790
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:58,960
techniques towards creative defense and

791
00:35:52,330 --> 00:36:02,049
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last axiom is basically the seesaw</font>

792
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:04,600
has to make security visible the seesaw

has to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> defense visible the seesaw</font>

794
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:09,990
has to make defense count<font color="#CCCCCC"> and visibility</font>

795
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:12,310
extends all over visible to the customer

796
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:14,500
take Google's example they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a</font>

00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:16,390
great<font color="#CCCCCC"> job of telling the user where they</font>

change they are the power to log people

802
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:30,490
off these type of measurements should we

803
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:32,380
also brought up not only to users but to

red team's and eventually to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the board</font>

806
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:39,850
is well how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you make security count</font>

807
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:41,440
what makes visible defense I mean

808
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:43,870
there's several things you can have

809
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,880
several line items it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

810
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:48,040
for visible defense there's a few

811
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:50,650
thoughts first of all that maturity

812
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:53,920
curve keep improving that maturity curve

813
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:56,200
keep checking it keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> pushing it</font>

814
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,450
whatever needs to be done has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

815
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:02,350
if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working try a different</font>

time the time taken for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the blue team to</font>

challenging them to keep detecting

faster and faster and<font color="#E5E5E5"> let them go</font>

822
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:19,180
do it tell them what to do and let them

823
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:22,629
surprise you with with new ways of doing

in infosec I mean this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a paradoxical</font>

situation if you do cool things smarter
