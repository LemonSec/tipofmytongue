00:00:15,379 --> 00:00:20,230
that's that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty significant so I</font>

use for all areas of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the business and</font>

though we work really hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> minimize</font>

11
00:00:33,949 --> 00:00:39,790
our risk I know there will always be

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,320
some dependencies that we can't avoid

13
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:45,050
we're all in this together no one really

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,660
does anything alone even if you're a

15
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:49,550
company that builds vos the productivity

hardware vendor or the chip manufacturer

19
00:00:53,420 --> 00:01:04,640

<font color="#E5E5E5">companies that look like they kind of do</font>

22
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:11,240
it all still have external dependencies

33
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,830
we're still leaning on each other like a

bunch of row houses with old wooden

35

37

vulnerable the smaller vendors have your

resources and less to spend on security

39
00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:58,959
they might<font color="#CCCCCC"> not even have a security team</font>

not large enough to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font>

their website

53
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:31,080
so thinking like an attacker<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to</font>

00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:33,600
look for smaller companies startups are

55
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,270
I usually fairly resource constrained

56
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,190
and for some reason everyone man right

there are depicted<font color="#E5E5E5"> as rockets so I kind</font>

of went with that theme some of you may

00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:44,850
recognize this one so let's say you're a

fantastic I saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> syntek I saw big media</font>

71
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,940
sites I saw a popular social network

72
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:17,730
social startups like to list of us a

73
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:20,160
bunch of customers so that their their

74
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:21,780
target customers can see oh well if so

75
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,980
in cells using<font color="#CCCCCC"> Evans</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then maybe it</font>

76
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,200
something I should investigate it gives

77
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:27,720
some credibility that's fantastic<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

78
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,320
also great for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us in this regard as we</font>

79
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:33,180
are targeting their customers so look

80
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,820
them up on linkedin and<font color="#E5E5E5"> TechCrunch Oh</font>

81
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,290
they've got less than<font color="#E5E5E5"> 200 employees as I</font>

82
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,430
can see on linkedin and there's not

83
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:41,040
doesn't seem to be anyone with a

84
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,750
security title of any sort there's one

85
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">network engineer that used to work in</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the security role in a previous position</font>

87
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,390
but no one as far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can tell who</font>

88
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:51,359
specifically assigned a security in this

89
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:53,609
in this organization I look at the open

90
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,790
jobs posted on their website and there's

91
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:58,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">nothing for security rules I'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rather</font>

92
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,640
security white paper and it says

93
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,650
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> along the lines of we take</font>

94
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:04,380
security very seriously so you know

95
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,670
that's sincere even apparently they

96
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,530
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> bother to hire anyone in security</font>

97
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:09,450
but they worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a third</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> party to</font>

98
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:11,790
perform security audit oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay fantastic</font>

99
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:15,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">that could be something so maybe that's</font>

100
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:16,200
a sophisticated manual inspection of the

101
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,299
code they're writing looking for new

102
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,890
vulnerabilities but maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>

103
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:21,719
security vendor that rims a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

104
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:23,700
tools against their very infrastructure

105
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,370
and turned out<font color="#E5E5E5"> an automated report and</font>

106
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:28,110
they check the box and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've done it</font>

107
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:32,100
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be either of those right or</font>

108
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:33,150
anywhere in between so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> check out</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">with technologies are listed there</font>

110
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,739
they're using and I'll add those to a

111
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,360
list

112
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:41,630
alist like it's longer over time and

113
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,400
i'll just wait and since<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can do this</font>

114
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:45,289
easily for lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies my list</font>

115
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,599
gets pretty big and eventually something

116
00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:50,090
will hit eventually a vulnerability will

117
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:51,620
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> found it will be posted someplace</font>

118
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,969
public I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do any work the</font>

119
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,050
bug was posted someone found the bugs

120
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:55,340
lonely and then someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> else comes lon</font>

121
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:59,120
writes a script concept for me how

122
00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:00,650
convenient that makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it very easy and I</font>

123
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,419
cannot produce opportunistically move in

124
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:04,130
before the patch is deployed because

125
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:07,310
these organizations without security

126
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:10,159
teams are not going to be able to deploy

127
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:13,490
security fixes as fast as say somebody

128
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:15,229
with somebody assigned to go beat<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

129

130
00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:20,030
got to stop everything and go fix this

131
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:22,130
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't have to do much work in the</font>

287
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,520
expected is that when DNS goes down you

288
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,040
can't log into critical systems because

289

octa is down and your whole organization

00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,610
and then you turn to Twitter to try and

00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:17,589
connect with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your customers and that's</font>

295
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:21,130
about what's happening because all the

296
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:23,410
media sites that you turn to are also

297
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:24,670
down and all these cloud companies use

298
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:27,490
each other so they're all having the

299
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:32,140
same problems with you so how many other

300
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:34,330
services are positioned like that well

307
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,850
almost four hours and you know it's

308
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,740
clear we're getting nothing done today

309
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:05,110
and that was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> caused by human error</font>

310
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:06,880
and there's no avoiding that so we'll do

311
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:11,230
what we can write will build in

312
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:12,130
redundancy for availability and make

our data will review our vendors and

316
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:20,500
encourage them to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> choices that meet</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">our security requirements so we'll still</font>

319
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:28,329
more vendors than most of us can really

get comfortable<font color="#E5E5E5"> with I hate ending talks</font>

321
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:32,800
with doom and gloom so I spent some<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

322
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:36,000
looking for a positive<font color="#CCCCCC"> note to end on</font>

323
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:39,670
and then I<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember to my audiences here</font>

324
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,130
so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is whether you're on offense or</font>

325
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:45,209
defense we're all going to be employed

00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:45,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">for a long time</font>
