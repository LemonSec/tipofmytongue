these competitions the first one would

7
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:28,640
be the security in machine learning

8
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:30,920
challenge it started early yesterday

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,289

28
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">been following</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Dylan on Facebook or</font>

29
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">Twitter you realize that he's been</font>

30
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,929
posting about<font color="#CCCCCC"> AI probably every hour</font>

31
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:33,450
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> close close to that goes with that</font>

32
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:37,409
yeah the worn-out is an understatement

33
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:39,179
right yeah so we're really glad<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

34
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:42,380
here we had a workshop yesterday on

35
00:01:39,179 --> 00:01:46,110
using machine learning in infosec and

36
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:48,080
received pretty good feedback and we so

37
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:51,030
Dylan<font color="#E5E5E5"> somehow managed to get these</font>

38
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:53,939
nvidia jets and tx2 devices yeah so

39
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically for those of you are not</font>

40
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:57,449
familiar like<font color="#CCCCCC"> nvidia makes graphics</font>

41
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,100
cards right and so those graphic arts it

42
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,049
can also really they're really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good at</font>

43
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,880
math so they're very useful for<font color="#CCCCCC"> building</font>

44
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:05,970
your own networks and training them and

45
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,318
the Jetson nvidia device the<font color="#CCCCCC"> techs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

46
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,910
came out<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think like what two years ago</font>

47
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:10,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">something of that so it's like</font>

48
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,920
innovative platform that you can use to

49
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:16,410
do 3d graphics and<font color="#E5E5E5"> AI stuff and the tx2</font>

50
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,630
just got launched you can buy it now but

51
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:20,459
it's not even<font color="#E5E5E5"> shipping so i wrote nvidia</font>

52
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:22,049
said hey dudes like we've got this

53
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:23,700
machine learning lab that we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

54
00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:25,440
hack at the box in amsterdam and we

55
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be quite nice if we</font>

56
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,790
could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a challenge alongside that</font>

57
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,980
and award the winners at the x2 because

58
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:35,519
it's pretty cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would like to have</font>

59
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:37,738
one so we had basically two challenges

60
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:41,130
one was the network challenge we have to

61
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:42,660
figure out if the traffic is genuine

62
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,370
traffic or is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is malicious traffic</font>

63
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,840
and since we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the security</font>

64
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:49,260
conference we had a lot of malicious

65
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,940
traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> will ask too much so yeah and</font>

66
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,950
the other challenge was<font color="#E5E5E5"> malware</font>

67
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,049
classification where you would figure

68
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:59,160
out if the executables are malicious are

69
00:02:55,049 --> 00:03:03,870
a bit not malicious and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the team</font>

70
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:07,290
did something similar and we are we are

71
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:09,900
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> too yeah so before we announce the</font>

72
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:12,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">winner there's an honorable</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mention so</font>

73
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,069
we receive quite quite a few submissions

74
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:17,910
they were interesting so we won't

75
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:19,589
mention them all but Matthew Joy's who I

76
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:21,930
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently is already on a flight</font>

77
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:23,909
back home he did something interesting

78
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:25,739
with the Twitter API using machine

79
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:26,970
learning the classified but accounts and

80
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,740
he was<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually pretty successful at it</font>

81
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:38,970
so let's give a hand for me

82
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:43,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">Joyce but the winning team if we're</font>

83
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:43,490
gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of drum roll roll</font>

84
00:03:44,480 --> 00:04:06,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> winning team</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a group it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> niko</font>

85
00:03:48,270 --> 00:04:12,510
and metio from the Imperium oh yeah you

86
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:16,049
have to tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> us what company calls</font>

87
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:19,560
Imperium we made more security so we

88
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:22,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a very big database of apks that we</font>

89
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,990
have labeled as malware or no my man

90
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">world and what we did was to attract all</font>

91
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:33,930
the permissions of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> APK and random</font>

92
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:35,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">forest to classify</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them there's a</font>

93
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:38,820
machine learning model could tell apart

94
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:40,950
if it's a genuine a bigger or malicious

95
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,469
APK which is an Android application file

96
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:45,469
and we did that shit out and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's turned</font>

131
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:38,409
were teams and there were challenges

132
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:41,050
this year we were supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have 24</font>

133
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:44,259
challenges one accidentally broke so we

134
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:47,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">only had 23 challenges which makes for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

135
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:50,310
total of fifty six hundred points in the

136
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:54,758
game to solve the challenge we had

137
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:56,740
originally<font color="#E5E5E5"> 24 teams to had to cancel but</font>

138

also to showed up last minute to fill

139
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:04,180
the place so we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> did have all 24</font>

140
00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:07,240
teams on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> arena from the 24 teams</font>

141
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:09,130
only 11 were Dutch<font color="#E5E5E5"> that means I think</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> first time that the CTF</font>
