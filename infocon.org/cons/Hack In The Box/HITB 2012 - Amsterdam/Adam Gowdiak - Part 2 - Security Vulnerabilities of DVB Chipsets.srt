1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,760
the yo

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,339
a I appreciate that so

3
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:10,880
this will be a second of our

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,080
project yeah

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,220
yes them this time

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,670
here the more technical

7
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:26,090
other by

8
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:32,320
break of

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,610
you want to continue well

10
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,980
Cup

11
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:43,079
prefer like about the

12
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,660
like okay the paperclip

13
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:53,660
that goal

14
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,480
the buffet likely be fam

15
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,370
gorrid security I very hard work
component

16
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:05,379
as well good of

17
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:09,180
again disclaimer this topic even more
faith

18
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,060
one I once again both

19
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:17,200
confirmation provide for educate upon

20
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:24,200
go

21
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:30,330
group so why bother bob Corker

22
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,810
security up digital for tonight the
youth

23
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,670
they up

24
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:40,840
I Pepe you

25
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,660
call like hey

26
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:51,660
higher great very

27
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,840
call

28
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,660
whether perfect couple year text

29
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:26,660
type form

30
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:35,200
gossamer

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,430
good some

32
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:51,650
a book

33
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:57,800
3 on

34
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:04,800
by grip smart because information about
the right strikes and but

35
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:47,310
you can contact so when it comes to the
controller switch out which are out

36
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:47,910
there

37
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:52,730
Dickey Hall that the whole thing here
and come to the security of its the

38
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:53,850
fertile a key suspect

39
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:57,110
effect 64 bit secret key just to the
scramble

40
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:04,110
and cryptic mpg streams their use for
all UV

41
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:08,019
HBO uses different keys %uh for example
Fox had

42
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:11,780
there at American automatically by the
content provider the oil change

43
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:15,840
every 10 seconds yeah there are
different Keith

44
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,329
I'll text you and even Keith and the
keys

45
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:22,460
approach cost the for the cleanup
devices and cryptic for

46
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,990
I'm usually yeah

47
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:27,020
and some kind of a mixture crippled just
for the purpose

48
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:34,020
and the keys are carried and entitlement
come from message app score

49
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:43,650
they contain the this Scott and the
message for my the specific to

50
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:48,050
difranco condition of a system bandar
saw

51
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:51,639
their keep of MPEG stream: carrying

52
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:54,979
giving ATM messages can be denoted can
be found by

53
00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:58,430
by some she a descriptor which is
usually

54
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:05,430
broadcast the best part of elementary
streams associated with I

55
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:11,240
are you the system to protect contact
and the satellite

56
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,480
the box environment so it's simply make
sure that certain criteria

57
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:20,610
are for a few before access to the
content to scramble content is cracked a

58
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,350
given user

59
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:25,820
saw this is a subscriber smart car which
halted formation about subscriber

60
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:30,080
access take your programming and it hot
information to

61
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:37,060
you know what programming packages are
pure more

62
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,599
says which means paying subscribers can
the crypt

63
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:45,300
cryptic programming saw and this is the
septa box the vice

64
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,940
at smart car give me the comptroller

65
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:54,060
key fall this program year and Sep Smart
Covers Canara Easter

66
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,479
the cultural or key on that you vicki
venues or some type

67
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:01,229
to watch cue track so this is basically

68
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:05,419
this architecture we got this again to
scramble to MPEG stream:

69
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:09,009
have we got a spark describe a bench
MPEG stream:

70
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:14,570
pick up

71
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,100
and smart car able to the crypt

72
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,660
those keys but the keys hey what are
your stats crumbling

73
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,310
for the scramble to contact are on our
knees by the Smart car

74
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:30,360
beef the user's allow to view it even
contact so I'm of course

75
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,780
on account for this model there are some
threat so

76
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:37,290
the primary for a comes from the fact
that

77
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:41,790
all the crime in caucus and a trip to
the Pro for Casa to all subscribers

78
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:48,280
anthers on me I

79
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,290
on brawl subscriber in your been tougher
to like it that were

80
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:56,100
that subscriber come for a couple
subscribe to all premium channels

81
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,240
and then can start releasing the crypto
keys 20

82
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,320
the scrambled egg peach and mpg streams

83
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,790
so and this is why

84
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:10,500
security the this stuff try to beat us
she came up with some other solution

85
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,160
which is called the condition of the
system with cheetah

86
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,300
firing and this solution I seventy tries
to hi

87
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:24,259
cultural arts were

88
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:28,159
he said that controller arbitron for a
given device

89
00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:31,939
and forgiven chipset so this inning and

90
00:07:31,939 --> 00:07:35,159
Clyde between the smart card and that
kinda by device

91
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:39,639
so the he got caught them her
distributions prevented because

92
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:43,249
you cannot share the key switch are
different for every subscriber

93
00:07:43,249 --> 00:07:46,870
yeah every subscriber ever smart card
for hiciste different keys

94
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:50,090
good to attract even acceptable but
there's pairing

95
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:53,930
Sep the box and the Smart car I'm

96
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:59,170
I

97
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:03,280
here we got does the pairing

98
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,340
this this Marquis ball box and this is
the current function

99
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:11,810
and what departing das it simply Heights
uniquely thais

100
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:15,320
hair except the box device at the Smart
car

101
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,760
and the college to make sure that the
controller keys

102
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,960
are ultra I hope the same for every
subscriber

103
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,120
so when it comes to the current faction

104
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:32,120
extreme not much s this now about it
when it comes to a different look

105
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:37,550
basically this is a cryptographic key
function tight affect the box the vice

106
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,800
versa try Chris Marker

107
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,719
YouTube has this form saw that actual

108
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,149
anti-tank is accomplishment the use of
some encryption

109
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:51,209
however it and and what's yours and and
despairing faction

110
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:55,199
one of the key act terms is the
Comptroller starring

111
00:08:55,199 --> 00:08:58,300
this is actually the key which issuing
print subscriber

112
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,750
and this is the key that makes the
current faction

113
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:08,750
unique for each pair

114
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,940
bias digital satellite TV operator

115
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,209
at the time of activating a given your
subscription at the time of

116
00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:19,810
activity friction disc effective
acceptable everything for the smart and

117
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:20,420
usually

118
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:24,279
for the security purposes this key issue
any fiction

119
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:29,240
its me think even pp chipset saw

120
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,040
Comox as one of the leading provider so

121
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:40,040
the promise not to sell warships a
pairing

122
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,850
for your social shopper hardcore and
because of the chipset

123
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:49,089
parrying functionality they meet so

124
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:52,389
a partnership with different chipset
vendors

125
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:55,880
and/or it to be able to properly income
and that bitch

126
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,980
for perfection I champs are one of the
how the fender select

127
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:02,089
Michael Clarke's Broadcom wrath of
technologies

128
00:10:02,089 --> 00:10:05,699
had et cetera saw I

129
00:10:05,699 --> 00:10:12,699
because Comox an awesome make sure to

130
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:19,340
party saw come back for rice mandatory
comprehensive evaluation hell for all

131
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,330
the chipset

132
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:24,610
and that the are supposed to rock they
are kinda shocked a system which is

133
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:25,200
supporting

134
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,370
this is done and at that different the
brothers from the work

135
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:31,480
so those ships Sr damn

136
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,380
later issued some kind of Renault
scarring and the scoring a certified in

137
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,060
writing by

138
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:41,240
contact chief security officer more
information can be found and the Cox

139
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,960
website but when I want us

140
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:49,259
so use that this

141
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:53,240
that's the case of an asshole compaq
okay so

142
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,360
this gonna be about the be cheap sex I
gave you

143
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,459
from introduction to the commission of a
felony how

144
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:02,490
the security a cock and works and
ditched

145
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:07,509
likely for for TV chipset actually
implement the car function I drop which

146
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:09,319
is related to the having of

147
00:11:09,319 --> 00:11:13,399
MPEG transport stream and different out
if you update us all

148
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:16,529
think that the kids are in bed at the
desk romping they

149
00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:23,529
kantor audio and video decoding graphic
display

150
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,870
but that the system on chips with
different trip from dedicated course

151
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:33,190
inside so this is fun up the
implementation so

152
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:36,579
does she said this is the FBI said 130
single chips

153
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:40,670
high definition for above the Qatar this
is actually the architects of the cheap

154
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:43,459
you can see how many component the rock
yes oh

155
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:47,790
is pretty complex system but that's a
cheap use in fact the box

156
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,850
ask for running called

157
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,560
but also for 40 mpg and

158
00:11:53,560 --> 00:12:00,560
happy campers come this is the other
chicks everywhere

159
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,720
at the generation model the single-chip
hi def interested with a collar

160
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,770
a little bit different architecture but
still a complex system

161
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:12,240
saw the

162
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,110
York lol the specification basis at
which were also shot a

163
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:22,029
during the presentation and his workday
set-top boxes all up there were running

164
00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:23,520
up on Vesta my Clickbank

165
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:28,310
chipset so and we found out that get or
two generations for peace

166
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:35,310
cheap such a harsh on integration 20 and
there

167
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,330
but when it comes to breaking the beach

168
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:45,380
so show you gonna clan this popular at
some point of time when you work with

169
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,800
the fact a boxer 3 just talk to
challenge and decided to see

170
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,600
if something could be done with respect
to the security of content by the mall

171
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,180
or coke

172
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:57,720
and so the security chat challenges
regarding

173
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,320
the breaking be chipsets are like the
company to the fact that not much

174
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,570
it now overstepped helping or not much
just how

175
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:11,190
respect to you know how to her

176
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:15,210
for such here to cut a piece of she
calmed yeah so how to adjust

177
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:19,530
stopped working with this so many on on
the committee interface

178
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:24,170
man you know I'm no implementation up
the cryptographic algorithm Keith

179
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:28,990
lots of I'm not stuff with pretty
challenging think so how come

180
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:32,010
we were able to brake a couple of cheap
saw

181
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:35,620
and it Tiffany talk the major in Kildare

182
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:42,620
1.5 your time we we stand on this
project softness of

183
00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:49,249
gather and glue together many pieces of
information that we called them

184
00:13:49,249 --> 00:13:52,600
close and by doing so we are was
possible for us what

185
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,999
on it to discover how certain chipsets
war but we are also able to find

186
00:13:56,999 --> 00:13:58,179
security vulnerabilities

187
00:13:58,179 --> 00:14:02,339
that of course we built a couple of told
because you know

188
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:05,449
now lower course are very important
because

189
00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:10,059
got the call to order probably be able
to finish most power projects so

190
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:17,059
some of the common approaches when it
comes to working with different

191
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:22,300
cation yes all week we took some

192
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,709
information from database available on
that

193
00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:28,839
St dot com website and you know

194
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,430
they did contain from generic
information about the chief architect

195
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:33,350
say how about some

196
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:37,380
obsessed and some comp on banks and you
know what kind of

197
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:41,380
a cars were in sight and for what
purpose

198
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,639
they were used but actually there wasn't
much yes so

199
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,220
but in all something is better than
nothing yep thought

200
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:55,220
it still having worked for a

201
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,760
and cheer some device drivers we had
full access to the set-top box service

202
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,260
why this is the second cup yet

203
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,740
its building on the practice top we have
full access to set the focus for the

204
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:09,300
the Knox RSS a debate drivers we started
talking aesthetically analyze

205
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,019
share

206
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:13,389
fine there is available systems what he
wanted to find out

207
00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:17,139
you little to find out device drivers
that handled

208
00:15:17,139 --> 00:15:20,529
controller some way yeah so inspect the

209
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:24,300
libraries we checked the print them both
only find some clothes some

210
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:31,300
some information and the

211
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:36,839
the security key and and mpg the scrum
so we had just like all the fighter ever

212
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:40,379
s to keep the MATV driver they offer
different shapes our

213
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:44,209
because the two different drivers for
the Frenchies for the she chips are

214
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:46,309
different saw

215
00:15:46,309 --> 00:15:50,199
it wasn't enough because you know
knowing which device driver

216
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:53,249
is responsible for something hey it's
just maybe

217
00:15:53,249 --> 00:15:57,279
Ducato total lot of clothes so for you
want to find out which

218
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,619
which thanks a lot actually responsible
for you know

219
00:16:00,619 --> 00:16:06,660
applauding the key to that server

220
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,850
runtime: analysis engine we we we
implemented on a set top box

221
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:14,160
at the bottom fireman the US our smart
car

222
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,759
are y'all instrumentation functionality
recently snooped fought for their friend

223
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:21,050
he/she a message is sent to the car

224
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:24,110
we hey watch for the response says

225
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:27,230
returned by the car and one of these
risks of

226
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:30,420
you know those responses were and
bedding here

227
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,899
the encrypt controller yeah because we
were working with that

228
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:38,710
ships up

229
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:42,170
actual API feeding work there controller

230
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:45,500
was simply started to talk to your
superior tracing

231
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,080
and we found out that there are some I
saw secured which are taking the same

232
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,950
arguments as returned by the smart card
so

233
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:54,990
I think this recently caught correlate
data

234
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:58,460
and we could find out you know which API
with what's happening to the key

235
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,330
decryption

236
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:02,690
killing for the cheap far some other

237
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:06,450
very important thing also York on the
way up to

238
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:09,690
running New York primary with the shot
for and

239
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:14,209
digital satellite

240
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:17,190
which is called TMK and thats service

241
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:20,839
along that the major or bitter fight
provider

242
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:25,000
it provides different set top box estan
it also has compact car

243
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,790
but what interesting here respect to the
key and K

244
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:32,730
and it's %uh for tonight qaidi hair the
same

245
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:35,740
audio and video streams are propped cost
to the platform

246
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:38,790
and Kim K the

247
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:45,790
subscribers so bach there a separate
condition like 30 for me

248
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:52,300
stripers what that man but simply meant
we could look up

249
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,750
information with the use of pure it up i
PI

250
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,760
and we could find out there identify it

251
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,250
I think identifiers up to streams which
were carrying

252
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:05,300
does Ischia messages so we could find a
stream

253
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:09,990
for the hair at the first one is for the
key and K

254
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:15,100
ok 00 conditional access system ID and
the other is ok 01

255
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:22,100
the conditional access IP for the
platform at

256
00:18:23,779 --> 00:18:26,309
messages and we started off you same

257
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:30,539
pain yes send messages being should at
the same time of time

258
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:35,529
but a capital P we've

259
00:18:35,529 --> 00:18:42,529
the project for so what

260
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:49,210
yeah

261
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:56,210
on like Donkey I

262
00:19:02,199 --> 00:19:06,329
official week we we started to feed
different share messages tho

263
00:19:06,329 --> 00:19:11,059
different Kim K card and but the result
we receive

264
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:14,729
was that now pick a card

265
00:19:14,729 --> 00:19:19,549
were responding furnishing the key 6
exactly the same keys

266
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:23,129
a different car what that what that mean
meant for us it that the

267
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:27,209
can make a cunt we're not using cheap
sectarian so they are at issue

268
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:34,209
plain text the prescription Keith we
could use

269
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,820
control work keys or at least but the
main

270
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:44,690
it's for tonight you properly worked
with I'm elevation proceed problems

271
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:47,830
you know what I think it fit roseanne

272
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:50,850
because I change the flight and there is
no response

273
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:57,850
the project or throw them

274
00:20:29,509 --> 00:20:31,210
his make ice

275
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:34,840
patrols in the protectors for them a
change the site

276
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:41,840
it's showing

277
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:52,410
alright I just cooking I don't have a
picture here so have 10 the next text

278
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:57,980
and now I'm trying to to tell a little
bit more about how to STI 7100 chipset

279
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:58,260
was

280
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,550
help broken so well

281
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:05,350
we know the device driver the the
implemented the the

282
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:12,230
faction IT related to their keep the
crib something

283
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:16,169
this that's what the crib s k function
so

284
00:21:16,169 --> 00:21:19,260
by analyzing the device driver

285
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,820
coat the binary code yes I find out
something about the corporation Bangkok

286
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,159
they find out that

287
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:28,980
third there are some that the cheapest
working to secure Maltby find out that

288
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,200
the cheapest was not using

289
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,340
yes Keith the final fight for us what
the register us the

290
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:37,980
a mocking for the memory defroster the
Chiefs

291
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:41,900
register spacewalk memory mapped in
parallel to the is for the

292
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:47,630
for the car a memory

293
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:51,670
US for programming a given cheap here
but something by analyzing the

294
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:55,480
the cold up to that crap SK function

295
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,530
%ah I just wish it was visible because
now I have a picture

296
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:03,820
you know if it's just like a

297
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:10,820
$1000 worth a so have the

298
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:21,040
for sure

299
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,640
I'll

300
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:33,640
for you

301
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,860
for

302
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,120
Bell tel fine reif

303
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,450
and I binary quite easier accessible

304
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:49,529
from a shack fine yes our they shouldn't
have had

305
00:22:49,529 --> 00:22:56,529
effective hi

306
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,650
show

307
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:04,140
told or so much information

308
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:08,110
fashion called function shot

309
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:14,190
good to have device driver

310
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:18,670
find out are

311
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:22,900
operation he also by analyzing fashion
fair

312
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:29,900
for fiction

313
00:23:32,429 --> 00:23:38,460
you're able to right fear I got for she

314
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,470
picture

315
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:48,470
kinda there

316
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:39,539
0

317
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:56,630
0

318

to Texas and was 35 saw this is the
formal offer the crypt of Rick's

340
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:57,710
yet this is factual know how but that
the concept of America time for us keep

341
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:58,140
def

342
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:02,210
so I'm missus the probable source of the

343
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:05,570
Peter this is the image of the ICI 7100

344
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:09,170
chipset and we think that the buckets
here at the CP

345
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:13,130
component the trip to process or we
think that this is a trip to process

346
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:19,690
very quick and just expect from the
location but it's close to

347
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:22,559
stuff act so on so

348
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,690
but actually inside crypto iight

349
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:29,240
actually in fact that you can chipset
saw

350
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:33,870
that was the easy part and now more
difficult part which is related to the

351
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:36,100
SCI SCI said one on cheap Sep

352
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:40,779
that's more advice chipset and
completely different from the one we

353
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:44,850
we at ProCare before and it US

354
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:49,159
a different St to keep DMA chief
component this chick component course

355
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:56,000
also using walk

356
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,070
no loading different keys to the cheap
like no control over its current

357
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:04,889
yes Keith on the other hand because the
STI 710 monoliths

358
00:30:04,889 --> 00:30:07,899
I'm bad at an acceptable environment
which course

359
00:30:07,899 --> 00:30:11,399
and which had at different architecture
you know

360
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:14,950
more dynamic East pink libraries more
modular architecture course

361
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:19,169
easier for us to reverse and sheer the
operation of the whole system

362
00:30:19,169 --> 00:30:26,169
we also had some support for crypto de
Mayo parade

363
00:30:27,429 --> 00:30:31,350
but reversed and there are lots of
kernel symbols we had like six 100

364
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:33,640
eighty kilobytes of kernel semaphore

365
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,660
enough or reverse engineer this is like
a gold mine yeah

366
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:41,670
so we find out by errors are cheering
the

367
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:45,559
operation of the system that there a
different memory mopped

368
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:48,600
cheap re just for different Keith saw

369
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:53,150
we had some keeps went 10-1 and the card
when it comes to this so

370
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:56,240
first of all we that used with the help
of some

371
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:02,890
turn on your Lovelight very same boat

372
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:07,090
re just that we're responsible for this
crumbling the perverse possible for

373
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,370
holding strumming keys

374
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:11,530
we also able to find out from
information

375
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:14,600
about the region which was responsible
for

376
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:18,560
in of some cryptic him a key saw those
two regions

377
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:23,230
and the symbols according to Cole and
and actual compaq's

378
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:26,680
the Caldwells US and that how the coat

379
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:30,050
what's was packed with them both it
helped of talk

380
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:33,120
gather again information about the
friendship regions

381
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:39,049
for

382
00:31:39,049 --> 00:31:42,619
are a hypocrite for the email pressure
the majority of all cryptographic

383
00:31:42,619 --> 00:31:43,110
operations

384
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:46,820
we also reverse engineer that library
but this was crazy work

385
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:50,549
because we need to go ap from the
library leather

386
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:53,730
down to that device driver leather and
then

387
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:57,259
at the device rival ever will also
needed to see and I'll

388
00:31:57,259 --> 00:32:01,539
how this propagates to their cheap are
your programming register saw the sauce

389
00:32:01,539 --> 00:32:04,739
all about trucking different values you
something single

390
00:32:04,739 --> 00:32:07,860
bits and just to see you know how talk

391
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:14,840
you know program at

392
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:19,190
that sort of stuff how how to help keep
so we also wrote some custom Java some

393
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:20,440
proteins that we did this

394
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,270
just because we wanted to make sure that
what we are doing with

395
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:27,630
our coat API and the crypt the car
library worth

396
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:31,580
actually correct saw this with the court
first case in a park ripped operations

397
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:35,340
so and other shit very important we find
out

398
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:38,640
why you know reverse engineering the
septa boxers but the worst

399
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,660
a clear indication of some Keith some
the SE K Q

400
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:49,660
know what this is secret cheeky I

401
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:54,220
this what which indicated Texas set up
this key which is unique for their

402
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:59,260
chipset and bad at all place its worst
worry confirm this

403
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:02,470
first place what was at the time of the
creek in the book

404
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:05,580
bottle author called the bootloader
Kotwal

405
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:10,150
the crib that with the use of this Sekt
we never got access to the ski

406
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:13,350
but we you the sake of being used by the
that cold

407
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:16,840
and other another indication of when we

408
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:20,550
analyzed the softer operate distribution
we found

409
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:27,550
some binary later

410
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:31,560
we also find out and and the current
level

411
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:36,270
try first that the actually the SCI 71
online cheap

412
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:39,830
makes use of some harm or so I'm this
term or

413
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:40,700
now

414
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:43,729
think this is a destructor morse
indicated by you know

415
00:33:43,729 --> 00:33:47,090
a couple of coats in both pay them both
we then

416
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:50,450
we even you know notice that there is a

417
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:55,149
at some kind of a initiate a shark in
the tri-state for her coat

418
00:33:55,149 --> 00:34:01,690
into the cheaps I

419
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:04,670
process or it right that call yeah which
check

420
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:07,870
some stuff like you know meets arm no

421
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:10,990
the usual process of have up you know

422
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:15,200
me nothing matched this kind this
special process or call

423
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,230
saw well we find another club

424
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:22,500
there are also a couple of years ago
some some your p.m.

425
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:26,370
6 tremor project which you know
basically ready for a couple of

426
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:28,020
documents and also

427
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:31,679
the leaked this information I basically
put all the information

428
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:36,920
there eleven information that was leaked
by Laura

429
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:40,540
or which was your stay by this he okay I
want

430
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:43,600
then companies and this project and gave

431
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,690
a couple of Defense about a couple of
information about the

432
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:51,110
features have you know maybe not

433
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:55,320
for you are feat but still something
that help something

434
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:59,260
some other claw that most our research a
little bit for

435
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:03,370
better because we know that there are
some kind of screen car

436
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:10,370
he found out another project and at
which had them

437
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:17,270
salters one function which leak why
instruction for my 61

438
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:20,790
nothing else about this of actually

439
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:26,580
day key and point in our search cut from
that point equipped for any more for

440
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:29,920
we know a we we could find out

441
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,320
backshell for much of the top
instruction for the steam car

442
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,609
for the process or we had for her for
year

443
00:35:36,609 --> 00:35:39,790
but what this line peaks also

444
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:46,790
them Mr ever seen this is done by work
number

445
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:52,080
shop what we started or restarted

446
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:55,230
20 try to find some poppers kinda sheen
car

447
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:58,970
far more so we know that there's also
some

448
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:03,370
get public IP common implemented by
device driver fiscal month simply

449
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:07,290
returns the chief I T it needs to
communicate with the cheap

450
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:10,640
of the for the for more and we are able
to

451
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:15,460
to find some relationship between here
at the structure return quite device

452
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,090
driver

453
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:22,450
and the structure and the numbers here
and the coat

454
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:25,790
cast that were talking

455
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:30,150
dish worth for the output of the device
driver we confirmed that by changing

456
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:30,790
here

457
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:34,230
one-story instruction what the other
story instruction

458
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:39,170
so for we had another value and not the
one we expect to talk

459
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:42,230
we know that this was actually the piece
of Coll

460
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:45,230
that's what the henning take get public
IP compact

461
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:48,240
so and this was also very

462
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,270
and crucial moment in the whole research

463
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:58,270
saw we started 20 dick federal law

464
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:04,770
what we did so we know that we could
change there

465
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:08,640
for more called and runtime this
probably shouldn't happen to you have a

466
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,480
secure

467
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:14,710
cheap and you you know the soup secure
cheaper specialized and

468
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:18,210
it suffer more uploaded chapter horace
king Iran

469
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:22,130
and at some point of time attackers able
to talk inject arbitrary

470
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:25,849
instruction and the it today few marks
called her execution publishing probably

471
00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:26,270
happen

472
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:29,630
for the church but let's leave it so we
r

473
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:36,030
able to replace arbitration shuttle so

474
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:40,450
on the Leister effect of different
destruction execution to

475
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:44,230
environment and that by the environment
mean the memory a

476
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:48,820
at registers from this is how we
discovered some other instructions

477
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:52,400
so and this is that idea

478
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,510
behind this so we had to her mother
called

479
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:58,560
renewal the piece of code that ross
implementing

480
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:03,170
to get public ID faction so we simply
enough for you that jump instruction for

481
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:04,200
much so we did

482
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:11,200
but champ to the and doctor for more
there was like I G

483
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:15,390
your test or unloading trucks and buses
were one of the first instruction we

484
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:19,920
we could reverse engineer and we return
the back to their original coat

485
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,069
of of the cat public IP factions so

486
00:38:23,069 --> 00:38:26,839
and this injection of use our coat

487
00:38:26,839 --> 00:38:30,829
& Co there the power of of the get
complicated function

488
00:38:30,829 --> 00:38:34,069
implemented by the sink or for more was
at the car

489
00:38:34,069 --> 00:38:37,430
of reverse engineer all other
instructions have the same car

490
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:41,619
saw and the Basic Law and the basic
approach for years here's that

491
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:47,450
no if you know good

492
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:51,210
to actually reverse engineer all other
instructions why because you can't jump

493
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:52,200
to your coat

494
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,299
you can start to register contact
because I thought

495
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:58,960
another context you can execute I'm no
instruction

496
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,839
restore the original context and jump
back for the call the former pop so

497
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:07,210
by doing this by experimental to look
different instructions

498
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:10,339
were able to find out about the form up
all

499
00:39:10,339 --> 00:39:13,349
often I'm not shocked which were US

500
00:39:13,349 --> 00:39:18,000
and think of you are we we are playing
with so

501
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,930
energy

502
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:26,789
hearing visibility we started with the
adults are instructions but what that

503
00:39:26,789 --> 00:39:30,470
than though I'm of destructions compare
instructions conditional branching

504
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:33,650
I one of the most difficult part all the
structure think whoopi

505
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:36,890
extraction manipulation and there's
there's also some

506
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:40,480
repeating structure some kind of a
pressure switch repeated the couple of

507
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,269
instructions for

508
00:39:41,269 --> 00:39:45,700
couple of times you if this project
appeared before and instructions of

509
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,140
course

510
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:49,319
we try to reverse engineer on the data
structures

511
00:39:49,319 --> 00:39:56,319
that were and a far more called we are
dealing with on here

512
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:03,329
try to procure some car so at the move
instruction could be easily confirmed by

513
00:40:03,329 --> 00:40:04,069
starr

514
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:07,259
rejected the parking structure could see
if storing

515
00:40:07,259 --> 00:40:10,470
there as a doctor at the Starbucks some
more actually

516
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:14,539
did produced that pic provide you with
which was loaded to the register

517
00:40:14,539 --> 00:40:18,690
shameful compare instructions what we
use here to find out their condition our

518
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:19,200
jobs

519
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,930
and compare instruction was that we know
that here there are some value is very

520
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:26,220
similar to that values of the Commons

521
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:33,220
handled by that device driver I shel
show we care

522
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,940
comp rm conditional Jianping seaquest
saw

523
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:43,779
at the end note this is of course 30
just work

524
00:40:43,779 --> 00:40:47,750
me for you and content many book up some
the ship the box the color because you

525
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:48,970
know if you execute a

526
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:52,130
an instruction which isn't valued and or

527
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:56,920
something which which should be done and
we there was a reset and stuff like that

528
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,410
so finally we were able to disassemble

529
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:03,440
most of the hard work ot this are like
public

530
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:10,440
forty hundred-plus instructions on the
11th up

531
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:14,730
analyze how the former cop works

532
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:19,780
why sufficient well we were able to
discover separate dispatching for

533
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:23,330
crypto DMA for working with the tricky

534
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:26,570
the operation to keep your precious
shadow precious where

535
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:31,140
dealing with Keith we also were able to
talk she some poptarts which

536
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:35,099
implement the Kenya threats or if any
context switching the former called

537
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:38,510
and that's a pretty short for har har so
week

538
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:41,810
we've been expecting any context
switching but there are a couple of

539
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:46,599
your

540
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:50,489
there are some King chat session some
proteins saw

541
00:41:50,489 --> 00:41:55,579
unfortunately this wasn't enough no you
can da static analysis of some cock

542
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:59,700
always you know tracing a run time
tracing sure at bigger picture

543
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:03,819
saw what he did week we actually
implement the fuck kind of a tracer

544
00:42:03,819 --> 00:42:07,049
yeah and the way across implement it
there

545
00:42:07,049 --> 00:42:11,869
its implementation process of two parts:
there's a sink or a park and there is a

546
00:42:11,869 --> 00:42:12,660
chupar

547
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:16,420
so at the same car park we are simply
doing some kind of binary

548
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,019
instrumentation

549
00:42:17,019 --> 00:42:23,290
that's a pretty complex

550
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:26,720
then sink or trying tho not if I jump up
are you know

551
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:32,010
now lock but I'll quote the registers
and actually instruction and stuff

552
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:35,350
and but you know this work and why with
greeted

553
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:39,380
this we want to look a that power and
the sink or a

554
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:43,830
yeah instruction sequences that cost
dealing with this

555
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:47,850
particle a functional cheap related to
the golden keys to the cheap attacker

556
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:51,610
key functionality and so here's a just
the

557
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:54,920
a quick look at the your house out local
our

558
00:42:54,920 --> 00:43:00,260
our p

559
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:04,430
and we were able to actually paying down
to instruction sequences that

560
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:07,960
implemented the loading up their key and
cryptic key

561
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:11,610
a Critter Control out to the cheap saw
this is the instruction

562
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:16,450
so we have a his shots and that's simply
put cheap and today triple DS malt

563
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:19,610
then we should the instruction that dole
specific cheap

564
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:23,860
internal cheap call mom to the register
Rishi some instructions that the fuck

565
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:24,790
kind of waking

566
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:29,360
me tomorrow but its looks like a waking
we see some kind of secret with which

567
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,350
lost their

568
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:35,460
that im all

569
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:40,430
all starting up to resolve of course all
of the instructional coach names

570
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:43,820
are sort of in all the shower makes

571
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:48,240
we've never seen any shock some and up
call the

572
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,250
II specification and stuff like that Sol

573
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:54,930
this a tough figure out by the function
like events topics such

574
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:59,380
saw by analyzing the

575
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:04,220
shrink or if you're we also noted that
there are some internal cheap comments

576
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:05,860
your spite that for more

577
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:11,230
discount fare

578
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:14,590
20 you know sort of put does come on
tiptoe

579
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:19,160
separate blocks because because she some
patterns future one block second block

580
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:22,620
so it's not like this at the random
comments page

581
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:26,290
so and the most part I'm how much your

582
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:30,490
our dollars hair when it comes to
translating the high-level

583
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:35,350
device driver comment which launched the
contra large print queue for the cheap

584
00:44:35,350 --> 00:44:39,060
this comment is it was use the internal
should come on when it comes to setting

585
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:39,630
back

586
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:46,630
encrypt that control up to the Chiefs at
best

587
00:44:48,369 --> 00:44:49,619
okay saw

588
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:53,270
but we started to play even deeper of
their

589
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:58,240
in Karachi and what does come on so we
wrote this simple piece of code

590
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,670
and why we wrote this because you want
it to 20

591
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:05,450
actually she you know what the command
command of

592
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:10,710
what arguments takes you know how it
changed techies memory and stop so

593
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:14,230
this our primary culture points from an
King

594
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:21,230
hair painter our sink or if you tomorrow

595
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:26,630
how we could play with this this this
instrument that called recursively

596
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:30,049
give some import we court a

597
00:45:30,049 --> 00:45:34,140
playoffs pesedit.com much we could see
you know how Keith

598
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:37,719
change well-respected different common
and

599
00:45:37,719 --> 00:45:41,469
at this of also very crucial part in
this research because

600
00:45:41,469 --> 00:45:46,499
we were able to discover that you care
how crypto car a common form of

601
00:45:46,499 --> 00:45:50,559
so we find out that its compost more or
less of disc

602
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:57,559
the start so we have a target the target
specifying K

603
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:02,130
a result should report a source Pro
which

604
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:05,810
stars a cuban and key I'm

605
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:08,830
should be hatch for the operation we
have a key

606
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:12,900
something to secure specify to as a key
stop number or a

607
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:16,910
at you 00 North this was a you to take a
shock to

608
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:20,450
escapist chief security key so basically

609
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:23,780
bring your the Tiki comment form of and

610
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:30,780
here's a sample operations toast talk
critical operations were used

611
00:46:34,819 --> 00:46:38,130
controller foreign key what it does is
simply it

612
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:42,049
always the crips register in Port where
sheik a key

613
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:45,390
and stars there are not as a key it
floats your 0 a

614
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:50,009
better come on also the sums key
shopping from the crips an operation

615
00:46:50,009 --> 00:46:54,439
and week on travel up there what the use
of power called

616
00:46:54,439 --> 00:46:57,880
instrument that sink or a cold and by
playing with different

617
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:01,900
TKD common and this is how we are
actually able to

618
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:08,900
to come up to the security but there are
pieces because what we find out

619
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:14,820
of Tiki ka month we could achieve
something interesting so here

620
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:18,110
here's a stepfather be number one of

621
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:21,800
sq if you're STI 7101 chipset saw

622
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,980
a and that cokie Gration

623
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:28,740
if crypt of controlled turnkey is
provided as a source

624
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:34,600
his keys provided as their if they're
cheap set specific key is provided as a

625
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:38,320
extra key and eight TDs the corruption
takes place

626
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:45,320
and the result historic at Q on

627
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:50,030
of the cultural upbringing keep is a
cryptid with that key for and the other

628
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:50,570
step

629
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:55,450
what we day lost reuse that keep from
slot wine

630
00:47:55,450 --> 00:48:00,460
to Dec ripped however a cryptid contra
was divided value

631
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:04,800
we use another common 20 provide another
corporation for their registers

632
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:09,300
for the operation but as a result you're
able to start the plane tix value of the

633
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:10,190
contract worth

634
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:14,200
a temperature at some other key stock
purchased her and the most interesting

635
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:14,930
part was that

636
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:21,930
this key stock purchase

637
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:24,420
saw does marked threat

638
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:28,680
were not accessible for a king the
better for me laugh or

639
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:32,990
for crypto people it all hope that the
whole attack how this work

640
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:37,060
an this is not the first whether he
should the second one of america's we

641
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:39,160
find out that it's possible to actually
obtain

642
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:42,440
their plain text value of the
controversial currently the actual

643
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:44,070
apparently because pairing

644
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:47,610
by the means of cryptographic fashion to
cheaper than the Smart car

645
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:52,020
so you find out that now we could take
rip the contra spring key

646
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:56,940
and took the

647
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:59,650
there are inaccessible key start at

648
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:02,900
at key stops here of the fault location
for the Contra

649
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:06,590
Frankie and SCI 71 on Mon and Steptoe

650
00:49:06,590 --> 00:49:12,890
what we simply did we simply her encrypt
it there is our top 10 p-4

651
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:16,690
20 achieve the plane tix value of the
contract Frankie

652
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:19,890
and it worked we have verified this
recently

653
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:24,880
implemented the card debt woes a or
encrypt it

654
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:31,420
right re encrypting their value support

655
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:35,170
keeps at and this coming operations
thank you work so

656
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:39,510
that's actually that the second father
Peter according to a Shiite set on

657
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:41,400
chipset when it comes to the

658
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:46,140
location update for her beauty there a
tool box and its forty somewhere here

659
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:49,750
we're not sure but this is the block of
the cheap that

660
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:53,579
das seems to be doing that the crips and
and you know scrum

661
00:49:53,579 --> 00:49:58,250
just coming and stuff so okay

662
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:05,250
fire to skip skip the fight so from
across the cold

663
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:09,780
called when it comes to this security
but there is a test %uh

664
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:14,630
it was part of the fish this main called
we implemented on the couch for them all

665
00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:16,680
our operation and accept the book so

666
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:20,900
our Prof Costco actually work a
client-server architecture never

667
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:21,560
mentioned that

668
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:25,390
this is the time to mention that so we
had a client a backdoor

669
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:28,880
or mother client on Sep the box devices
we had some kind of a

670
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,170
no back to our server and you know
they're

671
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:35,280
different clients at the party by Cisco
communicate with their

672
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,420
affect our server saud

673
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:40,490
the

674
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:43,680
factions we were able to talk definitely

675
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:47,070
obtain plain text value of the keys your
stare

676
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:50,140
and for that for the decryption of the
cryptic

677
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:53,930
and it's for tonight transmission we
were able to talk

678
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:58,500
said this quiche over the network 20
other systems and used

679
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:03,000
this this Keith for the crypt bankrupted
content so we also enable

680
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,790
20 actually the crypt video-on-demand
staff

681
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:11,030
an quite how how this was I'll just
national moment so

682
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:17,580
here's the the earth for for
consequently contact that so we have a

683
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:18,850
set top box here

684
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:22,330
the sauce s Chia SCI 7100 cheap

685
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:26,800
here we had a set-top box of SCI 71 on
what ships are different Chiefs

686
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,980
different setup of the callers from this
set the box the color

687
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:34,150
we extracted plane tix controller for
premium programming

688
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:37,990
with phantom over flower ACM server
product from

689
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:42,290
Tribeca or Sarah and this big car
service a key for larger

690
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:49,290
the Keefe that put this septa talk got
the set the box children

691
00:51:50,530 --> 00:51:53,680
lowest does the keys to receive Atlas
able to

692
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:57,260
actually the crib the content wish we
saw that company more

693
00:51:57,260 --> 00:52:00,920
we've ended Dec capture a bit compact
content on that

694
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:05,680
the car which proved that you know
everything work far so

695
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:10,730
the other the other function I to relate
it to the proper protocol test

696
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:13,890
PTO on-demand sharing we were able to

697
00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:16,930
to use the ability to extract

698
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:23,930
keys plain text Keith protecting that

699
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:28,130
young to manteca and environment an hour
partners apparently worked with

700
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:33,290
the content or store it on Sep a box and
this effect post your PDR beyond the Mac

701
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:36,950
so the ditch the site to provide her
with pushing

702
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:40,870
the content in a crypt at four different
movies 2 set-top boxes

703
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:43,990
they weren't there Stora and the Hard
Rock a trip to

704
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:47,980
in order to secure them the
controversial keys

705
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:51,560
were require yeah and the controversial
keys were at least

706
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:58,560
on me proper access right worst hit by
the smart

707
00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:03,110
now reviewer damn

708
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:06,760
during that time we had access to the
content we were able to talk

709
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,990
story to Dec ripped there all of their

710
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:13,410
contra works which are protection that
movie after the

711
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:17,040
but pure top to up there in tokyo were
able to

712
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:21,220
to share the Contra worth were way if
the the

713
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:25,570
other colors or we quickly we could
actually use toast plain text control at

714
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:26,090
the bars

715
00:53:26,090 --> 00:53:30,000
the scrambled a movie and this was
passed the rental period and the South

716
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,450
in her

717
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:38,140
okay so coming after the summary

718
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:41,440
a so when it comes to that SCI

719
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:44,870
fertilizer here a situation like that
alright security for her B fest

720
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:48,840
so the Hannah Montana question we've
been asking our summer

721
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:52,760
how competitions were not discovered
before the market really tho

722
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:56,370
for microelectronics thats that's a
major silicon vendor

723
00:53:56,370 --> 00:54:00,120
saw definitely number one in Europe in
the camps to the

724
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:07,120
an Irish up the different ships to
market not

725
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:12,430
from week Wikipedia and their of this
complex security evaluation those for

726
00:54:12,430 --> 00:54:13,150
Koreas

727
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:16,430
Apotheker capitalization dom four
different

728
00:54:16,430 --> 00:54:19,630
security chief said and you know

729
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:24,210
also wasn't spotted I don't know what
kind of information is provided to

730
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:25,380
comment on the caps two

731
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:28,759
you know evaluating faithfully from HR
just you know

732
00:54:28,759 --> 00:54:33,289
from data briefs but if they it helpful
information that's thus would have been

733
00:54:33,289 --> 00:54:34,460
spotted in some way

734
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:41,460
so we've never received extra scoring
that were a psycho bitch

735
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:42,900
by Comox

736
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:46,390
it this was not disclosed by Anya other
bandar

737
00:54:46,390 --> 00:54:49,490
so when it comes to the impact so

738
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:52,589
we may receive information press a micro
trying San

739
00:54:52,589 --> 00:54:55,970
dishes that did you did she took that
are at our impact

740
00:54:55,970 --> 00:54:59,519
quick question saw disability the

741
00:54:59,519 --> 00:55:02,950
the fact that summarizes there is false
hope the company

742
00:55:02,950 --> 00:55:06,069
our inquiry so we

743
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:09,829
tried to do that in fact estimation up
on publicly available data

744
00:55:09,829 --> 00:55:16,829
we found the following theft

745
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:21,000
capital Dhaka man and buy some St guy

746
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,330
and and apparently the commander keith

747
00:55:25,330 --> 00:55:28,470
mpg mpeg mpg for shipments

748
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:32,670
I till year $2,500 a post-mortem 500
millionth

749
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:37,920
chips saw this or sector boxes different
digital television set

750
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,790
DVD blu-ray players because now I didn't
mention that before

751
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:46,090
that cheats like SCI 711 effect on the
US and

752
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:53,090
and ash set top box

753
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:57,740
and the Internet to SC if

754
00:55:57,740 --> 00:56:00,799
is the number one on the caps two h264
marker

755
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:03,859
ASO it had for about 2k

756
00:56:03,859 --> 00:56:07,349
market had about 680 percent market
share

757
00:56:07,349 --> 00:56:12,760
and your to the IMA so it has customers
from all around the or somehow the mains

758
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:13,549
or so

759
00:56:13,549 --> 00:56:17,579
well but we still talk how yeah how many
of these chips

760
00:56:17,579 --> 00:56:21,230
are out there are which are vulnerable
whois using them

761
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:28,230
which set top boxes are using them

762
00:56:28,770 --> 00:56:31,940
summer summarize data this presentation
so

763
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:36,050
so what would your what we are able to
accomplish the sauce thank you the first

764
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:37,740
successful attack a caster

765
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:41,090
implementation of a complex conditional
access system which keeps appearing

766
00:56:41,090 --> 00:56:45,200
we didn't bring the Contact Card million
fair

767
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:49,150
air show that the card is vulnerable but
we

768
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:52,560
did break the implementation the
implementation of the con- access them

769
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:56,050
and this specific environment of SMI
quick links chips

770
00:56:56,050 --> 00:57:02,140
saw a

771
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:06,359
fat I can accept the boxes tossed that
we plate with that the time

772
00:57:06,359 --> 00:57:10,150
talked about and the first presentation
so

773
00:57:10,150 --> 00:57:13,789
you broke security up dedicated cheap
said SCI

774
00:57:13,789 --> 00:57:17,540
said on a long lost property a

775
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:19,520
had more serious talk because we're even

776
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:22,820
were able to extract the plaintext
crypto or

777
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:26,160
controller starring key saw definitely

778
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:29,510
had walk could start

779
00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:36,510
asking questions hell

780
00:57:37,430 --> 00:57:40,900
on obey a dangerous concept it might
look like a

781
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:44,640
dangerous costs are saw its 30 to the
shocking

782
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:49,090
she does kind of issues being you know
Park and national com

783
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:52,780
yes some kind of output autobahn some
kind of design shows

784
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:57,150
when it comes to shopping the keys
thought there's definitely don't need to

785
00:57:57,150 --> 00:57:58,310
improve security

786
00:57:58,310 --> 00:58:02,780
and evaluation processes by the silicon
and condition of the surf and endorse

787
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:06,750
hair we hope that

788
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:13,740
you know the risk

789
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:18,440
this this hope this will be used by the
company's from the crisis and to improve

790
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:22,860
security product far there's definitely
that need to tight ass up the book

791
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:23,760
security

792
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:27,610
which rely on vulnerable to be cheap but
we don't know much about

793
00:58:27,610 --> 00:58:31,520
how many of them are their Park now in
order to

794
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:35,340
sexually make sure that benches are not
to use exploitable

795
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:38,820
it the primary thing is to make sure
that check the boxes

796
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:42,130
are not so easy ha cable an it and

797
00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:48,049
health me

798
00:58:48,049 --> 00:58:51,369
should discuss you don't need a
significant action the septa box

799
00:58:51,369 --> 00:58:55,459
any to be completely break security over
septa box you need to get current level

800
00:58:55,459 --> 00:58:56,059
access

801
00:58:56,059 --> 00:59:00,449
in it to get access for the cheater and
then maybe I'm you can for playing with

802
00:59:00,449 --> 00:59:02,939
some I think that basically

803
00:59:02,939 --> 00:59:06,900
at all I am happy that I am not pass the
time

804
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:11,519
for thank you very much for attending

805
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:15,089
this talk I appreciate that now that
also

806
00:59:15,089 --> 00:59:21,360
two hours

807
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:28,360
question yes I am try to offer them

808
00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:32,769
mesh s one of two the lease

809
00:59:32,769 --> 00:59:36,450
you work able to act missus this the
cost over

810
00:59:36,450 --> 00:59:40,700
tool implementation fell what which
didst

811
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:43,829
joost ditched pic

812
00:59:43,829 --> 00:59:47,609
took a pic ship caught set-top box key

813
00:59:47,609 --> 00:59:52,220
Cox

814
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:56,660
am is attending responsibility of to set
the host

815
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:59,690
to assess be sure to stall its

816
00:59:59,690 --> 01:00:06,359
by us are using Cisco happy of
Mississauga this possibility someone

817
01:00:06,359 --> 01:00:06,859
else

818
01:00:06,859 --> 01:00:11,249
sold if you want so it kept assess some
of your Christmas

819
01:00:11,249 --> 01:00:14,309
employed all and fishing is at risk

820
01:00:14,309 --> 01:00:21,309
yes all you free asking about this this

821
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:27,970
to play with different call marked with
Keith at week if you if you were able to

822
01:00:27,970 --> 01:00:28,450
see

823
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:32,119
somebody a shower and achieves I your
memory

824
01:00:32,119 --> 01:00:35,690
mopped regions %um no what the safe

825
01:00:35,690 --> 01:00:39,180
but we knew because we could we have a
reference value

826
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:42,430
from the other you know sort of parallel

827
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:47,089
conditional access system wat yours
plain text controller

828
01:00:47,089 --> 01:00:54,089
so this is probably yet produce what
happened yeah

829
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:10,030
the I think both I don't know how much
he was responsible for for the

830
01:01:10,030 --> 01:01:13,820
actual deployment of the conditional
access system I expect that

831
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:17,870
but sure the possible to have pressure
asked a text value of

832
01:01:17,870 --> 01:01:20,970
for the same scripted content at the
same time

833
01:01:20,970 --> 01:01:24,350
you have a system to try to make secure
if you have a

834
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:28,150
pitched a fit right to depart from which
your try to make secure

835
01:01:28,150 --> 01:01:34,030
implement you know as a vast security
mechanisms in the

836
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:37,450
why do you have a couple of channels are
some other service

837
01:01:37,450 --> 01:01:41,410
being offered to the market or you're
simply half

838
01:01:41,410 --> 01:01:44,550
those keys be available in plain text
yeah

839
01:01:44,550 --> 01:01:48,190
at not for a that like it like really
pregnant

840
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:51,820
contact yeah because TMK service was
like for

841
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:55,920
this was like a prepaid like 12 2010 at
maybe something like that

842
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,920
but still at the key issue with that

843
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:02,010
we had as a reference value every 10
seconds

844
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:05,070
but that's what at one at one point we
had to

845
01:02:05,070 --> 01:02:08,240
K

846
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:11,260
650 and M looking to the chipset memory

847
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:14,760
playing with the chief said across
easier for us

848
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:18,579
to find the results of our operations
because at some point of time

849
01:02:18,579 --> 01:02:24,319
we find find out pay here at 8x contra
what if I will pop top

850
01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:27,349
yeah for for-profit

851
01:02:27,349 --> 01:02:30,920
actually this service should be put in
some other way

852
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:34,420
yet maybe about ill prolly this is the
matter of

853
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:37,930
of saving the band with so your
broadcast want ml

854
01:02:37,930 --> 01:02:44,930
and this actually

855
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:48,070
one content can broadcast that with the
use of some key

856
01:02:48,070 --> 01:02:51,480
and then you have different conditional
access systems

857
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:54,550
which are able to the crib discuss this
one content P

858
01:02:54,550 --> 01:02:58,280
is being you know US by different
digital I can you come from you can have

859
01:02:58,280 --> 01:02:58,660
like

860
01:02:58,660 --> 01:03:02,360
behalf contact you can have I hear that
tell you

861
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:06,120
and yes and difficult process for this
is her

862
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:10,600
well a trade thanks from the cockpit and
this particular context the

863
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:13,890
help this happened to cures for yeah saw

864
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:17,730
they try to limit the

865
01:03:17,730 --> 01:03:20,960
by you speak of the channels which are
available

866
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:24,410
to the market and the plane tix keys
worn out already quite like

867
01:03:24,410 --> 01:03:28,730
praying already

868
01:03:28,730 --> 01:03:32,109
yeah quite have two questions

869
01:03:32,109 --> 01:03:35,930
yeah first on the 7111

870
01:03:35,930 --> 01:03:41,090
arm after all reverse engineering was
complete

871
01:03:41,090 --> 01:03:45,810
worth the attacks did you have to change
the firmware

872
01:03:45,810 --> 01:03:52,810
for the attacks or were the attacks the

873
01:03:53,650 --> 01:03:58,609
on on on that the second one seven-term
I seventy 11 yet submit was the key part

874
01:03:58,609 --> 01:04:01,849
yeah we needed I without Ste

875
01:04:01,849 --> 01:04:05,490
deputy to change the far more be
actually wouldn't be quite able to

876
01:04:05,490 --> 01:04:06,510
execute any

877
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:09,789
think or instructions so we were
changing for more

878
01:04:09,789 --> 01:04:12,890
we were hijacking the coat top of what
one faction

879
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:17,730
where checking our called syquest ship
it requested to follow instructions

880
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:21,329
up into the cult of in order to see what
happens right because the

881
01:04:21,329 --> 01:04:28,329
key part and it probably the chillin

882
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:32,220
should one be able to go actually change
to Paramore

883
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:35,450
of some internal trip to car and runtime
yes after the

884
01:04:35,450 --> 01:04:38,860
show statins I I'm just out the
questionnaires

885
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:44,050
but what say you you had some kinda
instruction set guide

886
01:04:44,050 --> 01:04:47,220
to that slim core you

887
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:50,650
reverse-engineered very frequently I'll

888
01:04:50,650 --> 01:04:55,170
would it be able to mount the attack
without the ability to change

889
01:04:55,170 --> 01:04:58,680
but say they did have a secure boot
loader and he couldn't change anything

890
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:03,850
but you did have the men

891
01:05:03,850 --> 01:05:07,380
that he from HR all what what I am not
much of her son

892
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:10,920
I'm not sure if I understand your
question yeah so

893
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:14,110
maybe this couple itself wait for later
okay

894
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:18,480
yeah i i of course open if you would
like to at me some other questions I am

895
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:21,980
developmental here at the premises of
the conference so

896
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:25,560
well we're actually have time for
questions

897
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:29,610
yes side thank you very much for saying
so long I wish you a great evening

898
01:05:29,610 --> 01:05:36,610
from fall

899
01:05:38,870 --> 01:05:41,230
okay cool stuff now it's okay

900
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:44,720
my apologies for that for people are
over here

901
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:48,360
%uh I'm sorry it happened like this
today and today we're going to work with

902
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:50,360
the technicians to fix this problem
because

903
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:54,230
somebody called Murphy came in a few
more times now

904
01:05:54,230 --> 01:05:57,120
my excuses for that and we'll fix it
thank you very much
