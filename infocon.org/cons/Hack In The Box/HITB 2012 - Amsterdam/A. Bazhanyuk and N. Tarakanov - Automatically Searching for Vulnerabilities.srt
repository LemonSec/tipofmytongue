00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,980
the story behind the toward

9
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:41,909
uh... it was uh...

10
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:44,609
move-in took some time here

11
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:45,910
and uh... i

12
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:50,810
alex was me you we working uh... in this
versus uh... company

13
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:51,800
and

14
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,260
i do know that the florio arsenic
nearing the

15
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,840
source code all the time

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,710
and uh... because uh... they wrote the
full

17
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:01,680
scold

18
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,500
well we saw that the two will be great
idea to automate uh... problem

19
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,660
brought the cellphone forgot the scarry

20
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,620
uh... and

21
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,500
that moments a in my opinion uh...

22
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:21,260
one uh... framework by zoo was great
actually at the moment it's

23
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,410
great too

24
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,030
uh... so ln

25
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,360
well it's a ticket

26
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,420
about uh... doctors

27
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,960
uh... so tool alex is give yourself
you're from ukraine hughes a organizer

28
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,010
of product going green group

29
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,100
uh...

30
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,140
by not all booking

31
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,960
at the moment if he's sleeping i think
because it is good

32
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,000
california

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,930
and their stores in their debase project
but says this dark is not uh...

34
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:51,680
uh... some secret of stuff but bob
blaiser post

35
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,420
the swarup girl was done on

36
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,170
well most of your eagle

37
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:59,000
when alex uh... was working with me

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,340
uh... and uh...

39
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,210
actually urine

40
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,020
demeanor at

41
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,469
a key security uh... disney's in russia
is kind of complicated so

42
00:02:11,469 --> 00:02:16,959
uh... we uh... separate that the he
moved to u_s_ i stayed in russia

43
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,080
uh... still about me

44
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,689
after the

45
00:02:20,689 --> 00:02:23,349
we separated the news i think uh...

46
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:24,639
mhm

47
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:29,749
it's uh... alex to gave might still work
in the the blaze that

48
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:31,779
but the new

49
00:02:31,779 --> 00:02:32,910
i do

50
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,829
demand reverse engineering myself

51
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:37,269
uh...

52
00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:42,709
uh... right now i am independents and
quite actually um... after off some

53
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:43,930
articles in the

54
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,189
a key security russian magazine

55
00:02:46,189 --> 00:02:48,239
it's a kind of over the one

56
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,959
magadan russia about accused puberty

57
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,900
and most of the time i have like two
reversed colonel amt

58
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,359
uh... and uh... in recent years i
discovered uh... some

59
00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:00,839
or abilities

60
00:03:00,839 --> 00:03:02,469
uh...

61
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:03,780
in the colonel

62
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,539
ucla named colonel antonen windows
platforms

63
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:09,559
and uh...

64
00:03:09,559 --> 00:03:11,529
as sme

65
00:03:11,529 --> 00:03:13,800
alex and me like two fault

66
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,569
problemo

67
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:18,669
ultimate tours and hearing

68
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:21,079
it should talk about it

69
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:25,699
the manner than i will loom talk about
two first of all i would think now the

70
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:27,039
theory

71
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:28,190
sulfur than

72
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:31,759
about uh... did blazes 'cause uh... this
sir

73
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:34,669
system is based on

74
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:35,909
it blades

75
00:03:35,909 --> 00:03:37,009
uh... wheeze

76
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:38,799
something has been sick

77
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,069
and a m

78
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:44,209
stood next to be lost time he will let
you don't see you

79
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:45,239
what's this

80
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:50,639
and to the next day and uh... talk about
some uh... it's false about

81
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:52,739
uh... something for tomorrow

82
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:55,530
actually think now's the spent about so

83
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,819
implementation

84
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,160
of for this brochure like

85
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,959
it's forcing the blaze

86
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,650
and uh... another falls

87
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:05,449
and competent in conclusion some

88
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:06,689
results

89
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:07,719
so

90
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:08,969
actually in

91
00:04:08,969 --> 00:04:11,509
uh...

92
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:13,589
such system that has a

93
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:14,869
two parts

94
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:15,750
uh...

95
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,299
first one is the kind of

96
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:20,499
phot static park uh... it uh... based on

97
00:04:20,499 --> 00:04:25,179
either actually inside the and uh...
several of plugins

98
00:04:25,179 --> 00:04:26,789
for example

99
00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:28,669
uh...

100
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:32,749
xref things off some dangerous function
like uh...

101
00:04:32,749 --> 00:04:33,980
memory copy

102
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,909
uh...

103
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:36,629
mal but

104
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:37,999
freedman a read

105
00:04:37,999 --> 00:04:41,389
and uh... there are allot of alex asso

106
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:44,830
actually at the group and show 'em

107
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:48,039
bolna roti heater

108
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:50,690
can be your every instruction

109
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:51,979
uh... that uh...

110
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:54,540
manipulates the memory for example

111
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,710
uh... crucial memory is that it

112
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:01,979
there is a moving and there is a
indirect goal so on

113
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:04,320
i will talk later about the internals

114
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,780
uh... all for some

115
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,360
organs and third

116
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,599
kind of uh... dainik park dietz debased

117
00:05:10,599 --> 00:05:13,590
and blazed the just to help

118
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,360
when uh... in two thousand down

119
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,909
and eight into their own eighty two oh
nine

120
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:23,000
uh... first lead and the place
particularly spine

121
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,209
and that is the the release

122
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:28,080
but actually thing is that uh...

123
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,580
it's not that frameworks that

124
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,699
it's ready to use in the real world

125
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:36,550
scenario cousin discount for all

126
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,639
and uh...

127
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:39,949
and you have to enhance its

128
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:42,179
uh... allot uh...

129
00:05:42,179 --> 00:05:44,229
that too

130
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:47,510
please some results

131
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,639
so

132
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,059
alleluia talk about theory

133
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:54,239
by the way you can

134
00:05:54,239 --> 00:05:58,509
howie you find do clarence is by filing
i think

135
00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:03,380
raise your hand spec buzzing might
mutation

136
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,260
uh...

137
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,699
sake home

138
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,900
for example what uh... needed to do

139
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,860
if there is a and are under commanded
article and

140
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,599
there is a some

141
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:18,099
here steve lore

142
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:19,610
creek to stop

143
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:22,600
and uh... actually by mutation fighting
you can

144
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,279
you simply get nothing

145
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:25,400
so you'd have to

146
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,520
manually reverse engineer

147
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,490
some unknown for market

148
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,779
and uh... this is

149
00:06:31,779 --> 00:06:36,419
takes a lot of time

150
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:40,029
to solve some kind of problems in recent
years

151
00:06:40,029 --> 00:06:43,610
uh...

152
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,130
danes analysis uh... uh...

153
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:47,180
was born

154
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,680
chilean

155
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,259
gait analysis is the kind of

156
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:52,889
dataflow technique

157
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:54,399
so um...

158
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:55,289
we

159
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,329
dipped some

160
00:06:57,329 --> 00:06:59,349
first date their first incubator

161
00:06:59,349 --> 00:07:01,210
with depicts

162
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:04,620
and does and we monitor or how
instruction

163
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,380
uh... protests is data

164
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,569
and that's safe and talk it's kind of
fluids

165
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:14,159
implemented by tracing so it's gonna
flop file hollowed show we'll pop

166
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:15,560
culture looks like

167
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,719
so all basically it

168
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:20,389
source pizza like andrew ward

169
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:22,290
uh... could be anything

170
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,299
network beckett's of

171
00:07:24,299 --> 00:07:26,509
keyboard brass uh...

172
00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:28,030
file from d six

173
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,560
before he even you can uh... tinker

174
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,410
output from some function for example

175
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,759
you can't ting tsa

176
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:38,119
address of for

177
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:41,270
mohawk or something like that

178
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:44,229
so

179
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:47,009
instructions processes

180
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:48,169
data somehow

181
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:50,319
and uh...

182
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,779
next ah...

183
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:56,139
uh...

184
00:07:56,139 --> 00:07:59,020
for example if you have to adjust uh...

185
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,639
one kilobytes file

186
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:01,659
and uh...

187
00:08:01,659 --> 00:08:04,610
there is a for example zip file

188
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,319
first week old building

189
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,229
tons each his file so uh...

190
00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:11,099
you mark to for example

191
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:14,059
file lisa

192
00:08:14,059 --> 00:08:15,439
just offsets

193
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:16,389
and ben

194
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:20,330
well uh... program starts to

195
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,360
uh...

196
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,889
uneasy but and uh...

197
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:27,619
so warm

198
00:08:27,619 --> 00:08:29,520
the existing information

199
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,610
good actually could be anything

200
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:34,160
uh... indeed blaze there is a

201
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,210
for example

202
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,720
uh... upset

203
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,599
plaza what kind of uh... data

204
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:40,339
for example

205
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:43,050
he's a does it uh... come from

206
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,930
that poor profile

207
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:49,570
uh... uganda implemented whatever so
whats

208
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,380
camouflage moral

209
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,100
and um... this is kind of you know

210
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:54,930
chain

211
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,509
uh... for example

212
00:08:56,509 --> 00:08:57,930
uh... moved construction

213
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:02,710
uh... from mallory the registry

214
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:06,750
head

215
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,590
if we talking about thinking

216
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,720
uh... there is a m

217
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,810
objects

218
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:16,790
pizza

219
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,430
objective has uh... some

220
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:22,780
dane techniques of the kind of

221
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,460
whatever if you want

222
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,750
sold

223
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,210
ones uh... again

224
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:32,720
uh...

225
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,100
okay thoughts that exit

226
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,080
actually

227
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,440
at the first uh...

228
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,250
part

229
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:44,570
using by the broad you can reveal some
my of potential

230
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:45,840
or abilities

231
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:50,670
for example might looking for each
thrust about um... uh...

232
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:54,500
doesn't it's uh... just psychic without
uh... real

233
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,790
uh... values

234
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:58,110
uh... hits them

235
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,369
uh... order

236
00:09:59,369 --> 00:10:00,940
has all of the floor

237
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:04,110
uh... false positives causa

238
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:07,380
you can't some

239
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,140
stood to see

240
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:14,870
in one hundred percent reliable that
destroyer built you have to

241
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:17,450
generate date this at that time

242
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,570
after

243
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:20,750
we uh... when their program went

244
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,110
analyzing program

245
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:25,930
uh... processes data

246
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:28,070
you

247
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,280
goto

248
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,340
this is potentials

249
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:36,980
laurel place and to some crash triggers

250
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,770
it's uh... kind of

251
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:45,770
actually and reward static that than
others

252
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,020
you uses we've then iraq

253
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,960
so with the the 'em

254
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,530
in bortz

255
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:57,120
of web a separate it's just uh... lowell
fifty

256
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,280
and when i when that use it

257
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,580
about you

258
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,750
a combination of this is a good 'cause

259
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,660
uh...

260
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,520
by static

261
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,600
you bit gana

262
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,240
removed for

263
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,970
unusual called for example

264
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,820
if u

265
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,370
there's a just like that

266
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:20,530
uh... knoll operation on memory just

267
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:22,090
some mathematics

268
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,390
without system

269
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,100
interest instruction alike

270
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,790
indirect goals in that jumps

271
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,540
just said

272
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,940
sample collation he just keep it

273
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,690
and uh... focus on

274
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:33,519
interesting

275
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,500
instructions

276
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,010
like cook

277
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:41,780
diesels functions

278
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,080
memory copied

279
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,839
golds

280
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:47,010
malloc ps

281
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:49,340
they're a little a lot of potential

282
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:52,250
laurel places

283
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,160
so let's talk about

284
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,430
framework about debate sexually

285
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:00,740
this uh... kind of form

286
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,279
uh... great

287
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:04,490
framework

288
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,490
in fact

289
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:09,420
uh...

290
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,439
open source for sure pizza

291
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,280
macquarie body

292
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,120
it's uh... a lot of fun

293
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,970
of us

294
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:18,710
barks a lot of food dirty text

295
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,250
and uh...

296
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,420
on

297
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:25,240
because that alot of four

298
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,580
it has a lot of future but keeping of

299
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,690
uh... mentally coat it's because they're
just

300
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,840
the released just small part

301
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,390
off what they kept

302
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,340
so uh... uh...

303
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,680
this framework

304
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,600
you can use it is not just of for
discover alarm realty but for a lot of

305
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,600
things

306
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,450
uh... for example

307
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:51,410
uh... there was talk uh... black hats
and

308
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:53,850
approach was

309
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:55,510
if you've got crash

310
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:58,380
from some kind of food mutation

311
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,490
bilingual

312
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,280
from protocol based

313
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,790
you just have koresh

314
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,589
uh...

315
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:11,460
and you have to analyze them

316
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,530
what set these is exploit will come out

317
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:15,829
uh... so

318
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:18,699
uh... jeremy rebecca to protect that

319
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:21,180
using the blaze penza

320
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,050
think now this purpose

321
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:25,130
and incubation techniques

322
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,090
you can reduce dime

323
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,020
all four

324
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,200
analyzing in

325
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,580
for example the few

326
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,210
manali was debugger

327
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:35,610
uh... you

328
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:39,180
actually takes

329
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,630
twelve hours

330
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,050
and the reason the blades

331
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,390
makes me nuts

332
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,990
so you just

333
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,780
presidency and

334
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,250
uh... some al gore

335
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,000
assays that this is member corruptions

336
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,020
from scissors affair for the file

337
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:59,250
sold the blaze

338
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,320
consists of two main art

339
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,430
uh... vine

340
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,260
which is

341
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:06,930
kind of static competent and took signal
which is

342
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,610
that i'm a canal his competence

343
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:12,310
and there are a lot of uh... perhaps

344
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,369
uh... the

345
00:14:14,369 --> 00:14:17,490
their cost

346
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:21,290
but t there a lot of paper psychedelic
papers who can read it

347
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,090
their actually great

348
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:25,060
uh... so

349
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,720
this is a dynamic barked team all

350
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,110
uh...

351
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,900
gold it's

352
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,280
nicely

353
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,520
it's assumed

354
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,160
based on chemo

355
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,690
uh...

356
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:39,060
on faster and later

357
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:42,559
and the there is an does keenly just
kinda later

358
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:46,990
it's uh... know nothing about brought us
about frances

359
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,350
files just

360
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,130
process instructions

361
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,120
soul

362
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,140
uh... to when the whole

363
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,390
what to tracy

364
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,170
whereas the process

365
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:59,120
as a reserve semantic struc ture

366
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,900
it's a and in windows it's too

367
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,800
implemented by a driver

368
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,030
that's an threatened to tradition or
teens

369
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,970
for example if some brought some stocks

370
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,280
uh... it uh...

371
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,120
gets it

372
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,050
message that uh... this be a teases

373
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,019
uh... process started and

374
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:19,170
by uh... some registered

375
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,350
interruption

376
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:23,370
it sends

377
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:26,190
some in fortis that post

378
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,450
so as a reserve

379
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,040
uh... communication between

380
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,750
demolition gassed

381
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,990
whereas there are some

382
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,040
barbequing

383
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,550
uh... software

384
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,600
executing

385
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,890
and that hosts wears a bind and

386
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:41,630
and at everything

387
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,890
and uh... it

388
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,670
the second the

389
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:49,380
the actually main to paint the house and
senate

390
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:53,220
so it's a implementing baked caulking
each instruction

391
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,310
and uh...

392
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:57,250
poppy for example he fits

393
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,270
from registry to

394
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,730
uh... memory

395
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:03,720
and registries painted

396
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,920
it didn't

397
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,250
implements purple gation so we just got
beat

398
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,640
uh...

399
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,730
uh... in full

400
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:15,040
and uh...

401
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,600
there is a m

402
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,949
alot of for

403
00:16:17,949 --> 00:16:19,210
actually

404
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,940
cold in there

405
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,690
because a m

406
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,700
alot of fun

407
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,370
strange gold 'cause etc etc

408
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:29,460
arctic

409
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:32,190
x's uh... eighty-six last year

410
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:35,220
as that of locked in a lot of
constructions

411
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,270
and

412
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,300
if you take a look at teaming

413
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,569
it serves just

414
00:16:40,569 --> 00:16:42,760
you can see that

415
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,450
a lot to the thought of

416
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:45,930
uh... functions uh...

417
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:48,770
week we've named spotlight constructions

418
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:52,760
and there is a and that uh... up around
santa just

419
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,270
uh... doing some

420
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,430
actions with uh...

421
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,550
being info

422
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,230
and uh...

423
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:04,089
on top of that there is at the p_r_i_

424
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:05,079
uh...

425
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:07,410
by uses its deep yeah you can

426
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:10,160
uh... cold you can dental appt

427
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,130
alot intersting tools

428
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:17,039
all i could you've been optometric

429
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,280
automatically dot

430
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,750
do called on baking mall where analysis

431
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,839
uh...

432
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,260
does the

433
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,980
this talk about the liabilities

434
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,279
uh... are you still

435
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:30,530
by the tracing

436
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:34,260
for me to say intersting

437
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,429
uh... lesson program

438
00:17:36,429 --> 00:17:40,669
lots of some data where how to trigger
the crash

439
00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:42,679
in automatically

440
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:49,520
uh... there is a uh... a lot of freight
guys for example

441
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,510
is there is a dat guy thinks it's a

442
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:56,220
of users there

443
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,120
process started

444
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,550
this has all of the four intersting

445
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,570
so basically

446
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:04,210
it's kind of four

447
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:07,620
uh... brutal machine butts not fearful

448
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,159
and later

449
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:12,460
uh... 'cause it's the

450
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:15,390
based

451
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,800
barry all

452
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,960
for sure

453
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,919
uh... on version

454
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,670
all point nine point

455
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,779
it was uh... released to you know

456
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:31,720
it was uh... dj generate to southern

457
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,380
and the the has that

458
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,520
its full

459
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,700
because the before

460
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,950
marked

461
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:41,640
uh... and the man

462
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,940
fact that

463
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,769
teaming based on dispersion of chemo

464
00:18:47,769 --> 00:18:49,829
and model of the latest one

465
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:52,059
does the impersonal for all

466
00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:53,289
went down

467
00:18:53,289 --> 00:18:55,919
uh... developers of chemo

468
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,490
uh... made uh... ultimo a lot of

469
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:02,950
in council for

470
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,180
performance

471
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,950
uh... the implemented

472
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,410
technical generator

473
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,860
and that after that's a implementing

474
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,630
deeper predation aldo

475
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:14,010
uh...

476
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,740
there is a the broke

477
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,320
something shouting

478
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,340
and uh...

479
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,450
their blaze steamboat

480
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:24,059
and the actually when i see you how tiny
co-director

481
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:27,340
it's not clear how to implement uh...
tink

482
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:32,670
uh... appropriation mobile with thankful
generator

483
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,820
sold maybe at uh...

484
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:39,470
it's a with the idea to get uh... late
dispersion of morgan

485
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,950
remove some called clinical generator

486
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:46,970
so downgrades but uh... the thing is
it's thankful generator it's kind of

487
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:52,190
uh... teacher of king

488
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,180
bind

489
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,640
uh... by node system

490
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,380
so

491
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,550
between

492
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,910
took a multi millions just

493
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,179
the main

494
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:01,980

495
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,010
pizza

496
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:06,750
traced trace everything

497
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,140
traceable

498
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,830
if we talk about mine

499
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:13,590
uh... some main uh... per person padhne
mein

500
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,169
it's uh...

501
00:20:15,169 --> 00:20:15,950
in houston

502
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:18,680
intimate language

503
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,790
and uh...

504
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:20,559
uh...

505
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,610
if you're talking about uh... tracing

506
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:25,770
the front and for the for example
phrases

507
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:30,870
and there there is a somewhat deals
which processes trace file and to

508
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:35,000
generate i'll

509
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,259
and uh...

510
00:20:36,259 --> 00:20:37,929
i think that uh...

511
00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:38,980
iol

512
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,690
buttons are males language

513
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,330
uh... some domain

514
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:44,700
idea different implementing novel

515
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,940
demeulemeester

516
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,730
it's too

517
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,340
it simplified

518
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:52,580
unified

519
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,520
so

520
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,890
uh...

521
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:58,230
ducking about x eighty six are stuart

522
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,760
it's uh...

523
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,090
and

524
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,260
instruction are not

525
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,040
definitely not

526
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,640
for example uh... since

527
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,490
acts at instruction

528
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:15,490
it's a adhesion and then exchange it'd
changelist of uh... or complex

529
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,740
when you when you have to such

530
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,440
operations at

531
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,280
influences a

532
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,760
alot of objects

533
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,360
uh... brewed up eight year to listen to
fight

534
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,690
and the

535
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,250
with this uh...

536
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,200
uh...

537
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,909
intermarried language there is a

538
00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:34,830
if you take a look

539
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,550
seven instructions

540
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:39,740
and actually uh...

541
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,510
the main event

542
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,580
lar

543
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,460
jumped

544
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,520
she jumped

545
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,809
uh... and to the reserve

546
00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:49,679
for special come out

547
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,660
holds the star p-labeled

548
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,820
a special

549
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,260
uh...

550
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,299
program just uh...

551
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:59,970
mattbeaton declaration instructions

552
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:05,100
uh... there is a also expression than
the thing is

553
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,410
what is the knifing behind

554
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:08,980
this intermail language

555
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:12,810
so weak upenn

556
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:14,860
just form

557
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,240
tracfone

558
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,950
march cure

559
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,810
uh... another ct too

560
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:20,919
uh... cause

561
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:21,890
you

562
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,440
pizza

563
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,700
uh... for example doesn't matter what
powell

564
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,710
memory works just to

565
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,760
no has

566
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,450
or one process

567
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:34,630
and then

568
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:36,010
is there is a

569
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:37,460
uh...

570
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,600
operations like

571
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,679
plus meaning my nose

572
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:44,070
uh...

573
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:47,410
duma reparations

574
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:48,330
or chili

575
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:49,470
there um...

576
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:51,430
some kind of

577
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,720
of failures for example

578
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,890
uh... one one beats it

579
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:59,279
needs to sixteen

580
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:01,059
and the

581
00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:05,440
and i think that the memory could
represent indian

582
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:11,190
begins in the league indeed linden
doesn't matter

583
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,850
when you trace file program police

584
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,880
crazy captains m

585
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,250
process

586
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,660
uh...

587
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:21,330
this trace file two

588
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:23,970
to see you what actually

589
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:26,160
uh... instruction in there

590
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,470
at you

591
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:31,580
you'll see something like that

592
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,350
there's a dress

593
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,809
instruction

594
00:23:34,809 --> 00:23:36,460
and a_t_t_

595
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,820
depicts and

596
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:41,410
before instruction actually it's a kind
of

597
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:43,370
thinking for

598
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:45,240
before we take a look

599
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,780
uh...

600
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,990
g zero means that statement

601
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,289
it's not think that

602
00:23:50,289 --> 00:23:52,810
uh... to muses juwan

603
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:54,400
means for that

604
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,320
tha

605
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,820
have some

606
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,059
debut full

607
00:23:58,059 --> 00:24:00,299
was so for example insisted

608
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:01,760
uh...

609
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,799
instruction

610
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:03,970
reps toast

611
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:06,360
uh... would have run

612
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,430
the axe

613
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,490
which is it

614
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:09,480
uh...

615
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,610
not think that

616
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,929
there is a marked to zero

617
00:24:12,929 --> 00:24:15,159
and uh... memory

618
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:18,220
which is then has uh... some

619
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:21,630
painted in fall

620
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:23,230
and that repairs

621
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:25,440
it's the

622
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,520
not

623
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,690
estimate instructions there is a rep

624
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:29,620
graphics

625
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:32,880
and the wrapped used to use

626
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,359
contour will re-register

627
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:37,309
sold as there is a

628
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,440
several objects

629
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,800
for example i register a

630
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,250
the a acs

631
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,710
register or u

632
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:44,790
the acts

633
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,810
memory at that time were present

634
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,559
and then

635
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,180
as there is a also

636
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:53,850
uh... if you see it r_c_ dull user

637
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:55,799
uh... some kind of fun

638
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:57,470
info about

639
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:00,950
howell object to

640
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:04,910
uh... y-axis just uh...

641
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,780
uh... basically

642
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,900
is just rush bit this person

643
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,810
done it

644
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:12,809
the your belly of the year x reads and

645
00:25:12,809 --> 00:25:14,610
assigned to memory

646
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:15,720
at uh...

647
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,380
uh... addressed uh...

648
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:20,900
which equals u_p_i_ instructed

649
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:25,420
register so afternoon you can see that
there is a

650
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,490
uh...

651
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:27,790
some

652
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,560
digits after

653
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:33,860
t one it'd and for dumpty ftv

654
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,870
comes from

655
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:35,860
net oracle

656
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,460
but then the

657
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,110
twelfth that he wanted to see

658
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,570
for example if seth

659
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:43,910
and uh...

660
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:46,330
you can implement a lot of float

661
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:50,590
your polling ting beautiful

662
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,480
as it is this is the info you got to the
after

663
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,500
trays

664
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,480
uh... but uh... you

665
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,289
you just

666
00:25:58,289 --> 00:26:00,200
it just for reading

667
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,420
actually the thing that he is

668
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,279
to generated

669
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:06,479
helped alot from the press by all

670
00:26:06,479 --> 00:26:08,400
uh... and

671
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,400
ever played

672
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,910
actually does it

673
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,789
sold

674
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:16,640
uh... the skin

675
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,870
use in all of

676
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:18,609
uh... pat

677
00:26:18,609 --> 00:26:21,040
application replete with you

678
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,910
and uh...

679
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:27,309
uh... when you have steps the some
include a ton

680
00:26:27,309 --> 00:26:32,320
uh... actually eat soon means that it's
benefit echo control

681
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,029
so warmth

682
00:26:34,029 --> 00:26:35,740
they intern maryland which

683
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,330
uh... their marks the inputs

684
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,100
index

685
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,630
upset

686
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:42,590
and then

687
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:45,600
type of the value

688
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,540
so it

689
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,360
this is kind of

690
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,929
for example

691
00:26:51,929 --> 00:26:54,519
that's been looks like gogo

692
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:56,010
intermail initialed

693
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:58,370
so there is a violinist uh...

694
00:26:58,370 --> 00:26:59,510
types

695
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,470
assignments

696
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:03,080
uh... so

697
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,480
the main thing behind

698
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,010
free worry about

699
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:09,000
used to

700
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,250
you have some

701
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,040
uh... first braces

702
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:12,770
which year

703
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:14,190
hours some

704
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:18,029
functions and the that's there was some
function

705
00:27:18,029 --> 00:27:19,419
you have uh...

706
00:27:19,419 --> 00:27:21,340
at some conditional jump

707
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:24,340
uh... you will not change for example

708
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,539
alerting direction

709
00:27:26,539 --> 00:27:29,320
so for that looms this perverse

710
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,580
the reserve

711
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,450
w_b_ will

712
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:37,519
which is the condition of acutely in
uh... bein package and then

713
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:40,179
ito from intermail tonnage

714
00:27:40,179 --> 00:27:42,130
if the produces a

715
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,700
it's to be cold

716
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,690
and that the pizza

717
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:46,950
sold or

718
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,390
constraints seller

719
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:52,290
uh... this is a not about the bassist
separate

720
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:53,320
actually is

721
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,000
s_d_p_ in my opinion it's not the best
one

722
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,260
there is a also extend to you

723
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,150
uh... from my personal victory

724
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:02,649
but uh...

725
00:28:02,649 --> 00:28:05,910
buying antibodies uses is

726
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:08,180
and uh...

727
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,149
for example

728
00:28:09,149 --> 00:28:11,610
uh... after the that would be with you

729
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:13,800
uh... process is a some file

730
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,050
it generates s_d_p_ program

731
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:19,010
so s_d_p_ actually

732
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:21,139
uh... there is a own language

733
00:28:21,139 --> 00:28:23,029
which is a

734
00:28:23,029 --> 00:28:25,420
maybe more

735
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:28,559
yours on that

736
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,389
and them the main thing

737
00:28:31,389 --> 00:28:33,320
the solar it's the salt something

738
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,519
and um... the tree cadets

739
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:37,299
would have to some praise some

740
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:41,520
demanded language program some s_d_p_
program

741
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,909
we change

742
00:28:44,909 --> 00:28:47,360
condition on some

743
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,690
and took warik false and

744
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:51,690
say give us pontoon sample so

745
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:52,980
the main idea

746
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,030
use to

747
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,500
i haven't

748
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,350
uh... to get there

749
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:59,960
tell me that i'm not

750
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,420
i'm not through the true

751
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,090
so

752
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:07,210
not on not to give us through and
this'll

753
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:10,290
you for you to change some

754
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,200
and do it

755
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,470
uh... query affected this brought this
dipti program is false

756
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:17,490
and to give a sponsor example

757
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:20,300
is dpm

758
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,389
we were

759
00:29:22,389 --> 00:29:24,309
produced

760
00:29:24,309 --> 00:29:25,520
uh... i'll quote

761
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,460
uh... output software s_d_p_ youths

762
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:31,030
and brick by list for priyo revolved

763
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:35,380
so for example

764
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,740
this uh...

765
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,530
answer or fifty pieces

766
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:40,600
invalid

767
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,000
and there is a

768
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,230
values for some kind of

769
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,260
into place

770
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,190
so with uh... after

771
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:51,720
lee we generate end second incubated
with these fellas

772
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,230
we can get them out

773
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,370
uh... back

774
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:57,330
the program

775
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:58,840
as is actually

776
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,230

777
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:02,620

778
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,330
of forty more

779
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,690
and then

780
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:08,630
is it uh...

781
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:10,070
as i said before

782
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:12,760
uh... the blaze was released in public

783
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,110
it's uh...

784
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:17,020
to look for

785
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,120

00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,520

whole process

839
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,980
uh... to get through some results

840
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:29,100
so for example

841
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,350
every program

842
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:32,170
it's a

that there is no thursday adage

844
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:35,540
for example

845
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,110
ida pro plugin

846
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,740
uh...

847
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,670
said that

848
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:41,240

uh... potential dangerous from popping

00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:50,160
and it would have traced with half bath

853
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,200
that you know that

854
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,150
and the the main purpose it's too

855
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:56,950
uh... how to get

874
00:33:39,409 --> 00:33:40,490
at

875
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:42,080
range of some

876
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,860
objects and do it

877
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,820
uh... on some

878
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,860
uh... not conditional branch

879
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:53,540
there's actual branch does there is a
abrasion on uh... memory and

880
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,850
this instruction

881
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:56,080
uh...

882
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,659
exception to be triggered

883
00:33:57,659 --> 00:34:01,510
and you'll find a redirect to exception
handler

884
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:03,160
uh... so

885
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,400
i'm basically

886
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,860
there is a

887
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:11,849
uh... kind of thing resemble invisible
bathroom program

888
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:13,329
so uh...

889
00:34:13,329 --> 00:34:14,969
mike's temperature of the

890
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:15,999
all cold

891
00:34:15,999 --> 00:34:18,009
it soon

892
00:34:18,009 --> 00:34:19,529
uh...

893
00:34:19,529 --> 00:34:22,729
uh...

894
00:34:22,729 --> 00:34:24,250
from the static barked

895
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,219
it's there

896
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:27,399
uh...

897
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:30,689
just static park

898
00:34:30,689 --> 00:34:31,539
seed

899
00:34:31,539 --> 00:34:33,289
every picture

900
00:34:33,289 --> 00:34:36,019
the whole picture

901
00:34:36,019 --> 00:34:39,139
so the basic algorithm behind that

902
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:41,260
it's a first first of all

903
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:44,269
we'd get the reasons the

904
00:34:44,269 --> 00:34:45,599
uh... some

905
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:46,929
knowles

906
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:50,479
uh... word potential

907
00:34:50,479 --> 00:34:53,219
then the pool we unity mornin

908
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:54,189
and later

909
00:34:54,189 --> 00:34:55,729
uh... we you know

910
00:34:55,729 --> 00:34:57,510
envelope of targeted to cold

911
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,910
for example if we

912
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:00,369
there's been some

913
00:35:00,369 --> 00:35:02,239
uh... for example adalah breeder

914
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:05,440
uh... publisher just invoked by dobrimir
was

915
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,789
i won't be d_f_

916
00:35:06,789 --> 00:35:09,729
uh... zen tracing begins

917
00:35:09,729 --> 00:35:14,099
at some point we stopped racing now
converse that uh... too

918
00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:15,660
intermail language

919
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:18,299
the band we change intermediate language

920
00:35:18,299 --> 00:35:20,689
too

921
00:35:20,689 --> 00:35:23,559
get closer to

922
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:26,499
place where we're going on

923
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,579
unlicensed worried

924
00:35:28,579 --> 00:35:30,739
where we have to go actually

925
00:35:30,739 --> 00:35:32,130
and then

926
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,999
uh...

927
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:35,829
prime grove

928
00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:40,919
then uh... the pit by w due to weeded
generate

929
00:35:40,919 --> 00:35:42,630
uh... is to be program prime

930
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:45,189
and after sullivan s_d_p_ program

931
00:35:45,189 --> 00:35:47,199
prime we get to them

932
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:48,199
data

933
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:50,289
uh... after protesting

934
00:35:50,289 --> 00:35:52,099
uh... week uh... we

935
00:35:52,099 --> 00:35:54,319
would get uh...

936
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:55,969
you back

937
00:35:55,969 --> 00:35:58,929
and this is a looked too

938
00:35:58,929 --> 00:36:04,519
uh... points uh... to and uh...

939
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:05,789
there is a kind of

940
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:09,329
uh... there is no mt in this uh... alkyl

941
00:36:09,329 --> 00:36:14,749
uh... president

942
00:36:14,749 --> 00:36:16,910
there is a exit conditions

943
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:18,789
uh... i haven't so that

944
00:36:18,789 --> 00:36:21,199
correction and about them

945
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:24,819
well for example exit condition eve

946
00:36:24,819 --> 00:36:26,260
pictured if u

947
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:28,409
yeah i get crash read it

948
00:36:28,409 --> 00:36:30,069
yet you think that

949
00:36:30,069 --> 00:36:32,619
so we or you just

950
00:36:32,619 --> 00:36:33,939
perceives it

951
00:36:33,939 --> 00:36:35,559
uh... some cold

952
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:37,709
uh...

953
00:36:37,709 --> 00:36:39,799
doesn't

954
00:36:39,799 --> 00:36:41,579
connect to

955
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:44,529
incubator

956
00:36:44,529 --> 00:36:46,079
so was this is

957
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,879
uh...

958
00:36:48,879 --> 00:36:50,809
uh... the presentation

959
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:53,100
sold uh... would have

960
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:57,169
some integrated first

961
00:36:57,169 --> 00:36:58,769
you took the stand

962
00:36:58,769 --> 00:36:59,720
and later

963
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,389
as and uh...

964
00:37:01,389 --> 00:37:03,249
buying generates

965
00:37:03,249 --> 00:37:07,889
uh... intermingling which buys awake
uh... you can

966
00:37:07,889 --> 00:37:09,359
not just to

967
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:13,709
uh... trays upenn uh... do a lot of
uh... phoenix

968
00:37:13,709 --> 00:37:15,969
uh... from sample hooping

969
00:37:15,969 --> 00:37:18,859
uh... profiling and uh...

970
00:37:18,859 --> 00:37:19,640
does it

971
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,629
tina landau bovine

972
00:37:21,629 --> 00:37:23,220
connected to each other

973
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,099
you know you have to

974
00:37:25,099 --> 00:37:28,009
guilt you all binder two

975
00:37:28,009 --> 00:37:30,049
uh... which is

976
00:37:30,049 --> 00:37:33,810
youthful mucus viner the va user

977
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:36,009
developed in o'connell language

978
00:37:36,009 --> 00:37:37,150
uh... pizza

979
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:39,119
functional programming language

980
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,819
this kind of

981
00:37:40,819 --> 00:37:42,019
uh...

982
00:37:42,019 --> 00:37:43,379
blend for me

983
00:37:43,379 --> 00:37:45,579
uh... sold

984
00:37:45,579 --> 00:37:47,799
after the we get through

985
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:50,290
traced we generate i hope so

986
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:51,819
then we change bath

987
00:37:51,819 --> 00:37:54,389
and we uh... get too

988
00:37:54,389 --> 00:37:57,129
you get this the bracknell at

989
00:37:57,129 --> 00:37:59,519
s_d_p_ generates you today

990
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:02,529
so was

991
00:38:02,529 --> 00:38:03,709
easy

992
00:38:03,709 --> 00:38:05,389
straightforward idea

993
00:38:05,389 --> 00:38:09,069
but uh... actually it's uh... works

994
00:38:09,069 --> 00:38:10,060
uh...

995
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:13,719
group is a

996
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:17,429
it works but because food

997
00:38:17,429 --> 00:38:18,659
it's false

998
00:38:18,659 --> 00:38:20,299
well i will talk about it

999
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:22,189
mater

1000
00:38:22,189 --> 00:38:24,490
actually uh... the main room

1001
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:25,630
do the baggage

1002
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,779
well as the system pizza

1003
00:38:27,779 --> 00:38:30,159
uh... performance

1004
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:32,559
uh... and uh...

1005
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:34,999
uh... about four months

1006
00:38:34,999 --> 00:38:35,830
uh...

1007
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:37,809
and how-to

1008
00:38:37,809 --> 00:38:40,979
gabriel at just uh...

1009
00:38:40,979 --> 00:38:42,349
for example

1010
00:38:42,349 --> 00:38:43,360
usa

1011
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,789
uh... as a system

1012
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:47,499

1013
00:38:47,499 --> 00:38:50,019

1015
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:54,959
some part of the cold and them

1016
00:38:54,959 --> 00:38:57,509
uh... u

1017
00:38:57,509 --> 00:39:01,379
have a alot of input data is that uh...
uh...

1018
00:39:01,379 --> 00:39:02,809
each input data

1019
00:39:02,809 --> 00:39:03,650
uh...

1020
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:05,640
that powers uh... different

1021
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,960
bathroom program

1022
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,699
and then you just didn't you take

1023
00:39:09,699 --> 00:39:11,779
uh... uses data

1024
00:39:11,779 --> 00:39:13,269
and uh... this approach

1025
00:39:13,269 --> 00:39:14,999
benefit a combination of

results

1030
00:39:25,049 --> 00:39:28,179
so um... dude ranches collective

1031
00:39:28,179 --> 00:39:30,909
premises for months and actually

1032

logical order of realtors

1038
00:39:41,909 --> 00:39:43,359
which you actually

00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:44,419
the

1040
00:39:44,419 --> 00:39:45,709

00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,839
there is a kind of

1049
00:40:02,839 --> 00:40:04,589
solvent

1050
00:40:04,589 --> 00:40:05,570

and the actually

1055
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:13,709
he owed it to

1056
00:40:13,709 --> 00:40:15,039
depends upon

1057
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:17,190
uh... how much of and john ulti

1058

00:40:28,499 --> 00:40:29,970
uh...

1064
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:31,519
very weekly

1065
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:34,309
and it depends on your target does

1066

uh...

1067
00:40:36,529 --> 00:40:37,480
tracy's

1068
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,630
a lot of for

1069
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:41,699
uh... some be programs like google's

who are guilty in mike's office

1076
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:03,729
which item found recently and uh...

1077
00:41:03,729 --> 00:41:07,069
actually uh...

1078
00:41:07,069 --> 00:41:08,220
generating

1079
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:12,449
uh... just tracing deserve honorable

actually datasets gracious mike forbes

1081
00:41:15,159 --> 00:41:16,749
uh...

1082
00:41:16,749 --> 00:41:19,249
take this uh... about forty minutes

1083
00:41:19,249 --> 00:41:23,999
and uh... trace violence about uh...
thirteen he divides

1084
00:41:23,999 --> 00:41:26,429
and uh... uh... when you have such a

1085
00:41:26,429 --> 00:41:28,279
uh... decode

1086
00:41:28,279 --> 00:41:29,250
trace file

1087
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:31,220
health program is uh...

1088
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,509
if you wish to

1089
00:41:32,509 --> 00:41:34,049
and the new

1090
00:41:34,049 --> 00:41:36,829
it's simply

1091
00:41:36,829 --> 00:41:38,649
at berkeley simply

1092
00:41:38,649 --> 00:41:40,430
counts of protests dot

1093
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:41,339
fish

1094
00:41:41,339 --> 00:41:43,619
huge files

1095
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:47,029
so i mean

1096
00:41:47,029 --> 00:41:48,859
you might be needed to

1097
00:41:48,859 --> 00:41:53,119
uh... this is delays it it's not too

1098
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,319
being ford

1099
00:41:55,319 --> 00:41:56,939
usual and programs

1100
00:41:56,939 --> 00:41:58,579
in just two

1101
00:41:58,579 --> 00:41:59,869
uh... is better

1102
00:41:59,869 --> 00:42:01,079
usa

1103
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:04,529
uh... intools as there is a some project
kal

1104
00:42:04,529 --> 00:42:08,669
uh... holds d_p_ it's the same is the
blaze

1105
00:42:08,669 --> 00:42:11,759
but it's uh... prime plus into

1106
00:42:11,759 --> 00:42:15,859
so if you uh... like too

1107
00:42:15,859 --> 00:42:18,059
for discover or a built-in

1108
00:42:18,059 --> 00:42:20,730
uh... home internet explorer with them

1109
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:22,269
usual m program

1110
00:42:22,269 --> 00:42:27,069
uh... it's better use vp zen

1111
00:42:27,069 --> 00:42:29,220
uh... doodles maybe i did

1112
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:31,219
is much much foster is an

1113
00:42:31,219 --> 00:42:35,719
uh... team

1114
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,759
there is a also

1115
00:42:37,759 --> 00:42:39,729
implementation issues in

1116
00:42:39,729 --> 00:42:41,719
uh... debased itself does

1117
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:44,239
uh... invited

1118
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:45,839
buying uses uh...

1119
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:47,119
d_x_

1120
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:49,530
and that uh... teaming for

1121
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:51,319
uh... logging

1122
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:52,839
uh...

1123
00:42:52,839 --> 00:42:54,169
instructions

1124
00:42:54,169 --> 00:42:56,270
uh... it uh... uses uh...

1125
00:42:56,270 --> 00:43:00,799
just under said that that and then

1126
00:43:00,799 --> 00:43:05,329
the thing is that uh...

1127
00:43:05,329 --> 00:43:08,489
some over the instructions

1128
00:43:08,489 --> 00:43:10,239
i can't handle

1129
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:13,079
uh... for example some special

1130
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:17,119
uh... conalep instruction

1131
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,249
team

1132
00:43:18,249 --> 00:43:22,949
bust president backs is part of bombing
for use in four years old and programs

1133
00:43:22,949 --> 00:43:24,889
and uh...

1134
00:43:24,889 --> 00:43:27,339
aper played for example cutie

1135
00:43:27,339 --> 00:43:32,099
and it's uh...

1136
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:34,439
only generates a interest

1137
00:43:34,439 --> 00:43:36,509
language for single threat

1138
00:43:36,509 --> 00:43:37,839
so

1139
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:40,880
it's uh...

1140
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,700
basically ford usual m programs that's
it

1141
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,959
you will not to get

1142
00:43:46,959 --> 00:43:47,960
of some

1143
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:51,459
re real results

1144
00:43:51,459 --> 00:43:53,669
this is a system

1145
00:43:53,669 --> 00:43:54,929
actually

1146
00:43:54,929 --> 00:43:56,939
uh... kind of concept

1147
00:43:56,939 --> 00:43:58,150
it's a

1148
00:43:58,150 --> 00:44:00,229
you know

1149
00:44:00,229 --> 00:44:01,649
not burn

1150
00:44:01,649 --> 00:44:05,619
i would say it said good only versus
uh... from

1151
00:44:05,619 --> 00:44:09,649
a coat some part of course and then

1152
00:44:09,649 --> 00:44:11,349
in my uh... research

1153
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:12,369
uh... out

1154
00:44:12,369 --> 00:44:14,440
ideal throughout that

1155
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:17,909
uh... the blazes better use for
paralleled

1156
00:44:17,909 --> 00:44:20,299
occurs there is a less call

1157
00:44:20,299 --> 00:44:21,639
and then

1158
00:44:21,639 --> 00:44:23,569
traces are smaller

1159
00:44:23,569 --> 00:44:25,200
interment at the

1160
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,839
language programs smaller

1161
00:44:26,839 --> 00:44:28,489
a recent smaller and

1162
00:44:28,489 --> 00:44:30,429
for a and works uh...

1163
00:44:30,429 --> 00:44:32,769
uh... faster than

1164
00:44:32,769 --> 00:44:34,309
do you wanna priests

1165
00:44:34,309 --> 00:44:36,899
some you'd lent

1166
00:44:36,899 --> 00:44:39,889
uh... and button but actually

1167
00:44:39,889 --> 00:44:41,889
even in parallel to

1168
00:44:41,889 --> 00:44:46,779
uh... also performances so very bad
stolen

1169
00:44:46,779 --> 00:44:47,660
about so

1170
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:48,879
future of

1171
00:44:48,879 --> 00:44:49,619
uh... this

1172
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:51,439
of that system

1173
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:54,639
it's uh...

1174
00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:57,979
reduce over hot overhead of for months

1175
00:44:57,979 --> 00:44:59,579
and the

1176
00:44:59,579 --> 00:45:01,949
the bottleneck offices system

1177
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:04,289
definitely searching

1178
00:45:04,289 --> 00:45:05,899
uh... and the

1179
00:45:05,899 --> 00:45:07,689
team which is basically

1180
00:45:07,689 --> 00:45:10,729
so uh... straightforward

1181
00:45:10,729 --> 00:45:12,069
uh...

1182
00:45:12,069 --> 00:45:14,680
uh... thought it's uh... we have to

1183
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:15,749
removing some

1184
00:45:15,749 --> 00:45:16,869
somehow

1185
00:45:16,869 --> 00:45:18,809
well for example of

1186
00:45:18,809 --> 00:45:23,139
uh... more for uh... algorithm of paper
patient hypo other

1187
00:45:23,139 --> 00:45:25,859
and uh... my opinion that it will

1188
00:45:25,859 --> 00:45:29,409
depends uh... uh... forman solarz

1189
00:45:29,409 --> 00:45:31,249
uh... but uh...

1190
00:45:31,249 --> 00:45:33,119
told the full uh...

1191
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:35,359
cold for current right

1192
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:38,069
uh... there is a some project aber

1193
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:40,369
uh... which is uh... based on sound

1194
00:45:40,369 --> 00:45:42,329
but uh... it uh...

1195
00:45:42,329 --> 00:45:43,779
death penalty

1196
00:45:43,779 --> 00:45:45,899
death in my opinion cuz

1197
00:45:45,899 --> 00:45:48,069
it's uh... about

1198
00:45:48,069 --> 00:45:51,269
do it's about four years old

1199
00:45:51,269 --> 00:45:53,289
and doesn't

1200
00:45:53,289 --> 00:45:56,019
upgrading

1201
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:58,779
and uh...

1202
00:45:58,779 --> 00:46:00,140
uh... necklaces stop

1203
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:01,309
it's uh...

1204
00:46:01,309 --> 00:46:03,940
but the mission of explode generation
'cause this system

1205
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:07,910
it generates an adjuster perfect
concepts just uh...

1206
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:10,219
it did just triggers a crash

1207
00:46:10,219 --> 00:46:11,649
and

1208
00:46:11,649 --> 00:46:13,729
automate explode generation

1209
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:15,599
in grill or older

1210
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:19,219
we uh... pleasing a lot of split into
gatien's

1211
00:46:19,219 --> 00:46:20,689
and uh...

1212
00:46:20,689 --> 00:46:22,239
uh...

1213
00:46:22,239 --> 00:46:24,849
degenerate riyadh will exploit

1214
00:46:24,849 --> 00:46:27,119
uh... you have to

1215
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:29,369
beauty some state

1216
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:30,730
uh... so for example could

1217
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:32,680
talking about uh...

1218
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,150
fuller forged

1219
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:36,109
here's land he for a full

1220
00:46:36,109 --> 00:46:38,219
you have to

1221
00:46:38,219 --> 00:46:38,869
uh... yes

1222
00:46:38,869 --> 00:46:42,579
forget it different manfred mann some
powell solo

1223
00:46:42,579 --> 00:46:46,179
uh...

1224
00:46:46,179 --> 00:46:47,749
for example

1225
00:46:47,749 --> 00:46:49,309
stagnate or fall

1226
00:46:49,309 --> 00:46:50,320
in my opinion

1227
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:51,739
uh...

1228
00:46:51,739 --> 00:46:52,999
the move

1229
00:46:52,999 --> 00:46:55,310
just to have gone and history

1230
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:57,359
because there is a suspect cannery

1231
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:00,899
and uh... and pizza and

1232
00:47:00,899 --> 00:47:02,769
spectator protection ever

1233
00:47:02,769 --> 00:47:04,369
uh... by now it's too

1234
00:47:04,369 --> 00:47:06,099
almost everywhere

1235
00:47:06,099 --> 00:47:08,939
uh... but the in fact i

1236
00:47:08,939 --> 00:47:13,150
uh... pn discouraged data have
discovered some part of his some

1237
00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:15,009
into ours there is a

1238
00:47:15,009 --> 00:47:17,639
nor stick battery

1239
00:47:17,639 --> 00:47:18,510
eqn

1240
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:21,189
yeah in tucson twelve

1241
00:47:21,189 --> 00:47:24,380
uh... and that is the main broza may no
problem

1242
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:26,369
of automation explode generation

1243
00:47:26,369 --> 00:47:30,799
that's even if you get yet detained at
the gate the under your control

1244
00:47:30,799 --> 00:47:31,930
you

1245
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:33,769
gnomes act formalin

1246
00:47:33,769 --> 00:47:40,659
uh... howled input data

1247
00:47:40,659 --> 00:47:42,039
change dat

1248
00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:44,159
it doesn't mean that the u

1249
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:45,050
difficult thing

1250
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:47,040
you have exploited

1251
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,149
guzar there is a random ization

1252
00:47:49,149 --> 00:47:50,760
and uh... there is a

1253
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,440
hot topic on the internet

1254
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,069
how to automate uh... memory leakage

1255
00:47:55,069 --> 00:47:57,079
uh... to be loot to

1256
00:47:57,079 --> 00:47:58,640
uh... control at the end

1257
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:03,519
nowhere is this some binary sites

1258
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:06,409
in my opinion leads

1259
00:48:06,409 --> 00:48:09,589
he if someone uh... solved

1260
00:48:09,589 --> 00:48:10,709
most all that

1261
00:48:10,709 --> 00:48:13,629
she will be doing there

1262
00:48:13,629 --> 00:48:16,429
sold there's a and other thoughts

1263
00:48:16,429 --> 00:48:18,969
uh... holy cow

1264
00:48:18,969 --> 00:48:21,479
uh... combined

1265
00:48:21,479 --> 00:48:23,089
and as a friend works

1266
00:48:23,089 --> 00:48:25,519
with this uh...

1267
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:28,689
frills uh... there is a one

1268
00:48:28,689 --> 00:48:29,889
group project

1269
00:48:29,889 --> 00:48:31,069
esti

1270
00:48:31,069 --> 00:48:33,879
it's uh...

1271
00:48:33,879 --> 00:48:35,819
olivine

1272
00:48:35,819 --> 00:48:39,319
last chemo andy you'd also use s_d_p_

1273
00:48:39,319 --> 00:48:41,550
uh... but uh... the great things that

1274
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:43,090
it based on the air

1275
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:45,189
the missed first of two more

1276
00:48:45,189 --> 00:48:47,359
it support uh... aram

1277
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,540
architecture and there's a reserve

1278
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:51,089
some benefit

1279
00:48:51,089 --> 00:48:52,549
new concept

1280
00:48:52,549 --> 00:48:54,229
that that is there is a

1281
00:48:54,229 --> 00:48:56,629
uh... mole

1282
00:48:56,629 --> 00:48:58,649
uh...

1283
00:48:58,649 --> 00:49:03,469
no point to too

1284
00:49:03,469 --> 00:49:05,699
between if you have

1285
00:49:05,699 --> 00:49:09,540
trace file there is a no points to
generate hi al

1286
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:12,400
s_d_p_

1287
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:17,730
city actually just like to use a alex is
a more skillful in that

1288
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:18,760
so

1289
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:22,369
housekeeping

1290
00:49:22,369 --> 00:49:25,339
let's uh... take a look about

1291
00:49:25,339 --> 00:49:27,779
uh... some

1292
00:49:27,779 --> 00:49:29,159
uh... examples

1293
00:49:29,159 --> 00:49:32,129
uh... for example uh... uh... for

1294
00:49:32,129 --> 00:49:33,169
relented

1295
00:49:33,169 --> 00:49:35,380
uh... over force tactful

1296
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:37,319
into your wonder all right sir

1297
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:39,729
i'm open to directorates race conditions

1298
00:49:39,729 --> 00:49:41,799
uh... and then

1299
00:49:41,799 --> 00:49:43,829
for example luke

1300
00:49:43,829 --> 00:49:46,869
various logical arnold to sole source at
internals

1301
00:49:46,869 --> 00:49:51,339
and uh... president there at all the
facts of political or religious it's a

1302
00:49:51,339 --> 00:49:53,789
heart to define them properly

1303
00:49:53,789 --> 00:49:54,940
so for example

1304
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:56,549
uh... this

1305
00:49:56,549 --> 00:49:59,039
of use very you

1306
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:01,099
uh... common in programs

1307
00:50:01,099 --> 00:50:04,460
uh... for example there is a
multiplications and

1308
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:06,209
allocation of

1309
00:50:06,209 --> 00:50:08,299
some size and there is a local

1310
00:50:08,299 --> 00:50:10,479
and there is a member of corruption

1311
00:50:10,479 --> 00:50:12,639
uh... ins at the

1312
00:50:12,639 --> 00:50:18,009
and now free your example little beat

1313
00:50:18,009 --> 00:50:18,720
you've

1314
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,949
there is a

1315
00:50:21,949 --> 00:50:23,879
weakened uh... define

1316
00:50:23,879 --> 00:50:27,029
uh... by uh... internment of language

1317
00:50:27,029 --> 00:50:29,539
called section of our duties

1318
00:50:29,539 --> 00:50:30,619
look like

1319
00:50:30,619 --> 00:50:31,640
for example

1320
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,469
uh...

1321
00:50:33,469 --> 00:50:36,299
or if we got to uh... to object

1322
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:39,809
and uh... sleeve

1323
00:50:39,809 --> 00:50:42,789
after some operation

1324
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:44,309
yet uh... can be

1325
00:50:44,309 --> 00:50:46,729
uh... multiplication

1326
00:50:46,729 --> 00:50:47,999
addition

1327
00:50:47,999 --> 00:50:50,030
uh... animation whatever

1328
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:51,409
and uh... then

1329
00:50:51,409 --> 00:50:52,779
uh...

1330
00:50:52,779 --> 00:50:54,419
thus far goes to

1331
00:50:54,419 --> 00:50:57,819
uh... allegation doesn't matter uh...
keep us back

1332
00:50:57,819 --> 00:50:59,449
are just uh...

1333
00:50:59,449 --> 00:51:01,830
you assignment of

1334
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:03,450
va you are able

1335
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:05,399
some call

1336
00:51:05,399 --> 00:51:08,179
uh...

1337
00:51:08,179 --> 00:51:11,609
to depends uh... on hook

1338
00:51:11,609 --> 00:51:14,189
range of the memory of the

1339
00:51:14,189 --> 00:51:16,229
um...

1340
00:51:16,229 --> 00:51:17,119
lengths

1341
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:18,230
and uh... there is a

1342
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:20,079
left to the resort

1343
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:22,419
uh...

1344
00:51:22,419 --> 00:51:23,829
addition

1345
00:51:23,829 --> 00:51:24,949
on that memory

1346
00:51:24,949 --> 00:51:27,129
and uh...

1347
00:51:27,129 --> 00:51:30,549
pictured the main barbarism in question

1348
00:51:30,549 --> 00:51:31,740
user is a

1349
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:33,979
very able uh...

1350
00:51:33,979 --> 00:51:35,769
is that or then

1351
00:51:35,769 --> 00:51:38,319
uh... purple and

1352
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:39,929
uh... it's uh...

1353
00:51:39,929 --> 00:51:41,769
it's uh...

1354
00:51:41,769 --> 00:51:43,569
uh...

1355
00:51:43,569 --> 00:51:47,749
looks like into out the buyout or
combines the right

1356
00:51:47,749 --> 00:51:49,969
uh... so

1357
00:51:49,969 --> 00:51:51,549
of

1358
00:51:51,549 --> 00:51:54,779
fruit for example it's a bit of course
is basic

1359
00:51:54,779 --> 00:51:56,450
definition lupus

1360
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:58,919
in real world there is a lot of four

1361
00:51:58,919 --> 00:52:00,460
on a different examples

1362
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:02,149
but uh... domain

1363
00:52:02,149 --> 00:52:04,579
uh... the main thought thats

1364
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:06,239
like that

1365
00:52:06,239 --> 00:52:08,559
so for example

1366
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:10,929
uh... actually

1367
00:52:10,929 --> 00:52:14,669
uh... basically yet we can definable
ability

1368
00:52:14,669 --> 00:52:16,230
yet he gets tainted

1369
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:18,869
but uh... also

1370
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:19,989
definition

1371
00:52:19,989 --> 00:52:21,329
i'm pointers

1372
00:52:21,329 --> 00:52:22,879
uh... barbara force

1373
00:52:22,879 --> 00:52:24,219
uh... uh...

1374
00:52:24,219 --> 00:52:26,789
injury or force

1375
00:52:26,789 --> 00:52:29,979
uh... into her operation and their
results

1376
00:52:29,979 --> 00:52:30,730
uh...

1377
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,449
prism

1378
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:34,689
a lot of uh... static

1379
00:52:34,689 --> 00:52:36,269
uh... part

1380
00:52:36,269 --> 00:52:37,799
well for the system

1381
00:52:37,799 --> 00:52:38,900
uh...

1382
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:41,259
you deserve a lot of false positives

1383
00:52:41,259 --> 00:52:43,339
uh...

1384
00:52:43,339 --> 00:52:44,919
it's kind of paranoid

1385
00:52:44,919 --> 00:52:46,909
it's a uh...

1386
00:52:46,909 --> 00:52:48,389
trolls everyday

1387
00:52:48,389 --> 00:52:54,739
uh... construction like lead idea over
lote expansion address and uh... at the

1388
00:52:54,739 --> 00:52:57,009
patient

1389
00:52:57,009 --> 00:53:01,460
like uh... it's a potential powerful and
too

1390
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:04,599
sulfur that it's the not special it's
uh...

1391
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:09,169
real you know you have to implement
survey of the loop

1392
00:53:09,169 --> 00:53:10,099
analysis

1393
00:53:10,099 --> 00:53:12,869
value character ranged

1394
00:53:12,869 --> 00:53:14,969
hi uh... what objects

1395
00:53:14,969 --> 00:53:16,679
packing the deep

1396
00:53:16,679 --> 00:53:18,139
uh... range from

1397
00:53:18,139 --> 00:53:19,879
uses gazans are not

1398
00:53:19,879 --> 00:53:21,880
and those for example define

1399
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:26,430
uh... race condition uh...
straightforward thing please just see is

1400
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:27,769
there is a

1401
00:53:27,769 --> 00:53:29,609
uh... someplace where there

1402
00:53:29,609 --> 00:53:31,319
uh... memory

1403
00:53:31,319 --> 00:53:32,419
somemore

1404
00:53:32,419 --> 00:53:33,980
uh... actions with memory

1405
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:36,259
and is there is a strict state

1406
00:53:36,259 --> 00:53:38,040
uh... and that you fits not

1407
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,339
its potential

1408
00:53:40,339 --> 00:53:44,009
there is potential race conditions

1409
00:53:44,009 --> 00:53:46,799
sold if we're talking about

1410
00:53:46,799 --> 00:53:49,179
uh... paralleled

1411
00:53:49,179 --> 00:53:52,179
uh... for example uh...

1412
00:53:52,179 --> 00:53:53,430
famous house i

1413
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:56,159
i had a steal

1414
00:53:56,159 --> 00:53:58,959
and uh...

1415
00:53:58,959 --> 00:54:02,209
let's pick a loop at the device out of
control

1416
00:54:02,209 --> 00:54:04,939
there are some uh...

1417
00:54:04,939 --> 00:54:05,889
of

1418
00:54:05,889 --> 00:54:07,619
prompter and that

1419
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:09,469
uh...

1420
00:54:09,469 --> 00:54:10,219
actually

1421
00:54:10,219 --> 00:54:13,309
uh... concept indeed behind

1422
00:54:13,309 --> 00:54:16,149
it's earned true

1423
00:54:16,149 --> 00:54:18,130
uh... i still cold

1424
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:19,960
paintball first thing length

1425
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:20,920
and see

1426
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:23,359
uh... for example

1427
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:25,220
there's a some of sorts

1428
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:28,029
uh... firstly weekend that

1429
00:54:28,029 --> 00:54:30,569
dainty only i still cold

1430
00:54:30,569 --> 00:54:32,529
not bar personal planks

1431
00:54:32,529 --> 00:54:34,030
just as still cold

1432
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:34,950
and see

1433
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:37,089
uh... or

1434
00:54:37,089 --> 00:54:39,259
what's uh... what's in the ward

1435
00:54:39,259 --> 00:54:43,140
exactly uh... range of i's still colds

1436
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:45,150
some argue i think that's

1437
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:50,660
hands and after only after that we think
the by offers and lancs

1438
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:51,480
to see

1439
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,170
uh... use there is a

1440
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:54,780
some arranged checks

1441
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:55,979
is there is some

1442
00:54:55,979 --> 00:54:59,389
uh... memory corruptions

1443
00:54:59,389 --> 00:55:01,029
uh...

1444
00:55:01,029 --> 00:55:03,069
and further and actually

1445
00:55:03,069 --> 00:55:04,519
falk

1446
00:55:04,519 --> 00:55:06,730
of device control

1447
00:55:06,730 --> 00:55:08,309
there is a

1448
00:55:08,309 --> 00:55:09,939
uh... to

1449
00:55:09,939 --> 00:55:11,669
uh...

1450
00:55:11,669 --> 00:55:14,939
method methods that uh...

1451
00:55:14,939 --> 00:55:16,349
if we

1452
00:55:16,349 --> 00:55:18,539
it's if it's another bomb parked

1453
00:55:18,539 --> 00:55:20,609
how you have to think only data

1454
00:55:20,609 --> 00:55:22,069
thank you profess to

1455
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:24,749
uh... driver bite

1456
00:55:24,749 --> 00:55:25,460
invoking

1457
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:28,630
i still empty fits that defies still
cold

1458
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:29,810
this method neither

1459
00:55:29,810 --> 00:55:32,720
it's better if you consider great to
thing

1460
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:33,939
pointer itself

1461
00:55:33,939 --> 00:55:34,839
fiza

1462
00:55:34,839 --> 00:55:37,879
in terror that in their output unit

1463
00:55:37,879 --> 00:55:39,979
manager of windows seven

1464
00:55:39,979 --> 00:55:42,619
just uh... doesn't uh...

1465
00:55:42,619 --> 00:55:43,929
chakkar

1466
00:55:43,929 --> 00:55:46,439
uh...

1467
00:55:46,439 --> 00:55:48,719
wonder mahlet on off

1468
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:50,039
sold

1469
00:55:50,039 --> 00:55:52,459
and basic concept

1470
00:55:52,459 --> 00:55:55,319
and uh... actually

1471
00:55:55,319 --> 00:55:56,479
road

1472
00:55:56,479 --> 00:55:58,829
this concept uh...

1473
00:55:58,829 --> 00:56:00,679
works for example

1474
00:56:00,679 --> 00:56:01,889
uh...

1475
00:56:01,889 --> 00:56:05,909
in uh... zoos those zero date

1476
00:56:05,909 --> 00:56:08,049
about twenty

1477
00:56:08,049 --> 00:56:09,930
twenty-month uh...

1478
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:11,290
old zero date

1479
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:14,299
uh... think is that uh...

1480
00:56:14,299 --> 00:56:16,369
i trusted khaled

1481
00:56:16,369 --> 00:56:18,900
uh... gold from there

1482
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,030
user lamp

1483
00:56:20,030 --> 00:56:21,379
goes to

1484
00:56:21,379 --> 00:56:24,650
somewhat panchen have to go arrest on
paper

1485
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:27,129
but uh... artillery lisa context

1486
00:56:27,129 --> 00:56:29,950
i was there but the war was developed
and food

1487
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:31,030
inset ways that

1488
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:32,339
uh...

1489
00:56:32,339 --> 00:56:34,599
only

1490
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:38,129
only load

1491
00:56:38,129 --> 00:56:40,359
on the

1492
00:56:40,359 --> 00:56:44,169
uh... data from the colonel

1493
00:56:44,169 --> 00:56:48,399
at till release context francis and a m

1494
00:56:48,399 --> 00:56:49,620
only colonel entered

1495
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:52,440
and if u somehow

1496
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:53,939
have to access to sabse

1497
00:56:53,939 --> 00:56:55,879
function farms they use the land

1498
00:56:55,879 --> 00:57:01,999
it's a first-time it said to come and
arbitrary memory butters and uh... you

1499
00:57:01,999 --> 00:57:05,129
uh... when uh... some courage next gold

1500
00:57:05,129 --> 00:57:09,239
and reveals that if u constrain some
object

1501
00:57:09,239 --> 00:57:11,190
you have to control

1502
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:13,769
uh... you will you will leave

1503
00:57:13,769 --> 00:57:16,619
it leads to intro lofty eighty totally

1504
00:57:16,619 --> 00:57:19,180
solan actually the for the first one

1505
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:22,910
yet decrements of or arbitrary memorex
already xd

1506
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:24,339
excludable condition

1507
00:57:24,339 --> 00:57:25,749
but uh...

1508
00:57:25,749 --> 00:57:27,509
if you wish to keep it if you

1509
00:57:27,509 --> 00:57:30,000
uh... or take mallory just to grant that

1510
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,649
and their protests that

1511
00:57:31,649 --> 00:57:37,239
uh... next you will see that that uh...
like there you have uh... total control

1512
00:57:37,239 --> 00:57:38,709
of ikea register

1513
00:57:38,709 --> 00:57:41,019

1514
00:57:41,019 --> 00:57:41,859

uh... that

1522
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:58,229
it's finally fixed

1523
00:57:58,229 --> 00:57:59,630
uh... also

1524
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:01,829
dollar richard and uh...

00:58:01,829 --> 00:58:03,779
uh... smart talking about

1526
00:58:03,779 --> 00:58:07,119
of smart or some interesting functions

1527
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:11,519
uh... reveals uh...

1528
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:12,729
strange

1529
00:58:12,729 --> 00:58:15,129
uh... realization off

1530
00:58:15,129 --> 00:58:17,799
some uh... defenses for example

1531
00:58:17,799 --> 00:58:20,349
uh... and privileged user account

1532
00:58:20,349 --> 00:58:22,139
uh... simply

1533
00:58:22,139 --> 00:58:23,649
tarnoff or

1534
00:58:23,649 --> 00:58:25,479
for firewall

1535
00:58:25,479 --> 00:58:27,890
uh... pizza

1536
00:58:27,890 --> 00:58:31,559
and degrees to and security of the

00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:33,290
uh... hold system

1538
00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:36,319
and then this thing is that

1539
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:39,409
it units that i still there is a or

1540
00:58:39,409 --> 00:58:40,559
to herbal teas

1541
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:45,879
i want to just to be so do you know
unturned reference ornery and and uh...

1542
00:58:45,879 --> 00:58:47,759
after

1543
00:58:47,759 --> 00:58:49,149
uh...

1544
00:58:49,149 --> 00:58:51,240
crash after open refrence

1545
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:56,389
there is a just a logical durability

1546
00:58:56,389 --> 00:58:59,699
the great example of four

1547
00:58:59,699 --> 00:59:01,039
november

1548
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:02,649
uh...

1549
00:59:02,649 --> 00:59:04,739
mistake unparalleled

1550
00:59:04,739 --> 00:59:06,749
that uh...

1551
00:59:06,749 --> 00:59:08,799
in fact technique and its uh...

1552
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:14,130
one of the firewall and anti-war scary
famous in russia

1553
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:15,469
but uh...

1554
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:17,239
and uh... the state

1555
00:59:17,239 --> 00:59:20,479
uh... bought some

1556
00:59:20,479 --> 00:59:22,880
and this is engine uh...

1557
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,359
picture these files you need

1558
00:59:24,359 --> 00:59:26,079
and indeed that's used

1559
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:29,489
it's got kind of a deal l buttoned
colonel answered

1560
00:59:29,489 --> 00:59:34,589
and the the thing is it's a in this bill
elvis's or about the

1561
00:59:34,589 --> 00:59:35,839
he the

1562
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:37,999
uh... expert functions

1563
00:59:37,999 --> 00:59:39,749
uh... but uh...

1564
00:59:39,749 --> 00:59:43,589
uh... it's a

1565
00:59:43,589 --> 00:59:48,229
the truth it you can involved with this
functions from the use of land

1566
00:59:48,229 --> 00:59:50,129
and uh... it

1567
00:59:50,129 --> 00:59:53,219
diseases functions uh... a lot of
arthur's

1568
00:59:53,219 --> 00:59:54,539
appoint or so

1569
00:59:54,539 --> 00:59:55,680
and uh...

1570
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:59,250
because there is a there is a full trust
fund them possitive

1571
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:01,369
it's a deal ok relented

1572
01:00:01,369 --> 01:00:03,969
and uh... no checks for pilot

1573
01:00:03,969 --> 01:00:05,659
uh... memory so

1574
01:00:05,659 --> 01:00:08,349
uh... to we'll

1575
01:00:08,349 --> 01:00:09,700
you simply visit

1576
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:11,879
it leads to keep the

1577
01:00:11,879 --> 01:00:15,659
different civil are built to fight
arbiter remember reader period

1578
01:00:15,659 --> 01:00:21,190
underwrite and the uh... football match
and the thing is that as is uh...

1579
01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:22,529
my code

1580
01:00:22,529 --> 01:00:25,679
uh... used by over several products

1581
01:00:25,679 --> 01:00:30,049
uh... over a sound

1582
01:00:30,049 --> 01:00:33,389
extreme so and brought the flowers
master

1583
01:00:33,389 --> 01:00:36,879
if u heard about

1584
01:00:36,879 --> 01:00:38,649
and the next uh...

1585
01:00:38,649 --> 01:00:39,480
and another

1586
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:41,429
but i uh... then

1587
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:43,089
does this system

1588
01:00:43,089 --> 01:00:44,769
i revealed some

1589
01:00:44,769 --> 01:00:47,329
unit intersting uh...

1590
01:00:47,329 --> 01:00:48,489
uh...

1591
01:00:48,489 --> 01:00:49,549
interesting

1592
01:00:49,549 --> 01:00:52,479
writing samples in their microsoft gold

1593
01:00:52,479 --> 01:00:54,819
uh... for example state

1594
01:00:54,819 --> 01:00:55,909
steeled

1595
01:00:55,909 --> 01:00:57,690
uh... yeah at one time

1596
01:00:57,690 --> 01:00:58,960
the command that the

1597
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,919
somali intersting

1598
01:01:00,919 --> 01:01:03,169
uh... from child is that you know

1599
01:01:03,169 --> 01:01:06,139
in in dollop of murder of windows

1600
01:01:06,139 --> 01:01:10,530
uh... for example uh... not a buffer
secret uh... i called alot signal

1601
01:01:10,530 --> 01:01:12,320
uh... 'cause if u

1602
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:13,910
testifies deal with

1603
01:01:13,910 --> 01:01:16,279
uh... stan

1604
01:01:16,279 --> 01:01:17,240
this year old

1605
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:19,160
langston zero point there's

1606
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:20,949
uh... it will work

1607
01:01:20,949 --> 01:01:24,520
craft to are p and processes to dry out

1608
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,959
and uh... actually the street to it

1609
01:01:26,959 --> 01:01:30,679
uh... to uh... a lot of local steve that
ideas of the box

1610
01:01:30,679 --> 01:01:32,579
actually uses civ

1611
01:01:32,579 --> 01:01:33,420
signal

1612
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:35,089
is a uh...

1613
01:01:35,089 --> 01:01:37,480
you were talking about seeing the rescue
team

1614
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:38,299
there is about

1615
01:01:38,299 --> 01:01:40,639
for everyone so if this kind

1616
01:01:40,639 --> 01:01:47,639
uh...

1617
01:01:48,639 --> 01:01:50,449
if we do uh...

1618
01:01:50,449 --> 01:01:51,809
phenolic sample

1619
01:01:51,809 --> 01:01:54,249
uh... some cool just uh... reboard

1620
01:01:54,249 --> 01:01:56,349
and later

1621
01:01:56,349 --> 01:02:01,029
another of the recessed uh... sorrow
eyes jail there is a

1622
01:02:01,029 --> 01:02:02,830
or corruptions sold

1623
01:02:02,830 --> 01:02:05,909
you can the discovered just in one

1624
01:02:05,909 --> 01:02:06,740
uh...

1625
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:09,399
particular product which should

1626
01:02:09,399 --> 01:02:10,949
basically

1627
01:02:10,949 --> 01:02:13,059
uh...

1628
01:02:13,059 --> 01:02:14,349
decreases

1629
01:02:14,349 --> 01:02:16,599
uh... security system

1630
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:18,970
by implementing new from childhood

1631
01:02:18,970 --> 01:02:22,779
and the thing is that city like in the

1632
01:02:22,779 --> 01:02:24,509
this example

1633
01:02:24,509 --> 01:02:26,189
one uh... driver

1634
01:02:26,189 --> 01:02:30,039
uh... using by several products the same
thing

1635
01:02:30,039 --> 01:02:31,349
of with these

1636
01:02:31,349 --> 01:02:33,419
as as driver s

1637
01:02:33,419 --> 01:02:36,609
uh... be argue it would be a raft that's
the issue

1638
01:02:36,609 --> 01:02:40,039
also presents in are threatened lavasoft

1639
01:02:40,039 --> 01:02:40,889
soul

1640
01:02:40,889 --> 01:02:41,839
actually

1641
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:43,989
about trend micro

1642
01:02:43,989 --> 01:02:45,969
are already

1643
01:02:45,969 --> 01:02:47,639
dr

1644
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:49,449
i keep in paris

1645
01:02:49,449 --> 01:02:51,219
actually uh...

1646
01:02:51,219 --> 01:02:54,339
also there's the not the device with the

1647
01:02:54,339 --> 01:02:57,629
uh... wants to you before i go to you

1648
01:02:57,629 --> 01:02:58,839
sold

1649
01:02:58,839 --> 01:03:00,439
the main people soft

1650
01:03:00,439 --> 01:03:01,809
uh...

1651
01:03:01,809 --> 01:03:03,099
deign to those that

1652
01:03:03,099 --> 01:03:05,759
there is a some

1653
01:03:05,759 --> 01:03:07,289
uh... problems

1654
01:03:07,289 --> 01:03:08,889
for example was stolen

1655
01:03:08,889 --> 01:03:13,509
uh... will which is for example you have
days i think that's

1656
01:03:13,509 --> 01:03:14,889
uh... through and

1657
01:03:14,889 --> 01:03:16,929
uh... to pilates

1658
01:03:16,929 --> 01:03:18,189
uh...

1659
01:03:18,189 --> 01:03:19,610
lengths of the strength

1660
01:03:19,610 --> 01:03:23,699
buys the books obstructing the finders
data

1661
01:03:23,699 --> 01:03:25,770
i think the but mantra annulled and

1662
01:03:25,770 --> 01:03:30,470
there is no and information often purple
gates uh... also was uh... false and

1663
01:03:30,470 --> 01:03:31,259
analysis

1664
01:03:31,259 --> 01:03:35,459
it's uh... pontoon the constant for this
purple base shin

1665
01:03:35,459 --> 01:03:36,849
and uh...

1666
01:03:36,849 --> 01:03:40,950
if you you can assault oldest brought
problems

1667
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:44,529
but uh... at q

1668
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:45,400
enhance

1669
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:50,109
levels of pain the information it's
mobile head

1670
01:03:50,109 --> 01:03:55,179
and the yeah about some of pitfalls of
thank you know it colonel and there is

1671
01:03:55,179 --> 01:04:00,879
also think information though a lost
uh... then the u

1672
01:04:00,879 --> 01:04:05,469
for example check off some system brave
als uh... which is you haven't

1673
01:04:05,469 --> 01:04:09,349
controlled uh... for example justin

1674
01:04:09,349 --> 01:04:11,139
you know the produce mold

1675
01:04:11,139 --> 01:04:12,339
tracted

1676
01:04:12,339 --> 01:04:17,589
some code the checks yuki if it's that
come from thrown from user and uh...

1677
01:04:17,589 --> 01:04:18,739
it's uh...

1678
01:04:18,739 --> 01:04:21,499
lori abel of uh... across the state

1679
01:04:21,499 --> 01:04:27,849
and uh... you haven't uh... tainted you
haven't seen anything so itself

1680
01:04:27,849 --> 01:04:32,839
and that's something false a of for
example there is a defense mechanism

1681
01:04:32,839 --> 01:04:35,759
uh... yeah uh... does it

1682
01:04:35,759 --> 01:04:39,269
when you think in the dirt pizza lowell

1683
01:04:39,269 --> 01:04:41,089
burial

1684
01:04:41,089 --> 01:04:42,070
soul

1685
01:04:42,070 --> 01:04:44,449
as there is a great uh...

1686
01:04:44,449 --> 01:04:49,949
performance over past and there is some
mechanisms that you for some process

1687
01:04:49,949 --> 01:04:51,569
uh...

1688
01:04:51,569 --> 01:04:54,660
uh... doing something your graphic

1689
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:56,799
the screen

1690
01:04:56,799 --> 01:04:59,729
uh... would get mood nothing

1691
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:01,039
so uh... oh

1692
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:06,389
about stupid false about high scale as a
said it's chicken it uh... of system

1693
01:05:06,389 --> 01:05:12,170
very able for example uh... getting off
pratice malt or some chips alf

1694
01:05:12,170 --> 01:05:13,619
the isn't proteins as

1695
01:05:13,619 --> 01:05:16,319
he's a professor uh...

1696
01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:18,330
our account arse engine

1697
01:05:18,330 --> 01:05:19,889
or it's attacker

1698
01:05:19,889 --> 01:05:23,439
and uh... some of their into our system
and uh...

1699
01:05:23,439 --> 01:05:24,929
implemented sent

1700
01:05:24,929 --> 01:05:26,079
cocaine

1701
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:29,449
uh... this function and the just uh...

1702
01:05:29,449 --> 01:05:31,799
close electorate uh... you know it

1703
01:05:31,799 --> 01:05:33,259
i think they'll

1704
01:05:33,259 --> 01:05:35,289
so in conclusion

1705
01:05:35,289 --> 01:05:37,599
uh... i think uh... satyam

1706
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:40,819
quality kinda for security level

1707
01:05:40,819 --> 01:05:42,179
yeah uh...

1708
01:05:42,179 --> 01:05:44,179
then tells us to

1709
01:05:44,179 --> 01:05:48,809
it's not too you it's another kind of
technique for above their main

1710
01:05:48,809 --> 01:05:55,809
time but uh... yatin meantime into uh...
mostly from academic and uh...

1711
01:05:58,139 --> 01:06:03,019
most of the people it

1712
01:06:03,019 --> 01:06:06,099
get uh... reported to have by using

1713
01:06:06,099 --> 01:06:08,929
affiliates to more

1714
01:06:08,929 --> 01:06:10,899
uh... simple solutions like

1715
01:06:10,899 --> 01:06:14,869
uh... xx stupid fathers like mutation
basic

1716
01:06:14,869 --> 01:06:17,539
but uh... vis a

1717
01:06:17,539 --> 01:06:18,439
approach

1718
01:06:18,439 --> 01:06:20,099
uh...

1719
01:06:20,099 --> 01:06:23,409
nice says that uh... it's just

1720
01:06:23,409 --> 01:06:25,069
full automation

1721
01:06:25,069 --> 01:06:26,529
you haven't

1722
01:06:26,529 --> 01:06:27,709
