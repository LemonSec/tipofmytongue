1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:06,630
the lot

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:10,260
stations in here with a cash tender with
a7 allocate a place welcome 'em

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,679
thanks guys just before we begin

4
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,830
I am thank you for coming to talk I was
the last one Iran's

5
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,289
once the guy and drinking pas de sac I
I'm

6
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:26,090
the should be and it's going to be a
limit my melting so I'm sorry maybe some

7
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,170
but so I just a quick shot hands-on
who's actually

8
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:33,120
done any kinda a memory me collection or
exportation on a platform

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,220
just just the right hands just okay cool

10
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:40,670
cat-scan who's done and I may be on the
heap any kind if he picks player

11
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:44,070
okay cool has actually fifty this
cochran

12
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,149
as gonna change thing I am side

13
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:51,680
originally had this talk is named guys
in the Windows seven al Qaeda but

14
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,760
because we're gonna be covering a
limiter but we know is I

15
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,960
exploitation or just that you know basic
stuff understanding how it's actually

16
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,329
working and I'm going to

17
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:04,629
arm you know abt the possibility or type
attack that could possibly work under me

18
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:05,070
knows I

19
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,899
I'm so I I titled it just goes in the
alligators that

20
00:01:08,899 --> 00:01:11,920
I am so start of week going

21
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,159
you know up what what we're gonna be
looking at so why targeting a manager

22
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:16,600
you know

23
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,790
will cover like you some advice he terms
that are used throughout the

24
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:20,610
presentation

25
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,320
arm some 1078 theory I

26
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,310
you know from the fun and a little bit
on the back in but not too much are the

27
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,689
elevator structures

28
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:33,330
and the algorithms associate with that
they will look at this for exportation

29
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,240
techniques have been done previously

30
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,340
are just I've only put a couple in their

31
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,409
are too because there were proven to be
the most reliable when I was in my

32
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:42,610
testing analysis

33
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:45,970
and looking at how the miners working
arm

34
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:49,360
then I'll continue on and I'll show you
when you attack another Windows 7 that

35
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,000
I managed to get working um that is more
less

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,409
a basis of arm of the free of reentry
over right technique so looking

37
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:02,049
looked more that I would've been a demo
then we'll cover you know I like

38
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:05,630
are the changes in 10 site and i'm
looking at possible ties to thank for

39
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:05,969
that

40
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:09,160
side oh my well arm

41
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,190
I'm a senior secured its all test rats
sick enter security research

42
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:17,660
and I also have been testing arm our own
past member a call and tame

43
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:22,220
side these guys rocks i hack should I
did we talk to these guys for

44
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,209
exportation stuff

45
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:27,770
arm you know I'm I'm not a software
developer and i'd a dying actually have

46
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:30,989
I'm a C-plus poss back rhetoric and
thats artist

47
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:34,470
contact quickly I site

48
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:38,349
why we talking a manager wall often

49
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:41,620
during the process a lot cycle you know
I i'm

50
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,489
development we see that a lot of Bailey
on memory corruption za

51
00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:49,700
you know I walked out stack-based buffer
overflows on a shot variables things

52
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,840
like that this

53
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,849
walked out early on in phnom

54
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:57,760
in the developed faces application rock
as versions increase

55
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,769
I you know we lose those kinda memnoch
russian-born abilities

56
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:05,030
I'm paid by employers are harder to find
than

57
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:08,860
and I'm just memory corruption in the
heap in general is a lot is the heart of

58
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,290
on

59
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:12,569
I am just because the dynamic way it's
running

60
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:16,269
and because at the time I have an
overwrought our time a triggering a

61
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:16,930
corruption

62
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:21,090
I you don't actually have the bug the
bug actually tree is there but I

63
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,409
is is happening there but the trigger as
often not right there

64
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:28,379
it's often during comp using a another
chunk another white light on in the

65
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:29,050
application

66
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:32,720
execution or what where free occurs or
what have you

67
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,840
or call us on our site I'm yeah I'm
really tired

68
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,340
fear like a loss of 8 knowledge in the
industry

69
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:44,349
song I guess that's why I took this this
possum exportation AP arm

70
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:49,090
you know and to got to help facilitate
your application their attacks right

71
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:49,580
because

72
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:53,299
not always can you do an application
that attack or you might you might help

73
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:54,959
leverage the heat manage %uh to

74
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,750
trigger I'm running I'm a specific
object used by the application of that I

75
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,129
think

76
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:03,500
so across many other guys made a pretty
cool cya

77
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,549
I thought I was it was interesting my
phone and I I am

78
00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:11,120
so some examples and applications into
that have been done in the past

79
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,480
arm with Papa working remote exploits I

80
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,159
you know you've got stuff has done by
hasty more here in night I'm pretty

81
00:04:18,159 --> 00:04:19,849
bored Institute Presentation Server

82
00:04:19,849 --> 00:04:22,900
exploit combat abuse a beside listing

83
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:27,000
XP and then you got more recently we've
seen yet to be set off from

84
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,669
I'm Chris fell sick I using his free
entry of satire I technique

85
00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:35,020
and then up yet is a multimedia library
exploit which is

86
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,100
application specific technique of on
incremental documenting

87
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,860
I are very type and I thanks cause a
call back

88
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,100
on a on a pair of so so

89
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,530
I mean I guess what are they all have in
common right I mean unite bike

90
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:53,940
their complex right sigh there's a lot
against us

91
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:58,090
in in a manager I as you'll see you know
I like

92
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,800
its it's a real challenge in is like
safe on linking now

93
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,949
obviously since XP Service Pack 3 so
much randomization the hay

94
00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:09,110
removal appointed is and you know it
including

95
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:12,610
feeling validation when I on the Insert
now from

96
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,870
I'm Brett Morse Britain was free with
your attacks

97
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:18,889
I unite back as a separated you know I

98
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:22,860
no more no more point is essentially an
end him so much and now and we know is I

99
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,940
this now randomization on the chunk
allocation

100
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:29,639
parasite arm so discover some

101
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,789
some he terms just quickly almost cover
like a block

102
00:05:32,789 --> 00:05:35,910
as essentially gonna be represented as I
pots arm

103
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:39,520
thats just how it's calculated memory
arm

104
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,699
you know a chunky a continuous book
covers parts I like

105
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:47,300
we talk about a chunk us you know and in
a size represented

106
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,509
by the number of blocks so if you go a
size up

107
00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:53,680
object for we're talking about 30 fights
here

108
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,800
are things like that sigh the
determinism

109
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,800
I am is the ability for it to continue
to influence

110
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,069
the peace process arm before all of her
corruption so

111
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:08,419
to be able to lay out a the Apes taking
a certain way

112
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:11,690
to trigger I the overflow and cause

113
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:15,169
on the right condition in the state of
the Apes I'm

114
00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:18,639
and I know I've been is just simply

115
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,860
holding I in the area memory that holds
a number of

116
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:25,669
chunks are the same size essentially
sigh its it's represented as

117
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:29,780
escora being I am it's all going to love
it

118
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,789
of theory I um

119
00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:36,520
or just look at like so like I said
before you know it

120
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,060
used by these beings a specific size its

121
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:44,289
the free chunks now have this this thing
in a seven like that the next offset

122
00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:48,400
that allows it to work at what I am with
an ex allocations going to come from so

123
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,180
as

124
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,669
the particular chunks allocated it
updates this

125
00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:55,500
another rally called the free entry
offset and Logan is more a little bit

126
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,259
light up

127
00:06:56,259 --> 00:06:59,560
because refers to the top attacks were
going to be doing

128
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,680
arm the each

129
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,599
I heap sub-segment com is

130
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:10,139
hi is has its own for its own been so
for example

131
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:13,310
I a user blocks and hip sub-segment is

132
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:17,110
a particular as his particular being and
that might get filled up in a new one is

133
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,099
created

134
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:21,139
com using their II Taylor

135
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:25,330
where Frank he bellowed from sin I'm

136
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:29,060
so united in this is a bus structure for
this

137
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:33,280
for this size heat chunk and I can also
use and diagrams a bit so it's all

138
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,470
confusing

139
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:37,780
arm you know an excuse to a get
activated

140
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:41,310
elevates very easily on the window 7
tape just by neck causing I think a

141
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,810
second allocations

142
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:46,160
and %ah you know and I'm point is like I
said before sigh

143
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,419
this is the back in the back end com I'm
gonna shave a diary because I just easy

144
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:51,530
to explain

145
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm but basically the colors he
represent the sizes

146
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,560
are so you can have like multiple chunks

147
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,810
I love the same size but the being on
the list the list him he up

148
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:07,319
on the points to the first chunk of the
sound of that particular size

149
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:10,800
arm it has a be linked value but the
feeling is not a point to like it used

150
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,400
to be in the old he brought

151
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,430
the the link is I actually counter the
counts and

152
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:19,120
I'm increments and decrements based on
the number allocations a phrase

153
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,750
and as soon as that reaches are I team

154
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:26,949
allocations or a seventeen allocations
if there has been a priority

155
00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:30,349
Ashraf rate then it will actually I'm

156
00:08:30,349 --> 00:08:34,400
creating a pocket and place that point
in their it'll be actually ahead bucket

157
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:39,610
plus one are all when it checks to see I
he fuckin actually system application

158
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:40,390
there

159
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:43,570
Sunday this destruction in the

160
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:46,779
you got the F lee which show obviously
points they had a chunkier

161
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:50,089
arm these chunks he-ro this is a single

162
00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:54,350
single lists night that so only all
tapes we looked at we saw

163
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:58,339
a free list like going across like this
with different incisors

164
00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:02,990
whereas now it's just a singly Nicolas
like this I wouldn't be linking if Link

165
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:06,160
and of course these are old elevated now
these feelings and thanks

166
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,200
so exploitation this is is not dead
obviously

167
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,880
arm so flattened if there's a size
greater than 1024

168
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,399
I write so you'd like be used to be like
free this 0

169
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:20,459
waiting inside the chunks nowadays its

170
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:24,620
in I the listing a-minus it's actually
the listing

171
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:28,230
bucket I -1 I believe and its

172
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:32,370
in the first box index which there are
two books indexes

173
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:35,450
if the skiff the second blocks index

174
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:39,870
when silent price there's one box index
by default

175
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,830
and if chunk serbian then I 1024

176
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:48,100
they'll be stored in in here and I'll be
stored in order of size

177
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:52,810
and it'll point to the first one arm and
if there's a second box index

178
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:56,459
then I it the chunks in a bigger than

179
00:09:56,459 --> 00:10:01,200
than 1024 will be stored in in the
second in this second

180
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,440
up boxing next in the list since has
been sober for

181
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,170
here but the details of this is not too
much important cuz we're looking at more

182
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:08,980
the finance I

183
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:12,500
anyway I just thought I'd cover for
clarity

184
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,440
arm though the actual front handle
effect a shape

185
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,079
starts off by having appointed to look
into shape from the actual he base

186
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:24,029
arm and then it it has a night another
data structure yeah

187
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:27,510
%uh call local local data

188
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:31,850
and then there's I'll think like a day
to signify which is actually a real

189
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:35,660
more management structures so special is
like is this is the head with a heavy

190
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:39,320
price it's more manager structures
within sight how to manage structure

191
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,540
which then isn'ta Natasha but what home
waiting to be focusing on

192
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:47,070
mainly is actually these is there such a
hearsay

193
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:50,440
arm you know that actually a quite

194
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,190
to this and it has like sub-segment

195
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:58,120
and it has use a box or use a day to
head up

196
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,290
om and this is actually where the chunks
are stored

197
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:04,459
I this occasion autumn's in

198
00:11:04,459 --> 00:11:07,480
in here and this a blocks I as well

199
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,589
and that work and that manages the
sub-segments for that particular

200
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:17,050
being arm and and is also free entry of
certain depth to calculate

201
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:20,540
hammy allocations have happened Andy
outlook fermentation

202
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:24,850
yes I I just cliches and his name is a
really important points a lookout for

203
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:25,640
this

204
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,589
this I hate entry via and Tom

205
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:33,630
and a free entry offset this is actually
used to to exploit the banja

206
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:37,470
from Chris felsic II

207
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:41,420
yep so this is what the actual chuckle
look like

208
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:45,279
I essentially it's got encoded

209
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,160
encoded by to the the verse top the
first 4 bytes from

210
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,240
and I believe and upon an allocation

211
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,709
the next offset his overridden because
it's no longer needed

212
00:11:55,709 --> 00:11:59,540
I'm it only needed when the truck is
actually free to point to where the next

213
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:03,500
Chinese to be allocated from this is
like predictable for us

214
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,790
as a from an exploitation funny this
allows us to some some degree of control

215
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:10,850
of where we know where the next
allocation come from

216
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:15,649
on site that's important point

217
00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:20,540
as an example we've got you know we we
try to allocate a sizer thought turn in

218
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,430
32 bytes

219
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:25,820
up a chunk and you know it like it will
look up in size one day

220
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,700
and then they'll look up you know the
the stigma him five for one day

221
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:34,079
and find it active sub-segment because
I've been can have multiple sub-segments

222
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,899
from from the elevator books I'm arm and
all

223
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:41,110
off on that use a blocks from that
sub-segment

224
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:44,250
and then once a fine sir that use a box
and thinking a look at the chunk from

225
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,740
nap till use a box

226
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,100
I you nice I I mean if if there's no
more

227
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,680
if there is no more sub-segments
available what is no more

228
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,050
%uh its if thats if the acting
sub-segments not set or

229
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:01,500
or need to create new one that will call
arm

230
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,579
you nightlife rag ppl Corp resign and
we're actually create any sub-segment

231
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:07,029
and use a box

232
00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:10,510
and then allow and then a I force
allocation from not

233
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:13,519
arm so I I

234
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,850
to

235
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:22,860
so it's pretty easy to mom to you
trigger the elec hedge

236
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,899
another Windows seven I'm Wii U we
pretty much know this week in discourse

237
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:30,829
I think seeking allocations

238
00:13:30,829 --> 00:13:34,589
and this summer I example car there very
simple

239
00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:38,300
arm the words to that

240
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,820
so this is essentially house working
you've got arm

241
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:45,120
you know the chunks be allocated you
gotta of reentry of sit-down

242
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,160
the other points to the first jump free
entry of that calculated by using the

243
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,230
next offset

244
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:54,250
or the offset to Dr chunk and it on them
by

245
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,940
and that will help point2 I and then if
you do it you know

246
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:02,269
use a blocks plus this value it all it
will actually call that that

247
00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:07,149
chunk there so arm you know and there's
a depth setting a great exchanges we saw

248
00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:09,029
before

249
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:13,420
upon allocation the %uh French upset
updated here

250
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:17,149
as you can see and that next offset was
he %ah is now written

251
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:21,240
yet on the way machine that point the
next chunk

252
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:26,440
so essentially just works by updating
like that

253
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,680
company with heavy affray of it will
work out with an ex of hepatitis

254
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:36,149
a ride into here antar and and reset the
free entry offset

255
00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:39,490
are and that but that's actually one
otherwise we're gone 3i

256
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:42,690
export in a bit later on so what will
look at that

257
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:47,860
exactly now gone to expectations either

258
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,949
um site you know I

259
00:14:50,949 --> 00:14:54,110
Benelux came up with a really really
good idea to you I'm trigger

260
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:59,560
of rain not true free and that will
allow you to free an object or structure

261
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,440
in memory

262
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,480
that could have a fun trip planning and
get called right

263
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,250
you know and doctors tell us a call to
come up with the idea that you couldn't

264
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,970
our cause opt reallocation and I

265
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:14,459
yeah allocate atop an object or I

266
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:19,220
Natasha cya when asked by artist I and
II of

267
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:22,940
work their way to work at the you can
cause I you know consecutive study

268
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,350
calculations as well

269
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:28,449
arm using are using abroad in different
ways to get into

270
00:15:28,449 --> 00:15:32,120
that particular hips tight sir om

271
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,139
yep say determinism ice cover a little
bit about this because it's pretty

272
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:37,310
important

273
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:40,660
but but basically the idea is um you
know

274
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:45,130
we want to have a predictable we have a
pretty to allocation fact we want

275
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:48,250
we want everyone I your diffracted keep
it so

276
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:52,250
you know upon week we encounter at
applications running in a while it's

277
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,519
gonna hit by the flood

278
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,000
but the problem is is he we can I take
pride we can weaken

279
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,949
allocate chunks to be able to the just
fill up the holes in the hay

280
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:06,149
make it I United to have deterministic
chunk allocations afterwards

281
00:16:06,149 --> 00:16:10,230
and Tom all week you know and we we need
more idea primitives to help us

282
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,060
expedition us just one but

283
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,800
when it a fraud even need like no need
for possibly nympho Lake a soft and

284
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,040
hardly

285
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,550
I of controlled sauce

286
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:23,990
that's too I'm you know different paper
I said just an

287
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:27,209
kopit rewrites possibly that could help
us a law

288
00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:31,190
a lot the ability to unite rigor free
when we need to interview how to set a

289
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,410
hole in the head

290
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:36,820
um maybe just before objective with
using it an application-specific

291
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:41,160
I'll I'm protecting application data and
inna

292
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,720
I you added the ability to trigger the
cash market really handy

293
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,040
referring exploiting the I look at a
party cash

294
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,660
cya you know it im really it really
takes someone to

295
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:57,199
work out what and the applications doing
it takes you to work at

296
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,730
him you know it at the river are you
gonna reverse engineer the allocation

297
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:01,079
pro

298
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:05,860
I process all the free process all that
kinda thing work at do you really

299
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,429
control the size or

300
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:10,819
do you really you know you my not
control the size are you my control just

301
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:12,750
a range of sizes you know from

302
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:17,370
02 20 bytes the market each job before
but then adds a hair on and then you

303
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,559
know you control that

304
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,839
I just a like it a twenty but range so
upset Mrs I

305
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:26,039
I am my you've really got to work out
what

306
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:29,620
what it is you actually control to be
able to to get that

307
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:33,809
and you know I boo gotta be outta
Crabtree objects somehow

308
00:17:33,809 --> 00:17:38,590
nowadays anyway I its it's very useful
to get to that

309
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,870
or and know that we're gonna have
function call backs on lies

310
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:45,809
objects this is really really hard on
this is the hardest part

311
00:17:45,809 --> 00:17:49,870
have any kind of exploitation apes I I
am you can get the technique working

312
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,280
perfectly against the

313
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,160
particular application but unless you
set up a propylene to begin with

314
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:59,970
then you are not going to get control of
of yapping which essentially what

315
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:03,660
site will cover on been Hawks technique
firsts

316
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:07,840
on this is a thriller incensed think
tank basically the idea is that

317
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,210
the chunky smocks a segment offset chunk
arm

318
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:16,160
we when would trigger an overflow arm we
override the head a structure is he up

319
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,600
and we particularly target these two
values here

320
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,919
arm Wiese be marketed as an offset and
then we set your offset to

321
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,380
I am another chunk that we won a free
ride so essentially the overflow works

322
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,280
like that

323
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,669
and we set the context tell you which
will be here

324
00:18:32,669 --> 00:18:35,679
and this has to be below three arm

325
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,530
I then this can be an option value here
the Sonata

326
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:43,390
and he said comin up a tree second
offset yes I

327
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:46,890
I've actually in this example his incise
fire which

328
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:50,780
I want to go to chunks backwards so I
just time's up by two

329
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:54,360
asset the 2nd of Sep yes I on that's
pretty much it

330
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,590
and then 05 always be the %ah

331
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:01,179
won't be there that milieu de I to mock

332
00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:05,100
it as a sign of the chunks so I am

333
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,350
yes our this is a really house working
right say

334
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:12,010
let's say the application we want to go
free chunk 3 I

335
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:16,260
from CR 123 an end there is an overflow

336
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,630
and its and the heat and has a targeted

337
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:23,929
right are and we send it to you know
this allocated object here

338
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:28,789
the segment offset here so in this
category 3 trucks back

339
00:19:28,789 --> 00:19:32,400
then what happens when the winner free
happens on this chunk

340
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,210
arm you actually actually realign the
chunk hit up

341
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,730
and previous one you know I essentially
we've got

342
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:43,460
situation where and andaba tree object
or structures free

343
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,640
and we can possibly call I i Function
Point of

344
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,910
on that all falsification execute a
fashion that say

345
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:55,740
I'm you know and then and then we
allocate blk to the top of that because

346
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:00,320
the way the I the lead fermentation head
is working as its first in first out

347
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,580
I published national early on but
basically as the allocation

348
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,919
what happens in allocation and then a
free happens like

349
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:10,059
ya in order in a las freest

350
00:20:10,059 --> 00:20:13,650
is updated from the free entry offset
site the allocated

351
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:17,100
this will be the next allocation point

352
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,200
I am you know I want the chance
allocated we can obviously I'd rather be

353
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,669
time on that kind of thing and

354
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:26,049
and and why prior about a function call
or something like that sigh

355
00:20:26,049 --> 00:20:29,880
om yes a this is basically this if
they're kinda kinda

356
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,950
very simple credit came up with a bit of
stick me so it you know it creates a new

357
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:34,630
badass

358
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:38,280
an object arm you know we

359
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,740
we allocate and then we we can cause
another location here

360
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:45,419
and this is the whole week I'm a flower
I'm going to target the sky

361
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:49,909
so we overflow the buffer and we hit our
target

362
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:53,020
okay and then its it's very simple we
just

363
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:56,510
we free in a target which is actually
gonna free

364
00:20:56,510 --> 00:21:00,340
that has been on checked then we
override bad ass bear

365
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:03,440
with this allocation here K

366
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,510
and then we feel that overrunning its be
table

367
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:10,320
and then we call function are I so
that's

368
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,440
I mean that sounds like a law right I

369
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,080
but often you know will be out a top we
won't have to create the object or if we

370
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,530
do we could see no objection memory or

371
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:22,970
make this all sorts of you know I i'm I
love this

372
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:27,610
yes from the from the applications point
of view so we we need to control maybe a

373
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:29,179
little bit if this

374
00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:33,360
this whole process but not not
completely over arm

375
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,840
tell me what's the French offset to pay
%uh

376
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,090
so you know I the idea here is that

377
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:44,820
we overflowing to anything and Jason
chum and we target the next offset

378
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:48,720
and that Jason Chalker be free right
that the idea that song is to be free

379
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,900
we talk at the next offset and then upon
allocation we are right the free entry

380
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,740
offset

381
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:57,400
and men we know that the next
allocations gonna come from

382
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,210
the use a block citrus plus the free
entry of Seth so we can set

383
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:06,809
an arbitrary location we get a ride you
know an object in College Park High

384
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:11,309
so it works like this you too and I
brightness said

385
00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:15,919
the next offset here and then when you
allocate this chunk

386
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,110
because as i chip up a check on the head
is of essentially year you have the

387
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:23,900
ability to set the free entry of setting
this value here

388
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:28,010
I which will calculate a lot and then we
know that

389
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:31,419
use a blocked plus this filly at is a
blockbuster Valley

390
00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:37,100
all have an option allocation so that
will activists some leverage control

391
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,490
about in the memory so

392
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:43,890
again on a show ya gonna run through a
little bit I ran so basically for

393
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:46,840
situation when you get a chance for you
going to al Qaeda from

394
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,960
s the next point of I you know and
there's an overall

395
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,659
on the the next offset annex offset
updated

396
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:58,080
when you allocate updated to the to the
free entry offset

397
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,440
to see a and then that's gonna point to
an object rancorous a different location

398
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:02,780
some

399
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:06,929
right the next allocation and so when ya
locate you allocate some other

400
00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:10,370
fake chunk or some other some other
random piece a memory

401
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:13,510
sack yet I

402
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:16,659
the prof concept so basically it's it's
very simple again

403
00:23:16,659 --> 00:23:20,260
are you see to mondex memory is what
retailer page

404
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:24,760
arm thank you for something to play with
I'll be allocate

405
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,559
a chunk then we we actual that up target
the next

406
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,659
free chunk in these blocks

407
00:23:31,659 --> 00:23:36,159
om then essentially we allocate to set
the franchise offset

408
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,990
its and then once we set the Braintree
offset we allocate again and this will

409
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,909
allocate over the top of

410
00:23:41,909 --> 00:23:45,150
a top of an object and then we just I
feel that

411
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:48,409
overriding the veto able and you know
force

412
00:23:48,409 --> 00:23:53,370
they are the virtual function call on a
sack

413
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:56,549
siphoned my little quicker the better
money on our side is

414
00:23:56,549 --> 00:24:01,130
slot car so I so my tech came up with
when I was looking at all this send

415
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:04,159
I United the Ontario not came up with
was

416
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,470
hang on a second so if the if the French
we offset

417
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:12,400
I you know he's update from the next
offset then we don't have the ability to

418
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,210
set

419
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:16,450
the next offset I'm to match that free
entry offset

420
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:20,200
really I'm action playing with the
double free when this came about so

421
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,529
that's how I sorta

422
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:25,820
came across the idea of this com so just
go through a

423
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:29,080
basically the couple ways to obtain
estate you can attended from a double

424
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:29,720
free but

425
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,309
the double free has to during one of the
second free

426
00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:36,480
armpit the child care is mock as a busy

427
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,539
as busy Chisa free chunk and needs to be
remarks

428
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:43,200
here in her busy chunk or I in East

429
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,100
and in with three a cya I'm x3 off-site

430
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:50,100
I or you can trigger a buyout um

431
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:53,360
you know of free and then and then use
been Hawks technique to free and copper

432
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,510
tree trunk

433
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:58,059
om and could probably try free that sign
shop again

434
00:24:58,059 --> 00:25:01,210
or you could just very easily I write
the next neck

435
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:04,770
I entry of center this to say hi thing
as chris Christie

436
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:09,070
so essentially you you have you know
what the free entry of citizen use a box

437
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:09,630
right

438
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:14,169
at the time were generally speaking it
am it hard tonight

439
00:25:14,169 --> 00:25:17,779
I and then you you know if

440
00:25:17,779 --> 00:25:22,760
upon upon that you pretty much said PR
the calculated next offset

441
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:27,080
hiya and this you know it very much like
the free entry of said divided by that

442
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,590
that value will give you

443
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:31,740
you know the same value what the next
top cities I

444
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:35,850
the same yet the same token value French
upsets I

445
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:39,220
yen those values will be matching and
then what happens is

446
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:42,260
when you cause an Excel occasion or just
update

447
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:46,360
the free entry offset to the same value
arm

448
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:50,020
but the thing is the depth is still 29
Ryan's case I

449
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:53,850
whenever you cause the allocations gonna
keep returning the same address

450
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:58,200
arm a quick sprint this say you doing
dude I've arrived

451
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:02,320
in this case and he said it to be
matching the franchise offset

452
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,820
and then wary you to an allocation you
can force the allocated to

453
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:10,809
keep returning the same address because
this free entry offset

454
00:26:10,809 --> 00:26:15,770
is updated same value are again

455
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:18,860
arm here favor

456
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:22,409
how but the thing is when he triggering
a by the Doubletree

457
00:26:22,409 --> 00:26:26,179
I you but situation where there's a
there's a test

458
00:26:26,179 --> 00:26:29,880
to see if the chunk is marked already is
free

459
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,850
so you have to if you you need some sort
of primitive we can control that

460
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:37,950
that bought all that orbit value from a
bot and to be able to make sure we can

461
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:38,679
and

462
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:43,240
with of three have correctly between the
double free

463
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,630
I so my simple example which is

464
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:50,750
I'm just using the double free I could
have done it by the ear diver fly but

465
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:56,010
I justice Frank an example I just 22
locations and a half

466
00:26:56,010 --> 00:27:00,020
and you free in the second one and then
we do that you know not a likely over at

467
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:03,020
right we modify that one by and headed
there

468
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:06,929
I'm so can be ended and then we treat
the second free

469
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:11,240
then that actually places that a major
into that state now

470
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,450
now every time because allocations gonna
return the same address

471
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:17,840
%uh this allocation up he will return
the same address is this allocation

472
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,470
structure here

473
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:23,750
I'll so these two will get allocated the
same address

474
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:27,260
the function points can be initialized
we ever write that function pointer

475
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:30,809
and trigger chair call that's actually
how X

476
00:27:30,809 --> 00:27:34,640
I'm heads its works pretty well

477
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,260
hum so all just a little bit dimmer

478
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:42,250
I might be a bit easier

479
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:45,320
stupid style

480
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:49,039
its I how well we're gonna gotta see
this

481
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:55,309
okay salty that are

482
00:27:55,309 --> 00:27:58,700
I just find it but it's a psychotic
break points and show you how

483
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:02,429
actually it's working make sure perot

484
00:28:02,429 --> 00:28:06,690
and say on

485
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:10,940
so I just touch the baby cuz I've been
up process for the debugger

486
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:14,960
added by a pond say I just you know

487
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,049
accept that to let up dodge

488
00:28:18,049 --> 00:28:24,000
say one sec

489
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,080
each

490
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,399
okay so the first break point said on on
the free

491
00:28:31,399 --> 00:28:35,480
I'll you know the second I point on the
second free

492
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,250
and you see here this is

493
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:42,390
and I quickly modify something here but
up they are a piece of

494
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:45,940
this on the live a card to modify that
had a billion that offset

495
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:49,789
pa 7 to see a I

496
00:28:49,789 --> 00:28:54,480
so we'll see when we go to cause a
location arrive you can say but this is

497
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,740
outside the premises this is the actual
chapter be free

498
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,909
this valuation me modified

499
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:06,309
and from the phrase modified and it will
get

500
00:29:06,309 --> 00:29:09,890
modified back to us through the same
value or similar value that can be added

501
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:11,399
be 3f

502
00:29:11,399 --> 00:29:16,210
the second breakers which is past on the
check

503
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:19,399
now every time you allocate it's gonna
look at the same address

504
00:29:19,399 --> 00:29:24,020
from this point forward state sorry
earning credits a

505
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:29,470
I you know we can see this is the
allocated address here

506
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:34,360
for this choc

507
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:38,169
%eh officer

508
00:29:38,169 --> 00:29:41,700
celebrate by Agnelli allocation say can
say

509
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:45,169
the

510
00:29:45,169 --> 00:29:48,190
the result oMG and

511
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:52,159
you can see the second interest areas
allocated at the second

512
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:56,409
locations good honest the address is the
same I just put his comments saying

513
00:29:56,409 --> 00:30:00,080
on a see any betta ha

514
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,779
arm and this business the chunkier so
we're just watching this chunk very

515
00:30:04,779 --> 00:30:06,090
closely here

516
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:09,700
arm

517
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:13,049
so now this point we're going to slice
the function pointer

518
00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:20,049
I

519
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:24,860
so I the punch by step arm

520
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:28,880
another pointer doc text code

521
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:35,880
IOM

522
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:39,909
and then we let the application Ron then
it's gonna it's gonna

523
00:30:39,909 --> 00:30:43,249
over right you know I that that don't
require their

524
00:30:43,249 --> 00:30:46,479
and then if the functions called or
arbitrage called

525
00:30:46,479 --> 00:30:49,529
can control the execution process i on

526
00:30:49,529 --> 00:30:56,529
that's actually how it works

527
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:03,000
so

528
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,020
I guess one of the main advantages of
this is the fact that

529
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:09,760
arm you don't really need to set up a
hole in the head too if you want to talk

530
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,050
application data you have to set up a
whole heap before

531
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:16,100
object in memory to be able to then
allocate that

532
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:19,490
that chunk and i've a ride an object I
am

533
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:24,010
pushing forward the generally speaking a
for talking applications efficient I dot

534
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:25,000
it will be

535
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,820
Liki Liki Liki to you feel heap and Tom

536
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,830
out so we get some sort of determinism

537
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:35,860
and then you allocate an object
afterwards and wheat-free a jumper for

538
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:38,080
the object and we allocate into that
spot

539
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,360
we overwrought the object but I'm

540
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,930
you don't have to you have to set up the
holes I am

541
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:48,280
but you still need to have the ability
to reallocate not to object

542
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:52,600
and you still need to know at runtime
what the train tree of say is sorry

543
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,910
there is some limitations

544
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:58,920
and unless you doing you 'cause an
absolute large number allocations and

545
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:02,740
taken really work out with the French of
that will be on time then I'm gonna be a

546
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,430
living doing

547
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:07,830
but thats essentially summer the
limitations of it you have to know that

548
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,810
the object you gonna force allocation on

549
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:14,150
I yet Sunday yet the unit forced the
right on

550
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:17,330
has to have a virtual function call on a
I'm or some sort of

551
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:20,940
fun to call anyway you are trying a fun
trip on a somewhat

552
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:24,130
arm you know and then like I got like

553
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:28,970
yes I hi as well as I'm doing all this
and i'm looking at them this technique

554
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:29,220
and

555
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:35,260
when as I came along and I was like arm
hand okay haha so

556
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:38,480
um you know and by the time I actually
got to the winners I

557
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,660
I you know I can only really focus on
the Consumer Preview

558
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:48,170
version I didn't get developer Developer
Preview but likely for me that that was

559
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:52,110
I was a good thing because it until a
change a little bit saw

560
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:55,430
I looked at the eye the allocation lol
I'll

561
00:32:55,430 --> 00:33:00,230
allocations a phrase just briefly sigh
but I notice a change is the first

562
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,740
change the notice was the

563
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:06,010
these blocks update such a law was
changed

564
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:09,770
Qwest ticket link: alone members were
added are things like the first

565
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:10,730
allocation offset

566
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:14,060
box tried to kidnap be maintained as um

567
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:17,210
this is this is quite new and in this
this this

568
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:20,660
data structure here which as a pointer
to his big not dead here

569
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:24,700
and I'm as a call that's quite
interesting and you know if this is God

570
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,470
page here

571
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:30,460
was added and I I guess is prevent any
kinda modification have these blocks

572
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:34,220
arm yesterday

573
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:37,670
it's still treating on on I 18
allocations all

574
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:42,040
pics call um you know there's there's no
more this next offset of Raintree

575
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:42,960
offsets a

576
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,610
stock in just over four it's now dead
like to get it

577
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:49,690
side or um

578
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:53,420
you know it's it's now really randomized
right it's theirs alone and determinism

579
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,050
in the ape

580
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:57,310
chunks are allocated all over the place
we like to know what's going on

581
00:33:57,310 --> 00:34:00,980
arm there's a got paid on the user
blocks

582
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:05,660
and Tom United is this this is back
before which we have no idea what put

583
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:08,480
how that Skype later what does or
anything like that so

584
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,570
om but let's have a look at like how the
locations working crack

585
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:15,960
let's go through this so what we have a
look we can see that

586
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,270
there is first of all it looks up a
index value

587
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:22,730
arm and its index value is with the from
the heat rent

588
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:27,580
him Tesla ants the index value is then
used to look up

589
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:32,010
random date our random reading by up
from the heat ran into

590
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:35,070
alright om months that a one

591
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:38,280
studies obtained then I

592
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:42,220
unite the indexes incremented and in
Britain back

593
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:46,130
into the Tesla we continue along

594
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:49,770
and what actually happens here is that

595
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:54,200
on this comparison on the size the
bitmap to see if it sa small

596
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:59,680
32 so om you know if we've got some
chunks available we can allocate from

597
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,880
at this point forward I

598
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,930
then what happens is that calculates
this bitmap index

599
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:10,000
I call that I'm basically is the size
pic map

600
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,300
times that Rep random value that it
retrieved on your right

601
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:17,960
are then divided up by one thing I gives
you his pic map index

602
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,450
and then once it's got that the map
index is actually

603
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:27,050
I updates is a bitmap and at de tus

604
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:30,720
and enough I can exclude that it was
quite a complex

605
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,950
process Esprit randomized and its

606
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:37,910
you know it we don't really need it we
need to know the actual mechanics

607
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:41,270
that just yet so um

608
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:44,390
then once that happened the job offset
dip

609
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:48,030
he's updated accordingly third episodic
documented

610
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:53,110
arnelle cation like it is and %ah and
rewritten into a new data structure

611
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:57,420
and then this is where it gets like a
little bit more interesting

612
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:01,030
right this is where we say like missus
gonna be where the next

613
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:05,520
chunks can be coming from army traits
it's it's it's like the blocks tried

614
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,050
times

615
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:10,040
you know the the bitmap data which we
saw get updated

616
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,860
I and they need adds the first
allocation offset

617
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:18,490
and then at that point you as the user
Box address

618
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:22,750
I say that calculation again

619
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:27,370
it works like this okay so this is kind
of important

620
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:30,820
this is this is how we can work out
where com

621
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:34,480
want more miss the point when you go out
what do I control

622
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,760
way we cry controlled by targeting I
can't control any of this so

623
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,820
whatsoever so

624
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:45,960
just copy the cover the fracas that
missus is so important to say

625
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:50,510
it still does still does this kind of
thing it does and Bell lights the yom

626
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:55,590
Delpech block on the free oMG works out
calculates the sub-segment from a free

627
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:59,490
and if the sub-segments couldn't be
create cochran be calculated

628
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:04,050
or if the Cal of the calculated value
this match is the actual sub-segment

629
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:08,010
then Hill a route or cause America
option

630
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:11,850
arm from that point forward sorry that's
that's pretty important

631
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:17,030
arm safer overriding unite free chunks

632
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:20,570
us are allocated chunks at as a free
occurs then

633
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:23,720
that's gonna cause a salon here problem

634
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:28,390
on you know and and nothing to you like
the up in Hawke's technique is now

635
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:32,110
has now gone right say the fact that we
can I have a ride and allocate a chunk

636
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,020
and free it

637
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:36,460
for free to adopt relocation what's
going to happen is that the second chunk

638
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,310
that it goes to

639
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:40,480
goes to France in the first one that
will actually be checked to see if

640
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,370
that's also segment of the chunk

641
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:47,700
if it's not then we got you know it's
like a a soccer net free public

642
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:52,030
um but now we'll have a look in like
possible exploitation I mean is I

643
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:55,940
as a possible because it's not armpit
still very hard to get

644
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,080
how percent reliability or at least some
some

645
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:03,270
level of reliability that I would call
fair com

646
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:06,830
map when he is so original when I was
like play around with

647
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:10,390
this scheme manager I was having located
like

648
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:14,300
bob what members i cant wrong with me so
we can Skype we control a couple members

649
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,090
that we could

650
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:19,050
could possibly talk about himself use a
blocks and I was like looking for like

651
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:22,700
LED way I have a ride because I knew I
can control the next

652
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,870
up with overflow chunk would be i I I
knew that was

653
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:29,610
that was park in an hour Scott well
maybe we can just start using

654
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:33,290
titanate manager for like deep sandy
wood writes all

655
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:37,180
all couple bought rights the whole just
get us the right leverage we can use to

656
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:37,610
get

657
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:41,400
an option allocation or something but
then like you know a Chris

658
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,950
present in Psych and I was really good
and actually headed no idea it was

659
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:45,480
really good

660
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:49,280
and to you possibly writing is a block
set-up

661
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,000
arm sir let's holler explore that

662
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,740
so the basic the idea was that if you
could override the user blocks

663
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:01,270
head of then you walk out on it some
others members and cause an optional

664
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:02,350
cash

665
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:05,370
I'll you know its

666
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:08,810
week we don't we don't determine whether
chunks are memory we it's it's it's

667
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:10,350
completely randomized

668
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:13,950
I'm but and we generally if we haven't

669
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:17,020
the ability to new job I'm leaking
application

670
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:20,650
to force allocations that kinda thing a
particular been size

671
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:24,480
then week or essentially doing more than
just like

672
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,510
18 allocations atria allocate right we
could probably too

673
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:30,880
affair fair number site

674
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,050
having having understanding that we can
have a look at

675
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:37,300
differences between Windows 8 Windows
seven on allocation

676
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:41,000
we see that as we go through her an
allocation is completely randomized

677
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
winners I

678
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,780
whereas pre sequential Minnesota

679
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:50,390
I'm sorry but not down here that the
uninitialized he's a box

680
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:54,609
so this is not punish loss at all until
we reach this area

681
00:39:54,609 --> 00:39:57,840
so as we go through her it arm

682
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:01,100
you know we we caught the allocations
took a and pain

683
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:07,279
me I use a box is created and then the a
track is taken from the user blocks

684
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,530
for what happens is you we could pop
what will happen if we could possibly

685
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:11,320
targeted

686
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,920
use a chunk 2004 targeted use a box yeah

687
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,950
might have a little bit over finishing

688
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:21,520
but the fundamental problem with with
getting this technique reliable

689
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:25,210
yes we don't know the distance between
the chunk that's going 0 for the user

690
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:26,280
blocks

691
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,450
because we don't know the order in which
the seller has to happen

692
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:32,840
so this essentially week we cannot just

693
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:36,750
I've for just enough to hit the user
blocks we have tile floor

694
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:40,010
essentially the whole went to stay here

695
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:44,570
just in case the last chunk allocated at
this year's a box from here

696
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:48,340
so that way we dine we we guarantee to
hit the user blocks

697
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:52,030
sequentially are

698
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:56,650
honey site this is the elevator block
sinuses where

699
00:40:56,650 --> 00:41:00,460
the user blocks n and things like that
are stored in using containers something

700
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,310
and say hiya

701
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:06,560
other 31st is a box is he a which is
almost guaranteed to be filled up an

702
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,910
application

703
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:11,890
arm and you've got multiple use a box of
that

704
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:15,350
and the thing that we notice is that
dollars is actually stored

705
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:19,260
sequentially it woulda and we know when
we can then possibly target dies so the

706
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:22,930
idea is that we don't really want to
damage this area here in memory

707
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:26,940
we actually wanna target these a box
directly so we to a from you two blocks

708
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:27,380
1

709
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:31,830
on target in the box to right just like
that

710
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:35,700
but not how does not got at this point
yes I when I was doing the test cases

711
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:36,720
those running

712
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,800
I'm no against Upton to produce a block
sees a book ebook still my got up to

713
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,840
this point here

714
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:45,990
I'm possibly later on they'll be God
said and checked

715
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:49,510
but I haven't attending I worked out
where than when the guys actually

716
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:50,420
triggered on

717
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:55,290
but our in a test case I was doing there
was nine got on the uneasy is a box here

718
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:58,980
so this is how it actually looks like in
memory and I know it's all in how the

719
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:01,240
same basically this hearing elevate

720
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:05,950
local site hit up %uh this is the use a
block point to add to the sub-segments

721
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:09,050
the the three different sub-segments

722
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:14,120
on and this is the high def the we saw
before someone to track is allocated

723
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:17,910
step stick documented want to talk is
free to come into

724
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:21,440
site I'll the

725
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,140
so you know we know that the chunks
Amman

726
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:29,810
I not deterministic but we now know that
the sub-segments or use a box as well

727
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:33,630
are also did are actually deterministic
and that can provide us with a

728
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:35,550
Louisville leveraged into

729
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:38,730
expectations on other I'm

730
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:42,240
sigh you know as a perk as a as a little
bit example it's it's a little bit

731
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,870
obvious is unrealistic

732
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:47,630
calm but you know week we can train your
not allocations to fill

733
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:50,740
foresees a blocks week or and

734
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:54,510
out cause more allocations to hit the
use a box to a

735
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:58,960
be so before and then one other 1 on the
charts from the use a box 1

736
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,430
we can use to target these a box to
right and then upon the allocation after

737
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:04,390
that

738
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:09,060
I'm we can trigger and now it really
cation show you how it works

739
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:12,750
essentially what we want to target the
first allocation offset because we know

740
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:15,500
that that's where the next chance gonna
be a look at properties can be used to

741
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,770
calculate when the next chance in hell

742
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:21,720
other books on bitmap we need to set
eyes to appropriate values or at least

743
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,609
control is going to somehow

744
00:43:23,609 --> 00:43:27,630
I and set them to name what had whatever
to make sure we get that out

745
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:28,930
reallocation

746
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:32,460
um but the thing is that I noticed when
I was doing the testing is that this

747
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:35,910
is a bitmap point %ah though the pointer
for that

748
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:39,690
I'm has to be brought along a slick to
needs to be updated get map

749
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:43,820
and also needs to I wall in my test case
now was

750
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:47,000
proven to work really well because when
you times

751
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,270
you know I obviously easier with the box
tried use nothing sigh

752
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:53,930
we can makin just controlled object
reallocation

753
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:57,940
based on the %uh the first allocation of
said which just makes it easier

754
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:01,740
but when mild when testing but
essentially you could set this to

755
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:06,380
appointed to a I value that you can
control as long as a study

756
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:09,840
and it's rideable should be should be
fine sir

757
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:15,050
sequentially the other flow exodus down
once I use a box heather is here

758
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:18,540
and the most important members that we
want to talk to are here

759
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:23,870
in-memory so effect this one here is
actually not important at all really

760
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:28,890
arm this just as pointed to what just as
pointer is most important

761
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:32,590
sorry the thing is the problem that we
fundamentally have with this

762
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:37,430
is that this he are required to some
minimum of 12 pots

763
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:42,100
now when we saw the the either fly from
the tip from a chunk that was overflying

764
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:46,530
to the user blocks from up here although
i don't. the user blocks had a

765
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:50,410
we don't know the distance right and so
if we haven't bought number

766
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:54,060
chunks in between that distance then

767
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:57,200
you know we might hit did keep the
members correctly from a sequential

768
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:57,900
employer

769
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:01,710
but we have an even number chunks we
might not it all depends on the

770
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:04,890
been size we're talking so

771
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:08,350
we don't know a runtime where the chunks
gonna be

772
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:11,400
the Last Dance Company at the time can
be allocated from

773
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,940
so we don't know the distance runner I'm

774
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:19,160
sire essentially you could like I said
you can set this to any value

775
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:22,310
I naked I

776
00:45:22,310 --> 00:45:25,430
said the pointer to to now or any value

777
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:30,190
I'm as long as tribal and we should be
on track

778
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:33,510
than that's essentially that the members
week we control at the

779
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:36,620
the calculation sir on

780
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:39,620
yeah I won't go thru loved our

781
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:45,560
why not with

782
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:50,260
I the stars above

783
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:52,640
on a that's okay cool

784
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:57,900
sir um yes a simple kinda thing we have
not kept cations think about a second

785
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:01,089
see the break what's being said things
like that um

786
00:46:01,089 --> 00:46:08,089
you know watch the baby

787
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:22,630
and upper consecrated everything in here
will be released next week aside Selina

788
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:26,860
make today's era so when we run the
application we can say that

789
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:30,240
you know if you love you two blocks here
we filled up this one here

790
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:34,210
and we're using this chunky %ah to
target visa blocks

791
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:37,770
om you know and we can actually override
number

792
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:41,230
chunks already been allocated and that's
why all signed before the peacock

793
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:41,930
control

794
00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:46,480
praying if wanna listen to free or in
some strike right ran some problems

795
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,260
so he's the overflow this occurred %uh
the user blocks

796
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:54,490
as you see this quickly overflowing I
know that distance we are now far

797
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:59,000
eyes can overflow and we have to make
sure that these members said

798
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,700
at the offsets correctly on so I watched

799
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:06,780
have a look here so this is the ER

800
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:09,990
this is the chunk that we the Wii up its

801
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:14,320
the subject and this is the arbitrage
its dobbs allocation are the top

802
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:18,210
night how yeps 0.22 Texans I saw before

803
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:21,820
but not how it's not a ring on the head
I siren just beforehand

804
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:26,170
that's so it can be and English three-f_
now because the allocation retain out

805
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:26,690
checks

806
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:30,750
to see if it's if it's a busy chunk
already on of om

807
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:33,940
upon allocation so as you can see I have
arrived function pointer

808
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:39,070
perfectly no problem an en banc and so
can control the execution if the punch

809
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:39,940
points called

810
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:43,100
cya om yeah thats

811
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:48,609
thank you

812
00:47:48,609 --> 00:47:52,849
how site you know I like I said the
major drawbacks is we got weed I know

813
00:47:52,849 --> 00:47:53,769
that distance

814
00:47:53,769 --> 00:47:57,289
fundamentally by having said that I

815
00:47:57,289 --> 00:48:01,439
with there's a way to get around that
possibly to I

816
00:48:01,439 --> 00:48:04,939
the major banja this technique ride is
the fact that we don't really made

817
00:48:04,939 --> 00:48:06,489
anything for leaks

818
00:48:06,489 --> 00:48:10,719
I'm oil address leaks or anything like
that we yes still

819
00:48:10,719 --> 00:48:14,309
all the randomization the winners I
people we can still use a a simple or

820
00:48:14,309 --> 00:48:15,709
straight acquittal overflow

821
00:48:15,709 --> 00:48:20,160
and still gain somewhat reliable I abt
reallocation objecting

822
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,799
accreditation so it just goes to show
that still

823
00:48:23,799 --> 00:48:27,459
even though all the pictures exists oMG
they're still possibilities for

824
00:48:27,459 --> 00:48:28,099
exportation

825
00:48:28,099 --> 00:48:34,259
arm you you will most likely like I said
before you must like the override

826
00:48:34,259 --> 00:48:35,319
allocated chunks

827
00:48:35,319 --> 00:48:38,390
and in doing so you you make sure those
copy free

828
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:44,869
com say yet what is in the reliability
is a major problem sorry

829
00:48:44,869 --> 00:48:48,900
depending on the use a plot the bean
sauce um

830
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:52,670
more depending on whether we need an
even number chunks between

831
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:56,619
the flyover fine chunk in the user
blocks or whether we need a and on

832
00:48:56,619 --> 00:49:01,059
on number or not arm because you know it
has to be divisible by 16 eventually

833
00:49:01,059 --> 00:49:03,189
right has been divisible by 16 bytes

834
00:49:03,189 --> 00:49:07,499
or yes exam by speakers the user blocks
hair like I said

835
00:49:07,499 --> 00:49:11,759
needs the three members for just tall
bites but then years and four to make

836
00:49:11,759 --> 00:49:15,519
even between yeah between I arm

837
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:18,759
so unite I was thinking about this

838
00:49:18,759 --> 00:49:22,999
like what the problem with being has to
be be divisible by 16

839
00:49:22,999 --> 00:49:26,380
am but looking at his really closely arm

840
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:30,969
you could actually possibly I make it
much more level by a

841
00:49:30,969 --> 00:49:34,880
having the fact that you could I in the
overwrought cover-up with an iPod fake

842
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,429
structure of the user blocks

843
00:49:36,429 --> 00:49:40,130
and just a question if I just I thought
tonight you can using 16 bytes

844
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:43,640
and you can possibly do that by having
the %ah

845
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:46,630
because the fact that the first
allocation of said and the box right

846
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:47,959
next to each other

847
00:49:47,959 --> 00:49:52,499
in in memory com you could actually have
those two values to get off

848
00:49:52,499 --> 00:49:56,160
that would hopefully also be a point of
to an

849
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,660
I study compelling that he's brought a
whole so if you could

850
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:04,569
Phil all this I that's possible the job
requirements as I

851
00:50:04,569 --> 00:50:08,179
then you could make this a lot more
reliable I'll

852
00:50:08,179 --> 00:50:11,529
substantially less that how X

853
00:50:11,529 --> 00:50:14,859
so I guess the conclusion that this his

854
00:50:14,859 --> 00:50:19,069
you not like I said before you know it's
despite all the randomization

855
00:50:19,069 --> 00:50:22,809
protections in now we know that hey 4 or
in the mail here itself

856
00:50:22,809 --> 00:50:26,729
are extortion fear possible exportation
of these

857
00:50:26,729 --> 00:50:30,079
office involving he manages I'll

858
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:34,130
yeah I i this there's still a long way
to go

859
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:37,539
applications that we want to retire
ghetto as

860
00:50:37,539 --> 00:50:40,589
as people bill Haber exploits still

861
00:50:40,589 --> 00:50:44,079
today for under under the southern
environments

862
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:47,999
I way and hopefully see more I metadata
attacks or

863
00:50:47,999 --> 00:50:52,170
Yuval I application-specific minute
attacks like this

864
00:50:52,170 --> 00:50:55,709
evolve that can be used and leverage a
lot better

865
00:50:55,709 --> 00:50:59,029
arm I guess the Wii has a day hey man
just say

866
00:50:59,029 --> 00:51:04,130
I'm pressing on and even even now i'm
having a look at a few other areas near

867
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:07,309
in the eye in the day and data
structures bit higher up

868
00:51:07,309 --> 00:51:10,619
they could possibly use to be leveraged
for accreditation

869
00:51:10,619 --> 00:51:15,099
om no around like they elevate clock
sign things like that sigh

870
00:51:15,099 --> 00:51:19,749
om you know I just like to say thanks if
a few friends and people like

871
00:51:19,749 --> 00:51:24,199
especially the heat guys have done a lot
of worker a pass on here expectation

872
00:51:24,199 --> 00:51:27,289
I'd say it's helping a long way and
learning a lot of the stuff from

873
00:51:27,289 --> 00:51:31,400
you know I I hope the people continued
on and and and focusing on

874
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:36,729
and some friends yeah some guys from a
better security and call and corn cutter

875
00:51:36,729 --> 00:51:37,079
and

876
00:51:37,079 --> 00:51:40,079
Syneron those guys and my fiance Vanessa

877
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:43,859
site X up some references and our

878
00:51:43,859 --> 00:51:47,289
hopefully we have some tough questions
I'm sorry cosby

879
00:51:47,289 --> 00:51:50,429
fast for we gotta

880
00:51:50,429 --> 00:51:53,869
financial questions there are any
questions or any questions here

881
00:51:53,869 --> 00:51:56,949
ice-t_

882
00:51:56,949 --> 00:52:01,079
it off how realistic do you think it's
going to be that Microsoft would

883
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:01,670
implement

884
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:05,779
like cookies for he keep tops basically

885
00:52:05,779 --> 00:52:09,509
sorry for saying it how how realistic is
it to you

886
00:52:09,509 --> 00:52:12,929
a to think that microsoft word
implements

887
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:16,509
keep Chuck cookies like placing cookies
before

888
00:52:16,509 --> 00:52:20,299
he chops to avoid that if you start to
you

889
00:52:20,299 --> 00:52:23,299
ok right now medidata day or

890
00:52:23,299 --> 00:52:26,459
check to cook NC okay it's corrupt but
I'm going to give up

891
00:52:26,459 --> 00:52:31,390
I'll it mites you know operate overhead
and make

892
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:35,209
get our application sewer but ass
computers come faster than

893
00:52:35,209 --> 00:52:39,509
yep so a lot other love the head is
already protected already so that's

894
00:52:39,509 --> 00:52:43,209
now it's hitting our the getting current
decoded

895
00:52:43,209 --> 00:52:47,029
and we saw the first 4 bytes a of the
child care is already protect a lot

896
00:52:47,029 --> 00:52:51,859
and those other values there are not
used in a while we can't I leverage as

897
00:52:51,859 --> 00:52:53,309
much as we used to anymore

898
00:52:53,309 --> 00:52:57,749
as now with back in the old he plans to
target things like the size right

899
00:52:57,749 --> 00:53:00,759
and that was that was easily leverage
because we can't unite

900
00:53:00,759 --> 00:53:04,160
after the pit you know a big nap or
something like that side

901
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:08,319
I but now but now I think that a better
thing might be

902
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:11,779
would be maybe possibly other a friend
in March the location where the user

903
00:53:11,779 --> 00:53:13,089
blocks of

904
00:53:13,089 --> 00:53:16,170
it if that doesn't perform I'm no
implement too much

905
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:19,209
comments all are backs I

906
00:53:19,209 --> 00:53:21,650
all possibly you could I

907
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:26,250
I your come up with the fact that you
know you can just sit there God page on

908
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:29,220
on the user blocks a lot early on in the
state or through the whole

909
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:33,640
for the whole thing song I guess that I
sent it on to a certain point because it

910
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:34,630
it might be some sort of

911
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:38,599
overhead and I'll it no pathological
cations causing a lot of allocations

912
00:53:38,599 --> 00:53:41,640
things like that its gonna fill opposes
a box or a sigh

913
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:45,160
I guess that's why they died do that but

914
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:48,609
I mean if you can just tool for the
whole all these a box then

915
00:53:48,609 --> 00:53:52,130
I guess that would bring really prevent
the exportation is kinda think so

916
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:56,569
hope that answers your question any more
questions

917
00:53:56,569 --> 00:54:00,369
I'm well

918
00:54:00,369 --> 00:54:01,130
to text in them
