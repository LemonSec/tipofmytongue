1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,710
the

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:09,710
me

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,470
the title over next talk is browser bug
hunting in 2012

4
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,750
please give a warm welcome to Roberto
Tsuji

5
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:26,750
leave it on thanks everyone thanks for
coming to stall

6
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,829
ano yes must meet I 4 p.m.

7
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:34,250
I'll try to be as much as entertaining

8
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:38,370
it's possible must be introduced many
mismatches G Ronnie

9
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,660
and the research to talk him into the
gonna do today

10
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,880
have has been done with Scott Bell it's
Michael E

11
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,310
unfortunate gonna make it so I'll try my
best to do

12
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:55,270
um the part of his position as well so
when we come

13
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:59,270
we both work for secure this has not
come it's on security company now

14
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:02,880
based museum we do also have office in
Singapore

15
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,960
and we both our principal security
consultant

16
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,040
I'm I have a blog so sometimes

17
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,060
time to time publish my search unblock
manage not that

18
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,550
and yes so what's the agenda for today

19
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:20,030
I'm the person tissue structures be
simple it's basically

20
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:24,110
three different points on his
introduction and then

21
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,280
are doing the shopping and conclusion

22
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,400
also all good so that action soon but
the

23
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,450
the main core the presentation is the
window shopping is like

24
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,159
going through all the bikes that we
found as part of his research

25
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:41,120
and it's kind of shopping experience
like we've built which by Vince like

26
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,060
going for shopping it's like it when the
shop and which bike is now in the shop

27
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,140
and

28
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,970
as part of the process old shuttle will
share with you some fun

29
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:53,890
and pain of farm it's going back to try
to exploit them

30
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:59,680
and of course which bike I'll try to to
do like them all Socialist International

31
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,710
I would choose

32
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:04,790
Tiger process well its parsley because
everyone use

33
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:09,689
ransoms and is a lot of Technology
shifting into the client-side

34
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:13,739
and once you find a bug in a browser
that's

35
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:17,939
the circle back because is affected so
many people so we leave with me to the

36
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:19,120
approach of Palm

37
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,319
like wide angles like wouldn't even just
published a memory corruption bites but

38
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:24,270
also other kind

39
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,920
bytes and when I say other kinda bounces
injection attacks

40
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,209
and also trying to defeat our security
controls Nebraska like same origin

41
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:32,840
policy

42
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,319
and it is something that you would see
as

43
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,599
swim okay let's get to know

44
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,750
to the columns and patient just want to
be based rate so that start

45
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,910
shopping I'm yeah pretend you're then

46
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:49,500
look at the window shop you see them
said the look and the shoes on the banks

47
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,069
with them

48
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:54,930
you could look at the local so the
Browns so the first one auto today's 25

49
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,110
folks use of the pre

50
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:59,730
there was found by Scott bed and the

51
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:03,489
on excluding a bus police training at
some

52
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:07,099
memory corruption Mike and has been
fixed

53
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:11,640
5-foot-11 it only works in Windows 7 and

54
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,560
we like to rate kinda party vendor
response with acts you 25

55
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,200
and his street because it took so long
for them to fix it

56
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,650
it's a very long trade if you check the
bike the Line train

57
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:27,090
is by think long time because once you
know the votes that we struggle to

58
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,000
understand the bond

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,930
and trying to to find the the fix for
the back but they fix it so that's

60
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:33,830
that's the time

61
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:38,000
so the approach we took two to to find
his back was to use

62
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,920
across ponds so cross part is a public
school has been developed by

63
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,340
Michael unsolicited and basically that's

64
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:50,160
scandal bomb to which can be used what's
miles but what was done in this case

65
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,590
whilst modify that

66
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,629
tweak it a little bit and I'll show you
what what's done

67
00:03:54,629 --> 00:03:57,849
so what kind of these

68
00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:02,730
what kind it is but what typist is this
pop stand is a memory corruption my hand

69
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:06,620
might produce the use of two free I'm so
the use of the free

70
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:10,730
ok years when the top is trying to use
onto the memory which has been freed

71
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:14,980
in his case is a chine which has been
pre you can see in the written this be

72
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:15,870
should be though

73
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,039
the fee fee fee fee is the partner which
spurred that

74
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:22,129
by the Montreux to identify the picture
which has been freed

75
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:26,379
and then you see the call I'm on the
bottom

76
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:29,449
and is trying to call the pointer which
has been freed

77
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:34,010
and of course that might be different
behavior so

78
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:38,440
thus of the mic boschman these workers
or he might actually be a big difference

79
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,430
I suspect that way

80
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,780
so in this case we try to get course try
to get them

81
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:48,120
to execute cold from from the corruption
by so what kinda modification we did

82
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,010
across parts

83
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:52,479
um what you see on the right side
despite the power meters

84
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,419
which about the prospects and dissolved
by means which can be changed

85
00:04:56,419 --> 00:05:00,280
so one on the main change was to
increase the entropy when fighting with

86
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:00,979
my meters

87
00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:05,020
you passing prospered and get the
modification with it will remove the top

88
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:05,389
of

89
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:08,960
garbage collection function and and then

90
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,509
also in the HTML template which is
passed across parts

91
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:17,400
um another major change was to set the
document doc sign mold

92
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,150
on which is basically like setting the
content and people

93
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:25,030
up option but for each and HTML elements
on

94
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:28,810
so that makes the entire page to be
editable

95
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:32,040
and with those changes we actually not
is the word

96
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,300
other crashes we couldn't find without I
mean those teams

97
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:39,759
let's play interesting and that that
spot to the modification

98
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,740
other modification with done is some
basically I created this tool which is

99
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,669
like a Python script

100
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:49,050
and college to mention and what it does
is it creates

101
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,360
like convey complex aged him out by and

102
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,699
support aged about 50 for

103
00:05:55,699 --> 00:05:58,720
and so what we did this combined tease

104
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,509
at complicit in 15 across parts and see
if we could achieve different results

105
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:08,020
the other thing which we noticed there
was cause some problems that you have to

106
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,800
wait that the page is loaded

107
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,889
completely times the the dole if

108
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:16,220
um the fighting starts before the pages
completed

109
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,280
then he will always keep different
results safe have a crush

110
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,440
you you my end up that you can reproduce
the crash anymore

111
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,699
so we had to do some some kinda changes
and other things we need is like

112
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:31,389
you have different faces in cross pazzo
we try to come down so on the

113
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:35,340
the PC with which we didn't want to have
and as you can see this cation that we

114
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:35,900
just left

115
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,650
like tweet properties she's a function
which just last changed on the

116
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,050
properties of each defendant's

117
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,289
so kinda from mounting that and

118
00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:48,630
took a long time to to get it working

119
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:52,000
and then we have the crash so the next
thing which we did it was to minimize

120
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,430
the crash because we were using a very
complex HTML

121
00:06:55,430 --> 00:07:00,289
assess the full in cross parts performs
thousands of Thomas pit operation

122
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:01,600
against the bomb

123
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,979
on the page so hmm

124
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:09,110
the problem will stand for me how many
and which Thomas keep the operational

125
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:13,050
are performed but crossbar so that on
the Cali plates train

126
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:17,699
the develop of my folks a station the
Fifers as tensions sounds cold day is

127
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:18,669
long

128
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:21,930
so useful if I put sanctions in five
books

129
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:25,310
and then what happens is that you run
Jays low can dump

130
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:29,530
all the CHA mosquito operation performed
by the cross-party

131
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:33,229
and the way to do that is basically
there's a local

132
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:38,120
lock function you scenes patient and you
create art custom event

133
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,910
the dome and basically JS love is
waiting for the custom you went to

134
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:45,960
to treat them and when the lock function
is

135
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,229
call by cross parts it just initiate the
event

136
00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:53,069
that is lock is waiting for at the Los
the content of

137
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:57,180
the operation that allow us to actually

138
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:02,139
make a hugely so tell us a bit operation
performed by cross but

139
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:06,199
and that's part of the many months in
the test case

140
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:12,030
I'm so love a lot of time spent many
months the state's case

141
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:15,669
and just might going by consistency
still run the five folks

142
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:19,889
a touchdown can see people still
crashing by making modification on the

143
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:21,030
HTML template

144
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:25,310
and the reducing the Dallas peeps as
well and that took a long time

145
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:28,770
and then of course the result is after
month

146
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:33,729
is to get to simplify test case as
simple as possible

147
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:37,229
where instead of thousands of people
pray she gets few jobs

148
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:40,380
integration instead the you change them
a fight you

149
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,550
facing 1

150
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:47,319
so this is the premier concert that i'm
gonna show so busy that to fight some

151
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:48,399
old

152
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,269
one is the pond not HTML page and then
if you guys can actually see him

153
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:56,579
try to make the suspicious people as
possible

154
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:59,720
miss you wanna Dusty's opens our child

155
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,399
our window and the child when the which
you can see now

156
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,179
it's basically a simple HTML file with
the form an input type file

157
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:13,089
what the parent das he opens the Chinese
owns time

158
00:09:13,089 --> 00:09:17,179
then there's %uh settimeoutfunction and
his case Duclos

159
00:09:17,179 --> 00:09:20,449
which triggered after two two sects and
then

160
00:09:20,449 --> 00:09:24,499
it clicks on the simplified

161
00:09:24,499 --> 00:09:28,999
from from the parent and any clothes
that though the chart

162
00:09:28,999 --> 00:09:32,749
to make the space simple and just try to
picture

163
00:09:32,749 --> 00:09:37,230
so pint sponsor a child the parents then
calls the file

164
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:41,910
clicks on the fall that calls in windows
to spawn the file open dialog

165
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:45,089
and then the pint trying to close the
child

166
00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:49,999
why the file opened: I love it still
open that creates the crutch

167
00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:53,819
they seem to be simple to understand but
wanted to get to that conclusion

168
00:09:53,819 --> 00:09:58,149
spent six months the

169
00:09:58,149 --> 00:10:01,319
andthe was not I'm and

170
00:10:01,319 --> 00:10:04,769
remember this call spending a lot about
this

171
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:09,499
so that analyze what happens in the
crash so what use is a use of two free

172
00:10:09,499 --> 00:10:13,100
it's obvious and is the screen should
I'm

173
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,499
based on the crash on the proconsul to
show and

174
00:10:16,499 --> 00:10:19,689
I can you see the diet call although eat
free

175
00:10:19,689 --> 00:10:24,410
on the trunk which has been freed I'm

176
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:28,660
another interesting thing is stock frame
yeah the moment to the patch

177
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:32,749
so want would we noticed here is that
the yellow part

178
00:10:32,749 --> 00:10:37,360
is all like multi land functions and
then but what he knows is on the tall

179
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,519
which is the last function which have
been called before the crash

180
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:44,769
it's all Windows Live is the user 32
should too and then the crash occurs in

181
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:45,389
the

182
00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:48,579
sahl wapi

183
00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:51,730
it kinda indication that something was
wrong with Windows

184
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:55,799
rather than five

185
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:59,790
so the conclusion is this is kinda race
condition but because

186
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:04,019
it's not that much reliable because it
depends

187
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:08,819
Hall the timing which is used to close
on the child when the

188
00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:12,100
and mascot is working and Blaze thats

189
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,410
I'm trying to to work on a bed the
proconsul

190
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:19,589
but for now I'm I'm gonna show me the
code execution on this but

191
00:11:19,589 --> 00:11:23,299
but that the is disabled so I'm not
trying to defeat any

192
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:26,619
memory security protections and

193
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:30,929
of course the thing which we we we are
doing is to

194
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:35,399
tried to make his bottle so a I think
that's the thing which are not his son

195
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:36,420
looking the column

196
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,420
um our website these are hard to go
about

197
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:44,279
keeps playing and so the technique that
the main point of that party police

198
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:48,139
that you have to get your peeps pray as
precise as possible

199
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:52,339
to to actually bypassed some 160 members
its protections

200
00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:55,679
so we're still not in that stage but I'm
I guess

201
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:01,879
thats interest in surely many try to
like them on this from now

202
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:07,920
so that my five what's Heights cm

203
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,549
and and the debugger is attached

204
00:12:12,549 --> 00:12:15,670
want to show the form is them

205
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:19,309
to tease them is the child

206
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:22,739
and again deserve the same one that you
saw before

207
00:12:22,739 --> 00:12:25,959
but I want to show in this is a little
bit different from the 1i should

208
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:32,959
from soon

209
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,850
romance on

210
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:41,590
spins so that this is the aunts one

211
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:45,090
so what's happening year is some is the
sprain

212
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:48,180
simple space Spain stun

213
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,800
and then the do close function its

214
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,610
I'm making the click on the on death to
win this which are open

215
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:58,920
so that two children before I say there
was only one

216
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,440
we had to create two windows in this
case is

217
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,880
just show you all complexes to to
trigger the crash

218
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,850
sent this case though though win the
second Windows

219
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:14,450
is a pic then the spray ok use then on
the other win the another click

220
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:20,610
and then close though the first win the
and that's what happens

221
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:24,040
so I'll try see if it works doesn't
crash was what I like

222
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:28,080
on fight I'm see crush up to so that's

223
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,260
that's why with so struggle to
understand what's going on

224
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:35,470
and to 20 make a better exploit
hopefully that works now

225
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:39,590
so this is some yes CC the file opened
items

226
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:43,940
on knife a check here ish issue that you
see the crash

227
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:47,830
but disease is failing failed because

228
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:51,010
um in deep space we put that these am
but on

229
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:54,030
sorry we should see the reference August
right running games

230
00:13:54,030 --> 00:14:01,030
if forget like

231
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:12,820
to that is you see the fascia game
doesn't doesn't really triggered

232
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:19,820
now is just calling nothing on training

233
00:14:30,609 --> 00:14:35,579
if anything again eighties by

234
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:42,579
see it it's it's also my butt saying
thanks for the field to

235
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:57,270
no doesn't work China love them

236
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:13,810
no the word yes Missy what's happened
here was about to

237
00:15:13,819 --> 00:15:16,990
said the back when and then me just
poems the

238
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:21,720
talk politics in since the tape is
disabled and he would just takes a cue

239
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,060
the

240
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:29,060
spread acted

241
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:38,149
alright time to introduce another other
buds so

242
00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:41,910
um is the bike I found maxim that the
for months

243
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:45,790
this is on two days no I'm releasing
five with them

244
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:49,509
and those aren't parched are for the
latest version

245
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:52,949
so the many responses to your own five I

246
00:15:52,949 --> 00:15:57,569
send the report to them and trying to
chase them no response

247
00:15:57,569 --> 00:16:00,600
and they've been 11 new releases

248
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,290
since I Sanders who to talk to them one
by will sign in to fix

249
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:08,490
so on the side of time nonstop two days

250
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:12,089
I in the box the approach it was
complete different up

251
00:16:12,089 --> 00:16:16,920
and in I didn't do any fighting you it's
more like looking for injection points

252
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:21,110
and

253
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:24,139
the type a bike is arm different type
about which

254
00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:28,009
im is can be found in Branson its cool
cross confiscating ball

255
00:16:28,009 --> 00:16:32,339
costs on scripting is like a definition
which was used in some box

256
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:36,949
they were found in turn inspired 34
years ago and also in five folks

257
00:16:36,949 --> 00:16:41,350
when you have injection the chromosome
which is the trusts on in five firms

258
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,810
so amazing if you what's cross halted
scripting means

259
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:49,050
%um kind of cross site scripting but
between two different zones

260
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:52,569
one is on trust and like internet and
then

261
00:16:52,569 --> 00:16:55,910
the other one which is trusted and when
it's a process them

262
00:16:55,910 --> 00:17:00,170
Rasool preached zone which at access to
APIs

263
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:03,899
so just to give you some example like if
you see in the bottom

264
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:07,429
five folks is not chrome across got
chrome

265
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:10,790
all-pro all-pro and much since the
payments

266
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:14,470
com slash slash is all previews
branson's

267
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:17,630
so what that means

268
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:21,189
if you're in that zone if you have to
ask it running that some

269
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:26,490
you cannot sis all the Intel APIs like
you can talk to the fight system you can

270
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:28,209
talk to the operating system you can

271
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:31,210
access book months you can do things
which are

272
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:36,940
to reply P pitched so I've done some
research on the past like cum in October

273
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,470
2008 to release these

274
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:41,790
all process getting to the operates
three a page

275
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,820
in Mike's blog posts to mislead just
some

276
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:48,780
all the Sri and Sandhill when it did
that

277
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,809
in full disclosure I'm three people
jumped into

278
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:54,929
discussions say I is the only thing you
can do

279
00:17:54,929 --> 00:17:58,860
just read the story and other time I was
in Williams understanding what I was

280
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,320
doing

281
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,909
essay yeah that's that's what it's all
and

282
00:18:02,909 --> 00:18:07,049
so-called if this I say it well UN
you're in opera config so

283
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:10,880
sewing you're not a race to say
something you should be able to do

284
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,520
something more

285
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,720
and so the two guys the funny bone re:
prop

286
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,909
in and turn them in the discussion that
you have helped

287
00:18:17,909 --> 00:18:21,610
in the final weights basically jump from
the %ah pastry into the Opera

288
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:25,299
config and then change the Branson
configuration

289
00:18:25,299 --> 00:18:28,640
and that could in the get code execution
so

290
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,419
there was quite shocking for me because
I thought of I just found the process

291
00:18:32,419 --> 00:18:33,429
given them no

292
00:18:33,429 --> 00:18:37,179
turn out to be a code execution which is
I'm

293
00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:40,570
but shocking but at same time there was
a lesson learned

294
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:44,110
so I didn't want to the same state now
months them

295
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:47,760
and other research amino is $5 for
pendants

296
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,200
with my colleague Nick Freeman and the
main point of

297
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,590
research was to find box in the five
folks this station and dance

298
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:58,350
an injection in tolls result into the
five folks

299
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:01,390
chrome trusted zone: and then again you

300
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:05,530
that code execution and anything about
this

301
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:09,159
kinda boxes to exploitation like its
under percent reliable because

302
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:13,900
it is no memory corruption by his and
layer 7 is duplication the

303
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:17,570
any john was if we took its three during
that song

304
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:21,240
will would be relied again this

305
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,610
total do but not my about months in so
these

306
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:29,070
developed by in China smuts information
and it's kind of hybrid

307
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:33,280
browser because his support both though
3 at recently out engine

308
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,929
and also the what kid and basement I
focus of these browsers

309
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:41,559
just performance and giving extra extra
features the user's

310
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:45,090
so according to Mike some that's a lot
of people using it I

311
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:48,890
130 means users phi and that means the
lone 2010

312
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:53,740
but the the I think the most interesting
part this discourse that uses speech

313
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:57,280
and these branches just pops in
performance

314
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,570
and if you go to the h2 meant this
website is course more points and crawl

315
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:05,040
so this is just a few min feature that
them Chinese not tryin

316
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,770
to get there but also more more
performing then

317
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:13,540
stand the Browns so it is the Bison
gonna percent today

318
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:17,750
I'm some it's a different things so the
crust on this campaign which I've just

319
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,809
been through this before

320
00:20:18,809 --> 00:20:23,169
in three different much mean for
different points and then the other box

321
00:20:23,169 --> 00:20:24,149
which is some

322
00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:27,409
all mention about so chaining all these
bikes together

323
00:20:27,409 --> 00:20:31,590
he gives me me find a different way to
get code execution

324
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:35,179
and his bros so let's start with the
first

325
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:40,720
your thing so this is some that's an
interesting one so

326
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,360
you have that you can do the injection
after the location not ash

327
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:48,700
the rent part you see that it's my
malicious payload

328
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:52,200
that militias paid its friend into the
um

329
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,760
about easley again that something
basement to the opera

330
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,640
history but my phone but the most
important thing is that

331
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,679
that Palin its render it

332
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,100
India multi-story then the malicious
page not %eh

333
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,210
mm dust a redirection from the internet

334
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:17,210
to be a multi-screen to trigger that
content which has been injected

335
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,909
than other way that's the second who
they I'm

336
00:21:20,909 --> 00:21:26,929
to ISS like injection is possible in the
titling conscription type

337
00:21:26,929 --> 00:21:30,500
and in months and you can preview SS or
you can be

338
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:36,010
subs you can plus subscribe so both
components are vulnerable to the same

339
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:39,350
the same but book once so

340
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:42,510
you have a book might think that say
okay

341
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:47,149
and you see the %um these nothing wrong
with you and the promise on the title

342
00:21:47,149 --> 00:21:51,880
and on the left side something that you
don't see these my injection

343
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,340
that injection would be rendered into
the bookmarks its own

344
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:59,030
which is kinda minutes

345
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:02,760
and then you have other but still like
much lost people to

346
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:06,500
for months so you can launch other
excuse the balls so it's kinda feature

347
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,760
for them so they fit to window open

348
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,120
seemed the 32 the Dixie if popup

349
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,010
is not lot seemed he would be called

350
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:19,880
and then you have from same origin
policy bypassed like come from when the

351
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,740
often you can tactical fine I'm so
that's that's

352
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:26,980
chaining his battle to get the key me
all

353
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:30,490
I'm response another

354
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:34,540
thing which iPhone yesterday which was
shocking so many for when you still

355
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,350
might stand

356
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:38,980
he would redirect to this page I might
not come

357
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:42,080
and whatnot is that when you go to that
page

358
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,040
and then if you get sincere but I'm
there are two tops last visit the pages

359
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,700
and most powered what most miss the
Pirates

360
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:54,059
so these pages on the internet any
displaying information which I in

361
00:22:54,059 --> 00:23:00,220
and no to my brother which a new up wat
page on the two should never be able to

362
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:05,040
to retrieve people to read and that's
the problem

363
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,510
and if you see him though I just
launched the spektr you see them

364
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:12,020
that too I'm when the the Mozart one is
to run time:

365
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:15,409
and the other one is much the these
objects are

366
00:23:15,409 --> 00:23:18,490
prearranged and they allows you to

367
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:23,530
basically interrupt he opens his temp or
the Browns

368
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:27,320
so the Bankia it's interesting because I
might stand up comics of trust in the

369
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,480
main

370
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,580
and it's the only to mean words such

371
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:35,330
dome up to its can be are available

372
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:39,070
soul the thing is

373
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:43,280
these no control the resolution on
though domain name

374
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:47,360
so and these nice a South somebody for
sale which to be

375
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,370
so basically what it's possible to be
done is the man in the middle like if

376
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:52,210
these and DNS poisoning

377
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:55,870
you can resolve I might sum up come to
another I P you control

378
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:59,990
and then you can have to ask if invoking
such objects and then

379
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:02,990
compromise the Houston or you can
compromise the use and

380
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:06,500
or HDPE using money she's probs or

381
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,620
if you're across escaping into the area
website months on the comp again you can

382
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,679
totally compromise the use and

383
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,649
and now it's time for I'm them

384
00:24:18,649 --> 00:24:25,649
michael's that

385
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,530
it is the maximum us click on this
morning I on

386
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:41,750
and that's the patient is known the
legislation's

387
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:45,900
version that I use for them but also the
latest version is for mobile to

388
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:51,970
to the bites military so this is the
first 1i show it is the

389
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:55,540
injection the about his three-page so
you think that

390
00:24:55,540 --> 00:25:00,360
and just show you what's happening years
some

391
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:04,550
I'm injecting after location ash and
what I'm doing I'm using the month stern

392
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:07,670
Dom up to and then on creating

393
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:12,140
allows you to create files so you create
a temporary find

394
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:17,380
create test but and and then when I do I
write something inside

395
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:21,370
which is same the kadu and then I launch

396
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:25,910
the file which is and just create is
possible just using

397
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:29,610
the dome just does and

398
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:33,210
no sewn onto speaking year but not busy
though was

399
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:37,880
just for the user to go to a web page
and exploit with to you don't want them

400
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,450
to is what happens so you click the

401
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:44,860
its own you see two shows because

402
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:49,370
mushroom the injection accused two times
and a multi-stage

403
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:54,990
so the same bill would be treated twice
and this is the page which is

404
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:59,540
basically doing the redirection you and
I need to do that because

405
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:04,010
and meets the user's at the ball stupid
to TT sweet so that

406
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:08,270
the injection is treated and teases the
injection you know

407
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:15,270
see vintage me too Smyth skip 9

408
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:23,390
you

409
00:26:27,289 --> 00:26:32,010
spend these three item yeah you can see
him

410
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:35,049
you can't injection so when I'm doing in
injecting you know

411
00:26:35,049 --> 00:26:38,130
a picture the beach in never gets loaded

412
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:41,330
and then based on the rule there's the
event and the

413
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:45,130
then triggers the the malicious
javascript and

414
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:49,950
accuse here also on the link pot so
that's why you see two

415
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:56,340
tune shows morning right up close

416
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:00,580
is a casing one

417
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:03,590
is the RSS

418
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:08,570
so on the shoe fits with the game

419
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:12,460
is just showing I'm not subscribe to the
RSS just previewing

420
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:15,460
the content and

421
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:19,200
that's it so the picture is here Nana
click here and

422
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,100
just flew to a concert he's showing me
when I am

423
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:27,130
and that's what I said before the MX is
approved its own

424
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:30,500
jealous people cures here and then again
you can call

425
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:36,110
the pre which API's you can do whatever
you want you can also

426
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:43,110
not subscribe see if he wants is a game
so that is a different model no much

427
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:46,440
since a few subscribe to you

428
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:50,440
and that's a that's on then change the
feeds all put a new entry

429
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:55,080
and you can compromise the user whenever
the feed checks for new update

430
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,399
it's funny you know

431
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,710
thinkin he could do

432
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:08,710
there's a story about this so I left my
am

433
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:12,380
might sandals Bay tied the left months
and

434
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:17,919
running with the ISS open and the the
morning after I wake up and it's so like

435
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:19,059
20 shells

436
00:28:19,059 --> 00:28:22,460
so put it does is lay he keeps checking
for updates

437
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:25,510
but he keeps reading the same article
even the old one

438
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:29,460
so the injection occurs every time so
was still spawning shells and

439
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:34,220
yells I couldn't believe it which i
think you know

440
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:40,779
must be shipped in Civ confirm know if
it is considered

441
00:28:40,779 --> 00:28:43,860
as all the shows the I

442
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:47,309
was amazing for them the myriad

443
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:52,919
right let schools

444
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:56,549
this from

445
00:28:56,549 --> 00:29:00,649
that's another one so this page you go
to this page

446
00:29:00,649 --> 00:29:04,649
with promise you to obvious follow it to
%uh the bookmark

447
00:29:04,649 --> 00:29:08,919
the problem is not here this is what
Penn the province yes a

448
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:12,019
noticed is some cool and then if you go
on the left

449
00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:15,429
that's and this was the problem

450
00:29:15,429 --> 00:29:18,940
so you can put your injection there on
the left side and then you can put some

451
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,940
pop into

452
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:24,659
to actually fall the user to click OK
when the user click OK then

453
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:28,669
you click here and now in snow

454
00:29:28,669 --> 00:29:33,899
John the basically what happens is when
you click on the book months

455
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:37,379
The Expendables launch and they said its

456
00:29:37,379 --> 00:29:44,379
yeah I read again you you compromise
much choice not working

457
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,809
and the last night is this means a is
the page

458
00:29:51,809 --> 00:29:55,440
announcement to I'm this dot com K

459
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,059
is the pay now I'm I'm

460
00:29:59,059 --> 00:30:02,970
I'm assuming that my DNS has been
compromised and I might standpoints

461
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:06,390
same website up this page saudis in this
case

462
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:10,549
locals safe I do I am i stone

463
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:14,610
on you on the same page that's the
problem

464
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:17,799
like it's a thrust into me it doesn't it
doesn't matter

465
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:20,970
will IP's was hoping to and

466
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:24,040
is just have to beat I much not come out
on

467
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:27,700
document the main and if you see

468
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,020
chechyan that somebody website but its

469
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:34,660
resolving to my local lost is no aged
yes

470
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:39,440
nothing and why the share this porn is
that if you look at the word the source

471
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,330
William and thats that's because I'm
using the script and I'm just

472
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:48,110
legitimately calling the month still not
be reached bombing PI

473
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:51,110
and that's why what's and

474
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:55,220
that that was shocking seriously I'm
gonna believe this from

475
00:30:55,220 --> 00:31:01,820
might

476
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:06,390
commit to the station let's keep
shopping for months

477
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:10,610
is that almond blossom thats different
one another Chinese bounce from

478
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:13,660
and I'm not dropped read delays here you
know

479
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:17,120
watched as well is the same sorry see
all 5

480
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,950
the Venera rating response tried to
contact them

481
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:25,110
I actually need there is a form so you
have to subscribe to the fall

482
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:28,440
if you do them right never before you
have to 10

483
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,240
you have to send 10 posts to be able to
contact the Ministry

484
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,059
then once you have denise is a content
then it tried to find a security

485
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:36,520
conference

486
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:40,530
the game in that so I send the report
and then

487
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:44,010
say okay thank you that'd then they
chased them said the

488
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:47,500
can you can give me a response or
something nothing

489
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,870
so again and only release all these bags

490
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:54,380
um

491
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:59,990
dizzy interesting because a is another
kind of hybrid but also so the

492
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:03,659
that two missions one is the light one
is new to me

493
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:07,290
to light is based on i you need to have
the internets platoon to

494
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:11,440
Island France the you to meet you you
might actually apply folks or chrome as

495
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:11,790
well

496
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:15,580
wanna from be funny from the FAQ pages
they

497
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:18,760
isn't process secure browsing and the
response

498
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:22,690
say yes on buses secure since is based
on the transport

499
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:27,250
on buses CQ as infants born kinda fun
dedicating

500
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:31,130
security to the other Bros but that's
that's not true

501
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:34,409
and

502
00:32:34,409 --> 00:32:37,799
just to give you some starts I just
checked and although com

503
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:41,070
his brothers stopped 26 millions noles

504
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:45,159
and Donald dot com has got more almost
like chrome

505
00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:48,350
I all scan indication to me that's

506
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:51,380
that's used against and and its

507
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:57,630
the its me probably nation preventing
china so little bit hollywood's

508
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:03,760
when in office when I launch it is that
I'm the main point is Devon Bostick seem

509
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:08,760
and then he will I'm call by putting I
for the nazis not though

510
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:12,330
real five times the Dixie that you have
in your system he seems to be that

511
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:13,610
corrupt nation

512
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:17,850
and it's under the it under the oven
ransom folder application

513
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:20,770
and then you seen the other side the
knife you can read but there's some

514
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:21,350
numbers

515
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:25,330
so integers the past arguments the five
first not exceed

516
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:29,690
so it is showing the kind of a hybrid
approach they took so they have Island

517
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:34,240
on the top and then call iPhone so
that's he would just be modified to work

518
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:34,909
with Holland

519
00:33:34,909 --> 00:33:40,490
and the other interesting stuff which I
noticed that the ISM

520
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:44,429
Rs resources oldham inside that there
are some fights

521
00:33:44,429 --> 00:33:49,490
souls trying to mop response to
privileged branson sons

522
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:53,460
and I found that on the PPN is is
matching bra so home

523
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:57,179
all ice RSS top dps is mentioned by some
locals

524
00:33:57,179 --> 00:34:00,870
wanna not just these pages use of this
function which is

525
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:04,179
AF run command and their functions

526
00:34:04,179 --> 00:34:09,109
be reached so they can only be use in
those pages or in the bouncer

527
00:34:09,109 --> 00:34:12,710
I'm brosser call specials on

528
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:16,570
have been trying to test his functions a
look but see what he does

529
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:19,909
and it's very difficult because

530
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:23,419
a few days if you try to try and catch
should try to catch

531
00:34:23,419 --> 00:34:27,260
gyro on that function like you pass one
argument

532
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:30,399
and you see what happens there is no
error but

533
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:34,440
these countries undocumented you can't
find any reference on the internet about

534
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,300
this function

535
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:39,119
and it seems to me like that it's an
internal function which is

536
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:43,010
I want doesn't want to put any
documentation about but what an artist

537
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:45,409
in these pages which come by default

538
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:48,960
is that like if you provide exits he
doesn't really have an integer

539
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,190
as the item into that function he will
contain all the story

540
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:58,830
so and then try blindly to understand
what what you can do with the function

541
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:02,800
so it's ready for my niece and like you
for past three we just pawns on empty

542
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,900
time

543
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:07,410
all if you passed 10025 I would just
search

544
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:12,630
for the IQ meant that you used so it's
kind of interesting stuff but I couldn't

545
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:17,310
I'm get away times than if I could
achieve code execution

546
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:22,390
so you know the box I'm same origin
policy bypass in the process homes on

547
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:27,250
and then again cross confiscating
nussbaum and stalk assess getting

548
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:30,390
into the feed reader

549
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:34,600
is the pool a concept on the least three
stealing which owns them about

550
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:38,390
and you have a night free market is %uh
page on the internet you have an iframe

551
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:41,810
the iframe point to the Browns home then
you create a reference

552
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:45,550
I'm with when the I'm from the win the
don't want to

553
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:49,790
and you point to the iframe and then and
then BC you call back to that special

554
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,109
function

555
00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:57,150
any words too busy to pull to bypass a
symbolic importance

556
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:00,540
this case as you can see in person sixty
thousand three that's the thing about

557
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,359
you

558
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:06,180
for the for these three

559
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:10,070
okay so it is the same but am

560
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:14,030
see me in two months them but different
injection point

561
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:17,070
so instead injecting on the location
arch in I want

562
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:20,480
inject from the title the page you are
visiting

563
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,540
save that the time others like that you
a.m. then you can escape

564
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:29,770
and put your a injection them then when
the user go to the bus home page

565
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:33,190
Inc takes on the tops though for the
street

566
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:36,480
injection is threatened

567
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,530
and then again I says the same stuff
months from now on

568
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:44,380
you into over this but the same even the
same time it is a more noble

569
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:48,000
its titling conscription socialism

570
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:55,000
some them as well

571
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:17,770
yet this is a game use it goes the page
in them

572
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:21,830
display tokyo's so this is done

573
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:26,390
is mainstream just got one item but
that's not showing you that

574
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:30,010
from a page from I'm on Facebook com

575
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:33,570
I'm just reading these three and that's
that's kinda though

576
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:37,130
the problem with his bronze I'm not
going to them on the other two months

577
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:37,630
because

578
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:44,630
I'm thinker no time

579
00:37:49,609 --> 00:37:53,609
call okay its keep going on the back
which have found

580
00:37:53,609 --> 00:37:58,399
on five-foot is mean but some time ago
but it's worth mentioning is because

581
00:37:58,399 --> 00:38:00,459
it's part of this research we have been
doing

582
00:38:00,459 --> 00:38:03,559
trying to find my cousin is was funded
by folks

583
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:08,069
so clearance sale because been fixed
amend responses 305

584
00:38:08,069 --> 00:38:12,269
I'm don't think which they define and I
know why they say that almost a month

585
00:38:12,269 --> 00:38:14,049
realistically developer I'm not

586
00:38:14,049 --> 00:38:18,499
tied together at that rectified but and
another didn't want to change so

587
00:38:18,499 --> 00:38:23,359
projects till then and the way that his
bike was found is

588
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:27,019
because we found it for months and I
don't and one guy one

589
00:38:27,019 --> 00:38:30,779
and land development was complaining the
same all that strange to you

590
00:38:30,779 --> 00:38:34,119
found but speak some following all the
guidelines from the dealer

591
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:37,389
all did you find about all all that was
possible

592
00:38:37,389 --> 00:38:41,569
so the promises

593
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:46,069
some dysfunction which is the and is
this Keith by and give each tenant

594
00:38:46,069 --> 00:38:49,199
past pregnant dysfunction issues

595
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:52,769
and recommend the moment Salem to feel
to it

596
00:38:52,769 --> 00:38:57,069
on trust H two men Palin so that's a
given and owns

597
00:38:57,069 --> 00:39:00,159
and you won't get instant right the page
from the internet

598
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:03,249
use this function defeated the

599
00:39:03,249 --> 00:39:06,809
page and and then do things with you and
them

600
00:39:06,809 --> 00:39:11,099
so that their homes he should be no you
can see an example I get paid to

601
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:15,679
paper this year on trust the aged women
and then you have fragment

602
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:20,689
and then you basically use the past five
minutes function to feed to the paid-up

603
00:39:20,689 --> 00:39:24,149
the result of that its feet with so we
should be safe to use

604
00:39:24,149 --> 00:39:29,859
in the context of the AM so I'll site

605
00:39:29,859 --> 00:39:34,479
out I was be clues about the comment on
the development and it's okay let's

606
00:39:34,479 --> 00:39:38,859
let's try it but say that paid off his
the pain and you see that test and then

607
00:39:38,859 --> 00:39:39,649
there's a script

608
00:39:39,649 --> 00:39:43,529
and then run the past by the conscience
the result

609
00:39:43,529 --> 00:39:48,380
and then see that the only things which
remains tests busy removing on-screen

610
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,749
because I gain if you haven't

611
00:39:50,749 --> 00:39:54,109
and I was getting junction in 25 folks
chrome sohn

612
00:39:54,109 --> 00:39:57,159
again you can do things like on
execution

613
00:39:57,159 --> 00:40:01,479
so skip this shipped out which is good
but then it from the slate

614
00:40:01,479 --> 00:40:05,149
deformation the painted but instead of
putting

615
00:40:05,149 --> 00:40:08,209
a straight script inside the H two men
paid

616
00:40:08,209 --> 00:40:12,479
and say what if we have Charles keep
into the 8 Ref

617
00:40:12,479 --> 00:40:16,049
a tribute to Kristen's don't that is
that strip

618
00:40:16,049 --> 00:40:19,359
I'll just the fifth and my phone is that
nah Street

619
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:23,989
up and that Spain just because if you
have that kind of condition then if the

620
00:40:23,989 --> 00:40:25,649
user clicks on that evening

621
00:40:25,649 --> 00:40:30,829
then the Dallas peeps which is that
would be executing the five fox.com

622
00:40:30,829 --> 00:40:35,679
and then again you can get code
execution a show in

623
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:39,649
them all from that and them that we
fumble the ball and the game was

624
00:40:39,649 --> 00:40:46,649
complaining about

625
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:52,290
you so it is some

626
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:56,130
is the wheat SS is he on on the left
side and

627
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:59,590
is the money supply cesspit so your
money

628
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:02,600
lignin feynman setting up listening part

629
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:06,410
until six and then

630
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:10,090
you see disney's in touch he cleats on
that

631
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:16,990
case on that and then stir the
investment and is the example

632
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:20,190
on will not be getting a 5-foot send
them since

633
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:23,810
it's interrupting the crumbs on you can
do pretty much whenever you want

634
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:28,450
this case nichols' the loading and I'm
an executable and then execute the walls

635
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:35,450
connecting back to see missed an
important

636
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:39,849
Jan other one over yourself it is moles
to meet him

637
00:41:39,849 --> 00:41:44,099
it some memory function my and

638
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:47,630
it's a clearance because they couldn't
find exploit and

639
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:51,520
been responses 15 it's plain to see
because I

640
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,599
ascend the report of and say okay thank
you but

641
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:58,450
you is not the security issue because
you're not providing the exploit

642
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:01,589
and it's a a and said okay

643
00:42:01,589 --> 00:42:05,260
I'm can you and me can you can you
should be back in Siebel so I can

644
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,380
understand what's going on

645
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:09,589
say no became can you shape

646
00:42:09,589 --> 00:42:12,800
if um if it is exploitable so they went
by

647
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,230
they did the analysis in this state is
not exploitable

648
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:20,060
but then the think I say but if you find
the exploit

649
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:23,950
please let us know minutes and no if you
say that these

650
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:27,560
mondex pondimin then don't spend any
time to understand

651
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:31,170
if I can find this point and scandal
fade because

652
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:34,290
there was something I found the SBG
phone

653
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:38,040
by nope no so this game released report

654
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:42,060
opposite you don't have the export
sinisa but the guy

655
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:45,880
after six months from the exploits and
release it in full disclosure

656
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:50,470
so that's by famed problem so the bank
was found I'm

657
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:53,820
can abuse noone buttons and I'll show
you

658
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:56,859
and I if you can read for me tried to
them

659
00:42:56,859 --> 00:43:00,520
basically it's is a simplified this case

660
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:03,980
on the bottom there's only to HTML
element and

661
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:07,040
what I'm doing with the Dallas peeps is
basically

662
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:10,589
clone the options and them as he removed
the art

663
00:43:10,589 --> 00:43:14,170
Upton and then to append the reference
in this is done

664
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:19,500
like com four times and it's done on the
first

665
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:22,510
each the amendment in the n1 and

666
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:26,010
and then I do us I Spain and that causes
the crotch

667
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:30,440
explain to see information I can find it
spawned try to share that with other

668
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,630
colleagues and friends

669
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:35,140
the within the Queen fine but its but
both

670
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:39,040
to to mention and North Sea for it

671
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:46,040
we have to be there as well

672
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:50,310
yet this is dumb not showing year the
painted

673
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:53,530
so these are the two each tournament and
then you have

674
00:43:53,530 --> 00:44:00,530
I'm crash function

675
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:05,270
and his what's happening stranger call
on the options from

676
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:08,510
begins hearings

677
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:11,549
like clung on to every moment up to man
up and reference

678
00:44:11,549 --> 00:44:15,470
and base in his book just calling

679
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:19,740
some on the methods all that you can
call against nom nomz

680
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:23,480
in the page like long known remove time
and then upended

681
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:28,349
so against is a

682
00:44:28,349 --> 00:44:31,980
simplify this case is my else could I
wrote for futzing

683
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:35,220
opera was more more complex was doing
more more operations

684
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:38,780
so in order to get the city's bond was
not it's not that easy

685
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:45,369
so you're not touching the bag into
opera and then just launching of against

686
00:44:45,369 --> 00:44:45,809
them

687
00:44:45,809 --> 00:44:52,809
that this case

688
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:58,630
and his the page and I'm in CA but then
you can see the fee fee

689
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:02,090
so opera Greece its use of defeat but
again

690
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:06,400
doesn't just say that's a crash but they
didn't fix it there was fix

691
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:13,400
in my 11 don't 52

692
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:20,560
alright last section on dawn the
presentation it some

693
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,310
really minor bugs but still pulling the
points that

694
00:45:24,310 --> 00:45:28,210
I'm cross confiscating computer book
months and

695
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:31,599
immersion in both Firefox and Opera the
five folks

696
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:35,290
on is but it's been kinda that's been
reported by someone outside

697
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:39,490
try to find by order to qualify as a
reference but it's thought that is being

698
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:39,920
you

699
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,599
I'm gonna show me now doesn't work
anymore from 5-foot-11

700
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:47,089
won the nobel that is

701
00:45:47,089 --> 00:45:50,530
also leads mention so

702
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:53,970
the approach here was lookin injection
in and from the book months

703
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:57,030
see what I could do if someone um

704
00:45:57,030 --> 00:46:01,320
we assumed someone as the malicious
bookmark some

705
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:05,150
his back is nothing new disease be
reporting like seven years ago but this

706
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:05,580
guy

707
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:09,140
Michael cracks my two months Eelam
basically say all

708
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:12,849
shouldn't alone John askew right scheme
to be bookmarked people

709
00:46:12,849 --> 00:46:17,330
but the stories that Chalis ki Uribe
scheme has been invented

710
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:21,190
for that purpose to be book-marking so
that there was a kind of bomb

711
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:25,720
discussion mountain I'm so let's say the
username

712
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:29,910
book months the militias bookmark what
happens um

713
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:33,920
that changes so what happens is that um
we may have a universal process getting

714
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:34,330
so

715
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:38,560
as to the use is on Jimmy and then
clicks on the militias bookmark

716
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:43,140
what happens that you might have to ask
it running into the complex on Gmail

717
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:44,520
that what happens

718
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:49,070
that's that's the impact of this problem
even worse

719
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:52,869
let's say they use instead of being on
Gmail com is on a prop Brian

720
00:46:52,869 --> 00:46:58,910
on um trusted or previous branson's on
like offer outcall conflict then the

721
00:46:58,910 --> 00:46:59,670
Janoskians

722
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:03,609
runs into opera config and then you can
get code execution

723
00:47:03,609 --> 00:47:08,760
and that's what I'm not sure the resume
racing this point

724
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:13,070
is even if you require the use the
multiple steps there are things you can

725
00:47:13,070 --> 00:47:13,910
do like

726
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:17,369
come you can fool the user like you can
for the status bar

727
00:47:17,369 --> 00:47:21,190
you can spoof your own bar so you can
spoof all the new user interface

728
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:22,320
controls

729
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:25,540
which also uses to make a decision

730
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:31,200
whether to bookmark or not something
lost jospin can be compressed can be

731
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,190
awful skated

732
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:36,020
still to the average user you might just
say

733
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:40,510
yet bookmark it admitted so

734
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:45,240
against Islam old sure a couple times
Ben I hate is the guy

735
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:49,220
who created tells keep your eye and I
found this discussion because he was

736
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:50,050
involved

737
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:53,770
and say there's nothing wrong with using
janowski you it's in chrome

738
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:58,359
what's good for content is good for
chrome often enough but is completely

739
00:47:58,359 --> 00:47:58,780
wrong

740
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:05,780
and the whole show in right now and it's
time to me

741
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:17,060
I'm the open

742
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:27,380
you can

743
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:31,829
is the problem so I've to sling and I
don't know if you guys can see on the

744
00:48:31,829 --> 00:48:32,829
bottomless

745
00:48:32,829 --> 00:48:36,550
on this age to be dot dot who will not
come on the stumps by

746
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:41,000
for right click then I bookmarked and

747
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,380
is the only thing which the user sees if
the user speaking this action is going

748
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:46,300
to click OK

749
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:49,690
if uses cable has not checked for the
address

750
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:53,339
and this is obviously is is not Google
com

751
00:48:53,339 --> 00:48:57,260
is something else so i cant is read by
multiple steps

752
00:48:57,260 --> 00:49:01,160
so

753
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:05,710
the same you same technique that's used
sometimes you may have even the

754
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:08,990
from the window hopes calling the part
of

755
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:13,869
the UN bar so it's even more difficult
for use let's assume new users say okay

756
00:49:13,869 --> 00:49:17,990
know that and so the book once known

757
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:23,500
is year in on the Google the problem
just raising is this

758
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:30,040
so they say the uses here and is doing
the stops money for the bus and then

759
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:33,670
that's why different steps then clicks

760
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:38,900
in that what happens that's that's upon
because the task it will

761
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:42,520
accusing the Opera conflict the Opera in
this case what I'm doing is

762
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:45,890
change in the preference for the
software the

763
00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:50,089
me softer and then do every direction to
the made to

764
00:49:50,089 --> 00:49:55,490
your eyes came so made to winning book
cathodic seems that the pulp local

765
00:49:55,490 --> 00:50:00,579
in whatever specified by default okay
let me show the same

766
00:50:00,579 --> 00:50:07,579
Hanover Park against my ass five folks

767
00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:19,380
again year seats the same problem like
him once the little taller but this is

768
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:20,439
normal to above on

769
00:50:20,439 --> 00:50:23,469
and I say we do bookmark this link

770
00:50:23,469 --> 00:50:26,880
in five for some things even worse
because you can see

771
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,719
you can see the %um was like that you
just based on that

772
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:35,949
same okay we save it now in Firefox is a
little bit different let's say the you

773
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:36,609
soon

774
00:50:36,609 --> 00:50:42,130
he's using I'm this session the sex
sessions by FTP okay

775
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:45,359
as you can see the station can read

776
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:48,939
into my I'd system and can read into

777
00:50:48,939 --> 00:50:53,709
my phone wants to not is he is the
chrome I mean chrome

778
00:50:53,709 --> 00:50:58,719
okay so what happens Eve the use is
working with the sentence and then goes

779
00:50:58,719 --> 00:50:59,499
here so

780
00:50:59,499 --> 00:51:02,739
I want to be the Muncie the website
that's what happens

781
00:51:02,739 --> 00:51:06,140
you got the code execution because again
the jobs peeps

782
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:09,979
ok who's into the crumbs on and you got
the code execution

783
00:51:09,979 --> 00:51:15,130
so this is has been fixed mice by if my
folks in

784
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:19,249
mission 11 is no longer possible which
is good seems that's

785
00:51:19,249 --> 00:51:22,989
someone else as reported these but so
that's

786
00:51:22,989 --> 00:51:29,989
that's pretty cool in

787
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:38,470
so conclusion from this whole um yeah

788
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:41,550
basically them main points and
disclosure fame like

789
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:45,420
it's 2012 and it's still difficult to

790
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:49,260
told and have a dialogue with bouncer
vendors and

791
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:52,710
what I'm referring to especially with um
the Chinese ones

792
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:55,830
I was shocked that can get you a
response like

793
00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:58,920
yes we gonna put the box yes thank you

794
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:03,040
is much weakened about there was no
response try to change that

795
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:09,300
a tape

796
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:15,030
a okay they give to negotiate for you
but

797
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:19,430
if you have to take a comprise a little
meet up to

798
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:22,940
me thank you

799
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:27,580
personal memory up by me even get a
reward

800
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:30,800
complete different budgeted and the same
with Lindsay Lohan

801
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:37,800
so I really don't understand why some
men those miss the but complexity versus

802
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:40,340
impact

803
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:43,780
so often is a little focus on crazy but
which

804
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:47,600
memory corruption but again look about
the injection ones

805
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:51,090
is a very simple but it's the one I show
for months on an island

806
00:52:51,090 --> 00:52:55,750
and is just at the end is just an
injection attack which accuse

807
00:52:55,750 --> 00:53:00,770
not trust them so they feed the need to
have a memory is no option but

808
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:04,280
to get code execution mouse and the kind
the bomb

809
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:07,440
proving at this point and

810
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:11,690
again that get it thing which was in
Justin's them delegation security

811
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:15,370
like Alan Russell said yes responses you
because it's based on IEEE

812
00:53:15,370 --> 00:53:18,480
and the end users company but that kinda

813
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,720
is gonna have that kind of assumption
but it's totally wrong because what they

814
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:22,580
do is like

815
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:27,260
yes the baseball meters boring but then
they up other P so called on the public

816
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:27,860
that

817
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:31,090
this kind of hybrid miss they are the
other features

818
00:53:31,090 --> 00:53:34,190
that part to the cold it's the one which
is gonna be

819
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:38,760
and so that they are wrong in saying
that boo

820
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:42,020
and yeah pretty much did not want to
think

821
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:45,140
they spend in the the little top and
Ward

822
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:49,080
to get five folks want working and to
find about as well

823
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:52,400
I don't think the teams who dis not come

824
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:57,310
I'm love is patient for my colleagues
salty some by so yes we all the banks

825
00:53:57,310 --> 00:53:58,320
issued today

826
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:01,580
gonna write that by staying with the
recent sometime soon

827
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:06,610
I who have any questions I'm think
there's still time left so you may ask

828
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:08,740
how you can just contact me on twitter

829
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:13,170
just talking to me it yeah I think we
have five minutes

830
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:16,190
for questioning his voice has anyone has
any questions

831
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:21,110
reversal no or

832
00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:26,579
something

833
00:54:26,579 --> 00:54:31,020
a thanks thanks for the talk that
interesting so it seems that

834
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:35,050
miss couple the arse more and more
people are looking to these

835
00:54:35,050 --> 00:54:40,140
XCS box I'll let you can actually run

836
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:43,369
dollars keep cool day into litas the
domain

837
00:54:43,369 --> 00:54:46,790
as the UK and basically bring air

838
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:51,380
cross escaped into code execution I so
that some of your

839
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:55,359
and some about you follow on have been
fun likes it automatically

840
00:54:55,359 --> 00:55:00,270
now bout my money size van away or do
you think its possible like to all to

841
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:00,809
meet

842
00:55:00,809 --> 00:55:04,470
this process like too little too floods
the

843
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:08,869
there any friend Bee Gees and leather I
bloody in that these if the page

844
00:55:08,869 --> 00:55:11,150
instruct information from the dole

845
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:15,940
day in a way that because I think every
reason not space tool

846
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:19,460
to find new box where the freezer
technique tweeting in

847
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:23,160
in more rapidly way nothin sweepers yes

848
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:26,710
that mean that is true the thing a
multi-nation

849
00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:31,670
up for the injection once spaces just in
the user to lend to the

850
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:36,099
money to me tonight want to change
actions directly into the home

851
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:40,270
trusted zone: it's done game on I'm

852
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:43,380
for the book months 1 yes requires a
little bit of steps

853
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:47,950
on the user's part and a game that

854
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:51,819
they were required to find an injection
which triggers automatically

855
00:55:51,819 --> 00:55:54,990
in terms of our team then I'm

856
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:58,640
yet it's kind of a different approach
the pressure was tweaking

857
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:02,339
base unit just miss you mean one
sentence like Austin looking for a

858
00:56:02,339 --> 00:56:03,770
cross-ice keep the months

859
00:56:03,770 --> 00:56:07,339
but is to the website into the Branson
that's the

860
00:56:07,339 --> 00:56:11,030
there was the trick to find the spot and
if you find injection point into

861
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:11,940
streisand's on

862
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:15,319
its it's game over you can compromise

863
00:56:15,319 --> 00:56:18,780
the bounced and then if that response to
you

864
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:22,460
this okay

865
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:25,569
thank you very much I think we're out of
time so I remember that I want to thank

866
00:56:25,569 --> 00:56:26,930
you very much for your dog

867
00:56:26,930 --> 00:56:33,000
tickets

868
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,230
all rights and now we're just gonna set
everything up for closing keynote and

869
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:37,020
will be back in a few minutes
