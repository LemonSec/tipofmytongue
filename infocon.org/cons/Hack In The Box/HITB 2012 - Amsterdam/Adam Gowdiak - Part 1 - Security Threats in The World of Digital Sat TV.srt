1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:08,040
the yo

2
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,520
1

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,600
pecan part of the hockey box even mining

4
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,020
oMG object and I am from security
explorations so

5
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,960
that s more security startup company
from Paul and point you with security

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,290
and vulnerability Research

7
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:33,530
me to a different commercial and prop on
a research project we came to life a

8
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:34,460
result of mine

9
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,650
passion to breaking secure think and

10
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:41,739
today from patient will be about

11
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:45,600
a topic which is a little bit and niece
when the cops computer and Internet

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,320
Security

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,440
I will be disclosing the detail for our

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,460
security project St 12

15
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,800
20 1101 that a problem pro bono work
that we

16
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,950
did and

17
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:02,930
for a year-and-a-half and we think that
pro bono work as a

18
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:08,130
an important part of our mission we want
to contribute for the field a little bit

19
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,310
so we wanted to capture today about
security risk which horse

20
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:15,610
officiated with last known technology

21
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:19,710
and what was left on eco system such as
digital satellite TV

22
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,820
eco-system both want to show you that
security in the modern

23
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,729
digital satellite TV shouldn't be
limited to the security of content which

24
00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:29,340
is usually

25
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,240
the perception up to content provider
homepage: apply to provide

26
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,920
saw important disclaimer: because I'll
be talking about quite fascinating stuff

27
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:44,440
i watch I want to emphasize that and all
the information that's provided here

28
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,880
day it for the cation on purpose for
that on their we do not promote

29
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,020
Anne acts of digital satellite TV piracy
and the use of information provided in

30
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,860
this presentation for illegal purposes

31
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,360
should people prohibited so case

32
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,700
how they collect are taken against %uh
our company will of course

33
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,660
I think our web pages so what's the
motivation for security

34
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:12,220
explorations both started a couple of
years ago and we

35
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:16,040
I one of our missions was to increased
general and Lawrence when it comes to

36
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,420
security of network-connected

37
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,480
15th so digital satellite TV set-top box

38
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,980
the whole area pissed off at like the
beast change a little bit

39
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,130
during the recent years because now
those devices started to be connected to

40
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:30,830
the Internet

41
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:35,069
and if you connect any device for the
internet here you need to

42
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:38,120
you or of author if the car out there
are

43
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,290
in a PC user are 100 Jahre all those
risks saw

44
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,310
the cost one of our motivation to thank
you want to

45
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,550
to find out if set-top box divisive
could be

46
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:51,349
hack are either under it related to the
mall or respect that

47
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:55,800
some less official motivation sup cuz
you know we are quite

48
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,849
a freak now this is there parking scream
affect the box device

49
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:03,450
when we thought that someone local out
there with a foot that try our

50
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:08,409
skiers were from maybe we could do
something interest saw

51
00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:11,969
basic that Tara data related to our
project so

52
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:15,400
this of problem of security research we

53
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,590
conducted the research for quite a long
time that was pretty unusual because it

54
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,390
took us a year and a half to

55
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:25,620
actually finish the project for a month
there were multiple

56
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,239
security officials found them they
effective quite a partial ban the earth

57
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,859
so because among the Pandora's Tower
company

58
00:03:33,859 --> 00:03:38,280
such as those providing web services
said affect the box manufacturers

59
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,719
there was a semiconductor company some
conditional access system provider

60
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:45,719
we treat this project as the one
exposing

61
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:51,000
reclassify and security over digital
supply key platform as a whole not just

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,219
set-top boxes so

63
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:57,760
fun introduction to the different
visions of likely be more secure

64
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,379
probably

65
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:02,939
know how this works though basically we
need to satellite TV provider

66
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:07,469
which transmits I think about over the
satellite and today

67
00:04:07,469 --> 00:04:10,680
use our home inflation's and what's
require

68
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,150
to receiver digital satellite TV your
search

69
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,780
me that some kinda via device and the
bicep the book

70
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:23,610
device and a satellite dish to to
receive to signal saw

71
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,210
the digital satellite signal that audio
and videos

72
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:32,400
if trust me that with the use of mpg
Trosper streams that's the fundamental

73
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,680
protocol and the the most fundamental
specification for

74
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,330
for the called for the light in your
area what

75
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:43,760
interesting from the hikers perspective
of course there's

76
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,880
audio and video data transmitted along
to those

77
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,610
mpg strength pock that there are some
specific a shot that

78
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:54,639
also state that you can have files trust
me that over to

79
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,100
transfer can have applications the
so-called job application Tupac's left

80
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,740
you can have also some private or or per

81
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,639
operator specific data subject such a
step up cooperation

82
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,780
upgrade some me for the tower related to
approach should be doing

83
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,010
Mac saw and PG streams are

84
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:17,520
pretty they have pretty simple form

85
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,539
saw basically audio and video de Thais
being and called it into some kind of

86
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:25,660
in all packed for my pocket a mpg call
h264

87
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:30,250
same for all your data the resulting
allotment three streams are split and

88
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:30,639
talk

89
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,150
some kind of tax which are called packet
type elementary streams they are large

90
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:38,520
I think it could be up to 64 kilobytes
of data

91
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,580
because these chunks are too large to be
transmitted

92
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:46,050
for they are pocket knife again encoded
focal transport chain pocket and the

93
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:46,870
fuck up or just

94
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,960
188 bytes man they have some common hard
to compete head or

95
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,960
they have TomTom very important field
which is called

96
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,509
P ID their pocket identify our and this
here

97
00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:00,900
simply don't know if the kind of data
that is being transmitted at the payload

98
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,990
object up the MPEG stream:

99
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:06,789
of course you have to have to and peach
state %ah

100
00:06:06,789 --> 00:06:10,819
and scrambled trip that so there's also
some kind of a peep

101
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:14,440
liking whether the state I scrambled or
not thought that's been straight up with

102
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,280
a fat

103
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,780
elementary streams saw one channel such
as for example

104
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,080
HBO can have a couple of streams washing
for I'm

105
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,759
audio of you hope you doin for beta that
Christians are pocket knife pocket price

106
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,349
again and we have the high of three

107
00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:31,770
which is being broadcast live to set-top
box devices

108
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:35,440
an difficult transports stream

109
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,949
saw because Feb above devices need to
know how to actually

110
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:44,009
extract the audio and video data from
the NPD change

111
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:47,710
there needs to be some kind of
additional information transmitted

112
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:52,050
along their all young pedo so we have
some special mpg tables

113
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:55,409
the finding a specification which simply

114
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:58,879
keep information the work to find akiva
stream forgiven

115
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:01,979
program at the first table program
Association table

116
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:05,840
which half a fifth number 10 for the
people

117
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,330
and we have also problem up table and
this table champagne

118
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:12,810
stay work to find a stream for a given
all your

119
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:16,030
your data forgiven program

120
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:20,199
so because to Dale primary talk about
that the box device aside

121
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:23,990
to introduce you but what what the f
things are so these are basically the

122
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,319
devices that

123
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:29,430
have a some kind of a tuner their
comeback to that television fat

124
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:33,490
and some kinda they're all sort of
signal and the can't help it if I can

125
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,080
beat this thing

126
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,919
icons from at the buffet like fish saw

127
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,610
these devices turn to signal a shift
from a satellite into contact

128
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:46,220
just and display on a television fact
the features of modern digital satellite

129
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:46,770
Lisa

130
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:50,169
the boxes are you know quite reach they
can

131
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:53,500
allow Internet connectivity have a cam
allow of

132
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,909
from somewhere pros or experience they
can allow to record some programming

133
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:57,789
Victor Ortiz

134
00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:01,379
internal hard drives so

135
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:04,400
better basic architect over

136
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,460
java-based set-top box I just decided to
just stick to

137
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,610
that kind of a tyrannical I'll be
talking about about bass up the boxes

138
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:12,389
later

139
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:16,539
so at the very top we have helped the
box hardware we have some dedicated to

140
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:18,220
be cheap tablet computer

141
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,509
and hard with and PG streams than we
have a top

142
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:25,400
and by that I S your campaigns disobeyed
you know how it or some other or what

143
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:30,490
all out of we have 10 Java Virtual
Machine and cable set-top boxes that

144
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:32,110
j2me specification of Fame

145
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:35,650
officials yes he he there somehow Java
Virtual Machine

146
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:39,250
later up into the air we have some kind
of pic

147
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,590
something that's called MHP metal or are
API

148
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:46,980
these are the car Java API which allow
to deliver perceptible

149
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,480
Harbor which actually provide the
function I took a set-top box

150
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,760
for Java developers and at the very top
you got the may affect the publication

151
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,110
which makes use up to

152
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:59,420
midora API which are pilau

153
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:03,200
saw ask our API for time and some month
many home platform

154
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,210
MHP they are defined in s specification

155
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:09,740
which can be dollar from our website and
they

156
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:13,090
provide basic that fashion Nike at
national hero from

157
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:18,130
low-level mpg access fam med iControl
and playback application life cycle

158
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:21,970
it's a prospective job applications from
graphic user interface

159
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:25,900
and of course security talked over each
step

160
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,800
that's very interesting think of you
know our monies are not

161
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,390
order these things could be executed a
stepped-up of

162
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:37,370
saw job applications and a separate box
environment or Corp

163
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:40,800
extract and they are broadcasted by to

164
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,530
digital satellite TV operators and fight
mpg streams

165
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:48,390
thought there is a special aite mpg
section which defines the

166
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:51,770
different attributes and attributes and
characteristics over

167
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:55,550
job application to be executed on a
septa bus tho

168
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:59,110
digital satellite providers have this
kind of power

169
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:03,610
execute applications at the box this is
a concept very similar to a shop let's

170
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:07,100
which means that eclipse are executed in
a sample

171
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:11,770
security sample for the there is no harm
to their environment they are executed

172
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:15,410
am what of important

173
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:22,210
know what happened what whole thing part
of that

174
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:25,390
well at eclipse are usually found

175
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:29,180
to their a given program for example if
there is an HBO

176
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:33,610
at HBO broke a some kind of application
so that that application

177
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:36,630
life the lifestyle publication is during
the

178
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,970
the time a given but you can serve as a
selective are

179
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:43,090
which means something that for the panic
even user

180
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:47,650
want to thank you can channel I'm
apartheid for

181
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:54,650
know what happened

182
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:08,399
try something else

183
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:28,200
I'm changing the resolution for maybe
it's gonna work

184
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:52,700
an idea what went wrong

185
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:01,010
okay so maybe I just proceed without a
the a couple of life

186
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:06,160
you now I got plenty of them how

187
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,450
okay I was talking about that to buy
accepts all

188
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:14,270
we'll have quite the kids are and the
flight so and I mention that the robot

189
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:17,270
like %um programming and what's
interesting is that

190
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:22,570
they could the also been found out by Ed
for tonight if the operator

191
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:25,950
on a set the book system that could be
felt in a purse or something

192
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:32,950
way other crap they could out of stock
and some way

193
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:39,860
so there's no slide but I can

194
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,080
to talk about it so

195
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:47,850
yeah a

196
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:52,230
the next fight something if about that
their

197
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:56,870
actual parking environment we worked
with I mean so I see the guys were

198
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:57,850
flashlights are

199
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:02,420
something serious happened whether so

200
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:06,180
all of the tests when it comes to this
research hope that this stuff at the

201
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:06,940
light pp

202
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:11,090
it was conducted in a real-life better
for tonight if the environment so

203
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:14,410
you work with wonder up to because
providers in poland

204
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:18,200
an which has about it come at 125

205
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:23,040
subscribers thirty-plus Asian TV
channels so we work with the

206
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,560
set to both devices of advised that if a
broadcast company

207
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,760
all yeah something yeah

208
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:38,070
thank you thought it was my fault

209
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:42,060
aka okay so we work with the

210
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:45,420
above devices of advantage for profit
company one of the biggest players from

211
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,430
the setup of

212
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:49,720
manufacturing market we work with their

213
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,900
devices which are based on as the
microelectronics chipsets that we're

214
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,200
using the contact conditional access
system

215
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:01,390
for whatcha paying for content security
at there are also some kind of unlimited

216
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:05,310
set up traffic Internet services because
the devices we worked with

217
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:08,430
they were connected to the Internet and
that had been tough

218
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,950
for tonight you provide or made the
environment more

219
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,430
and

220
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:16,360
reach for the users of these devices so
they could use some kind

221
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,590
some services for HR Xperia an

222
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:23,820
the next light showers there tho here we
got that kinda architects about are

223
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,430
governed by our

224
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,730
we have to use our set the book divisive
you got there

225
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:32,490
internet the infrastructure up to it is
a fact that I could you provide her with

226
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:33,150
just

227
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:38,160
a couple of trust services everything
here cause for the SSL connections

228
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:43,810
we got some photo gallery 35 as well so
these are the septa boxes

229
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:47,060
we you work with and disorder

230
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:51,320
actually not the

231
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,250
I'm they are all based on for
microphones chipsets

232
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,590
and there's also one more box we didn't
work well

233
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:01,880
with with respect to this the perfect IT
provider about

234
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,870
for the scope of this research it
doesn't really matter much

235
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:10,540
saw the septa buses were running put
different kinds of software

236
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:13,700
we had that hermès and carbon hardcore

237
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:17,090
they are pretty much similar when it
comes to that MHP

238
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:21,330
made the word on the job I AP a middle
or that picture of

239
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:25,870
important thing about that the other
fell for the car belonged to you at one

240
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:30,050
if that it had much more popular
architects it was using more dynamic

241
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,370
link library so

242
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:36,830
it with a little bit here to analyze
soft at the books hard work just for the

243
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:37,540
record

244
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:41,430
the estimate for trying system on chips
which means shark dedicated

245
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,630
microprocessors

246
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:45,790
with a couple of cars insight separate
cars

247
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:49,280
it up the car with doing something out
so we you have a car

248
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,680
which'll for example running the main me
no choice distribution

249
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:57,610
we had all fucked some cars which were
simply bring the end mpg the call being

250
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:01,410
all young pedo we had also some cars
which are using their

251
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:04,790
DMA trust her or cryptographic
operations

252
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:08,350
saw of course

253
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:11,380
week got the situation and environment
were

254
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:15,220
where security of confidence in part
from so did the fuck like a provider of

255
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,560
that the box manufacturer

256
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,180
doesn't want anything to happen to
perceptible to build on

257
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:23,770
phantom hack survey that something clean

258
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:27,320
so create secure environment of defect
the most divisive

259
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,390
these are some of the key charm they had
so first of all there's no other way

260
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,420
talk to connect from the fact about
devices were were

261
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:38,110
with any other website done the trust
that walk on E

262
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:42,210
HTTPS scheme orkut youth best morrow

263
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:45,650
there is also some restriction or
Somersworth respect to the

264
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:50,060
for fifty cut up the target web server
that septa bus

265
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:54,240
was unable to connect with her trusted
certificate

266
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,700
web server father of on some to but we
have to change for a sandbox environment

267
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,900
we happy of course had a

268
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:03,120
and Prevention use of ID with IP pain
for some

269
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,500
some kind of you during and no listening
to keep our

270
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,869
and Crips on the comp the flash and
having which was ready

271
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:14,660
and pesky from my point of view one peak
image 1 pick

272
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:18,110
image the when it comes to their
stock-picking

273
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:21,250
image for the fact the box main
application it was of course more

274
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,120
difficult for ever

275
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,790
and engineer for image for a custom to
hire system

276
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:29,290
which are only visible from the AARP
there are not visible

277
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:33,560
at from the always play our we have cast
from JBS security man that's our

278
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:38,580
no way to execute shell from Java there
was no of faith class this is the cloth

279
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,550
which allows tho

280
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:43,280
read and write process memory it was
removed from that distribution

281
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,540
and hi honey their author called Java
code which was being

282
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:50,550
options Cape for the main factor book
publication

283
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:54,900
saw well that's the state we teach me
sort of

284
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,600
by found out when comes to

285
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:03,050
thing shall state fate we started this
research with saw and of course wanted

286
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,860
to get access to the device of

287
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:08,500
we're pretty lucky because we found some
kind of cross of cross

288
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,890
cross-eyed should scripting on the
repeater and one of the trusted web

289
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,760
services this of course wouldn't happen

290
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:19,180
but it did saw they're vulnerable to of
pretty simple if you're able to inject

291
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:23,380
50 by of our HTML called which means 55
of

292
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,740
including script called which could

293
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,820
executive in fact the box of course

294
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:33,540
act from that point it wasn't so easy
factually

295
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:37,430
now fully on the divisive because fifty

296
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:42,350
bites is not enough class all resources
that were referred from a webpage

297
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:45,780
on a sec top of they couldn't come from
any other protocol

298
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:51,300
Tampa HTTPS as you remember HTTPS also
garnered with traffic web server

299
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,090
certificates

300
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:55,940
saw it was quite impossible for us to

301
00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:00,300
to go and took that direction so use
another boner attack another gonna be

302
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,080
there wasn't a photo gallery thermos

303
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,770
as well but we found out that the it
simply allowed

304
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:09,280
some it provided some extra
functionality to relate to compare

305
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,510
toda Albany users could simply at some
album from for problems

306
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:18,490
but they were watching for Sep the box s
at to some kind of

307
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:22,340
in of a very I want these and a half a
sample of the webpage

308
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:26,170
as visible from the Feb top of and you
can see the exact place for fifty by

309
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,610
such user provided called

310
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:30,910
could be the ink and that was a key
finding because

311
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:34,500
later if also found that these album
names

312
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,540
could be added I mean more of them
prepare to talk one web page

313
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:44,270
which means that we could chain and some
way our coat on one web page

314
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:48,520
saw and MHP specification state that

315
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,610
from JavaScript arbitrary packages
classes have methods

316
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:57,640
driver MassHealth can be are visible
what the use of some special

317
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,899
II

318
00:19:58,899 --> 00:20:02,320
object called packages what does it mean
it simply means

319
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,119
that we caught bypass the first six
hours that were up to

320
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:07,520
and

321
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,600
I'm at their web pros are level have a
calling

322
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,260
the wreckage java.io from JavaScript and
this is a sample

323
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:18,430
page which what what this pain that it
simply opec the connection

324
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:22,430
from JavaScript but the use of Java
ahead

325
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:26,340
in order to adopting some kind of
JavaScript file

326
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:30,530
and that was a key finding both by doing
this we are able to bypass security

327
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,540
restrictions on their web browser

328
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:37,910
of that were applied on affect the book
Steve Reich saw

329
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:40,930
we have to work a little bit more Hong

330
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:45,700
but there appeared for thought that an
arbitrary JavaScript code the code

331
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,130
execution could gain

332
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:50,990
so what we did we simply cap toe such
like

333
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:55,060
solution that for your thoughts that's a
no she class of names

334
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:59,750
for our album for possible names we
uploaded that to the web server

335
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,940
and them up on

336
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:06,150
upon parsing that that webpage

337
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:10,310
on the set top box of the coat was
executed and and

338
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,970
week because actually execute any cold
from our local web server

339
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:17,070
and South keep local fire could be down
all the time

340
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:20,900
executive with the use of evaluation
function of course

341
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:25,300
some people can do everything with when
Cassel JavaScript we are not here not

342
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,510
wept with your guys from

343
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:31,080
thought we prefer top saw you on it to
do how

344
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,320
stop in Java and there is also some from

345
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,290
statement from the MHP specification
which states that a

346
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:42,090
just a matter of camp called from
JavaScript to use all those

347
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:45,970
special up to packages and when they are
called they are called

348
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:50,760
the privileges over target application
and our case or something interesting

349
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:54,490
cause the Sep a box web pros or the
water which was

350
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:57,540
executing our JavaScript called was
executed

351
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,970
and the privilege conflict what this
means it means that we have

352
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:06,170
almost unrestricted accessed in that JDM
environment so we could for example

353
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:10,270
access facets of our packages and we
could create our class loader object

354
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:14,990
and this is what we did we create a
custom classloader object from

355
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:15,950
JavaScript

356
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:19,710
and we define a special note privilege
domain we

357
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:22,960
in an unknown not more class loader and
namespace and

358
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,330
nor to talk to run any Java called after

359
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:30,520
obtaining a classloader object we're
simply loaded our class from our web

360
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,180
server

361
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:35,530
executed that class the constructor for
class and this is the pine

362
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:39,260
which we had sort of unlimited access
from at the Java

363
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:42,410
Java Virtual Machine lever not
JavaScript level

364
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:46,090
execution access for the set-top box TV
of course

365
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:50,940
using their digital satellite TV
operator infrastructure and playing

366
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,610
updated better apply to me

367
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:56,760
operating infrastructure with your
services is not very convenient you know

368
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:01,340
uploading some kind of in all the

369
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,420
there favored I've Album Leaf

370
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:07,220
this leaf track on the and and and the
law

371
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:11,080
saw what you know you wanna talk to have
to be more

372
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:15,620
more more sure to you know we can
compare this research into

373
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:19,510
you know we don't know secretary most
crucial bach open access this happen but

374
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:19,860
for

375
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,929
what he did after gaining access to the
setup of

376
00:23:22,929 --> 00:23:27,650
we always tried 20 modified the web
browser configuration such a way

377
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:33,050
so we im able to http scheme and we
disable the certificate for education

378
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:36,480
and this what with this achievement this
one line of code and the cocky

379
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,120
bet online conduct aggression file
redevelop

380
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,429
official told that that although
Personnel Committee fashion

381
00:23:43,429 --> 00:23:47,160
and actually this allowed us to for
continuous you now playing with a device

382
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,380
for a year and a half

383
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:51,540
I'm noticed some okay

384
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:56,190
so we are at the point where we have
access the setup of pecan

385
00:23:56,190 --> 00:24:00,960
actions have a coat the next step is 20
break JDM security model and

386
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,230
I'm dust we had almost bicep almost
wrote privileges in Java

387
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:09,640
and this was your to their to some kind
of modified Security Medicare manager

388
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,830
implementation provided by the ATP to
set the box

389
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:16,740
manufacturer saw and this model we have
make fifty threat

390
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:21,220
which execute job of threat and two each
in a different we have some

391
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:25,100
ass a sign from kind over p value the
process I

392
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:30,550
identify your and we have the 25 a pic
application security monitor from ADB

393
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:33,679
and its interesting that it implement

394
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,830
the the French security checks such a
way for the iftar

395
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:41,690
a given Pete requesting some kind of
traffic operations secured separation

396
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:45,000
is equal to -1 no security checking
stock

397
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,320
it worth used by us later thought that
was not Dhoni

398
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,270
an interesting thing regarding the
implementation of

399
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:57,309
the security man thats or because we
also

400
00:24:57,309 --> 00:25:02,130
found out that actual permissions
cranking object the object that word

401
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:04,130
rocky road permission of two

402
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:08,120
different of our and threat from and
professor

403
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,500
could be simply opt anchor their trash
to the curb to curb your pain

404
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:15,200
and API action under the top two could
be called so

405
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,520
first we are paying to in Stafford
object and then we simply called

406
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,330
krautrock permission to a given park
appeared thought this was

407
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:27,090
not car above in any way by the set-top
box provider

408
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:30,380
access to the package is defining up
security matter

409
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:33,570
saw of all fire system access

410
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:38,240
because the security managers block him
from office

411
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,750
we needed to become actually the peep -1
and we achieve that by calling

412
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:46,470
one function from their families 3 p.m.
class

413
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:50,470
para attaching to the context of the -1
process by doing this

414
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:54,550
the security match are treated of as
they're fully trust that

415
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:58,929
to publication affect the box
environment saw

416
00:25:58,929 --> 00:26:01,970
we also wanted to know run in the
background white because

417
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:06,330
Java applications were being were I'm
are called with being stopped

418
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:09,860
at the time web pros are exciting all
the press were being killed

419
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:14,809
saw for the purpose of running into
daemon not running in the background

420
00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:18,070
we r again attaching to pot kid -1

421
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:22,400
to become wrote anti-environment and we
are creating a lot of threat and the

422
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,360
topmost

423
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,630
the most privileged trade group and the
tough on crime I think this

424
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:31,260
we could simply wrong in the back right
on a target set top box the next step

425
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:34,840
and job I you know usually when you okay
king wrote privileges but

426
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,419
your writing some environment where you
want to go p deeper into

427
00:26:38,419 --> 00:26:42,890
d target OS yes all so what you need to
don't need to bypass memory

428
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:46,830
safety watch what does that mean it
means the chimney took read and write

429
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:47,610
memory

430
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:51,100
in order to see what the people kind of
system has been if

431
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:54,120
so we abuse Java reflection API

432
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,850
to create some kind of a tight pressures
and condition to gain that

433
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:01,179
memory read and write functionality and
that's a

434
00:27:01,179 --> 00:27:05,309
that a diagram that shows the thaw what
this basically passes that

435
00:27:05,309 --> 00:27:08,510
recreated the couple of reflection field
object

436
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:13,780
and we track Java Virtual Machine and to
think you that if accessing

437
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:17,970
it's like looking at how object but it
wasn't really expecting some kind of

438
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,490
inches or so we we created

439
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:23,320
type of your up on our people for by
doing this

440
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:28,169
your simply able to access object to
more EP on its bomb

441
00:27:28,169 --> 00:27:32,700
and this obviously means accessing the
memory Oct underlying process and this

442
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,800
is how he actually came to return the
money right

443
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,000
access for the target process this is
not all

444
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,190
reading and writing memorial swath thing
but of course hikers has you want to

445
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:45,530
execute code to make it called missus
can be also easy

446
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:48,810
achieve sawdust this of don&apost

447
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:54,730
for a couple of times saw mmm respected
JVM virtual machine structures and

448
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:55,380
memory

449
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,380
and we modified some mess of

450
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:02,650
such a way tho and fed off being treated
as a tomahawk

451
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:05,659
JV JVs hard to treat them as a major
mascot

452
00:28:05,659 --> 00:28:08,940
which means that after executing such a
mess of

453
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:12,280
arbitrary jump to deselect that number
location could be

454
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,980
could be da for and we use what of
interesting here

455
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:20,630
the Java native interface specification
for the theme that parameter passing

456
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:23,760
and desist how to spend it looks like
but we had some

457
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,850
our mess of initially it was jackpot he
modified that

458
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:32,510
JVM structure so it was treated as an 84
on after calling him a team effort

459
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:36,000
that was there actual layout of the
registers are commands

460
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,620
and the native caught so we could
actually start writing

461
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:42,810
coat that the case had to ask them to
level up the heat patch SH

462
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:45,919
for processor level

463
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:50,980
saw native code execution if and it was
a little bit more complex thing

464
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:54,770
because we need to write a couple of
additional classes to be able to

465
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:55,640
actually

466
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:59,190
power elf images in memory to look up
them both

467
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:02,610
from you know to look up the got and she
addressed this

468
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:08,559
and so this of this of stock for the
flexibility for for the easier

469
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:13,220
development of called proof of concept
called gonna talk to prop for

470
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:16,870
so when it comes to provincial

471
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:20,460
elevation at Deutsche level saw we are
at the point where

472
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:24,390
you broke JVM security where you are
able to read my morning we were able to

473
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:25,290
execute

474
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:28,940
called naked call to accept the best a
family member that part affect the boxes

475
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,740
them

476
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:34,059
so we can play at the park all right and
of course and because that there is

477
00:29:34,059 --> 00:29:38,770
and prevent its yours or from Chaim
change for environment

478
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:42,590
we long 52 gauging more privileges and

479
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:45,790
thereof a couple of options for respect
that this first of all

480
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:50,179
there are a couple of Nick open and read
and write mode the script or

481
00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:54,200
such as that the cardamom like the
stripper we could accused

482
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,429
an initial you for this is related to
the target process implementation but

483
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:01,540
may 3 found out that this is something
bigger because this was related to the

484
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,650
architecture

485
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:07,380
over Targacept up of because assistance
for using that enough threat

486
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:10,590
all the the strippers open any of the
frat

487
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:15,120
or sharp among all the frats map in the
cuban botch

488
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,120
saw and fears that the kinda to change
attempt by Pat

489
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,210
implement thought this is a sample call
it that hard

490
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:26,070
in ok change from by putting its the 5th
it's like

491
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:29,600
you know hockey in nineteen but though
still possible that work for

492
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,870
why not don't if your we have used their
the

493
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:37,490
dick Becky ma'am descriptor for doing
this and we are able

494
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:41,870
and toe pot credential process
credentials and capabilities and memory

495
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:42,940
internal memory

496
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:46,340
to become wrote and then we probably a
change of temperature

497
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:49,740
simple with that cock

498
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:53,540
thought that was not only provide the
salvation of it which of available on

499
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:56,860
are perfect top of the Torah many more
problems you know there are some

500
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,870
services

501
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:02,220
which ex post and some filesystem
operations

502
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:05,690
all but the name spice with a privilege
is there are some

503
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:10,140
device driver switch allowed for fall
card on memory access read and write

504
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,429
access about no security check tho

505
00:31:12,429 --> 00:31:15,750
ross also heart device driver which will
simply cranky

506
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:20,870
any capability a user request but
without no security check for you can

507
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:25,559
the kind of security from the inside of
a septa box

508
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:29,370
here saw there was not enough for of you
are wrote

509
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:32,520
a target system if you wanna talk become
even

510
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:36,320
more privileged forgot current level are
you access white because we wanted to

511
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,750
play with a cheap set

512
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:41,080
directly after chipset I or register so

513
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,929
I wouldn't want it more flexible way to
go to thaw what we did

514
00:31:44,929 --> 00:31:48,659
we simply stunning our current level
massive

515
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:53,820
15 call we use some newest system cost
lot number seventeen

516
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:57,530
we talk some addresses from the
prognosis dams

517
00:31:57,530 --> 00:32:01,630
to find out that actually exact number
location worry where we could provide

518
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,350
our system call handler

519
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:06,370
and by doing this because simply call

520
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:10,669
any i/o operations from the current
level and those I operations could be

521
00:32:10,669 --> 00:32:15,120
use for accessing chips purchaser space

522
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,260
saw again more complex things

523
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:23,149
when it comes to the current level
access 3220 develop some more class s

524
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:26,330
dodged these are just a few of the
classic got the rock and total

525
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:30,399
130 something but the class is
redeveloping the Prophet concept called

526
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:33,700
but sure the clutter that allowed us to
play with the kernel symbols we were

527
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,500
able to talk

528
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:38,899
actually obtain memory addresses for
different concept with which was also

529
00:32:38,899 --> 00:32:39,580
very

530
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:43,220
flex flexible a copy on it comes to
playing with the current I will some

531
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:46,840
device driver some testing something out

532
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:51,630
so now something about the you know how
to spread my ovary I am talking now

533
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:55,990
but we know we got some access for the
devices yeah we broke time are we broke

534
00:32:55,990 --> 00:33:00,470
a Rs we got wrote we could take the
could call it in a

535
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:04,060
and a kernel-mode but Phil we don't
quite know how to

536
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:07,290
automatically from our have to book tho

537
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:11,679
and the key thing and that always there
as your web browser that's a custom web

538
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,310
browser it's yours by their

539
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:16,409
a ATP and they are set top boxes

540
00:33:16,409 --> 00:33:20,450
its implemented completely in Java and
trying to the Java

541
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:24,669
keep ax tak and it has some kind of
fashions for Yuri

542
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:29,149
you are i hav thirst for blocking if
have some kind of configuration setting

543
00:33:29,149 --> 00:33:32,760
XML file what's interesting that users
can

544
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,450
override the 13th by writing to the
flashlight rectory

545
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:40,649
and also having a interesting that users
can actually distinguish

546
00:33:40,649 --> 00:33:44,230
if they are working with our web pros
are all you bail

547
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:47,350
working with us STP many that's because
of the

548
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:50,929
object on implementation the web Prophet
SAW it it allows for

549
00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:54,159
easy and web sites popping

550
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,260
saw you are I hambre saw

551
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:01,590
that's the key part we abuse when it
comes to executing our

552
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:04,659
and acceptable environment for the usual

553
00:34:04,659 --> 00:34:08,690
way the web browser was loading
documents was for some kind of parts

554
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:09,750
document mascot

555
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:13,839
of some class an it at that point

556
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:17,060
all the restrictions regarding their
HTTPS team

557
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:20,100
HTTP scheme or taken to a cock saw

558
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,830
but you gotta find out that documents
could be loaded with the use of there

559
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:25,480
you are I handlers

560
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,879
and one kasinga right-handers your right
hand

561
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:32,109
Inc OCR pre or call loading dock talked
or

562
00:34:32,109 --> 00:34:35,179
any other document loading also your eye

563
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:39,020
handing didn't take into account the
restrictions from the

564
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:43,330
web pros are cokie Gration those
restrictions regarding the HTTPS

565
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:47,560
protocol which means we quote appears
that you're right hander

566
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:52,330
20 had to pay top over HTTP which is the
crucial thing because

567
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:56,120
we need it 20 fetch my lower from attack
our site

568
00:34:56,120 --> 00:35:00,770
not from just 10-6 trust services
website

569
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:04,530
saw and that your I have heard that we
actually have youth

570
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:08,069
this with the hehe handler this is the
hunger which is involved

571
00:35:08,069 --> 00:35:12,290
for and URL like that if you need to

572
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:16,819
dot aite pa speaks and their

573
00:35:16,819 --> 00:35:20,920
URL and the implementation of this
you're a howler

574
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:24,890
a H retrieved files

575
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:29,410
from the so-called interaction channels
saw that what what thrift retrieved

576
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:30,420
effect so-called

577
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:34,089
AI keyfile and that file specifying

578
00:35:34,089 --> 00:35:39,030
specified the Tupac's application which
have you invoking a target set top box

579
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:42,650
and that's more or less the form of of
the AI ke fire

580
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:46,589
if in attacks but it in our money if in
a binary format

581
00:35:46,589 --> 00:35:50,230
it can you find an image key
specification so record

582
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:53,790
say that now you want execute air

583
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:57,870
DVB job application we want the
publication not to give is the following

584
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:58,630
the publication

585
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:02,160
out of Thor I what we want this
application to be fetched from

586
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,920
that HTTP protocol at with the use of

587
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,060
HTTP or this interactive channel

588
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:13,569
an there are some problems because

589
00:36:13,569 --> 00:36:17,550
by default the set the box environment
didn't allow for Assigned

590
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:22,130
eclipse to be executed saw there are
some environment 33 specified that you

591
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:24,540
know on the fact that could be executed

592
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:28,470
and there are some security checks for
that about their problems also

593
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:31,930
at the class lot or level saw because
the

594
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:35,550
JVM operational out for the road clasp
of

595
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:37,060
a

596
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:39,530
and the whole environment report abuse
this

597
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:43,830
saw and by calling their some arbitrary
cloth from some package

598
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:47,340
one package store for SunTrust fame we
we could

599
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:50,680
fetch arbitrary files from some kind of

600
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:54,160
o'clock from from a local filesystem
year

601
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:59,080
you also with abuse the loading or a pic
up the clock classes and persistent

602
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,670
because we could lawton large

603
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:03,940
X left prop your to any security check

604
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:07,460
saw what we just needed we need it

605
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:10,530
our extract to appear in and some local

606
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:13,780
puff in a local file system we didn't
know how to achieve it but we

607
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:17,700
fun that way for a saw and the way to
achieve it was through the

608
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:21,790
interrupt each other high officials
think a bit about that some kind of that

609
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:24,260
and FS like filesystem

610
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:28,660
Hamas through HTTP which is
automatically mounted atop mount point

611
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:29,920
in a separate device

612
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,350
in our case that this was the month
point rchd

613
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:36,680
from number directory saw at the time of

614
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:40,700
parsing their I P fi other day you're a
humbler

615
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:44,760
simply thirst mounted our

616
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,160
a pic our our public security except
call

617
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,250
adept directory FF at that point we had
some

618
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:56,080
files Java class file available on and
visible from

619
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:00,370
local filesystem week with IP o's their
way class lauding

620
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:03,770
simply per per per percy that

621
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:07,600
to accept a box of redefine our

622
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:11,819
extract such a package an this resulted
in lobbying

623
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,980
object that from the mounted firepower

624
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:19,430
and this of from acquiring the bite of
to accept from our web server

625
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:22,720
and hey what's what the most important
this was done

626
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,940
your to any security checks prop your
tranny

627
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:29,950
signature check saw what we did

628
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:33,450
redevelop automatic tool for doing all
of that

629
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:37,390
X let execution and IIT fire preparation

630
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:42,450
and we tested that of hong all the
colors we knew we had in our lab pendant

631
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:42,870
were

632
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:46,320
so which means that you could come back
to

633
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:51,170
them are worth spreading some are you on
basically and could perceived as

634
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:51,860
following:

635
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:55,350
first use or visit of the flyers or
visit

636
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:59,990
fought a valiant service and than
there's a specially crafted web page

637
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:04,030
well things like that 50 bytes of
JavaScript code the JavaScript code

638
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:08,000
is downloaded to the setup of an that's
awesome called

639
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,170
all packed aite file AP file

640
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:15,010
again downloaded to the set top box
professed buddy by FFF top of

641
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:18,950
except up of parcels the AP file and
fetches the axe that

642
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:23,720
and executes extra pre or to any
security check for April 27 thing that

643
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,280
attack

644
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,700
and that actually the model are
spreading factory farmed out

645
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:31,070
an by doing this we pro- that it's
possible

646
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:34,370
to put hollering for Best Actor boxes

647
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:37,380
just by having a use or visiting

648
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:42,230
one of the trusted web surfers okay

649
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:47,040
now details regarding the banker
installation case you know

650
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:51,140
using our one-stop Perseus to be
persistently following the system

651
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:54,430
me again abused their way that their web
pros or

652
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:58,400
worth was launch and the web browser

653
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,880
parcel the computation feiler we simply
imitated

654
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:06,470
some kind of a script engine re-edit one
line for the browser configuration

655
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:11,450
and we we simply and left

656
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:14,740
our class and the flash directory so

657
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:19,540
having a class from the flash that
script or and the house directory

658
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:23,770
we were able to talk load that class
upon to web pros are start-up

659
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:27,110
so every time affect the box was
starting

660
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:31,150
their web browser are starting every
time ever web browser start

661
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:34,160
starting the configuration file with
parce

662
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,930
and our avocados executive and all the
steps regarding privilege innovation

663
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:40,290
going into the mall

664
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:43,630
could be DOMA and the whole execution
could proceed

665
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:47,730
completely unnoticed for the user those
are the first

666
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:51,530
the only problem when it comes to
set-top boxes there are some problems

667
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:54,660
there are some problems regarding the
communication at the prospect each

668
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,030
technique was used by

669
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:59,610
their digital satellite TV provider to

670
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:03,690
steps from kinda back communication
channel of Targacept the boxes from

671
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:06,780
its on infrastructure we found a way to

672
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,940
to abuse the XML parser of that acts
that

673
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:14,320
and we quote achieve some kind of
authorization bypassed

674
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,460
we could actually we are able to

675
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:20,540
skoloff our messages sent

676
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:23,750
over a dead rubber like double like X
another

677
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:26,750
protocol for that best a box

678
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:30,180
and that the infrastructure operator
side thought that this

679
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:34,480
this much message for coming from the
operator not from arctic char user

680
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,280
saw our messages could reach target
set-top boxes

681
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:41,450
and could be protest processed by Sep
above what this means

682
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:45,070
freedom we could then hit recording from
birth up the boxes or equal

683
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:49,170
sponsor concept a boxer some some some
pop-up messages some

684
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:52,430
email messages from a user screen which
wasn't maybe

685
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:55,860
very interesting still some kind of an
issue

686
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:59,200
are this one is pretty interesting the
of

687
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,950
as I mentioned and the beggining mpg
streams transmitted along

688
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:07,460
out NP just seems caught campaign
private information

689
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:12,390
saw and the case of our target
infrastructure we worked with

690
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:16,080
there were some and private treatment
which are carrying

691
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:21,210
day invoicing paper we find out that
this paper are simply unzip

692
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:24,570
data so it what it was a man trip that

693
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:28,740
am actually you're able to verify that
in December 24

694
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:33,260
2011 to an error and December last year
we are able to receive about

695
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:37,330
820,000 invoices for the user solve the

696
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:40,490
digital satellite TV service so best

697
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:44,110
rather sensitive business information
make when it comes to the amount of

698
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:44,910
money

699
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:48,180
people pay every month per subscriber
what kind of promotion

700
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:52,470
the should because this was the stuff
which was visible from the invoicing

701
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:56,160
because and there was information about
that what kind of promotion

702
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:00,630
use or sign up when it comes to signing
hang out with a given certain

703
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:04,630
some other interesting thing we find out
that the softer update therapies

704
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:09,030
walls and broadcast it a perfect top
boxes

705
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:12,060
and then trip to form which is code but
the key

706
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:15,380
for the trial property upgrade service
12

707
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:19,110
a broadcast again thank so I could

708
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:23,280
get access to that but it keeps up the
christian doesn't really make much much

709
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,080
faster and

710
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:27,510
and that compact Sol some other thing

711
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:32,030
because we are we are also working with
some and device s

712
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:35,130
which allowed for arbitrary access for
the

713
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:39,600
Porsche video-on-demand service now we
played a little bit we're

714
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:43,310
contacts and pipe and paper man and with
the chronic condition like

715
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:46,960
assist them we implemented

716
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,850
quite fair comprehensive hand at the
past

717
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:55,510
ass marquai smart car I O
instrumentation and Java so you're able

718
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:59,870
to simply watch messages exchange with
the set-top box and smart car

719
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:02,950
week which we got intercept them we
could change them

720
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:06,520
because actually do anything on that
think saw

721
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:10,360
and we find out something interesting so
the problem was the following

722
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,410
air at the time of wrenching and even
more me

723
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:17,400
which are supposed to be just 48 hours
the operator are sending

724
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:21,380
the entitlement which are that access
rights with affect top of

725
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:24,900
which were the noting the whole calendar
now they're like from

726
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:29,320
the first but that 30 sharp for the
first 30

727
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:32,520
first yet for q1 yeah saw an

728
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:37,200
so this was of course a vulnerable time
for that easy replay attack

729
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,640
because simply me for a given mass a
trick on

730
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,370
we could ping down the exact message
which was giving the ice is right to the

731
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:45,460
Smart car

732
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:48,500
after a two-day operator are sending
another message

733
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:52,550
which was this saving access to cuba
movie but what we could do.

734
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:56,430
because again in fact that the message
in the form of their

735
00:44:56,430 --> 00:45:00,280
he saw I saw 7816 AP you to the Smart
car

736
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:04,600
at that point we could enable again to
iPhone entitlement watch the movie

737
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,840
just because appear it was the home of

738
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,870
and that wasn't on initially farm the
other issue of

739
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:14,510
even more interesting we find out that
and

740
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:18,490
at some point of time we rented some
more recent November

741
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:22,680
are ok I got 2012 for at this of 2011

742
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:25,880
Rep some ok saw and December

743
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:30,320
the card was showing the following
access right not just right for December

744
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,470
but still very access right for November

745
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:37,760
so what you find out that at the end of
December

746
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,400
by simply replacing their access right

747
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,050
entitlement matter messages to the car
we were able to

748
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:48,260
enable access right but what or

749
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:51,340
de cartes was tradition the keys

750
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:54,510
and we are able to watch the movie so

751
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:59,040
%uh our initial hint what that there
could be some kind of their

752
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:03,680
be quite or mock between does and paid
her mouth we are not sure

753
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,920
it wasn't confirmed by contact boxer

754
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:10,450
they think this was the issue that
should hack

755
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:15,280
okay remaining issues there are a lot of
them I just go fast role for death of

756
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,040
proportion against some

757
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,040
services you know 4 p.m.

758
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:23,480
to to gain access to the user a comp

759
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:27,180
and without no locking mechanism that
shouldn't happen

760
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:31,150
camera configuration issues regarding
the environment variables

761
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:34,620
no posture for Otakon

762
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:38,160
which which was an initial from the
beginning but

763
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:42,030
at the time of maybe get an A to read
this ok with that this was an issue

764
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:46,220
some capabilities in the process paint
some

765
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:49,490
Carolina 00 access about the need for
their Otakon

766
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:54,350
all that shifting some interesting we
had a secure network infrastructure we

767
00:46:54,350 --> 00:46:55,400
found out

768
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,470
that ABB company

769
00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:02,080
I think we are well we think that this
with HP company

770
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:05,820
developers worked were using and working
in the area like infrastructure

771
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:10,140
suck because we find out some developer
for are we were able to talk for some

772
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:14,040
kind of web pages of some an ultra-soft
were

773
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:17,950
from pests offer this shouldn't happen
they're up there is no fire warning

774
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:21,140
no other striking a professional
checking for that I'm the perfect you

775
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:22,090
know having a

776
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:26,880
a developer city for her to be ex post
doc outside world

777
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,130
okay it was a lot of box

778
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:33,750
II some

779
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:37,150
a a good amount of work on a comp so

780
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:42,100
to reverse engineering everything in
order to find those box saw

781
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:45,420
how if of started how

782
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:49,760
why with possible so are fortunate to
say that

783
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,300
this is a path the Fenway saw simply
because there are

784
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:56,610
too much there's too much information
left in binary saw when it comes to

785
00:47:56,610 --> 00:47:58,350
embedded device the I streams

786
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:02,080
power message is something backing up
her stuff and they of course

787
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:06,370
allow to get some clothes all on what
the cuban piece of code of them

788
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:09,630
stuff like that so there are some text
files because

789
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:14,220
right their chief information from like
greater fire for the web browser

790
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:17,490
some information about from other expect
stock

791
00:48:17,490 --> 00:48:21,160
and a environmental de facto Paul

792
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:24,420
an what also import from the whole lot
of the back

793
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:28,730
interface if left unchecked the box is
there are some to back off on the shelf

794
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:33,570
there are some height and screams so we
could enable does Higdon screens

795
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:37,980
by simply entering a special secret of
Commons from there

796
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:42,900
the TV remote this from any other are
not gonna work at the Monaco throughout

797
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:45,920
these are the life that work in the past
them every time

798
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,120
use of proper to supply disco sharply
change

799
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:52,760
but anyway you are able to or no display

800
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:57,150
additional menu on a TV screen that
developers me some kind of the back many

801
00:48:57,150 --> 00:49:01,450
and we quote retrieve from kinda extra
information about that

802
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:05,150
septa bus operation implementation saw

803
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:08,580
well that wasn't enough of course we
read it from

804
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:12,380
extra work for you me %um some extra
mile so we did some

805
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:16,350
runtime: API tracing what this means we
free

806
00:49:16,350 --> 00:49:19,390
we had the way to execute code at the
making the air

807
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:23,220
so we we've built some kind of run time
APA tracing infrastructure we were able

808
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:23,950
to talk

809
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:27,730
to simply trace arbitrary leaps he calls

810
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:31,360
your city or call this is very important
because we quote

811
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:34,870
fine lot about that device driver
separation

812
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:39,140
here's a sample up though the our own
thing tracer and

813
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:43,660
where you is that that Iowa City IA
tracing at the library

814
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:48,270
peeps level 20 to find out you know what
kind of arguments are used to the idea

815
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:53,680
yes from a given device driver so we
also did a lot of mpg sneaking because

816
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,710
as I said there are many private
sections

817
00:49:56,710 --> 00:50:00,340
and protections are usually I'll carry

818
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:03,340
very interesting stuff like no so prop
great for

819
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:06,860
or some conditional access information
are from private data like

820
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:10,730
like peeling information and sneaking
mpg

821
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:14,400
data from Java was quite simple because
week with them

822
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,330
use that make you something API damage
papi or

823
00:50:18,330 --> 00:50:21,620
some other API all in Java so

824
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:24,920
what he also there you know we are we'll
I'll

825
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:29,220
to build tolls to make our research you
know progress

826
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:32,530
to make it more for we also both some
kind of

827
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:35,790
SH for process or coat and you later

828
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:38,910
we did this for the purpose of and

829
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:42,140
that trip thing there book alder

830
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:48,010
image saw it was like you know be
emulated the ethics for called on my PC

831
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:51,360
we proximate all access to the crypto

832
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:55,400
crypt the process or a over the Internet

833
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:59,200
and obtained the results in our annual
later by doing this we were able

834
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,240
with the crypt the bootloader called
which you lost

835
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:06,060
cheap specification we don't have access
to the key this is why we needed to prop

836
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:09,000
field operations the cheap

837
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,070
so finally what we did we extracted CD
in class if

838
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:18,150
US there should you have to file for
mock and we brought some static analysis

839
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:19,010
through

840
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:22,130
to so that it worked in most cases

841
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:25,590
these are some numbers switched so you
know how many classes we were able to

842
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:26,620
extract

843
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:29,640
from the MHP and middle or

844
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:33,400
and what we are we we actually tried
this because

845
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:37,670
there are some kind of inconsistency
their options cation up the Java classes

846
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:38,510
for the main

847
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:43,360
MHP application was stock but when it
comes to the call

848
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:46,670
car JVM process and the fundamental

849
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:50,090
MHP middle or this wasn't a so we could
actually

850
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:54,050
obtained the forest called by the
compiling have Java classes

851
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:58,240
and analyze it for some other weaknesses

852
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,640
ok that's a sample at being Dom points
ago I mean we

853
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:05,800
that the sample just the addresses from
the binary

854
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:11,530
when it comes to the from classes
available from one of the devices

855
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:16,110
her proof-of-concept code well

856
00:52:16,110 --> 00:52:19,270
and i sat it was pretty comprehensive
for you

857
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:23,630
34 how to apply for for Scott that and
some other

858
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:27,200
yeah I know it's probably not helping

859
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:30,430
everyday Barack well we try to figure
out

860
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:33,470
you know II what kind of activity

861
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:36,850
anamensis some or shopper could
potentially do

862
00:52:36,850 --> 00:52:40,210
on a target system so we implemented
over 70 ka month

863
00:52:40,210 --> 00:52:44,060
our call to work all on those devices we
had in our lap

864
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:47,710
it was compatible of to differ I'm

865
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:51,000
similar but to a different process or
now

866
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,250
illustrated of topics we discover it

867
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:57,370
the car simply illustrative privilege
elevation

868
00:52:57,370 --> 00:53:01,920
follow each information access to all
sorts all sorts of information

869
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,460
bad there's no much time today to
present the first

870
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:09,110
that the prof Costco because I wouldn't
put you on Sep representation for this

871
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:13,520
from actually from agents available on
our website well-respected

872
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,580
saw what's interesting is that a

873
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:20,280
because security of content it's
important for affect the books provide

874
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:23,820
septa book on a five percent and into
power apply to providers

875
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:27,640
what with it and at one at some point of
time we decided to find out

876
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:31,680
if there if it's possible to capture HD
premium programming

877
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:35,390
an it turn out to be possible it require
from prime

878
00:53:35,390 --> 00:53:39,620
timeout of XO reverse engineering
because there was no

879
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:43,130
and now no BP API

880
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:47,980
we know it actually and the a little bit
feather into the caramel

881
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:52,750
into the car offers in the two tracks
some pointers and care about her

882
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:56,020
but we did this and you're actually able
to

883
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:59,100
Dom over to network from a set-top box
arbitrary

884
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:02,220
mpg streams and I don't know how I have
time to

885
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:05,450
to show you demonstration six-minute

886
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:09,280
the difficult one so

887
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:13,070
I don't know if I can because we have
some kind of software here

888
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:18,500
okay so really the capturing and when it
comes to capturing

889
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:21,550
these were pure

890
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:25,600
this HD caps or saw

891
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:29,940
may be softening yeah

892
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:33,020
anymore class HD and

893
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:36,130
you can as you can see it's like you
know

894
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:39,220
no destruction and the image and it can
actually be

895
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:42,750
jolt no problem with with the capture so

896
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:47,940
we tried it on of on different the
colors and it worked so

897
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:52,320
well so we we have come from kind of you
know reservation with its gonna work

898
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:55,990
how much of a tad gonna heat when it
comes to a friend over the network but

899
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:59,960
it work an hour non-network record
simply extract their

900
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:02,970
the mpg streams of a state are and

901
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:06,100
dump its try to the fire this is that
the fire the cost tried

902
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:13,100
come from our acceptable okay coming
back to the presentation

903
00:55:16,739 --> 00:55:17,619
yet thought we'd

904
00:55:17,619 --> 00:55:22,680
fit some hotter provoke of the
functionality we didn't mention before

905
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:28,730
in a few no at for whole concept and
that gives a fuck IT provider

906
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:31,650
gave users the possibility to rent
movies the

907
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:35,410
from set-top boxes to access customer
service from such the boxes

908
00:55:35,410 --> 00:55:39,589
20 access their some the biggest wet
action part both

909
00:55:39,589 --> 00:55:42,599
and pollen from top to bottom and the
Dove Creek this of course

910
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:46,289
required credentials user credentials
what we did

911
00:55:46,289 --> 00:55:49,460
implemented some kinda fun tonight he
was able to sniff

912
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:53,160
basic EPS traffic and up tank that the

913
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:56,559
login credentials and Tampa to arbitrary
file

914
00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:01,230
saw at some point of time this was this
was also a risk offset the box users

915
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:04,609
half from malicious code being installed
it on be specified

916
00:56:04,609 --> 00:56:08,690
okay summary I'm good with thanks I'm
happy

917
00:56:08,690 --> 00:56:12,539
a on RBS impact so first of all

918
00:56:12,539 --> 00:56:15,640
we'd interest we didn't receive any
response from

919
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:18,829
ATP when it comes to the impact quite a
question so

920
00:56:18,829 --> 00:56:22,059
we are actually now how many I'll

921
00:56:22,059 --> 00:56:25,380
that set the book device outdoor are
vulnerable

922
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:29,700
information wasn't provided we asked the
company about no offer

923
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:34,739
that questions so we try to to a
estimation on the with respect to the

924
00:56:34,739 --> 00:56:36,059
publicly available data

925
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:40,920
saw this having you know I'll retrieved
from the Wikipedia and a

926
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:45,079
the company website fact 2010 the 16th
me off at the Bakshi

927
00:56:45,079 --> 00:56:49,519
over 30 model now some of those the fine

928
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:52,970
under separate brand customers from
Europe Middle East Africa asia-pacific

929
00:56:52,970 --> 00:56:57,180
and North America but we don't know
which actual customers beyond

930
00:56:57,180 --> 00:57:00,519
the wannabe verified and Poland actually

931
00:57:00,519 --> 00:57:06,900
had vulnerable a box solvent response
when it comes to on that

932
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:10,160
data web service provider provider

933
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:13,170
everything went more with Dan so
bake-off

934
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:16,529
firm to fix it all the issues and web
services

935
00:57:16,529 --> 00:57:20,869
you know that the arbitrary JavaScript
is like a injection show up there were

936
00:57:20,869 --> 00:57:21,489
problems

937
00:57:21,489 --> 00:57:25,259
actually we've noticed that the function
on three de facto

938

to purine their photo sharing photo
albums on Sat the bottle was removed

security reasons we don't know

941
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:39,249
contact as: initially rejected both of
our

942
00:57:39,249 --> 00:57:43,049

regarding the push PO'd

943

that one which allowed 20 to see movies

944
00:57:46,739 --> 00:57:50,730

regardless of the fact that

945
00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:55,299
December credentials were not allowing
for that and

946
00:57:55,299 --> 00:58:00,059
read we receive the detail the payoff
explanation that this was the result of

947
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:01,869
trying to affect earth everything that
way

00:58:05,089 --> 00:58:08,190
we don't know any more details for going
this issue

950
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:12,789
saw pro need the %uh

951
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:15,930
well I'm cool

952
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:22,200
carefully chose my work that the last
two companies advantage to broker

953
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:26,259
night right now vision and Henry
apparently some

bear a fur collar research

955
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:36,109
as potential as the first half
perpetually

956

security the tests were conducted and
their contraband buyer

957
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:44,660
and that no preacher and use of the

958
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:45,569
you know

959
00:58:45,569 --> 00:58:48,730
at work or spoken and that Paul yeah

960
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:52,029
and we didn't receive and the response
to that

961
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:55,720
impact inquire your status inquiry
questions from

962
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:58,999
January 2012 saw but I can just say that

963
00:58:58,999 --> 00:59:02,960
I mean Iran fifteen-year may be too long

964
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:08,190
up ever if ever happen usually terrorist
I'm kinda contact with the company

965
00:59:08,190 --> 00:59:08,980
regardless of

966
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:14,779
what kind of Mac magnitude the back is
reported I have experience reporting

967
00:59:14,779 --> 00:59:16,650
Peter box and there are no problems

968
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:20,910
with that band saw that's it

969
00:59:20,910 --> 00:59:25,269
final earth a I think that

970
00:59:25,269 --> 00:59:28,569
now called a prosecutor straight that
there are some kind of a neat

971
00:59:28,569 --> 00:59:32,950
for more for a security evaluation of of
complex systems

972
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:36,900
all the fish from the pub lessnau and
the harp of course which are

973
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:41,650
best now we farm I think we can to many
security issues

974
00:59:41,650 --> 00:59:45,749
official to be so manufacture Hannah
when it comes to defend buyer

975
00:59:45,749 --> 00:59:49,789
this wouldn't happen but not for profit
that mahler code is a frat

976
00:59:49,789 --> 00:59:52,890
internet connected a polite about stock

977
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:56,130
we solved at fifty-five could be
infected

978
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:59,180
and the same way PC all are

979
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:03,210
tech Tuesday kapala so questionnaire are
smart

980
01:00:03,210 --> 01:00:06,450
respect yeah saw

981
01:00:06,450 --> 01:00:10,349
this fish evolution we are experienced
right now

982
01:00:10,349 --> 01:00:14,849
yes mark alderidge function of

983
01:00:14,849 --> 01:00:18,960
many web page ok baby come

984
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:23,249
internet-connected at some point of time
ok people

985
01:00:23,249 --> 01:00:26,390
are thinking these devices quote possum
Creek

986
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:29,430
yeah I don't know direction the use of
caps

987
01:00:29,430 --> 01:00:32,670
spinning computer crash affect

988
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:36,759
service %ah also when we come access
users

989
01:00:36,759 --> 01:00:42,749
home he said divide so

990
01:00:42,749 --> 01:00:46,839
and we think a pokémon apart I'm when
the cab pickup

991
01:00:46,839 --> 01:00:50,789
from this project saw they are probably
a better

992
01:00:50,789 --> 01:00:53,969
too much homework come to the security
of compaq

993
01:00:53,969 --> 01:00:57,489
not quite ready when it comes to connect
device

994
01:00:57,489 --> 01:01:01,400
in perhaps actors me for security

995
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:04,660
adventure like and smart yet

996
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:07,969
a couple of big comeback any right each

997
01:01:07,969 --> 01:01:11,200
we need to think about passion talk

998
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:14,789
about the security and privacy so

999
01:01:14,789 --> 01:01:18,019
when I of yeah

1000
01:01:18,019 --> 01:01:22,170
potential you know partially Arthur from
by the way

1001
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:25,249
security connect

1002
01:01:25,249 --> 01:01:29,190
okay y'all I am wanna of the

1003
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:33,660
I portside you know asshole

1004
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:37,809
so I its okay thank you very much

1005
01:01:37,809 --> 01:01:40,940
maybe oppression

1006
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:47,940
the best yeah I'm ready

1007
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:04,949
know this is better on technical to the
political

1008
01:02:04,949 --> 01:02:07,380
the

1009
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:09,690
but the abuse see

1010
01:02:09,690 --> 01:02:14,640
any signs the TV industry

1011
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:17,680
file gradually realized

1012
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:20,869
TRL with the RM

1013
01:02:20,869 --> 01:02:24,210
not it's not really a realistic

1014
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:27,829
realistic approach for managing to call

1015
01:02:27,829 --> 01:02:31,049
as a

1016
01:02:31,049 --> 01:02:35,640
as an ecstatic killer well one example
the music industry eventually figured

1017
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:37,279
out they switched from Peoria

1018
01:02:37,279 --> 01:02:40,480
watermark well after I would like

1019
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:43,839
to go and that area it

1020
01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:50,480
for you know well I personally don't
like

1021
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:53,539
when I have KRN recognized

1022
01:02:53,539 --> 01:02:57,059
I don't like all when it comes to their
a prototyping

1023
01:02:57,059 --> 01:03:00,470
I don't really think that's gonna happen
probably

1024
01:03:00,470 --> 01:03:03,519
the reason for your further provider

1025
01:03:03,519 --> 01:03:08,599
of probably you know defeat provide
their

1026
01:03:08,599 --> 01:03:12,180
television they decay all saw

1027
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:16,480
and this is probably the reason why no
all that stuff Paul

1028
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:22,109
from the PubMed provide after that
appall

1029
01:03:22,109 --> 01:03:26,599
you might to protect life act saw but to
fight K

1030
01:03:26,599 --> 01:03:30,289
back come occasional a change approach

1031
01:03:30,289 --> 01:03:34,839
captured iraq I don't have yet so I i
action

1032
01:03:34,839 --> 01:03:37,859
Peter and I had a

1033
01:03:37,859 --> 01:03:41,160
actually any

1034
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:44,960
represent from basketball

1035
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:48,049
top 3 pick up

1036
01:03:48,049 --> 01:03:52,440
philosophical into first mine %um

1037
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:55,680
thank you

1038
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:59,369
yeah %uh was wondering

1039
01:03:59,369 --> 01:04:03,380
how much what you've been saying applies
digital terrestrial TV

1040
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:06,869
I here I was wondering if you could

1041
01:04:06,869 --> 01:04:10,160
say how much of what you've been saying
applies

1042
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:15,359
digital terrestrial TV system as opposed
to satellite bit

1043
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:18,849
I think up

1044
01:04:18,849 --> 01:04:22,119
did to restroom digital

1045
01:04:22,119 --> 01:04:29,119
TV host past allows me to repeat the
question at I think but by never misses

1046
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:36,849
at the same you think same issues supply
for

1047
01:04:36,849 --> 01:04:40,299
the VTEC has poster

1048
01:04:40,299 --> 01:04:44,039
satellite broadcast all me to 330

1049
01:04:44,039 --> 01:04:45,900
or

1050
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:52,390
for yeah well you know we haven't worked
with the

1051
01:04:52,390 --> 01:04:55,690
our about by call peripheral

1052
01:04:55,690 --> 01:04:59,060
people yes but me to fame from

1053
01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:02,740
the following perspective you have
devices been connecting

1054
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:07,220
and I don't know this is going if the
direct

1055
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:10,670
that operator are undertake

1056
01:05:10,670 --> 01:05:14,580
comes to that operation cable so just
pay

1057
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:18,990
after the race his device you put under
attack after the Fed

1058
01:05:18,990 --> 01:05:22,630
I'm kinda compact comp from him call
which go

1059
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:26,589
down the street from the operator along
the case yeah

1060
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:29,570
fresh L which hand over security

1061
01:05:29,570 --> 01:05:33,920
punishes could could apply I don't know
what this

1062
