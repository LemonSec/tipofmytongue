1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,000
the

2
00:00:24,189 --> 00:00:26,449
so the title the talk is the

3
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:30,289
trust security in society and what this
really is

4
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:34,829
is a a talk about my new book which came
out a couple months ago

5
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,760
indeed is when he away the surrounded
the into the talk it

6
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,940
may be closer to call the stalk you know
what I did in 2001

7
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,320
this is the the combination a lotta
lotta

8
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,940
research about security and trust really
my

9
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,260
so endless questions to look at security
in context

10
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,670
and figure out no what's going on

11
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,699
why and how and

12
00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:05,400
this really led me to thinking about
trust and

13
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,869
should invite all of us to think about

14
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:13,490
how Trust works in in society mean just
just today

15
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,580
when I wake up in a in a hotel in a
strange country Nov

16
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,210
I'm sure many people in this building
havoc you have ability to get in the

17
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,000
motel havoc

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,100
have a passkey may I go downstairs I eat
breakfast

19
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,619
serve to me your food by strangers I got
sidewalk around then again I'm and

20
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:36,390
passing strange in a street nobody's
attacking me

21
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,579
I come to this conference lots of people
here

22
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:44,770
night not that feeling perfectly safe

23
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:50,789
were in this room you know the the
amount you yesterday got an airplane

24
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:55,759
you have to trust their not me not just
that the pilot in the crew

25
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,639
but the airports in and the people and
never forget the taxi ride from the

26
00:02:00,639 --> 00:02:01,460
airport

27
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,479
I you know this is

28
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,750
the amount love the number two times we
trust people

29
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:13,060
are enormous and this so great we don't
even really think about it

30
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,209
I think that is the true measure up how
well trust works

31
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:20,319
in our species in society that we do
it's so often

32
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,340
thousands of times a day make me I see
people drinking the bottled water no

33
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,970
one's worry with that its poison

34
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:32,299
me no one's actually worried we're not
worried the ceilings gonna collapse on

35
00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:32,900
us here

36
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:37,040
me it's a trust

37
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,099
is essential to society society

38
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:44,959
does not function without trust and

39
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,879
its also unique to our species we are a
trusting species and mission we're all

40
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,280
sitting in this room

41
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,250
mostly strangers and nobody's worried
that someone else will jump up and

42
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,010
attack them

43
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,840
me laugh because that's normal

44
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,629
but if we were a species a chimpanzees
this would be impossible

45
00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:09,439
I we would not be able to do this only
humans can do this

46
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,760
make that can trust strangers

47
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,510
at this level we do it thousands times a
day

48
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:21,469
we reflexively so I want to talk about

49
00:03:21,469 --> 00:03:25,040
is trust in society how society

50
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,959
makes this work and to me this is a new
way of thinking about society

51
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,909
as a way of thinking about society's
problems that i think is useful in a

52
00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:35,650
lawsuit if

53
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:41,319
again this talk is really distilled out
my latest book liars and out liars

54
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:44,750
which copies are available over there

55
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:50,840
not many and

56
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,049
and its it is a security talk it is very
much a security talking to talk about

57
00:03:56,049 --> 00:03:58,840
secure society's role

58
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,579
in the enabling the security

59
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:08,540
that enable society it's about Russian
society

60
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,810
so unless why it's important a lot of
people write about

61
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,859
why trust is important i cud take that
as a given

62
00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:18,790
more interested in how society induces
it

63
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:23,200
you what is it that's going on in this
room

64
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,270
that we can be sure that nobody will

65
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:30,640
attack us or pickpocket us

66
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,910
would jump up grab our computers and
leave

67
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:37,569
make me we don't think a bit

68
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:41,620
blitz actually an interesting question
how

69
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:45,199
does society you security

70
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,560
to enable trust

71
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,300
and fundamentally to talk about group
interest versus self-interest

72
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,560
and how the group enforces its interest

73
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,800
on individuals in the group

74
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,810
I trust let's think about trust her
second atrocities a really car

75
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:06,880
complicated concepts nyhan

76
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,030
as a word it's very overloaded with many
meanings in like the word security

77
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:16,130
which has and showed a different number
than meanings trust also

78
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:19,630
has a lot of different meanings and I
think that speaks to

79
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:23,849
the richness of the concept and its
importance that the word is so

80
00:05:23,849 --> 00:05:29,729
overloaded with nuance they don't you
must can't use it without qualifying at

81
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:33,919
so it's either is up personal intimates
or trust

82
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,759
me when you say I trust a friend

83
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:42,550
you're not really speaking about their
actions you speaking about them as a

84
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,740
person

85
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,740
I trustee you

86
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,759
does that mean that means I you have
some general belief in general alliance

87
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:52,400
that you'll be

88
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,360
even some trustworthy manner and then I
know your intentions

89
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,520
I know who you are and I know that those
intentions will inform your actions

90
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:10,110
me it's a very personal former trust a
family member a friend a spouse

91
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:13,569
that's actually not what I'm talking
about here

92
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:19,300
make me this causes also a less intimate
in less personal former trust

93
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:25,449
when I trusted the taxi driver to take
me this hotel without cheating me

94
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:28,979
had no idea who this taxi driver was

95
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:32,530
the taxi driver might have been you know
a mass murderer by night

96
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:36,139
I actually didn't hear I trusted

97
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:39,470
that he would drive me from the airport

98
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:43,139
to this hotel with the meter on

99
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:47,479
that's it mightn't I don't know him
personally

100
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:51,080
I don't know was motivations but I can
still

101
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:56,569
trust his actions in that context

102
00:06:56,569 --> 00:07:00,240
I don't know if he wants to steal I just
know that he won't

103
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,849
right now with me and that's good enough

104
00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:07,889
now the son of former trust REIT you
think if it is lit like

105
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:11,259
confidence you could think I've the camp
drivers

106
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:15,690
trustworthiness more like compliance

107
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:22,580
you could think that this is reducing
trust a consistency or predictability

108
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,159
me at my idol go to the eight Inc

109
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:30,030
get off the plane go to the taxi cab
stand

110
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:36,530
and it's predictable Miami I should know
what's gonna happen

111
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:39,710
right now that's the that depends on
context right even if there was a

112
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:40,599
different city

113
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:45,889
we were in mogadishu I might not have
that same level of trust

114
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:50,139
so when people are trustworthy in this
way %uh the phrase a uses

115
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:55,569
is their cooperative they're cooperating
with whatever social norm we have

116
00:07:55,569 --> 00:07:59,680
the social norm between taxi driver and
passenger

117
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,940
the social norms in this room

118
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:08,240
made the social norms on the street when
we pass each other

119
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,340
made and that social norm is you know
you don't pick pocket each other is what

120
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,479
by an ATM not

121
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:16,610
or maybe say hello which depend on
culture

122
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:20,289
so in today's society we trust

123
00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:24,360
people in this way that she's not only
people we trust institutions

124
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,069
and we trust systems me thinking back to
that airplane

125
00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:31,169
it's not really that I trusted the
particular

126
00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:34,760
hi let to fly me to Amsterdam

127
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,840
it's like I trusted the airline that
produced him

128
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:43,640
right that KLM has whatever systems in
place to produce

129
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:48,080
reliable pilots I don't have to worry
about what those systems are

130
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,640
I trust that the airline will generate a
suitable pilot

131
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,630
for my plane in the morning

132
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:01,490
9 a.m. is not that I really trusted that
taxi driver

133
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:04,990
but the whole system that produced them

134
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:09,269
you know the licensing system in
whatever airport systems are in place in

135
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:12,519
the Meadery the meter

136
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:16,560
man I also trust the more abstract
systems they just yesterday I got some

137
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,200
euros at an ATM machine

138
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,450
kind of an amazing thing and I put a
card in the slot

139
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:26,089
push some buttons and I get local money

140
00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:29,570
trusting implicitly by some magical
system

141
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:34,870
that a similar amount will be debited my
cap United States

142
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:40,279
me I don't know how that system works an
I don't have to care

143
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:45,470
I have trust in it so that's trust that
cooperation

144
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:49,690
so all my my thesis is all complex
systems

145
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:55,390
require cooperation but or complex
ecosystems require cooperation

146
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:58,480
and and this is true for biological
systems

147
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:04,610
it's true for social systems an issue
for social Technol systems

148
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:07,940
also in any cooperative system

149
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:12,329
there is an alternative parasitical
strategy

150
00:10:12,329 --> 00:10:15,510
this is true for tapeworms your
digestive tract

151
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:21,730
this is true for thieves in a market
this issue for spammers an email

152
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:27,570
right this is true for companies to move
their profits of shorter Ave taxes

153
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:30,820
me any quick a history of cooperation

154
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:35,290
there's no alternative uncooperative
strategy

155
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:38,829
my among us sitting here politely
listening to me

156
00:10:38,829 --> 00:10:44,610
is your turn and strategy of picking
each other's pocket

157
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:48,029
and and using the can lodge in game
theory

158
00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:52,800
I'm gonna call these parasites defectors

159
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,790
and the fundamental model I use in the
book is the prisoner's dilemma

160
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:02,040
the cooperators versus defectors in and
I'm not gonna go into the details and I

161
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,440
hope most you know it

162
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,660
it's a it's a great thought experiment
from game theory

163
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:12,220
that illustrates the fundamental tension
can cooperating in defecting

164
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:16,500
and their real-world examples of it
everywhere it actually is a great model

165
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,160
to look at

166
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,339
at human conflict I

167
00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:24,459
so parasites can only survive

168
00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:28,139
if they're not to successful

169
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:32,389
made if the number of defectors gets two
large

170
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:36,579
society collapses read the whole system
collapses

171
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:39,730
it too many people steal then

172
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:43,209
you know there's no such thing as
property

173
00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:48,519
if you're it if the tape rooms in a jet
attract get too greedy

174
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:51,880
you die and they die

175
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,510
I too many thieves in a bizarre the
bizarre collapses and there are no more

176
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,930
thieves

177
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:00,720
the too much spam in email we all say
I'm emailing was too much span

178
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,120
in the in the spam is now useless

179
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:10,160
I did too many people don't pay their
taxes government stops functioning

180
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,980
need so these defectors should have some
natural limit

181
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:20,329
to how well they can do by the system
itself

182
00:12:20,329 --> 00:12:25,810
and there is this fundamental tension
can cooperating defecting

183
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:32,810
you think it is a tension between us as
individuals and ask literally society

184
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:39,220
name it so you know we might
individually want each other stuff

185
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:44,750
but we're all better off living in a
society with no one steals

186
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:49,250
rightly know we might individually want
to not pay our taxes

187
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:55,389
but we are all better off living in a
society where everybody does

188
00:12:55,389 --> 00:12:59,620
and and it's actually even weirder than
that

189
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:03,480
mean individually I want your stuff

190
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:08,510
might as a member of the group I wanna
live in a society where no one steals

191
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:13,980
but I'm better off that way but we think
about it I'm much better off

192
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,490
living inside with no one steals and
taking your stuff

193
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:22,329
my get the benefit of stealing and the
benefit of living in a theft free

194
00:13:22,329 --> 00:13:23,880
society

195
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:30,880
I but that's the dilemma it everyone
acts that way society collapses

196
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:37,010
and so so most of us realize this say
this is not

197
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:40,290
you when you think about the prisoner's
dilemma this is not something that is in

198
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,160
a sense

199
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,260
difficult most of us understand

200
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:48,860
that it's in our long-term best interest
not to act in our short term

201
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,430
self-interest

202
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,660
but button of course not everybody does
in all situations

203
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:59,019
and that's why we need security I that's
for security comes in

204
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:03,320
its security is how we keep the number
up defectors

205
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,160
down to some acceptable minimum

206
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,329
right security is how we induce
cooperation

207
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:17,329
which in turn induces trustworthiness
which in turn enables trust

208
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,170
night so security is what keeps

209
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:25,100
us in this room for not stealing from
each other

210
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:29,389
which induces us in this room to be
trustworthy

211
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:33,160
which makes us feel comfortable

212
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,790
right any why we feel trust in this room

213
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:43,199
why we why we don't have to think about
00 someone's gonna steal from me

214
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,029
but that we can just forget about it

215
00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:51,790
at in a note here on making no more ok
no claims about the moral stance of

216
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,519
defectors

217
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,389
and I think this is important when I'm
really talking about

218
00:14:57,389 --> 00:15:01,149
is how groups in force norms

219
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:05,550
and this dynamic works for a community
if citizens

220
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:10,399
made you or this room the community of
people at this conference

221
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,029
it also works for a community of
criminals who trying to enforce some

222
00:15:15,029 --> 00:15:18,079
criminal code on their members

223
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:23,470
right and effecting might be talking to
the police

224
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:26,750
meter so that so the mechanisms are not

225
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,910
based on some abstract moral absolutes

226
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:35,329
they're really about the group in the
group norms

227
00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:39,720
so the phrase I use

228
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,130
to talk about the mechanisms by which

229
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:46,500
we as a group induce cooperation

230
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:52,300
I call societal pressures and I like
this term because it really easy really

231
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,110
are pressures

232
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:59,130
me they're not absolutes but there are
ways we

233
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:03,190
knowledge each other not just
individually

234
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:06,670
to behave cooperatively and

235
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:10,149
you know like any you know real
pressures they don't completely

236
00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:11,949
eliminate defectors from the goal

237
00:16:11,949 --> 00:16:16,649
isn't to have a society where crime is
your own when I'll talk about that later

238
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:21,910
the coal is to get defection down to
some manageable number

239
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:25,550
that's low enough that we all feel

240
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:28,649
that we all can trust

241
00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:32,920
so therefore different types a side of
pressures and I go through Minturn

242
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:37,839
that we used to induce cooperation %uh
the first one is morals

243
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,720
and by morals I mean something very
general

244
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,139
I mean anything that in our own heads

245
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:51,410
that induces cooperation pay most of us
don't steal not because it's illegal but

246
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,290
because

247
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:57,009
we know what's wrong we feel bad if we
do

248
00:16:57,009 --> 00:17:00,800
we feel guilty

249
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,770
you know we we we we don't want you and

250
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:09,800
in this is true for a lot love
cooperation

251
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:14,659
made the majority of our cooperative
behavior comes because we want to do it

252
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:14,959
because

253
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,520
in our head we we don't we want to do
right we want and don't want to do wrong

254
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,150
however we define that right some that
can be cultural summer that there'll be

255
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:27,690
a native some great research on the
neuroscience have morals

256
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:32,000
on how much of this is is inside our
haiti is

257
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,410
is evolutionarily inside our heads and
how much is imposed from society

258
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:41,730
maybe can see examples from other
species up

259
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:45,040
the to touch morals the second

260
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:49,000
type his reputation and by reputation

261
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,760
I mean also very generally anything that
involves what other people think of our

262
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,440
actions

263
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,990
this is a very different in a much
stronger site

264
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:03,940
seidl pressure how others respond to our
actions

265
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:07,280
and it's very basically we get praised
for good behavior

266
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,530
and we get snubbed for bad behavior

267
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:15,920
and this control but this probably
controls a lot of cooperation

268
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,200
in this community you know what

269
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,220
what the rest of us will think about us
if we do something that is

270
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:28,280
def it as uncooperative we defect if we
act like a parasite

271
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,420
on this community

272
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:35,150
and its informal I do you know if I have
a friend over to visit the steals my

273
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,160
sweater I'm not gonna call the police

274
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:41,430
should not invite him over again

275
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:46,020
right you know that informal retribution

276
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:51,000
is he is how reputational pressures work

277
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,110
so these to sidle pressures are very old

278
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:57,680
right morals reputation there's all the
society

279
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:01,430
there is old is our species

280
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:05,940
we are there are a number researchers
who are

281
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:09,380
who look at at language as being
developed

282
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,400
in part for this right gossip

283
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,210
is away %uh enhancing reputational
systems

284
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:21,670
be able to give information about each
other to each other

285
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:25,080
in a lotta cases this stuff is all that
humanity

286
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,300
make you can see him morals and
reputation

287
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:32,550
working in other primates and other
mammals

288
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:39,550
you can see this is a large samples %uh
both have both of these

289
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:44,490
someone cell phone

290
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:49,430
me so so this this is really are are
primitive societal

291
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:52,900
toolbox

292
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:57,120
made this is you and this is what we
used

293
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,420
as as primitive small communities and
they can be very powerful

294
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:08,310
maybe the the extreme attribution for
reputation is ostracism

295
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:11,700
make moving someone from the community

296
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,410
and and it's an interesting we we as
humans are

297
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:19,310
are are somewhat unique in this rainy
you can see other primates

298
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:23,120
act on reputation information me you see
a

299
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,610
experiments the chimpanzees we were
based on what they know about each other

300
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:29,340
they will behave differently

301
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:34,380
by humans are the only species that can
transfer reputation information

302
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:38,710
I can tell you about him

303
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:43,040
no one else does that humans are unique
in that

304
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:47,440
and that is a huge different to and
there are people who think that language

305
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,540
was developed

306
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:53,710
mostly because of that that that was the
driving force behind a language

307
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,220
development

308
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:00,040
me but with those two malls reputation
work but they don't scale

309
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,670
but the problem is society gets bigger
more complex

310
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:08,460
and those two alone aren't enough to
ensure cooperation

311
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:12,430
right so we have two more so I'll
pressures we have laws that farmers

312
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,470
reputation

313
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:18,110
and technologies that also induce
security

314
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:22,840
I so my third type aside a pressure is
institutions laws

315
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,890
because institutions have rules they are
effectively

316
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:33,890
norms that have been coat if I'd and
whose enforcement has been delegated

317
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,310
me to woo so we as a group have

318
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:42,600
designated those people to enforce the
norms I love

319
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,720
not stealing or not speeding on the
highway to whatever laws

320
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,060
you want to talk about

321
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:53,440
whenever you have a variety of
institutional pressures

322
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,530
that induce people to behave according
to the group norms

323
00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:02,510
in the whole field the criminology fits
your

324
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:06,280
right and lastly we have security
systems wat you met you know actual

325
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,220
mechanisms designed

326
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,550
to induce cooperation I prevent
defection

327
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:15,900
induced Ross compel compliance so with
it whatever mechanism you're looking at

328
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,390
it

329
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:21,310
you know it was a door locks and tall
fences or alarm systems are forensic an

330
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,810
audit systems

331
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:27,020
mitigation recovery systems visits or a
complex summer them work before the

332
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:31,160
facts on the market after somebody turns
a fact

333
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:35,920
made some don't the you can really map
these out

334
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,820
in a pretty complex way

335
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:44,300
and all them work together

336
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:48,130
Miami ndau dunno take the the easy
example stealing

337
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:51,640
most a bus on stealing cuz we know it's
wrong

338
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,280
summers are stealing cuz what are
friends will think about us

339
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,300
by the rest of us aren't stealing
because it's illegal to go to jail

340
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:05,970
and for people that those three things
don't prevent we have door locks

341
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:09,450
and the interesting thing i think is
really interesting that

342
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:14,000
our community which spends its
pretensions entire time in this little

343
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,240
piece

344
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:21,820
the technical security measures were
largely ignoring everything else

345
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:28,260
so often are secure discussions are
extremely narrow

346
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:31,970
there were not really looking at the
full range

347
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:35,730
I love mechanisms love so I don't
pressures

348
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:42,730
that we could bring to bear on a
cooperation problem on a trust issue

349
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:48,120
okay to the way we think about it is
that individuals are are making this

350
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,370
cooperate defect decision

351
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:55,960
my chest you wish I not steal I'm under
citing right now

352
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:00,450
imma about his side based on you know
whatever criteria I have

353
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:07,170
the societal pressures are away for
society to put its finger on the scales

354
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:12,290
made they make it more beneficial for me
to cooperate

355
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:15,880
and less beneficial and it should have
and and less but there's a limited

356
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,350
effect

357
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:24,260
and how well they work depends a lot on
context

358
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:28,140
thank you let me give one example a
publisher said this early I'm is in need

359
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,070
experiment

360
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:32,340
and it talks about the power
reputational

361
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:36,050
a pressure says experiment done at a

362
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:40,500
the an office coffee machine and will
cost me coffee machine worked as you

363
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,570
take up a coffee

364
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:45,420
and you drop you know queen in the box
with however

365
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:50,090
Weber coffee cost any such thing about
how this works to cooperate means

366
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:55,240
you pay for your coffee to defect means
you take the coffee and don't pay

367
00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:00,070
thank so you can measure cooperation
right to me if you know how much coffee

368
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:03,120
you have the incentive money you have
the end of the day

369
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,610
you actually can figure out what
percentage of people who operates

370
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:11,070
actually could figure out so what
percentage of the total amount you

371
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:14,000
should have you do have you don't
actually know if it's

372
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,910
more people paying less or fewer people
paying the whole amount

373
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:22,370
so the experiment is dead is a great
piece a research is they put a sign

374
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:27,580
behind the coffee machine that had a
picture of a pay rise

375
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:30,660
and they found that the cooperation rate

376
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:34,550
increased dramatically

377
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:38,620
that when people just thought that
someone might be looking they see a pay

378
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,460
rise

379
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:45,090
they actually paid more for their coffee
made the control was a picture of a

380
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:51,970
a bunch of flowers that's how powerful

381
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:58,970
my our need for you know a good
reputation is

382
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:03,540
try I'd that as great as you a great
experiment so anyway so so

383
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:07,390
mate the people are making this
cooperate effect the session

384
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:12,000
society is using pressures to pose
fingers on the scale

385
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,090
and we're trying to find this

386
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:18,940
optimal balance between cooperation
defectors

387
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:22,890
it's not zero defectors

388
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:28,410
may have been too many defectors of
course is expensive

389
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:32,120
and but having too many cooperate it is
also expensive cuz you spending more

390
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,640
money on security

391
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:39,500
made so there is as natural level I
didn't know you know a natural crime

392
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,700
rate do not know the crime at issue in
Amsterdam

393
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:48,700
but you know it's not zero it some low
amount that's low enough that we're all

394
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:55,380
you feel trusting in a role feel safe
walking the streets

395
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:00,060
and societal pressures allow society to
scale

396
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:03,110
mean these is you know these are the
mechanisms

397
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:07,380
by which side he was allowed to grow by
all those primitive systems are enough

398
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,860
for small communities

399
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:15,120
but larger communities require
delegation and more formalism

400
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,360
May and global systems require you know

401
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:25,210
even stronger global laws and and
large-scale secure technologies

402
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:29,870
so this I way at looking at society I
think has strong explanatory power

403
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:33,670
and in the book I talk about this in
relation to terrorism

404
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:37,300
the financial crisis organized crime
Internet crime

405
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:40,660
to a bunch of other things now

406
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:44,930
II you have to understand I'm civil fine
greatly here

407
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:50,270
this is actually all very complicated

408
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:54,360
night you know in in my book i I'm
drawing from

409
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:59,750
psychology at economics and game theory
evolutionary biology

410
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:03,150
neuroscience philosophy

411
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:07,770
on my anthropology archaeology history
political science laws will be the

412
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,190
theology

413
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:13,360
it when the hard things about writing
this was to figure out the back on

414
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,450
reserve my topic

415
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:20,990
because this quickly flows into a lot a
different disciplines

416
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:24,800
and it could have been our a huge in and
and an interesting book

417
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:29,420
I didn't you put down trees on it but
there's a lotta places to take this

418
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,590
research

419
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:33,890
and serve you know give you a few them

420
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:37,950
yeah I've been talking about
self-interest persons group interest

421
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:44,440
but it's really a simplification often
there are many competing interests

422
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,640
made your interest as an employee of a
company versus your interest is a member

423
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,170
of society

424
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:55,630
as an example for and different groups
will use

425
00:28:55,630 --> 00:29:00,270
societal pressures to further their own
group interest

426
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:03,910
with their different aspects of
ourselves you know that we can be in

427
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:08,410
conflict with each other

428
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:11,470
me the interaction between morality in
law RRR

429
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:14,900
arse really a separate topic and very
interesting

430
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:18,760
you how each of these different pressure
scale

431
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:23,430
is important and for us living a
technological world

432
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:28,560
how technology helps make them scale

433
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:32,420
by the effect a group decision making as
other complication

434
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:35,770
a lot of these cooperate defect
decisions are made by individuals are

435
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:38,860
made by groups

436
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:43,310
by an organization accompany decides

437
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:48,000
and the dynamics a group decision making
is is real important

438
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,140
and how this plays out common group and
I have a separate chapter on

439
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:55,710
on organizations another chapter on
corporations

440
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:59,470
another chapter on government
institutions

441
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:02,660
right there a lot of specific dynamics
that play out

442
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:05,770
in those different sorts a group

443
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:12,240
man again how this scale society gets
larger and more complex

444
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,020
I mention this is a earlier but what
happens when the defectors are in the

445
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,580
right

446
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:21,590
me how does this work with complete with
police informants

447
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:28,260
or conscientious objectors to military
action or civil disobedience

448
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:32,930
right now I can spend as with hours on
this but but I I'm not

449
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:37,590
a lot of it in the book and and you know
lighting a lot that you really

450
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:41,650
is a separate topic what I wanna talk
about here on out I'll

451
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:45,430
do a little bit more and then and then
you leave much time for questions

452
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:49,640
is to talk about the thanks to
technology possessed technologists

453
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:53,800
how technology changes things is real
important

454
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,530
to basically technology allow societies

455
00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:01,540
scale technology allows

456
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:06,490
Arctic our society to get bigger and
scale effects I'll pressures in a lot of

457
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,700
different ways

458
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:13,620
right there are more people there's more
complexity

459
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:19,620
there are new social systems there are
new security systems

460
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:24,290
there's increased technological
intensity

461
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:28,220
there's increased frequency is increased
distance

462
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:32,360
and you can sort of see some that stuff
anything about the Internet

463
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:37,300
by the Internet allows crime to happen
across greater geographical area

464
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:41,630
my automation you think of some kind of
have automated hacking tools

465
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:46,780
increases frequency make new social
systems like Facebook

466
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:50,040
also change things increase complexity

467
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:54,160
me a lot exam was a complex effecting
security more people wait the more

468
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,860
people get on the internet

469
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:59,800
the more dangers there are just because
the scale

470
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:05,840
meet you should imagine how all those
things affect societal pressures

471
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:10,200
but you know so the meta point is if you
think about

472
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,630
societal pressures as resulting in some

473
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:17,660
balance between cooperation defectors

474
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:22,410
technological advances upset that
balance

475
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:26,960
right we have some balance out banking
fraud that we're happy with

476
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,830
some intense the internet thanks go on
the internet and now

477
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:35,740
the balance is changed i'd is now more
banking fraud because there's a new

478
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:39,600
new attack vector know we have

479
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:44,030
a murder rate that we're happy with and
someone invents a gun

480
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:49,080
and suddenly the murder rate increases

481
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,060
night or this some crime rate that's all
right and then someone invents

482
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:54,470
fingerprint technology

483
00:32:54,470 --> 00:33:00,400
man that upsets the in general new
technologies upset this balance

484
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:05,080
and in response rate society has to
rebalance

485
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:09,390
we have some new societal pressures you
know maybe some new laws are some

486
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:12,530
some new technologies maybe there's some
group norm

487
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:19,530
the gets out reflected in in the
reputational pressures

488
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:22,950
now this is an iterative process right
you know this is not a

489
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:26,350
a scientific process and it's hard to
get this right but

490
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:31,780
you know this is how we get stability in
society

491
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:35,760
me this is how society manages to remain
stable

492
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,320
even as technologies increasing even as

493
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:42,550
things change

494
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:49,240
the problem is that attackers have a
natural advantage

495
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:53,440
me that in this a balancing in
rebalancing

496
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,680
attackers have the upper hand

497
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,480
right you know they can make you sick
innovations faster is what's a good

498
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,690
example %ah

499
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:04,830
a summoned into a motor car and police
say

500
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:07,950
know that's an interesting idea and they

501
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:11,589
uniform exploratory committee decide
whether they should buy a motor car

502
00:34:11,589 --> 00:34:15,710
and they produce an RFP and they go out
for bids may get proposals laid out

503
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,579
proposals

504
00:34:16,579 --> 00:34:20,470
they procure the car and they have a
training program in the figure out how

505
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:22,020
to use the car

506
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:27,329
meanwhile the a the criminal says all
look a new getaway vehicle

507
00:34:27,329 --> 00:34:30,630
man and can very quickly

508
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:34,630
use a car in in in whatever crimes is
committing

509
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:38,630
we sure that thats same thing on the
Internet

510
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:41,889
yet pre-purchase as soon as

511
00:34:41,889 --> 00:34:46,840
internet commerce appear you we saw a
new breed of cyber criminal

512
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:50,510
was very quick to take advantage of it
to steal stuff

513
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:56,520
meanwhile the police who are like you
know train on Agatha Christie novels

514
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:00,270
you know took what five to seven years
to figure out

515
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:04,650
what Internet crime look like and how
you could possibly

516
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:08,030
defend against

517
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:12,900
met you have that kinda mismatch

518
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:17,360
between attacker and defender now and
and because of that

519
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,610
you know i i you're always gonna have

520
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:24,890
that what I usually when I call this a
security gap

521
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:29,320
made between what the defenders can do
and with the attackers can do

522
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:34,690
and and and the result is a natural
advantage for attackers

523
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:38,480
and if you think about I give a bunch
examples in the book that that

524
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,440
the security gap is greater if there's
more technology

525
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:47,350
and its greater in times of rapid
technological and social change

526
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:53,210
by attackers get more but advantage and
in our society right now there is more

527
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:55,020
technology never before

528
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:58,310
and we're living in a time I love

529
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:01,690
%uh the greatest technological and
social change

530
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:06,250
than we've ever seen ever before so
we're now living in a world

531
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:10,670
where the security gap is the greatest

532
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:14,250
my this means it's going to be hard to
get

533
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:19,600
societal pressures right

534
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,630
this is actually going to be a hard
problem I

535
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:25,760
recently come to the belief that

536
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,950
our best hope is is not to get ahead at
the attackers

537
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:34,190
but to be able to react faster and
useful to see this mean

538
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:38,100
starting to rise in the security
community I've heard it called

539
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:42,790
agile security or reactive security

540
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:47,390
Orleans security with the idea that we
can't

541
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:51,720
predict what the attacker will do next
but the best thing we can do

542
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:56,470
is notice what they do and respond
quickly

543
00:36:56,470 --> 00:37:00,330
that we can mean to maintain security
that way

544
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:07,330
and I think that is a the result I love
this is so fundamental realization

545
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,380
that we're not going to close the
security gap to the best thing we can do

546
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,190
is a

547
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:16,060
is react to it

548
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:19,980
mayor ed but you know had technology
isn't all bad I technology

549
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:24,660
help societal pressure scale to

550
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:29,460
anything goes a the no I don't know
what's a good example Ian

551
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:33,760
in historically if you want to be alone
in a bank loan you'd go to a bank with

552
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,590
the bank

553
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:40,440
officer new UN they would give you a
loan or not depending on your reputation

554
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,780
me perfectly reasonable reputational Bay
security system

555
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:49,580
you now what happens you know at least
in the US as ever and has a credit score

556
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:52,800
they go into a random bank anywhere in
the country

557
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,240
and they get a loan based on their
credit score that credit score

558
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,570
is a technologically enhanced

559
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:02,610
reputational system now you complain
about

560
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:06,850
how it doesn't working I mean problems
with it but it allows

561
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:11,430
the banking system to scale nationally
and even globally

562
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:15,760
make EVA's reputation the visa feedback
system is another great example

563
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,210
a reputational Bay security system

564
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:24,700
night you can you can argue and and i've
seen the not made in this way

565
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:28,390
but I've seen historians argue that
writing

566
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:34,420
I did that the technology overwriting is
a mechanism for scaling moral pressure

567
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:37,920
be able to take your religious and
ethical text

568
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:44,210
and write them down and transfer them
from individual to individual that way

569
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:47,720
is away to scale that

570
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:53,040
by all sorts of technologies held by
institutional pressures helped Los scale

571
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:59,640
and better technologies mean certainly
scale also scale

572
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:03,530
writes a soldier one final problem I
hinted at this earlier

573
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:07,480
right is that society isn't always right

574
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:12,590
you lot of what I'm talking about are
how group in force their norms and

575
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:14,670
individuals in the group

576
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:19,120
make group interest versus
self-interests the implicit assumption

577
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,710
is that the group is correct

578
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:25,750
but that's not necessarily true

579
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:32,000
with the group could be enforcing a
social norm like slavery

580
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,780
I or torture I or you're not giving
women the vote

581
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:42,060
and those who oppose that are the
defectors

582
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:45,690
but are the ones breaking the norms

583
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:49,690
are the ones who society punishes but
sometimes

584
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:55,790
in the end they are morally right

585
00:39:55,790 --> 00:40:02,790
night so this process is also the
mechanism for social change

586
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:10,180
a this is how society grows through
defectors

587
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:13,490
right so stock up a final points Peyton

588
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:17,150
no matter how much societal pressure you
deploy

589
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:20,500
bill always be defectors are you cannot

590
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:24,360
get the defection rate down to zero

591
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:29,580
it's just too expensive and diminishing
returns the two great

592
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:33,930
made to increase societal pressure isn't
always worth it

593
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:39,110
but more police isn't always a good idea

594
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:45,620
you know more people badging at this
conference isn't always a good idea

595
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:50,370
made societal pressures actually prevent
cooperation to

596
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:53,540
because whenever you have a system to
punish defectors

597
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:56,770
they're always gonna be false alarms

598
00:40:56,770 --> 00:41:00,240
iTunes you mistakenly punish the
innocent and those false alarms have an

599
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,550
effect

600
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:08,600
we all defect at some times regarding
some things

601
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:13,500
nobody is a hundred percent to cooperate

602
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,610
and they're a good defectors and they're
bad defectors

603
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:20,790
and we can't always tell the difference

604
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:23,910
and lastly and most importantly society

605
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:27,810
needs defectors made the group benefits

606
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:33,350
from the fact that some us within the
group do not follow the group norms

607
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:38,470
and this is how we get social change

608
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:42,770
so that's what I have prepared I'm I'm
happy take questions

609
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:45,890
first on this topic and then on any
topic you know there's always lots of

610
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:47,820
interesting questions accomplices like
this

611
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:53,010
I I didn't bring a box of books that
they're selling at the

612
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:56,150
at the table over there I do have

613
00:41:56,150 --> 00:42:00,270
book Flyers this is thinner than the
normal book The

614
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:03,490
that you can the benefit is it's free
the

615
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:07,620
the problem is this far fewer words so
as a stack there in a stack

616
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:11,730
there at the end of the and the talking
grab one

617
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:15,110
so are there any questions

618
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:18,760
yes down here I scrapbook all right
we're gonna try to

619
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:22,640
run a microphone around questions good
morning thank you for you talk

620
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,820
I'm I think to ask what do you think
about the

621
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:29,090
security industrial complex

622
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:33,020
there's a large lobby of people who earn
lots of money

623
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:36,310
to put pressure on petitions

624
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:39,610
to spend more money on

625
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:43,650
well systems that that may constitute
civilian society

626
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:46,750
a bar societies in in your opinion

627
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:49,850
United States so I i've no argue that
mean they're they're

628
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:54,760
is definitely certainly in the US and
Europe a very strong lobbying group the

629
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:58,020
in several mechanisms right there is the
the group lobbying

630
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:01,330
are to make it all scared a cyberwar to

631
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:04,530
induce more spending their there's the

632
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:08,920
no groups that are inducing spending in
surveillance

633
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:12,460
you know the technologies is lobbying
group for airline security

634
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:16,980
now on I'm certainly not happy about it
I i think there's a lot of

635
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:22,210
other extraordinary waste and abuse and
Lhasa liberties because these groups

636
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:27,160
it is a very real problem and I'm not
sure we have a good solution

637
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:30,480
but you know I've and I no disagreement
with high with your calculation the

638
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,880
problem

639
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:34,930
show you do you have no on sir any any

640
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:38,200
you like and let me let me know you like
me what's the force anything you can do

641
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,630
to solve the problem though God I wish I
had an answer like

642
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:43,850
if FN ACLU and in Holland we have
similar groups

643
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:47,650
that's the only answer I don't know if
it's the only if the only and it's kind

644
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:48,950
of crap answer

645
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:53,380
up at I i don't have a good answer I
mean this

646
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:56,500
this is a day a major societal problem

647
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,510
and yes it's something that that you
know

648
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:02,760
I think we need to fight a every
opportunity we can

649
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:06,160
it's kind of a losing battle writing you
know I'd I try to fight this much

650
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,020
possible I'm not doing that great

651
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:14,900
so no I wish I had a better answer for
you thank you

652
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:18,780
what's this hands over there as hand
back their

653
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:22,330
you're in charge you you you you you run
it from person to person

654
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:25,970
I'm just reggaeton remix around the
world

655
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:29,010
you talk about that four forces that

656
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:32,150
and force good behavior

657
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:35,290
and an hour work feel is mainly

658
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:39,320
seems to be mainly concentrate its about
fourth force

659
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:42,570
mmm what could we do

660
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:45,580
to make those first three forces

661
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:49,690
be more recognized by regulatory bodies

662
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:54,000
yeah I'm thats it's a good people that
let us it's a good question I'm not sure

663
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,080
the regulatory bodies but but certainly
I think we should use the morning that

664
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:57,420
that

665
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:00,990
example the experiment with the pair
behind the coffee machine

666
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:05,480
is a great example if I put a pair I is
on a banking website that means to me

667
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:06,930
less banking fraud

668
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:12,510
maybe someone should run someone should
run the experiment

669
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:15,610
maybe I'm yeah I think about but

670
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:21,400
yday and yday feedback is a purely
reputational system to reduce fraud

671
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:25,260
I'd like it if our community which
started thinking

672
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:29,420
more creatively about ways we can
leverage

673
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:33,850
our moral pressures reputational
pressure institutional pressures

674
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:38,660
in in what we do because I think we're
missing quite a lot

675
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:42,960
up pieces to a security tool box know
how to get them recognized by regulatory

676
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,870
body is another issue I the night they
think they're to demonstrate

677
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:47,370
effectiveness

678
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:53,230
but I do think there's a lot of of
things we can do

679
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:57,280
you know there's I'm experiments done in
banking fraud

680
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:01,890
up that demonstrated that if

681
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:06,700
the criminalists induced to think up his
victim as a person

682
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:10,750
is less likely to commit the crime which
is there some way

683
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:14,640
we can personalize transactions

684
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:18,280
in a way that reduces fraudulent
transactions is great

685
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:23,160
research in behavior psychology on a lot
of these topics

686
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:26,770
and and you know we've largely not pay
attention to them

687
00:46:26,770 --> 00:46:30,050
because we're let's face it we're
technologists and we want to come up

688
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:32,070
with a clever crypto protocol

689
00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:36,550
that solves the problem yeah and that's
all well and good

690
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:41,290
but I I kinda wanna so looking at these
other ways

691
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:44,650
and when the weather the first step
sister recognize

692
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:47,850
that the whole notion of solve the
problem

693
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:50,950
is the wrong way to think about it

694
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:54,150
because we're never gonna solve the
problem we're just going to

695
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:59,790
reduce the incidence love defection to
some manageable rate

696
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:03,460
Ryan whether we do that via a firewall

697
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:06,630
we do that via social shaming

698
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:13,300
you that's going to depend on the
details of what we're trying to solve

699
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:16,810
alright so where's my phone now got a
question at the back there

700
00:47:16,810 --> 00:47:22,070
and get a raise your hands are no we r
LA or

701
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:25,120
and yes you coming from up there so I
like answered

702
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:28,300
%uh and I'm are all the way around now
anyway

703
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:32,150
and I think differently or extender is
no difference between

704
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:35,540
moral and reputational based am

705
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:39,210
pressure just anybody mater

706
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:42,290
number of observers Gaza

707
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:45,970
Pinguino morals because the we learned

708
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:51,460
might harm our reputation you know that
that's seen it yet it's an argument and

709
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:54,980
and this is getting into heavy fossil
the that I'd die cut a slot in the book

710
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:55,810
a little bit

711
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:59,810
but you can make that argument it does
seem like when you look at the

712
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:02,030
neuroscience of the brain

713
00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:05,070
that their is a difference but since
both

714
00:48:05,070 --> 00:48:09,750
evolved simultaneously both are very
interrelated

715
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:12,990
you can argue I think it's a reach
logging in

716
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:16,840
that it that you can't separate them out
I separate them out

717
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:20,440
primarily as a mechanical exercise

718
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:23,710
because the way they operate from a
security perspective

719
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:27,940
are a little bit different but yes to
perfectly reasonable argument to say

720
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:31,230
that hate there really two aspects the
same thing you

721
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:34,340
you philosophically you can pull them
apart

722
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:38,710
and me and they did there's a lot of
literature that supports that argument

723
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:41,920
delage that supports the other argument
and make

724
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,130
that itself is oh actually a good book
to write my wish somebody would write it

725
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:49,950
it wouldn't be me because that is much
more of a psychological neuroscience and

726
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:51,369
philosophical discussion

727
00:48:51,369 --> 00:48:55,080
buddy I me you make a very valid point
and I don't

728
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:58,920
II don't necessarily disagree I just
chose in the book

729
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:02,020
to separate them out I

730
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:07,060
thank you other two microphone there
three microphones

731
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:10,470
this can get dangerous a high

732
00:49:10,470 --> 00:49:14,540
I am so basically my question is

733
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:19,119
every time they read a book a they are
mostly very absolute east and the

734
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:22,360
being that with the road any is like

735
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:26,580
basically global when on numbers are
sometimes different so

736
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:30,650
I wanna know I if you look into

737
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:34,640
like global society or just ok since a
society

738
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:38,860
because you know we're population if
he's its route were quite

739
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:42,580
I if you take China Russia yeah you have
was it publishes a

740
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:45,610
that's basically right I into a few
cover

741
00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:49,170
in your book let's all say to you is
like size century to

742
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:53,930
one specific citing show it its with the
principles I talk about

743
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:57,960
I think our are more universal how they
are instantiated is very local men

744
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:58,860
looking at

745
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:03,460
the notion of a group in group interest
and the group sizes

746
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:07,690
are different depending on the issue and
depending on the age

747
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:12,060
me there than natural sizeof our
communities based on technology

748
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:15,930
whether their villages or towns or
cities or countries or

749
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:19,320
or confidence or or global so

750
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:23,070
you know there are very different group
sizes

751
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:26,619
and a lot of the mechanism to talk about

752
00:50:26,619 --> 00:50:30,180
RR this the same regardless of size

753
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:34,950
the instantiate differently I certainly
there a lot of cultural differences

754
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:38,110
in groups which i think is extremely
important

755
00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:41,410
that when you look at group norms

756
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:44,950
you whether you're living in the United
States or living in

757
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:49,530
Japan me there's very different group
norms

758
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:55,520
in very different definitions of what
constitutes cooperative behavior

759
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:59,610
so I i move around in group size

760
00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:03,170
in the book because I'm trying to tease
out

761
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:06,900
more universal positions but there's a
lot at detail

762
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:13,170
in group specifics that that that really
make a difference

763
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:16,660
okay I think we have time for one more
question right person in charge a

764
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:20,090
question says one more how bout up

765
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:23,380
oh okay UN I have the my excitement you
are the less pressure

766
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:27,080
you'll be judged by your peers on the
quality of your question

767
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:31,550
up not to put any pressure on you mind
you

768
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:36,310
a.m. brother brown from buffalo new york
thanks for fascinating

769
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:40,430
lecture my question is regarding the
other side of the coin to security that

770
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:41,670
is privacy

771
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:45,480
and %uh the second part of the question
is like to have your views

772
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:48,850
the disc with regard to the senior
citizen community through the what

773
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:52,130
the senior citizens enders privacy

774
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:55,740
privacy and so mean took

775
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:58,950
I mean that's an extremely complex talk
I bring a lot

776
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:02,420
about about privacy your privacy i

777
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:07,320
I maintain is a a is a very important
social good

778
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:11,210
that it is something that is essential
to to all societies

779
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:15,660
that I on the other hand it is also very
contextual

780
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:19,820
and there are cultural norms with regard
to privacy

781
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:23,590
there are generational norms with regard
to privacy

782
00:52:23,590 --> 00:52:27,530
and we're living in a world right now
love

783
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:32,300
%uh rapid changing privacy norms

784
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:36,030
yet might my main fear and worry

785
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:39,550
is that a lot of these changes are being

786
00:52:39,550 --> 00:52:44,970
orchestrated by companies that have a
financial interest

787
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:50,990
in controlling what the norms are know
so easy example is Facebook

788
00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:55,760
my facebook makes money by you having
less privacy

789
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:00,710
so they are pushing social changes where
less privacy is a is expected

790
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:04,780
and I think that's very dangerous I I
don't know for the answer the question I

791
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:07,530
feel feel like I me as I start this
topic I'll

792
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:11,340
I won't come up for air from forty
minutes some a little loath to get into

793
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:12,110
it

794
00:53:12,110 --> 00:53:17,910
but I I'd ideal you know there's a lot
of the above bad means about privacy

795
00:53:17,910 --> 00:53:22,369
going around our community that like
young people don't care about privacy

796
00:53:22,369 --> 00:53:26,830
which question you know if you think
that per second you know is bullshit

797
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:30,400
you ask any young person they care a lot
about privacy

798
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:35,830
but what's going on is our our societal
debates about privacy

799
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:40,360
RR now has lobbyists effectively

800
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:45,210
made for profit entities that are trying
to

801
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:48,230
trying to manipulate the debate

802
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:52,970
and I think we know we have we have a
chance I love getting it badly wrong

803
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:56,960
because that you know on the other hand
these are all short term changes mean

804
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:57,830
you know the

805
00:53:57,830 --> 00:54:01,170
we're living in a world where things are
changing so fast

806
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:05,080
you fast-forward ten twenty years I
think we're likely to get it right

807
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:09,160
because privacy is valued even though
you can be my I think about it

808
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:14,020
but its prolly gonna take that long
because the generational issues

809
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:18,000
because the difficulty understanding
technology that we will need people who

810
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,250
are born into this these technologies

811
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:25,390
to figure out what the right balance is

812
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:30,230
lead so that's I may get to stay in the
know I just want to thank coach R you

813
