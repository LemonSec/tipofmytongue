Google Tiger you're doing

7
00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:28,310
yakking about the program twice cuz with
the first one on acix

8
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,399
last month but this time with additional
box

9
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:37,870
twice so I'm Zuk

10
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:42,030
on undersea Imperium innovates

11
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:47,750
security firms try to take the

12
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,110
security and changes to make

13
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:54,320
secure place uses the

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,460
hours ago 9

15
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:03,670
to see still I was

16
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:09,619
typical size I'm not in we have actually
very good security

17
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:14,049
stuff coming ahead for France keep the
clothes

18
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:19,100
interests you can follow me on twitter

22
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,670
i'm looking security industry for them
it's yours

23
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:43,930
today working the security consulting
company

24
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:47,659
have it is one of their biggest tech
companies in his them

25
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:54,060
the main job is whether plication
penetration test

26
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,810
has found a lots of bugs in the popular
website for them

27
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,770
critical reliability in people that the
army to

28
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,960
getting access to any funeral for the
both they pretty is this

29
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,989
it today we're going to show you but
feeling look as though the SIS

30
00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:15,600
it we want to show you how any of you
can find this kind of bikes

31
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,160
you just need a creative mind

32
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,730
to find this kind of both and you can
follow me

33
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:26,390
on Twitter in the much liquor that'll

34
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:31,269
so either a

35
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:34,440
ok earlier today's make you think
difference

36
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,970
let's say you're scanning some kind of
the backbone the program the usual

37
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:44,080
apps the usual programs to scan website

38
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,180
you would probably not find anything
because

39
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,500
30 other people do that already internal
teams

40
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,989
did the same listings so you have to
check with your methods

41
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:59,920
your your do different stuff the
program's gonna do automatically

42
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,060
so the more manual you go inspection its

43
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,110
matters be able to find more stuff first
doing overview of

44
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:11,549
lubrication abilities will

45
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:14,980
now targets are targeting this
presentation would be

46
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,900
Google Monte program after dot

47
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,070
wield know your enemy so will spy on the
enemy

48
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,380
you'll see how we get more information
about

49
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:30,590
how to find real boxes some basic
intelligence

50
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:35,239
we can use to find the next spot which
is

51
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:39,540
weak spots once we find weak spots will
try to repeat those

52
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,540
and tried to do it repeated over under
services

53
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,890
which will have the same boxing classes
box

54
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:50,000
I will try to do as many them was as
possible

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,209
in our assessment of this moment to
program the phone

56
00:03:56,209 --> 00:04:01,150
total more than 100 box must've weren't
critical

57
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,410
but there are some were very critical
that can affect

58
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:08,019
any in each one of you directly and
without your

59
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:12,359
acceptance so

60
00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:15,650
reasons for bug bounty program so you
first

61
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:20,549
the the money you get paid for doing
resurgent

62
00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:24,930
defenders giving you some kind of basic
money

63
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,220
for finding those abilities

64
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:34,199
the second one is credits when you find
a bar bill T

65
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,889
you refer to them you get credit from
the vendor you get the credit

66
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:43,820
page again Google whole fame you get
with Monte

67
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:47,970
program you get there is a is reasonable
overs

68
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:52,430
yes the creates but

69
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:57,080
you know what credit is not really
interesting because and money's not

70
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,740
really interesting because they don't
think much for those books

71
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:03,699
they pay for a web application box 500
bucks

72
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:07,860
which is considered a good amount to
3,000 box

73
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,139
in the black market for example

74
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:15,190
you can probably find for a global
service books tired

75
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:19,930
but we don't light at researchers

76
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:24,229
we feel need to report

77
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:29,060
fix there's nothing else we can do but
that's the current status

78
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:36,060
but you're afraid researchers are not
doing the same sweet biggest order books

79
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:36,990
that are not being

80
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:41,710
reported bug bounty programs

81
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,800
starting 1995 my netscape

82
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,910
later on was ten years later

83
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,380
with Firefox Firefox

84
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:54,419
continued netscape but its

85
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:58,580
its August later CDI

86
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,669
zero day initiative started

87
00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:05,400
to do the the phone to both they did a

88
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:10,370
bug bounties so you can report until
then you report to Microsoft for example

89
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,050
and you got like one just credit through
discovered is

90
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:17,889
spark a bit later on it is selling

91
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:21,449
to vendors it to he give you like

92
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:25,979
bonuses like flights to black and stuff
like that they did act

93
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:31,889
later on they did the phone too long
contests 9 2010 first

94
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:35,639
will start to give money programs well
two occasions

95
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:42,639
just software applications like CD and
pontoon later morning 2011 Facebook Join

96
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:49,150
did the same so now you can find in
Google

97
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:53,370
Facebook in sales for similar services
and you can get space for funding

98
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:56,419
box the thing you have to know is you
fine

99
00:06:56,419 --> 00:07:01,509
just used scanners

100
00:07:01,509 --> 00:07:05,990
so the first thing we need to do is know
your enemy

101
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,990
enemy in this cases would be

102
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:13,349
maybe we'll there's really our enemies
during the same building as we are

103
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:17,039
so we know they can beat us

104
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,240
will be careful so our enemies not
Google

105
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,849
our enemies the other researchers

106
00:07:24,849 --> 00:07:29,590
for example cytokine not lani awful

107
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:33,139
those guys are finding lots of cool box
old-time

108
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:37,509
so if they don't find something

109
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:41,400
will find its and if we don't find it
they'll find it before us

110
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:46,330
so it's a race for time

111
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:50,349
basically you have to find the box
before D

112
00:07:50,349 --> 00:07:53,460
but already got reported for example

113
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:57,050
purchased a damn know you have to

114
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:00,909
to get money seles period from that
after its first

115
00:08:00,909 --> 00:08:06,159
so to keep the undersea to see what
they're doing

116
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:11,379
maybe get ideas from and use it

117
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:15,520
so it's a for example there are doing

118
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,319
some kind of block past for example

119
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:24,279
about certain Victoria to be

120
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:27,590
services you take that Victoria attack

121
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,969
and use it in other services for example

122
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:35,349
someone found buggin conder may be the
same kind of Victor

123
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:40,130
attack if you use it under service

124
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:43,250
you'll find order books that were
discovered its

125
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,360
spying on their blogs very good

126
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:51,410
committed to do so but 90 to find
original box

127
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:54,510
which is probably more important and
more beneficial

128
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:58,120
you have to learn the company so you
have to to to find

129
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,610
services that weren't checked yet tough
to find services to

130
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:05,270
nobody else %uh scandia because I'll all
legal services

131
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:08,630
would be mostly like critically scam
lots of people

132
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:12,570
internally and externally if you finds

133
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,110
services services at the materials state

134
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:19,330
Danielle

135
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:23,650
your chances of finding ability much
higher

136
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:27,900
so will check for successful
acquisitions Michael

137
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,069
untested less secure well two occasions
by Google

138
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:35,400
I'll try to find multi-plex which means

139
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,060
to find victorious that repeated
services

140
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,290
which we can use for benefits

141
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:46,750
fine services like this

142
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,830
so if you want to learn Google

143
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:52,960
to use

144
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,940
fines information about Google so you
look at

145
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:00,060
new Google Google successful
acquisitions

146
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,900
and you'll get those difficult decisions
by Google

147
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:07,709
will get a least of lots of companies
who is acquiring

148
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:12,290
many companies all the time so basically
they

149
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:17,970
by a company week so every week since
2010 the company

150
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:23,570
which means a lot of companies that were
very fast integrated into their services

151
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:27,100
without really being checked like order

152
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:31,130
difficult service that's very
interesting but will give

153
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:36,460
later new services some users are being
tested less like

154
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:40,850
Google I'm sure not much have you have
heard

155
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:46,450
what is Google but Ill be enemies

156
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:49,940
even gets names services

157
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,450
so not every services movies gmail

158
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:56,500
conder so their small services

159
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,350
nobody even knows about and they're very
vulnerable

160
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:03,570
dick harm you in the same way building

161
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:09,100
gmail.com it's very important to look
for does

162
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,680
subdomains damn specifically

163
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,110
using their convention some news

164
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:20,400
we can take you can check old the
functions that they're using into

165
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,720
seaward a feeling

166
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,840
all the time time after time time after
time and then using our services

167
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:31,920
it works

168
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,680
so little repeat those spots

169
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,850
again each researchers

170
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:43,240
so Google acquisition site you can see
since 2008 bought the company

171
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,190
every every week someone said

172
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:50,620
you take take fifty take

173
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:53,830
dollars give your service

174
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:57,760
but not every company deeds their rights

175
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,370
situation testing products not the
company

176
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:07,070
older Fort the security some companies
just wanted to be first

177
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:11,670
they want to be first so they develop
fast buttino security comes later

178
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:16,130
second stage sometimes and then you'll
see all the mistakes that the design

179
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,680
their architecture

180
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,290
mistakes people did their

181
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:25,640
so the will other certain

182
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,710
Google Groups our approach will be
towards

183
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:32,160
mixed legal issues

184
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,920
the books the Nexus S

185
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:42,270
but dual soap refills escalation
permission bypass

186
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:46,070
something special for so

187
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:49,610
reveal that later but you have to
understand excesses is not just about

188
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:52,320
stealing your account

189
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,660
exorcist also means Kim hock your
computer

190
00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:00,010
so basically run JavaScript code your
browser

191
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:03,270
it means getting because I can use it to
run a client-side

192
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:06,600
ability to for example

193
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,970
built-in flash witty

194
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:14,410
down to use it attack your computer

195
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:17,850
Louis since the several it isn't being
discovered

196
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:21,410
Lancet attacks SATs such as job

197
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:24,430
those local box

198
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:28,140
every execution despite would have been
successful

199
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,240
so let's say I'm targeting you they want
to run a script

200
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,900
your account it's not just about
stealing your Gmail

201
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,690
as interesting as hacking your computer

202
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:44,090
it even gets easier uses

203
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:49,240
smartphones are much more class at
Victor's their

204
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,890
these

205
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:58,220
okay so the Google over we'll just look
at the convention for so you'll see

206
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,040
Google

207
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,170
com for such candor France connect for
its less

208
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:07,140
look forward slash Prince connect you'll
see some

209
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:11,650
for each one you can see exploder

210
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:15,580
so the subcommittee's for those be the
same

211
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:21,400
so it's called mailed

212
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,760
so that's the same forty-some its

213
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,900
regarding the convention for the support

214
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,940
you'd find almost the same convention it
is

215
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:34,160
any service so if you find Boxster if
you cease

216
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,380
people complaining and the support

217
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,470
about certain ever stick maybe

218
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:44,140
to take those errors nobody else
obviously

219
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:51,140
before is they got into the support

220
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:58,270
so that the first bucket and going to
talk about it

221
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:02,210
store the truth ability good coming

222
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:06,240
Google Calendar is there service the

223
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,890
to who really is a faith that the myth
said

224
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:14,070
meeting these miss legally

225
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:17,800
it was the first thing he was in
business 30 say look at cutting the the

226
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,980
purple

227
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:25,450
it first before went took about that
genetics again third will be coming to

228
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:29,800
whether the meaning journalistic into
today

229
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,270
most of the people winner them day when
they are trying to

230
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:39,180
a final bill it is in will give they
just try to inject for example

231
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:43,050
exorcist in the known for its in a GET
request

232
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:48,690
stories both request but if you want to
find vulnerabilities in Google Calendar

233
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:52,310
you must going more deeper

234
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:55,280
you need to find some places that I do

235
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,840
people didn't think of for example what
happened if you delete your coming due

236
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:04,060
or what they think if you unsubscribe
cunning the

237
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:08,690
if you if you look mom addictive you can
find it would be the tooth

238
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:11,930
google.com so the first

239
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,950
okay so day

240
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:18,430
reliability that am going to show you is
there though the toughest

241
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:21,610
reliability that they execute from the
client to winter

242
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:26,630
when the victim delete his own kind so

243
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:31,060
the for now it seems to be only a third
of six assists exorcist that the only

244
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:31,620
walk

245
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:35,290
when Michael because if I delete my
calendar

246
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:38,410
Texas with the execute only my

247
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:41,570
own so we need to find a way to

248
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:47,830
triggered it for remote exploit in the
picture you can see

249
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:52,130
the I injected X-thirty payload into the
kind in the Name field

250
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:56,420
okay so I create a new condom inject
check the spelling

251
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:59,570
into this and in the field and

252
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:03,630
now we see that

253
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:06,470
it's only if health

254
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,760
because Franjic Texas

255
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,230
into my commentary them no one

256
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:17,570
as indexes my only me so I need to find
a way to make it text with the built by

257
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:18,550
you think the showing

258
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:21,880
option in the book and kinda you can
chill calendar

259
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:26,250
what has been checking the three in the
10 years though can show is kinda lame

260
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,010
and later

261
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:30,660
the the calendar there will be shown
victim

262
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,720
so

263
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,930
in the picture consider sharing process
in effect we need to provide

264
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:41,810
the email address of the victim you want
to show is currently

265
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:47,060
so

266
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:51,820
I have found that the user must deal it
is kinda wanted five times

267
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,400
why the is a must did it Canada wanted
five times

268
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:00,730
for detector to be woken the client the
growth after one to five times the

269
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:01,180
author

270
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:06,000
here to see the error message from
Google and then

271
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,310
Texas hour 250 execute on the clock

272
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:12,950
so wait to force the target with a
little

273
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:17,420
missus clinton so

274
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:21,030
we found that there is no shouldn't
limit in Google Calendar

275
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:26,300
what is mean know certainly is mean that
it any user can show is coming up for

276
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,550
example 100-200 ninth

277
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:32,450
and the user will get the each im it
should

278
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:36,080
will get the email for each jury in
their day

279
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,820
kinda will be added automatically when
the victim account that the victim don't

280
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,640
need to approve

281
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,860
our display in the would-be

282
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:50,160
with the clear we think about their
creative way to exploit this issue by

283
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,210
using the kind of

284
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:56,060
want that then define standing for
example 100 comment the youth

285
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:59,090
later the user either

286
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:03,310
he have 120 in is only come

287
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:06,510
and any fun to delete each of them so

288
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:09,540
after the youth it went to five times

289
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:13,330
Google it on film if it's with our

290
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:19,400
extra 50 a.m. in the picture considered

291
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:24,790
her a message and that book but the
except that the deck

292
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:28,470
the kid from the climb when you decide
to delete

293
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:32,530
the made missus calendar and

294
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:37,970
going over so basically

295
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:43,680
so basically went up in these

296
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:48,090
nobody else chick forty what happens I'm
deleting it Comdr

297
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:51,640
so prolly the chick what happened if

298
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,750
conder once wanna what happen if you
delete the sink

299
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,810
there are multiple times and actually
Google emails

300
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:02,610
when you I invite someone to your conder
day say we have

301
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:05,960
automatically at a discount there to
your conder

302
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,810
so we basically can override all these
meetings and we have to we can actually

303
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:10,700
forcing

304
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,860
to delete the counters so we

305
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:18,140
invite them like six times and then yes
holding meetings over even

306
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:21,630
he would say okay entities may come
there in the air writing

307
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:26,490
meetings a must delete so we make the
user to delete the Kander

308
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:30,530
to trigger this error message which
Nexus S

309
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:33,540
so that's something like the usual

310
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:36,590
maps scanners

311
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:41,810
never find it cannot find something okay
so the second buggies

312
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:44,820
Google Analytics house like a said

313
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:48,350
client-side bucks extremely

314
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:52,630
dentures so if someone can inject

315
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:55,740
Java code JavaScript code to a

316
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:59,940
to our clients that's a game over by
2050 some

317
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,170
is a very unique very critical

318
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:06,990
rule in their organization you want to
attack

319
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:10,600
so we know everybody's using Google
Analytics

320
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,230
20 integrated into the website

321
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:17,810
and we can actually check that you can
go to date to the website then you can

322
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:22,710
do view source well as you do the view
source who can see the Google Analytics

323
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:23,690
JavaScript code

324
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:27,530
and you can make sure it's already
installed in the website you want to

325
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:29,180
attack so

326
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:33,410
winter tour around the web sites big
website speaks collapse

327
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:38,030
its users to Google X we see

328
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:41,910
dear using politics service okay

329
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:46,010
that's a first but we want to attack
those web sites we want to attack the

330
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:46,570
owner

331
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:50,130
of the website not just to hack into is
Google

332
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:53,840
XP stats interesting you want to hack
into his computer

333
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,550
and then hack into the server okay
that's more interesting

334
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:00,910
and we can do that targeting directly
through

335
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:05,170
lunatics so what happens if you find the
Nexus S E

336
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:08,740
we take full control of the web site
owner

337
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:14,740
that sounds like a good so in page
Analytics and Google

338
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:19,040
politics for example doesn't escape the
incoming requests

339
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:23,240
so let's see we're sending a website
during

340
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,790
so ya victim okay

341
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:31,340
see a victim dot com and the gloom
politics doesn't sick

342
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:34,520
website URL so let's say we are going
into

343
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,820
victim dot com forward slash

344
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:41,730
insert script ears so script alert XSS

345
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:48,260
guilty to murder that's it sounds like a
very simple tasks

346
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:52,540
but okay Google doesn't

347
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:56,770
didn't check the incoming request there
so

348
00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:00,880
basically just by entering the website
you can see here

349
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:07,190
its global economy or but imagine
someone from Google Labs com taking this

350
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:11,120
analytics this is a high-profile web
sites

351
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,790
and it can mean so basically what you
need to do is this Kate

352
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:19,170
love you new research is key to you

353
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:22,290
the local administrator

354
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:25,810
basically just in the URL you're getting

355
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:29,810
in the into the page in our tix so let's
say

356
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:33,080
someone when that meant administrator
low gains

357
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:38,280
thats one possible Victoria to attack so
we can actively wait for him to login

358
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,790
and you'll never know what it did what
we did too because we are

359
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:45,429
we actively waited for we did the attack
then we wait

360
00:23:45,429 --> 00:23:49,179
deal I'll see you next time today to the
inpatient politics

361
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:52,920
we basically can hack is computer I'm
still have just checking the service

362
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,040
which is

363
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:59,560
very important but less interesting the
specific scenario

364
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:03,020
entitlement we can use that is basically
sharing

365
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:06,170
so we can infect our own Google
Analytics

366
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:09,960
and then we can send someone a link no
we give you a read-only

367
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,810
access permissions to our analytics you
would say

368
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:16,970
what the fuck why read-only permissions

369
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:21,200
to your knowledge XD know you and you
can actually click on the link

370
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,630
you'll see the link it's a very innocent
seeking you cannot see that it runs

371
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:25,630
excesses

372
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:29,380
link that to be now Texas itself

373
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:32,480
once we shared it with him and sending
the link

374
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,520
game over so let's go to the first met
art

375
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,590
the first method we go to this URL with
with the scripps

376
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:44,179
inside in the URL one step closer to
locate

377
00:24:44,179 --> 00:24:48,940
we can take full control his computer

378
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:53,380
we wait and that's it achievement
unlocked

379
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:57,750
om this so this is this is how it runs
so

380
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:00,200
wants it answer two runs

381
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,020
deion page in our tix Hill will find a
disc script runs

382
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:08,450
so we waited for an administrator that's
a high-profile attacks

383
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:13,170
it's very critical the second one
would-be

384
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:16,310
sharing with the victim are Arnold

385
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:19,490
X so like is said we'll

386
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:22,970
rules the Wiltshire do you free will

387
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:26,720
we're giving you a free statistics about
our website which you probably don't

388
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,650
care about

389
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:32,120
but once you get that invite you'd have
to check what is it all about

390
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,980
why did someone just charities an
outdated

391
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:39,650
must be a mistake do internet link and
it's game over

392
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:42,970
so once we show it to the link

393
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:46,480
send you like very innocence think
you'll see

394
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,850
just just you can see Texas

395
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:53,540
we audience a third decks Asus insights

396
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:56,670
you're ready horrible

397
00:25:56,670 --> 00:26:00,980
what's your answer this link so that's
the second metal exploiting this world

398
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:07,980
case

399
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:12,550
so do Cougars people his torsional

400
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:17,480
webmasters to create its com

401
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,690
day

402
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:22,630
with from the store the 250

403
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:25,890
gertrude blom day

404
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:31,170
the picture you can see that the 332 the
injected X 250

405
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:34,870
to defeat eighth people just a creative
feet

406
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:38,610
them called the field with their picture
for spam

407
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:42,930
in the second picture

408
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:46,130
considered nothing at them there is no
exorcist

409
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:50,310
feed you concede defeat item with Alexa
15

410
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:54,060
imager for 30 who knew jumps could
deliver

411
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:58,020
nothing runs so we need to find a way to

412
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:01,500
make is reliability

413
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,500
split let's

414
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,970
look like that when the features feed
corn application

415
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:11,190
we have feature called email
subscription

416
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:14,760
im subscription I wish to Skype

417
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:21,760
to anything ditty went to okay so

418
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:25,370
we already know that there is
subscription feature

419
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:30,920
in it going and what about unsubscribe
with about the fair use the want to

420
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,070
unsubscribe deal

421
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:36,250
feet maybe it is it can birth to make
good

422
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:40,980
is a tech expert signed

423
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,630
victory conceded the process getting at
the OC

424
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:48,460
2015 decided to earth subscribe to a
feed

425
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:53,130
Booker little affair elicits did the say
that if you're sure you want to

426
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,040
unsubscribe

427
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:59,610
your feet in Denmark wreath on this day
exorcist they don't and

428
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:03,140
when the victim with the fate of the
this store the truth would be

429
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:07,630
triggering come so

430
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:11,020
there is the ways to exploit it is
ability one of them

431
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:14,990
is the victim subscribe their late 30s
heighth

432
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:18,060
type deal fits and the second one is
this

433
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:23,360
and do link to a victim it that it's
important to say that the victim put the

434
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,710
to be subscribed to you

435
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:28,280
feed you can at least in the mid
unsubscribe link

436
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,810
when the victim would click on a link
for the 250

437
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:37,760
with the trigger you aka K

438
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,960
this is favorites

439
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,630
I'm so again

440
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:48,670
and our services I'm sure not too many
of you have heard about

441
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:52,970
Google Friend Connect so this is another

442
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:56,410
based miss it I keep seeing the first
used to sharing

443
00:28:56,410 --> 00:29:00,240
option to find abilities their

444
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,750
so it really means the sharing options
wasn't checked not properly

445
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:07,550
analytical services just think

446
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:11,250
maybe next

447
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:16,390
to Ceres think about it so

448
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:20,240
Google Friend Connect this is my
favorite because it involves a bit of

449
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,470
social engineering

450
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:25,200
you probably have seen many hot girls

451
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,710
adding you on facebook recently with no

452
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:31,710
any mutual friends basically no
difference

453
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:35,150
so just the box or something that has a
very nice picture

454
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:39,950
so the attackers with very nice hot

455
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:43,720
picture going to the victims a victim

456
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:48,900
let's be friends the victim which
releases okay this hot girl

457
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:53,570
Canadian its letter

458
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:57,750
as a friend she wants to she wants to be
friends i alive but they will

459
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:00,820
a leather how it would work

460
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:04,980
ninety-nine percent of the males in this
room us

461
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:08,450
even if its security conference

462
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:11,730
not especially if it's a security mom

463
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:16,520
so although we know the risks

464
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:20,930
about heading skills to our Facebook or
Google Friend Connect in this scenario

465
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:26,930
Reese we still do it does and the target
will approve our requests

466
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:30,710
the doc will approve a request for two
edited

467
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:34,090
as as a nice name we had a nice arnie

468
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:37,850
was leash something you choose

469
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:43,160
something email me

470
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:48,320
but after we finished we want to make
him delete us

471
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,670
we want to make him to

472
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:55,710
not be happy with our relationship so

473
00:30:55,710 --> 00:31:00,880
once it finds out this is not a real
team it was probably want to delete it

474
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,840
but we once must and carrots because
people are not using the delete option

475

and researchers in detail in

503

large Berto

504
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,680
England you have to privacy options

505
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,980
one is this published document mean that

picture you can see the broth

511
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:36,429
unpublished document use them

512
00:33:36,429 --> 00:33:40,850
right is a loan document and then decide
to unpublished

513
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:44,050
and

514
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:47,700
d in the second picture can see that the
film one health

515
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:52,660
trying to access feel unpublished
documents you receive message for

516
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,700
movement that they do

517
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,840
request know if the clinton moms mean

that the committee's private only you
can access

519
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:06,900
Indian owners working so

520
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:10,530
will be invalidated our permission the

521
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:14,800
the night off from viewing day
unpublished documents

522
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,990
so know what can we do we need to find
out

523
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:21,679
creative way to bypass that the mission
validation again

524
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:26,250
let me tell a new friend

525
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:30,860
book in North inflatable to work its
looking on principle tool kit is a tool

526
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,360
that allowed to use the word

527
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,379
conflict their own documents

528
00:34:35,379 --> 00:34:40,149
you just need to provide there the
author of this specific IgE

529
00:34:40,149 --> 00:34:46,940
document that you want to be translated
and uploaded to today and uploaded.to

530
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:53,030
worded inflation to in the picture
consider that the kid

531
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:56,730
provided your end of their unpublished
documents Indian

532
00:34:56,730 --> 00:35:01,630
uploaded to their conflict with their

533
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:05,060
am way with the

534
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:10,420
so

535
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:13,960
in the picture consider the template or
do the job for

536
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,410
the and Plato access to the unpublished
documents

537
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:20,790
because look at them fatal tour have

538
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:24,160
permission to access to any documenting

539
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,220
application invaded and validates

540
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:30,720
that if they're document is published or
unpublished

541
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:35,390
so I used to love Google Translator two
axes in the unpublished

542
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:42,390
documents in will go north

543
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,680
cases for legal

544
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:54,480
is in our services in that was exist
okay Google Affiliate Network

545
00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:00,230
this is more common service I know more
people that uses it but maybe it's

546
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:02,930
because

547
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:07,549
to people so

548
00:36:07,549 --> 00:36:13,089
loool affiliate network store Texas

549
00:36:13,089 --> 00:36:16,799
and miserable just sold it to both

550
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:22,369
but that they're actually very
well-connected the same so we'll see

551
00:36:22,369 --> 00:36:25,589
so what is Google Affiliate Network
thats

552
00:36:25,589 --> 00:36:29,500
very good West they give us dance Google

553
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:34,029
within 4 is a free program that makes it
easy for website publishers

554
00:36:34,029 --> 00:36:39,170
to connect with quality advertisers to
get reported for driving convince

555
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:42,609
conversations are so we are choosing a
commercial for Google

556
00:36:42,609 --> 00:36:45,650
I am I'm sure they don't need us

557
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:48,750
those commercials but this is what the
service does

558
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:51,950
will use it to my post permissions

559
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:56,150
will use it to do whatever we wanted
service till

560
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:59,480
for civil our goals

561
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:03,339
or we have two different goals the Nexus
S the council we can

562
00:37:03,339 --> 00:37:09,319
basically a not just still is a
counseling is account

563
00:37:09,319 --> 00:37:12,789
is not much of a minor once second goal

564
00:37:12,789 --> 00:37:18,140
which is gaining mystery privilege his
account so we don't need exorcist

565
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:21,400
actually still is a car but you can use
it stewart's computer

566
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,849
so

567
00:37:24,849 --> 00:37:28,569
like like a city has acquired many many
companies

568
00:37:28,569 --> 00:37:32,539
and thank you can see here the website
that is

569
00:37:32,539 --> 00:37:36,380
series hours worse was

570
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:40,940
actual or Performax which was acquired
by

571
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:46,200
double-click which was acquired by so
Google

572
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,259
as received a box from double-click

573
00:37:49,259 --> 00:37:53,210
that receive the book from perfect
nobody checks its

574
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:57,319
in the way so basically the first attack
is

575
00:37:57,319 --> 00:38:02,690
is very simple I we change the link AD
and wants which is a leak in the

576
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:06,710
and we're already authenticated we can
see older people's links

577
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:10,220
once we do that we can change

578
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:14,400
so this is a permission issue basically
but once we can she's someone else's

579
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:14,970
link

580
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:19,609
we can also change someone else's

581
00:38:19,609 --> 00:38:23,319
text within this link once we change
that text within this link

582
00:38:23,319 --> 00:38:26,400
I E injected Nexus S two is

583
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,829
account without his knowledge so the
permission issue

584
00:38:29,829 --> 00:38:33,109
was elevated into or downbeat

585
00:38:33,109 --> 00:38:36,279
away to to

586
00:38:36,279 --> 00:38:40,539
to a Nexus S so this is basically a
permissions issue

587
00:38:40,539 --> 00:38:44,099
not the Nexus S but the slips it was so
vulnerable to go

588
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:47,410
all those seem 30

589
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:51,960
excess music so the first one would be
manipulating

590
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:56,349
barometers connect former sitcom me used
to inject

591
00:38:56,349 --> 00:39:01,009
exorcist field google.com so once we
change the link ID

592
00:39:01,009 --> 00:39:05,259
and use our part we can change the
script

593
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:09,710
the text Thomas Creek and basically

594
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:12,710
16 indexes

595
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:16,009
that's it so this is the first

596
00:39:16,009 --> 00:39:23,009
the OC for this website the second
attack is actually more

597
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:32,130
more effective life hack into somebody's
account via Nexus S within

598
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:37,460
when you can directly accesses so

599
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:42,180
manipulating the counters together
Mississippi Blues

600
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:48,589
on loved sounds like so

601
00:39:48,589 --> 00:39:52,089
you can basically many plates the user
ID not to

602
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:55,180
so once you want to change someone's
email

603
00:39:55,180 --> 00:40:00,480
enjoyed it indicated day someone I
thought

604
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,769
how it should be a key ficken update
someone else's

605
00:40:03,769 --> 00:40:07,339
email a recount to my email

606
00:40:07,339 --> 00:40:10,900
an ally thought I was okay it looks like
in

607
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:13,030
architecture

608
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:17,410
design should work

609
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:21,099
well early it didn't work well for us

610
00:40:21,099 --> 00:40:24,210
so once we use is account ID

611
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:28,809
and we change it to our email already
authenticated

612
00:40:28,809 --> 00:40:32,599
on the solutes look at it I'm allowing
you to change

613
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:36,540
your account to my email

614
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:39,680
and they thought that would be cool

615
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,760
so we did and I was a

616
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:46,390
a game over for them hours early
abilities

617
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:49,990
this was considered a good one

fine liabilities the only see it flesh
fine from the thurber for example

634
00:42:02,789 --> 00:42:06,440
him to you can't inject

635
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:10,470
in the list just that they don't so it
seems to the skills

636
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:13,900
so we need to find a way to kruk their

637
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,900
application to find a way to cock

638
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:20,829
difficult there

639
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:24,720
so without with the brute force attack

640
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,520
refers to thank you can of the broth
with 45

641
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,720
for example if you went to find a new $5

642
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:36,079
Wednesday when the service that you're
going to check you can find a

643
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:40,380
newt the victory with with the brute
force you can %uh some

644
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:43,500
before me up with both the Queen do will
stop to me

645
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:47,119
for example be docked picnic that column

646
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:51,529
either the clear that cool the king is
dead the truth with the tech

647
00:42:51,529 --> 00:42:54,730
to find a news come to me in death

648
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:58,690
and down for par skinny you can scan
night P

649
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:02,049
find them Newports and

650
00:43:02,049 --> 00:43:05,260
from so

651
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:08,339
we found that there is this up to me
both

652
00:43:08,339 --> 00:43:11,369
bpm that speaking at the school the

653
00:43:11,369 --> 00:43:14,460
disturb them think that no one

654
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:18,369
using angle I don't know why it is the
problem

655
00:43:18,369 --> 00:43:21,420
if but there we found there is the

656
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:25,900
PHP application on dismantling

657
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:28,970
but first the phone we just

658
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:32,260
the being David getting to see when
which

659
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:36,779
server de klerk that call me Austin so
where we thought that's

660
00:43:36,779 --> 00:43:41,369
it deeply that come with that on who
could fill them picture can see

661
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:44,690
of that from enable them

662
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:48,559
so

663
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:53,569
what was the story of their the in
picnic seems that someone installed by

664
00:43:53,569 --> 00:43:54,369
mistake

665
00:43:54,369 --> 00:43:58,160
all the reversal of it phplist each be
listed email

666
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:02,150
vacation it peak the it Beach Police
death or

667
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:05,789
is a first for me not with it is

668
00:44:05,789 --> 00:44:12,789
critical vulnerabilities him

669
00:44:15,609 --> 00:44:21,130
we have found that the the US PHP list
with their default username and password

670
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:23,769
its was there

671
00:44:23,769 --> 00:44:28,220
very big mistake do and

672
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:31,460
here with

673
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:35,259
100 ditch be listed there were unable to
a local file inclusion

674
00:44:35,259 --> 00:44:39,799
a local file inclusion vulnerability
allow us to get the shale

675
00:44:39,799 --> 00:44:44,119
when lugar's sir take care for
controlling the server

676
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:47,339
you can see that the fourth

677
00:44:47,339 --> 00:44:52,269
a first for me well-known all abilities
local file inclusion

678
00:44:52,269 --> 00:44:59,269
desk injection you have been there bitch
bill is exorcist all their web the text

679
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:03,180
so the person who installed phplist

680
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:08,450
think you got fired it says to be honest
I was kinda surprised to see that there

681
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:08,700
is

682
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:12,830
the pitch gillis the publication on
Google Earth with it the full

683
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:19,060
default username and password and

684
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:23,740
the picture can see the PLC of the local
file inclusion

685
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:26,960
with them depicted the the do

686
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:31,640
we get the show with their lit the
county it 3133

687
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:35,120
to them the most I O

688
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:41,210
price for it my friend youth in the
sense that their

689
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:44,780
picnic is over this is that this team
the ticket from

690
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:48,800
will that we determined that

691
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,140
is was there with the bill incredibly to
it for them

692
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:55,290
compliment the from

693
00:45:55,290 --> 00:46:02,290
so you would use fully imagine that

694
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:07,630
if you want to hack into Google you have
to use

695
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:11,740
0 days and send them via email be named
as

696
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:15,030
Chinese government but you

697
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:18,980
can actually find like VPN that speaking
that contacted

698
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:23,140
through with the default username and
password

699
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:26,800
so when we want to say foresees

700
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,230
the we love group the

701
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:36,300
dear I think what they're doing a great
job reported all those fucks

702
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:39,700
so we didn't release any abilities to
the public

703
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:43,750
very important gets hurt from those

704
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:47,770
abilities so we will with school

705
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:51,790
India bigger guns than we do to

706
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:56,840
make them upset on but we're good
friends

707
00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:01,270
Paso in order to hack into Google you
have to do several stop

708
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:04,410
howard's much as any bug bounties so
it's

709
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:08,800
this was just an example of just a big
bug bounty program that has

710
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,180
multiple servicers multiple servers
multiple

711
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:15,960
services multiple extension in

712
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:19,980
what it's like a very big companies so
it's just a very good example

713
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:23,120
for about a month to program but we
could have done it in and the order

714
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:27,050
companies give it the company and you
have a lot of mess

715
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:31,900
should start reorganizing that stuff
'cause you need is your day to hack into

716
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:32,640
the company

717
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:36,360
you only need the default password back
into your company

718
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:41,250
that's all it takes so protect against
and that's very important

719
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:44,510
on so you need to find bugs in those
services

720
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:47,730
as you've seen it was always the same
issues it was

721
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:51,960
unsubscribe button it was the sharing
option it was order options that are

722
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:52,620
very pretty

723
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:56,130
in all the services so you wouldn't find
boxing

724
00:47:56,130 --> 00:48:00,980
in than me one step to the application
you wouldn't find bugs

725
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:07,980
conder name if you just do it but if you
share it with someone then

726
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:12,250
you to take it's a whole different
scenario nobody else

727
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:16,760
check before if you'd go through the
past nobody else check before

728
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:20,720
then you might have a chance of finding
really good variabilities

729
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:25,540
on a in a very short time so that's very
important have to think difference

730
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:29,630
information-gathering is also very
important so like you've seen the

731
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:30,460
acquisitions

732
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:35,320
if you get some me than just a basic
information it's all dirty

733
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:39,670
opens I mean it's all in the Internet
you can use Google to find information

734
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:40,620
about school

735
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:44,480
that's very so

736
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:49,970
mix services so once you share with one
service to another

737
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:54,050
you get like like to do you favor
automatically edit

738
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:57,710
is kinder to your for example thank you

739
00:48:57,710 --> 00:49:02,220
those very good for me at: so

740
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:05,300
make services also a good sport

741
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:08,580
and permission see can see multiple
services

742
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:13,020
the permission was not properly checked
actually you can see that in lots of

743
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:13,940
companies

744
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:18,800
so permissions applications you should

745
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:23,160
should take a detour and closer look
into that because that's not something

746
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:27,360
the would find sticking

747
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:32,780
or not that easy give some reference to
some links

748
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:37,530
you might want to check out later my

749
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:43,090
it's not over yet maybe

750
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:46,710
just maybe it's not a good idea to floor
blocks

751
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:52,080
just

752
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:55,610
ok

753
00:49:55,610 --> 00:50:00,330
the left wing ability

754
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:04,020
is it'd be permitted pollution

755
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:06,170
in blogger

756
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:08,359
dismal ability you know me too

757
00:50:08,359 --> 00:50:12,150
beginning administrator anybody the
count missed a few

758
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:16,009
mind about local experts WordPress books
but then

759
00:50:16,009 --> 00:50:19,509
what both both with with their popular

760
00:50:19,509 --> 00:50:23,719
block services the

761
00:50:23,719 --> 00:50:26,900
this video I'm going to show you how you
can be administrator of

762
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:33,130
any broke is so we didn't put it ahead
it will take like a

763
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:40,130
36 these previews

764
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:59,830
in this video Act two is ok book to his

765
00:50:59,830 --> 00:51:06,210
his own look okay

766
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:10,320
so in blogger every every using Blogger

767
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:14,060
have a user ID low-key reading mean
that's

768
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:17,280
me is there for example locate the one

769
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,770
so cute their blood 82 so every israeli

770
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:24,910
booker's service notches or blogger d

771
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:28,340
in blog I found it ish

772
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:31,550
a user provides duplicate fields what is

773
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:36,580
duplicate is mean if you have for
example in the book the quest

774
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:39,630
broke eighty one and I

775
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:42,970
duplicate the feat with another located

776
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:46,210
till for example look at the one and
then

777
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:52,230
located to so the third her see that
will be the one in the third okay

778
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:56,330
it secure applauded the one I its combat
instead

779
00:51:56,330 --> 00:52:00,240
executes debt other field so

780
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,880
for example look at the two so in this
kind of

781
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:07,310
manipulation Turk I was able to

782
00:52:07,310 --> 00:52:11,240
papist the commission checks blogger
service and

783
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:16,470
becoming administrator of any blog group
now you can see the full

784
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:19,850
it up with the quest just duplicated
Louis defeat

785
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:22,850
with one more brody

786
00:52:22,850 --> 00:52:28,430
value this is my own account

787
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:33,010
okay which might want permission

788
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:37,000
no way and head user my book together

789
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,510
permission and
