1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,000
the yo

2
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,740
we are gonna talk about the the Solution
Manager

3
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:22,689
mean the im on even if they did in the

4
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:26,400

00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,369
Treasury says the most sinister some of
the examples

13
00:00:54,369 --> 00:00:58,010
but there are many more im the city

14
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:02,549
SEP solutions so but thats the you won't
find difficulty

15
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:06,420
even small companies or medium companies
the summer TBT

16
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,180
the beam big companies make for two days
important 100

17
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:15,090
so he usually SAP customers

18
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:20,369
repeat customers and the

19
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:24,020
is very common in these kind of it's a
good conference

20
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:27,880
to deductible the a route chill

21
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,900
the doc about will never be the same

22
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,090
how to compromise a specific service
Simple to

23
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:37,950
big game rule game preseason execute
gold

24
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,190
the mud we are talking about SAP systems

25
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:46,229
we are to be about systems though
they're holding the most critical

26
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:47,080
information

27
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,160
you know combined be that the thing
about the

28
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,260
a tour information on customers
informations great the information break

29
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,260
the bank account

30
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:59,750
formulas so were to be about very
sensitive on

31
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,770
im private information for a combined be
month

32
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:07,840
so a the furnace ABC them

33
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,520
the scripps Eve an attacker manages to

34
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,570
compromises ABC's them then the

35
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:19,510
this kind of what thats also possible on

36
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:24,580
we have to the go out and try to

37
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,140
here analyze the security of the CB
systems make

38
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,480
from a nap earlier gay we we should not
seen gonna stand

39
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,810
shares a router grounder some service
that will be the compromise

40
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,960
we might we must theme only see
information

41
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,560
ass their Rio valuable information you
know company okay

42
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,490
so if someone manages to break into a
CBC them

43
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:51,910
he would be able to it perform it's been
a shit thats

44
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:54,990
night the getting the information from

45
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:59,730
for formulas bank accounts customers
marketing campaign for

46
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:03,240
you brother all this information the
peace usually

47
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,520
posted been busy bee systems camby

48
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,960
a obtain with a new one

49
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,210
some other shit thats if someone manages
to

50
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:16,440
you can do this exercise think about for

51
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,710
for for a little while think about what
happens

52
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:23,380
is if someone jumps down your sabc films

53
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,980
just for an hour okay it's not like a
week or a day

54
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:31,270
just from our they look did the company
will be the scene

55
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:34,420
under of money so because all the
business processes

56
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,980
won't be able to to be executed it so is

57
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:42,020
supposition expert also very very people
on

58
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:45,850
according to how creative the attacker
can be

59
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:49,440
the the is ABC stems if if their
compromise

60
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,560
there the East also possible to perform
father that snake

61
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,810
for example the attacker might be able
to create

62
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:01,170
new employees to happen I love salaries

63
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:06,130
into the school intercom im send their
raw material and the

64
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:09,800
finished brother two-piece own warehouse
him

65
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:14,160
I know contact retrieval the permission
from the customer some

66
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,440
the payment orders a send the payments
to his own account

67
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,700
that depending on the be a DVD of the
attacker

68
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,960
their under oath attacks that can be
known

69
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,060
Johnson because the the the attacker was

70
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,460
able to compromise I'm using specific
service or an interface

71
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,660
the SABC okay so that's why we need to

72
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,750
the moved from the Stanley Cove you

73
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,780
the security and to understand that ACD
Systems

74
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:46,150
are holding the Rio sensitive data on we
are talking about

75
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:51,120
very important information as it don't
you wanna

76
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,490
the the them things out the

77
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:57,950
neo-nazis East usually engaged to he's

78
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:02,680
in addition this team basil we have a
unearth customers that

79
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,090
usually ask us for being prevent this
there is ABC stands

80
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:10,010
on one what we do is we connect to their
network

81
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:13,110
they give us the any the other is so far

82
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:16,130
or the stove maybe other sis and then

83
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:19,530
after one week two weeks the whatever

84
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:23,310
Mona time it's engaged we

85
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,100
return within

86
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:29,160
least before they were nearly dismantled
it that that those that we were able to

87
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,260
execute to those as ABC's tim's
unlimited you that this is taking a

88
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:33,780
brief

89
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,690
summary on Davies for you to keep

90
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:42,800
the he is really important to understand
really understand the security of the

91
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,810
SABC stance beyond situation of Duty
some beach

92
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,870
beyond the the common understanding of
SAP security because

93
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:54,550
he we were able to compromise it more
than 95 percent

94
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:58,690
of the the SABC stands before customers
when we were engaged

95
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:01,690
you have been pissed on the

96
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:05,000
bring brothers what is that we were only
even

97
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,230
least the flight Bo's to be nope going
to put suspensions

98
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:13,000
so the so far with into will be

99
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,730
let's star with this edition merge what
is the solution mansion tourism minister

100
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:22,260
the server component for the SAP
infrastructure

101
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,530
races required for every bloomin they
should be

102
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:29,900
even though you don Knollwood water
solution ministries

103
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,430
if you have a sleepy you have a
sufficient actually

104
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:37,700
EVOO is stunning in its ABC's tim you
will be prompted with a specific email

105
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,290
is generated by a solution manager that
so that's where you

106
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:45,690
%um solution merging nukem if it's not a
new company

107
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:49,380
well the you have this month in addition
it's prolly

108
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,430
enough then the ruling someone that is
providing you with

109
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:57,120
a SAP services some maintenance but you
are connected

110
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,270
Solution Manager for its

111
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,470
it usually this entry point the
frustration so

112
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:08,100
only 3drose gunning to elicit to the
Solution Manager

113
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,760
room from that point the can abide by
tears

114
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,470
the man issue service is the root cause
analyses

115
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:20,620
monitor they can do and other things
from that central point 800 another

116
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,250
nifty p.m. if they do so

117
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:26,460
I can the Maschine the number of things
that can be

118
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:30,400
executed from this official measurement
it's a love functions

119
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,520
im something to really understand these
the

120
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,910
im he's not holding any business leader

121
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:43,230
basil ciba-geigy all needs on the the
all the doors is security all Libyans

122
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,540
are not covering this Alicia masher
because it's actually

123
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,900
not holding any any kind of business
information base

124
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,200
it's only holding didn't even for me a

125
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,750
and that's why is very important the to

126
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:01,410
to understand I'm going to repeat it in
the concussions that he we need to

127
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,540
colour SAP security police began

128
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,570
okay we need to cover all the CBC themes
on

129
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:12,620
you can not focus only on the but the
system it's connected to

130
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,680
the all this ABC thins that you have

131
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,450
on the CW me through those connect to it

132
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:23,670
love staff on if

133
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:27,080
an attacker is able to compromises the
solution masher

134
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,680
Indian you will be able to compromise
all the SABC

135
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,510
a because of how deceased interconnected
decision miniature

136
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:38,660
then Indian a the article will be able
to

137
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:42,120
to compromise on this is so this is how
you

138
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,960
it looks like the solution mansion for
us to do you can see

139
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,210
Beagley is ABC's them only three does

140
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:52,530
are connecting to listen to summer show
they can the

141
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:56,270
of course gurney though it's unclear if
the resistance for the most common

142
00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:00,230
the first one and then you have the
different environment

143
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,360
and systems connected to it a on

144
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,650
the very important here is that we have

145
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,900
this is in at the Beagle landscape game

146
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:15,430
David you a and beer the it depends on
the

147
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,950
on how you define your landscape maybe
maybe mmm

148
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:22,050
compere with wonderfully im

149
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:25,430
layers okay you may have developments on
both days

150
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:29,670
you a pic Braun love systems connected

151
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:33,910
in this in landscape but something to
realize is that typically

152
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:37,740
all these systems in the same in
Birmingham

153
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,800
are connected to the same Solution
Manager eight so im

154
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,810
on the systems are connected with her
pussy connection

155
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:48,430
and then if you're able to bull

156
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:51,740
op to the Solution Manager funding goal
down to any

157
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,900
other see them then minutes ago

158
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:59,000
would be definitely threading in the
latest security them

159
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,490
to be based on books on development see
them on

160
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:05,940
then he would try to engage in
compromising

161
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,960
the for the PM I'm your the

162
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,000
you can see that the the him

163
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,380
they use a scene there right side its
because

164
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:19,370
difficulty but the environments are
there was a dark axis may your

165
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:23,160
in uses a company in place in there were
some

166
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:28,260
by developers from on you a to

167
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:32,050
if you think about it this is how we we

168
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:35,710
Maschine the the solution merger okay
this is like a mother she

169
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:38,880
this controlling all the SABC stems the

170
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,050
in the landscape on EV a theme from the

171
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:46,090
isn't the only 330 you me the be

172
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:51,430
looking at porn here's ABC's tim from
the British so

173
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:55,240
is at this point we need to

174
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:00,650
it focus on something that is im very
important for the stock and that is

175
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:03,770
but for some it that's we won't need

176
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:07,310
anything but for other attacks loonies
brody

177
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:11,270
any show compromise bay so we are
talking about week see them

178
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:14,410
for example developmental or some book
systems that

179
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:18,170
can be compromised is I'm you see

180
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:21,550
any number of well-known today the CC im

181
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:26,030
my sig game standard the my city some
nonprofit organization

182
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:29,160
that was created the basically by

183
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,200
the some companies simply meh nazis

184
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,520
that are it devoted to a sickie is to be
security

185
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,720
on each company specializing in specific

186
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,700
field of the CDC you can then we all the
company's concluded with different

187
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:48,780
standards and Avas to make a standard
its surrounding SAP security

188
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:52,760
centralize that you can see all the
different able security

189
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,410
neither security bro symbol FIS
imprinted on

190
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:00,180
a enid stand there and the in a place
where

191
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:05,180
anyone can contribute these are like the
most common with a heavy piece

192
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:08,710
he affect the CBC stems im

193
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:13,060
some of them can be abused to into to
have a go for compromise the vis-a-vis

194
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,040
systems

195
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,510
some other sir Muir a conceptual like a

196
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:21,020
it there they are dangers miami Heat is
that

197
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:24,950
you won't be able to compromise the
system you some 'em

198
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:29,900
so we're going to use when we redeem

199
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:33,970
it it's a every 30 we can use anyone
anything with them

200
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:37,300
compromises it initially this is Tim
have you seen

201
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:43,050
it any bring the community

202
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:48,530
so for these the we chose the affords
them the USS with the fourth passwords

203
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:51,690
this is very common name

204
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:58,690
SAP systems as well

205
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:06,170
okay

206
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:10,110
yes the for this where you seem to be
split that is an open source through

207
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,390
that you can download from

208
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:15,030
notice web-based im and basically

209
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:18,810
we r doing a brute-force offers specific
obligations over

210
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:21,970
we r Eileen host this

211
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:25,570
de Bres then we have the scoring or the
Services

212
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:30,890
no reconfigured in that they be onerous
and then we r enabling

213
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:34,410
their blood flows know him

214
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:38,830
Madhu to be able to take without having
any benefits officials

215
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:45,300
for the full uses so

216
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:49,100
you have this busy very comfy your this
Tuesday for users

217
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,709
on

218
00:13:51,709 --> 00:13:55,160
then when you execute him or do UN
hermano de

219
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,350
before uses is very common the

220
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:02,810
we end up that it needed love before you
so CBS ABC things

221
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:06,579
depending on the version the some
versions

222
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:09,730
have less before you system others my

223
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:13,290
do you should either always before the

224
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:17,000
so we're going to use these

225
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,910
before you certain the plane 66 that is
is substandard

226
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:24,060
so with this user even though it has not

227
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,420
assigned this supposed you can create
your sys-con begun

228
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:31,410
assigned himself the sample role a
profile in saree

229
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:37,709
im so

230
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:44,709
we have adapted the you sir new

231
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:50,780
we can basically beneath the sea thing
missing the buzzword

232
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:55,660
I we can assign ourselves a year old and
create users

233
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:59,210
and something to buy Nokia is a to

234
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:03,390
is a they sell oh she goes blind
separation

235
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:07,120
each SEP system the CC

236
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,290
where this is true if the system is
properly configured money for the

237
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:14,530
situation a few teeth controls are in
place and

238
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:17,910
or the users can do only what they
should be doing

239
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:21,000
and there is no other bleary Tia 15 the
system

240
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,090
East usually possible to bypass the from

241
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:27,930
going the down to the application server

242
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:32,270
the accessing the database directly and
it breaking the plane separation

243
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:35,569
or even with Eva gold or a

244
00:15:35,569 --> 00:15:38,429
de Atley it's a good its executing a ski
local

245
00:15:38,429 --> 00:15:42,119
BB so so both so if we compromise

246
00:15:42,119 --> 00:15:46,040
one plane then these might end up in the

247
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:53,040
fuken permissive the system you should

248
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:01,870
so let's say we have compromised one
sees them a

249
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:08,870
to

250
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,620
im and then we would see what it's
possible to

251
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:16,269
to be done with the Springfield will be
some

252
00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:20,189
there are some Grove CT connections that
are created by the phone

253
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:23,600
if you're around the the name

254
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,470
we certainly so we said to comfy euro
the satellite systems and the

255
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:31,680
Solution Manager on basically their

256
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,439
connections created from the solution
Minister suicidality them

257
00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:38,689
and from the satellite system
dissolution mansion and those are the

258
00:16:38,689 --> 00:16:39,259
really

259
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:42,720
dangers 1 day when you can the

260
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,269
let's say they're sending PC dress
relationship from the solution Manisha

261
00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:50,490
to the satellite systems my if you can
block you seen

262
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:53,670
any connection then relaying on these

263
00:16:53,670 --> 00:17:00,209
relationship even go down uncompromised
immunity want near some

264
00:17:00,209 --> 00:17:03,740
fights the their addresses relation the
after the

265
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:07,669
connections im we have two fear this you
can choose

266
00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:10,980
the if you can if you can be adjusted

267
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:14,770
or with strong financials it some

268
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:18,549
connections have store officials within
the connection this nation

269
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:22,100
so you can use this is the nation to two
axes

270
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:26,829
with diabetes Tim on day they're really
dangerous when are they about

271
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:27,980
connections they wonder

272
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:33,179
going from the city late to the solution
okay

273
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:37,049
so I'm going to show you this to slide
sir

274
00:17:37,049 --> 00:17:41,500
me too to having the presentation it I'm
going to show you now

275
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,919
them which the even

276
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:48,730
specific compromise initial compromise
will be able to

277
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:52,059
moved from the Senate see them any
satellite system

278
00:17:52,059 --> 00:17:55,110
to the Solution Manager the

279
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:58,510
you seen either FC functions

280
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:02,260
or just directly lead to a system within

281
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,580
the morn on the from the

282
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,850
solution masher will be going down a
game to

283
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:11,960
any other facilities its cool

284
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,390
DC this is so they moved so its cool

285
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:18,929
everything works they have actually have

286
00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:22,350
to SAP systems here running the laptop

287
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:25,750
I'm how another built a machine scan

288
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:32,750
very from 20 basil

289
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:37,230
agreed in my own you sir in the
satellite system missus

290
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:40,640
sr1 this is one of the surveillance
systems

291
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,330
because so for a limitations with the
resources

292
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:50,630
it would be great to have a make a BB
gun environment with development here

293
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:55,230
production and the solution mash about
because of limitations with her work i'd

294
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,120
a gun to have

295
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:00,030
running on the same machine as a
customer churn to be fancy from that's

296
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:00,370
why

297
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:03,510
I'm going to damn from the sr1

298
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:06,980
I'm to the Solution Manager and then
going back down

299
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:10,169
we've been you singer turned it'll this
is

300
00:19:10,169 --> 00:19:14,220
a isolate the fact that it's the same
system

301
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:18,230
it can be any other system it so

302
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:21,909
at this point if the name attacker
manages to get into the

303
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:25,679
im solid system he will Lexus

304
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,730
SM 59 that certain section

305
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:33,149
they sexually a they wondered I miss you
too

306
00:19:33,149 --> 00:19:36,899
it needs the view I'm change the

307
00:19:36,899 --> 00:19:39,980
in the thereof see this the nation this
is the

308
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:44,770
there's a connection and then we don't
see that there are two connections here

309
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:48,799
when he's the back them a connection

310
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,799
East who feared we've

311
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:58,010
stork intentions a so depending on the
British is that the you certainly don't

312
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:58,799
see them

313
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:04,190
we will be able to do something
virtually

314
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:09,570
if if we run a correction this with
either beaten

315
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:12,860
its success and we have this

316
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:16,530
other trusses connection on the pending

317
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:20,799
on the authorization for the use ur in
the target system so that

318
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:25,100
the user needs to have a specific
authorization object here but anyway

319
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:29,200
eat we r able to see their physicians
inability thing with the other

320
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,700
a this nation we can basically day

321
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,980
which use overseas is Earthsea

322
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:39,970
ACM authorization weekend PeekYou

323
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:43,960
remote loom very convenient on

324
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,830
we are now connected to a solution
manager peso

325
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:51,389
you see my initial connection I managed

326
00:20:51,389 --> 00:20:55,290
to connect to a solution manages so now
as you can see here

327
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:58,990
I'm connected in the Solution Manager I
just

328
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:03,799
leave their few mouse clicks and and
their im

329
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:08,049
other way to do this East to use the bad
connection

330
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:12,399
if he's not if a connection won't allow
you to

331
00:21:12,399 --> 00:21:17,950
do remodeling this is because the user
is not allowed to do they let alone

332
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:21,990
is so disciplined because of the use a
date but then

333
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:26,299
their positions are valued so we can
execute FC functions

334
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:30,159
and then we can axis because of the
previous of the user with an axis

335
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,389
any table literate system a so

336
00:21:33,389 --> 00:21:38,389
he's very with it's cool not

337
00:21:38,389 --> 00:21:42,290
we are now in the social miniature be

338
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:48,080
so I'm going to do the same the same 59

339
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,790
I we can see you there this nation's
little created by the

340
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:55,419
this week so that configures the
Solution Manager

341
00:21:55,419 --> 00:21:59,790
on you can see dresses TMW

342
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:04,750
no game will be each the phone
connection per seat sewn

343
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:08,149
the track the city today its own

344
00:22:08,149 --> 00:22:12,530
perforation it some of them this store
then shows something

345
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,330
trusted the pen name

346
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:17,450
make a niche a mark we've gone

347
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:24,450
32 go back to the system okay this is
the same situation

348
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:32,799
it'll the zoo is not allowed to the
remote loan but we can do is

349
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:42,040
because of the British issah the you sir
because of how the the

350
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:46,390
daily replace configured these results
Lexus

351
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:49,510
any table technical and be said save

352
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:52,510
peso its it's the

353
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:56,170
absolutely possible to do something like
this the same

354
00:22:56,170 --> 00:23:01,640
the same him him

355
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:06,760
him weaken

356
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:11,470
worry the dame okay

357
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:14,670
this is datum im

358
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:19,780
this is one specific David man depending
on the product that we have in stock

359
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:23,410
in that did it say let's see them if
it's any ECC

360
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:26,900
if it's in CRM and is it it is ceramide

361
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:31,300
depending on the only solution that we
have it we would be able to access

362
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:35,000
any of the tables technical and
non-technical T

363
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,740
basil we can download the Asus rugby
crashes

364
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:44,100
on get the you money pretensions to
connect to a system

365
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,960
we can target on this %uh both you
service it's up to the

366
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,570
creativity of the other p so

367
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:54,960
as you can see the it is possible

368
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,770
from the solar system goal up to a
solution masher

369
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:02,890
know them to in your city this is one
way

370
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:07,430
the the only thing the attacker needs
East any should compromise

371
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:11,240
they so he needs to compromise one of
the satellite systems

372
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,920
but then again the he he will be

373
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:21,920
definitely targeting the list securities

374
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:30,250
okay

375
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:34,230
social Minister this component East
highly dependent on

376
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:37,830
the Gateway the eight-week Eastern SEP
component-based

377
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:41,340
a good for you basically room every

378
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:45,010
a book based SAP system on the

379
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:49,590
if its main function use to communicate
sabc spins

380
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:53,780
between them and two communicate SAP
systems to examine systems

381
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:57,140
it so the CC executed we've Earthsea

382
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:01,020
the their will be there for the both for
his AB

383
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:04,290
so a social mission

384
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:07,660
a seat highly dependent from the Gateway
any attack

385
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:11,910
that we can the name achieve rule we can
executed

386
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:15,780
in the gateway will be affecting
definitely

387
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:20,370
dissolution mansion and my in a new
cease-fire not cecile

388
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:25,490
he had his first stop in black/red but
there in 2007

389
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:29,020
talking about the gateway and perhaps
even early this

390
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:32,679
so a I encourage you to go to

391
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:34,290
this paper the

392
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:39,180
picking the injured the danes with the
Windows Phone each one of the attacks

393
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:42,510
that you will find their East also value

394
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:46,250
indeed a plea on this the solution
mansion it because

395
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:50,080
there are several registered servers in
the solution masher

396
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,760
on you can basically execute Earthsea
look at thats

397
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,380
you can the gym cancel any registered
server

398
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:01,120
you can im do money in the museum even
though there is no

399
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,020
the business information days I love
very

400
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,149
the use will learn

401
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:12,799
im im important technical information so

402
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,950
any of these gateway thats Mb

403
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:19,399
im news look for

404
00:26:19,399 --> 00:26:23,399
each one of the attacks that we are
going to be covering you will having the

405
00:26:23,399 --> 00:26:23,969
slides

406
00:26:23,969 --> 00:26:28,119
a protection measure so the
controversial peabody

407
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:31,559
the you had to in force authorizations

408
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:35,009
the Phoenician of the ACLs on basically

409
00:26:35,009 --> 00:26:38,899
avoid the show compromise in the in this
identity thieves

410
00:26:38,899 --> 00:26:41,940
day so it in the congressional sections

411
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:45,769
we we have in no description on them

412
00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:46,730
phone

413
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:52,059
image this something that is cool

414
00:26:52,059 --> 00:26:56,230
were later today listen to you sir
arthurian the station 3

415
00:26:56,230 --> 00:27:00,350
an the cease it's something that you can
call for your

416
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:03,390
the to mash to centrally manage

417
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:07,049
or deceased day uses here's ABC's
basically

418
00:27:07,049 --> 00:27:10,520
each is ABC's tim high speeds own set of
uses

419
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:16,020
on no not not not only Keystone said a
few so smart also claim the been

420
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:19,620
so you have on the uses for each plane
each sabc them

421
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:24,450
multiply that by the environment where
the bidorbuy solution on you have

422
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:27,059
hundreds of thousands of users

423
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:30,150
be combined then im

424
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:33,590
how the due to my Nash to sensory mash
these you you can

425
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:37,100
good for you one on these this is
typically

426
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:40,230
we are to be about this here because
this is deeply difficulty

427
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:43,230
configured in the Solution Manager this
one

428
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:49,290
so as you can see in the the abram this
is the same concept the choirmaster

429
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:54,150
on they've what child systems so
connecting to require much through to

430
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:54,880
see them

431
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,040
you will be able to we ate indeed change
the frame profiles

432
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:04,250
do anything in all the systems that are
managed my dad Bournemouth

433
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:07,260
so it's useful for

434
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:10,980
Eva Vergara on the with the ABS said you
can

435
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:17,590
manner spoil your use a central for you
too

436
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:22,480
to have is that the CIA this concept is
very

437
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,900
related with the Solution Manager
configuration concept because if you're

438
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:31,309
I think these who are to the solution
manual configuration

439
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:34,679
then you have a lot of Elections im on

440
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:39,040
because who hours so onto another city
of connections depending on

441
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,120
which sees them so which month you want
to

442
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,350
appliance you want to the Manish my

443
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:48,570
you have these block on both connections

444
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:51,870
again okay so you have connection from
the child to the

445
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:57,610
master I'm from Minnesota to so

446
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,840
if you think early to be the bar this
you will

447
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:05,500
end up the looking at this a dissolution
Mercer connections

448
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:09,460
make something that you need to take
proper appear

449
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:12,679
because otherwise you can in lab having

450
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:18,120
live connections not know we which
connection issues for which team

451
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:22,540
the these you need to take proper care
with them so that's a no me

452
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:25,860
im so

453
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:30,679
80s also possible to to do the same kind
of attacks

454
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:34,130
good one the thief he is not
conceptually

455
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:38,630
this Alicia Manning show the choirmaster
East much more important because

456
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:42,640
from that system you will be able to
read a user's

457
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,950
in all the rest of the system basil if
you

458
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:49,780
can go up to the solution musher with a
few mouse clicks

459
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:53,020
you will be able to create users im

460
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:56,080
conveniently for each Brian each

461
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,950
you see them with the for 5 with you

462
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:05,040
one be so

463
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:09,020
motor Michels the you have this in this
light

464
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:12,070
really have some good to more than
muscle its way

465
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:16,760
to both who will we're going to both two
more things

466
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:20,090
the first one is this CCMS basil

467
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:25,650
CCMS the ceremony three min for us to do
provided by

468
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:30,380
SEP to receive events and to be able to
monitor

469
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:35,440
SAP systems a so there's this component
that you need to have the disco this

470
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,049
same

471
00:30:36,049 --> 00:30:39,179
Centro this internal system that's

472
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:42,360
it with a one day it's going to be
receiving all these

473
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:46,490
events room their lives there are three
go by the name

474
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:49,640
maybe the other night his existence

475
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:54,370
something interesting these scenarios
that

476
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:57,929
the nation needs to be 03 you that's

477
00:30:57,929 --> 00:31:02,080
go the ACC in this 31 remember the name
but

478
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,149
is a nation that %um starting down on me

479
00:31:05,149 --> 00:31:08,780
a bum it's a different nation and the
Asian DC blended

480
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:13,679
a centerpiece the server they saw it
registers himself in big a plea

481
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:17,409
of the central system so again

482
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:21,360
with how are these greatly affects
possible the

483
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:26,010
we need to properly secured in the day
in

484
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:30,929
the something a.m. to tab really clear
here is not

485
00:31:30,929 --> 00:31:34,230
it is running under the its it's a the

486
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:38,490
ATM user so they say the ATM user is the
use Avast

487
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:43,190
running or the subsurface is if you can
execute go though if you can access the

488
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:43,919
service

489
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:49,210
a this user I'm sorry you can basically
connect to their respective 75 any

490
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:50,270
resource

491
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:54,730
that this ABC from so if he managed to
compromise for peace

492
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:59,110
a Shinto any other bro sis there is
running on earth the sea

493
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:05,210
pretensions then it said basically a
full complement services

494
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:09,550
this is how it looks like im we brought
this to the store

495
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:13,899
because the it's not like a year
something new standard by

496
00:32:13,899 --> 00:32:16,960
usually aliens ups looking at the

497
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,230
central this end system in the same

498
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:26,059
see them as the solution

499
00:32:26,059 --> 00:32:29,080
so again FC connection so creative

500
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:33,490
from the synthesis template the money
through to them

501
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:37,679
the collect and analyze they analyze say

502
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,500
connection ECU's the same used with the

503
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:45,030
own credentials sold you can not abuse
that

504
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:48,059
the its using your own credentials be

505
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:51,270
they call it the this nation

506
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:54,850
east of the year that we've a specific
set of ministers

507
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:58,500
very nope real issue but still there
love

508
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:04,679
FC functions that can be executed

509
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:08,520
so there are connections back from the

510
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,940
the Asian do the soon see them

511
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:15,120
with using this a it started as just
another

512
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,240
located in the

513
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,710
month that you can see this is a
proprietary

514
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:23,580
it for months old the credentials are
stored before CSM rage

515
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:27,160
you sir he said nope militia you sir but
a steel

516
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:32,840
there something that you can okay

517
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:37,300
so a how an attacker would be able to

518
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:40,880
a dead this issue miss Asian there's a
specific functions

519
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,890
Bulls that can be used to execute
Commons

520
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:50,130
they with other than the cation so as
the

521
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:53,290
the Asian peace executed with this eve
AD in previous years

522
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:56,679
then arbitrary commands will

523
00:33:56,679 --> 00:34:00,100
in not been there for compromise
obviously people me too sabc

524
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:07,100
so me show you leave you

525
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:15,110
for this we are also using this ploy the
news

526
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:18,780
basically the same we have her two
models

527
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:22,400
specific models to the tix if the

528
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:26,030
agency says this limitation I'm to

529
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:29,170
exited called through this is the
imitation missile

530
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:32,310
basically you confer you're the target

531
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:35,880
so here something moving but they said
the CP ellis

532
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:40,260
is not the AP Earth orbit satellite
system is the AP reserve the Gateway

533
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:44,990
will be Solution Manager on this end
system they've the concept is very

534
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:46,080
different with you

535
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,150
the they won their issues in this boy

536
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:53,650
is bringing to the a solution Minnesota
Sen system

537
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:56,740
but actually the cold is being executed
in the

538
00:34:56,740 --> 00:35:01,600
the latest fool you had to the school
where the

539
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,589
RFC servers you have to configure the TB
name

540
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:09,420
this he said very the disability be
named because

541
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:12,940
it's based on the hostname vicinity them

542
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:16,320
last subsys EMS the before aids

543
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,040
though the the instance number peso

544
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,240
is very easy to guess the TB name

545
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:27,130
then if you'll run

546
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:30,620
be we have to enable the margin

547
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:33,660
to to exit to the big if the

548
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:36,920
patients in this is from CC imitation

549
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:41,100
I'm

550
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,940
the if we run this you see that

551
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:48,830
they're worried he was addicted its
sister loves the server

552
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:52,130
with that Pb name is prolly SEC
imitation

553
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:55,230
a so because the beastly

554
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:58,860
interacted with the proper procedure
functions undetected and

555
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:03,590
leave sis imitation so he's its
exploited by the

556
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:07,970
CCMS always succeed and then if you're
on the

557
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:13,130
the gym the exploit it creates a new
show

558
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:16,810
you had to start this year and then

559
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:23,630
the see with him

560
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:27,989
so at this point the only thing we we
need to let it be said that

561
00:36:27,989 --> 00:36:31,059
East the IP owners with this in see them

562
00:36:31,059 --> 00:36:36,239
K there's no well basically we needed
the hostname authorities then release

563
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:39,339
the firm but that's not late something
you cannot guess

564
00:36:39,339 --> 00:36:44,109
basically very situation you need any
kind of a spacious room

565
00:36:44,109 --> 00:36:47,319
so if you the

566
00:36:47,319 --> 00:36:50,390
run that common them

567
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:53,609
you have the basically common execution

568
00:36:53,609 --> 00:36:57,150
in the city them with the British is of
the

569
00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:01,680
a VM use CDM so

570
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:06,009
this boom you can massive database you
can do anything

571
00:37:06,009 --> 00:37:09,269
lunar will be yes

572
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:12,529
the and those who do it executing

573
00:37:12,529 --> 00:37:15,739
sq Commons room the

574
00:37:15,739 --> 00:37:19,009
sending me to a specific file im

575
00:37:19,009 --> 00:37:22,259
much he had 2.2 this set of credentials
for their

576
00:37:22,259 --> 00:37:27,160
who feared navigation through this is
day you so much that they will yes our

577
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:27,939
co2

578
00:37:27,939 --> 00:37:30,969
earn the if we

579
00:37:30,969 --> 00:37:35,650
around on rigorously in there with
swords the as we have accessing the

580
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:36,670
written in a race

581
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:41,019
lou with don't have any kind of plane
separation here

582
00:37:41,019 --> 00:37:44,689
gay so eats or their all the information

583
00:37:44,689 --> 00:37:48,369
I'm I E

584
00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:52,579
I E M

585
00:37:52,579 --> 00:37:56,539
axis bc im yessir co2 delivered

586
00:37:56,539 --> 00:38:00,549
there is no restriction purchasing your
day will be so I consistently for the

587
00:38:00,549 --> 00:38:01,009
table

588
00:38:01,009 --> 00:38:08,009
income

589
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:12,270
will be sold this another component

590
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:17,400
they scored Solution Manager did not fix
for the breeze when the CCMS

591
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,590
it we have to specifically configured
these basil

592
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:23,960
we have two 200 their requirement to
have these

593
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,570
on specifically configured this solution
when she did not fix

594
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:30,880
East reconfigured because it's Eastern

595
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,980
own every new SAP system

596
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:37,770
made Wheaton star gayshill if you see
another

597
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:41,430
SAP Eastern's a number 97

598
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:44,790
or 98 bone SMB York PA

599
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:49,300
thats the Solution Manager they miss the
Asian so the station

600
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:52,590
ISE is don't like the food so you will
find these

601
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:57,310
every version every SAP component its
develop

602
00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:00,480
in general im and its

603
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,690
exposing your specific interface be full

604
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:06,700
we see some interface a service to

605
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:12,240
remotely instantiate options is so let's
see what we can do

606
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,220
there are two things that

607
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:19,360
can be executed using these for

608
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:24,690
date is in the Asian once you can feel
it it's connecting back to the Solution

609
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:26,800
Manager using paid leadership positions

610
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,880
and this released by bridges dentures
are computed

611
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,960
in the senate Ethan so if you can

612
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,890
deplete their positions it's the same
process

613
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:40,430
for the greeting the is accused or then
you can

614
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:43,990
havel said of pretentious deepening

615
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:50,190
solutions and the recent East 103rd

616
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:53,200
that you can execute on this is

617
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,830
me using the people are interface im

618
00:39:56,830 --> 00:40:00,790
you can you have 100 methods expose and
then

619
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:03,810
using these methods you can basically

620
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:07,570
run information but you can also in
style application

621
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:11,230
Bay so im if you can

622
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:14,580
in style narita reapplication E

623
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:17,820
of course you had to go the properly
with the proper

624
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:21,340
interface and it's a job while we're
finally the

625
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:25,590
so you have to know how to repay but if
you manage to grade

626
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:29,530
your own application you can deploy eat
through the

627
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:34,000
before interface on

628
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:41,000
me show you

629
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:49,340
so we have these he's not with this plea

630
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:52,800
we have another general obligation
really for this from

631
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,180
we're pointing directly to a satellite
system

632
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:59,490
trying to the day what's

633
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:03,470
in there okay we have the same the
others we do an enema

634
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:07,590
and with currency this welcome imports

635
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:12,480
make 22 him we have this 7 2009

636
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,830
69 for the much TV and then we have on
the management console

637
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:21,390
the imports as well but this one these

638
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:25,350
the important for us is a finely 7004

639
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:28,560
let's it before interface man

640
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,080
if we manage to take these interface
without blinding

641
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:36,630
any kind of conditions we gone a

642
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:41,570
initially information it so if we're on
the same

643
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:46,020
duplication we can get information on
how

644
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:50,310
the SNDA Shanda school for you make

645
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:53,910
all these and different information than
the nation

646
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:57,380
love South mud will

647
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:00,600
also try to execute commands is so

648
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:04,490
if we if we use another Prometheus

649
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:07,750
minor see the common day

650
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:11,280
basically the obligation is trained to
im Eastern she

651
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,090
specific overshoot and 32 exited from

652
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:19,330
not as you can see here by the fall im

653
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:22,460
service not found exception 32 because

654
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:27,220
you're trying to exit is something that
is not there not the

655
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:31,280
80s pussy will with these before
interface to deploying

656
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,880
your own me obligations so you

657
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,940
execute this mines E Res I

658
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:42,130
and then a the application is going to

659
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:45,820
in style all the their requirements
worthy

660
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:49,980
application for room that we are going
to be using

661
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:54,480
on them as you can see insulation arm

662
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,550
was perform so we throw these

663
00:42:57,550 --> 00:43:01,670
different applications that will
continue and then

664
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:04,960
if we execute the same commander

665
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,609
we have executed before we will have a
different result be so this is

666
00:43:09,609 --> 00:43:12,660
common execution in the solid system

667
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:18,970
using the beef the smdh so if you
execute their

668
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:22,790
were my you can see that this is not
deceive I DM

669
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:25,859
of the SABC them to lift but this

670
00:43:25,859 --> 00:43:31,210
these the they say the ATM of the
Snettisham Asha the F-sixteens

671
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:34,230
be anyway this user East

672
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:37,840
the be nice to the saps serbians on
subsidies

673
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,930
the group so you can still

674
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:46,890
doing to them

675
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:50,390
so its

676
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:52,000
keep going with the presentation

677
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,100
okay so we're able to execute code

678
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:59,510
an authenticated again confirmations

679
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:02,960
for each one of these attacks you have
is a contar issues you have

680
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,230
is a way to protect yourself your own is
ABC since

681
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:09,690
im still I really encourage you to

682
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:12,960
take a look at these mmm see home how
you can

683
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:18,070
implement these mulroney's sold some
conclusions

684
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:22,290
a substantial masher

685
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:25,970
East usually North in this cool before
the team's

686
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:29,280
unusually North analyze from the
security

687
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,080
people in a few basil if someone breaks
into

688
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:36,550
the solution masher E it's basically a
movie because he can

689
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:39,619
depending on how you configure this you
can be

690
00:44:39,619 --> 00:44:42,760
if they are thicker than axis any other
system

691
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:48,150
in all the information here is ABC's
just relationships

692
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:51,430
unnecessary because the school will
prolly

693
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:55,770
if you the sale is but a game you need
to have a proper care

694
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:59,580
the Gerber appear of the authorizations
book which you sir

695
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:03,130
I'm we took positions on this is
basically

696
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:06,740
is so the tasks meh you need to do is

697
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:09,930
you have

698
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:13,290
RFC connections pining all the 15th

699
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:16,490
be Markham full all the pieces are
predicted

700
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:19,830
that's why a you need to analyze all the

701
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:23,940
this nation's all the connections
because despite the ones that are

702
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:25,290
created by the phone

703
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:29,340
the are the ones that we have been
looking out there are other this

704
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:32,000
nation's created by your developer sold
by

705
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,030
the some her brother old so

706
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:38,480
you have to known which interfaces are
your system's

707
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:43,180
be because otherwise we we had we did it
in something this

708
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:47,510
they proceeded to panic from there in a
pin directly to production

709
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:50,570
because of insecure interfaces so that's
why

710
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:53,920
its very important to take a proper care
of

711
00:45:53,920 --> 00:46:00,920
all the apps a connection okay

712
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:04,790
a few if possible he's also the
commander to

713
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:09,140
have a sitter different solution
Minister for the production environment

714
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:12,730
basil the in this way you are having

715
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:16,660
hype really school haii im

716
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:21,640
very in boredom solution masher very
sincerely social masher

717
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:28,340
separated from all the rest of the
system secure is it is a masher

718
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:31,430
ask any other brought the system the

719
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:34,930
moving forward with this secure all the
SAP systems

720
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:38,630
and the afterbirth this is be so the

721
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:42,640
the there really is situations that a

722
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:45,850
even though Dave number that the systems
are known

723
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:49,330
im analyzed by the only things East

724
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:52,780
deal an open door through the rest of
the system's so

725
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:55,890
you need to know we turn the system's
the

726
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:59,460
the we tell them when they read the
sweeter the the system's

727
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:02,480
that you can be used to connect to the
rest of the system's

728
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,970
on ECU in that deciding that you can

729
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:10,540
except the Reese is the Subie so it's
fine

730
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:14,560
but you need to know which are
differences between the systems

731
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:21,560
on which %uh the race yeah definitely do
not expose the summer should determine

732
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:27,609
im restrict networks is this is a
general recommendation for on this ABC

733
00:47:27,609 --> 00:47:28,330
themes

734
00:47:28,330 --> 00:47:31,940
they said I'm the promise it be too

735
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:35,100
they knew how to properly

736
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:39,130
segment a separate the network the CBC
films

737
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:43,470
from the network the in use urs a very

738
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:50,070
specific set of services should be
exposed nothing but that and they'd the

739
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:50,790
system's

740
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:54,780
the use the latest versions apply
patches is he said very

741
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:58,890
the complex task but needs to be perform

742
00:47:58,890 --> 00:48:02,260
so if you want to keep your SAP system
security

743
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:07,100
you need to apply to purchase on or the
the latest SAP security

744
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:11,330
learn in the end you have some
references

745
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:14,420
%um feel free to access the presentation

746
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:18,530
or the countermeasures the compassion
for references them

747
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:22,560
who it helps you if you have any
question

748
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:25,609
have sometime

749
00:48:25,609 --> 00:48:29,470
yes think we have about 10 minutes so if
it doesn't even have a question

750
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:33,660
new Britain's

751
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:37,310
okay we'll but yeah I got a question the
you mentioned the beginning

752
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:41,930
I'm you said it's quite the interesting
that not a lot of people show up for SAP

753
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:42,780
talks rates

754
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:46,480
in gets the results of what you're
showing and especially keeping in mind

755
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,839
the data that these things are
protecting

756
00:48:48,839 --> 00:48:53,410
should actually be completely opposites
why do you think that is a mean what

757
00:48:53,410 --> 00:48:55,080
what why do you think the interests

758
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:58,180
lemme here but many other places is a
dismal

759
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:01,910
actually because the only people who
that's coming to elicit don't

760
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:05,230
Zealand is related to the CBN

761
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:08,850
they wanna see Joshua this usually
sleepy seasons

762
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:11,940
knowledge or urbanization sister so

763
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:16,290
I did the bronte most of you are somehow
related to

764
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:19,830
SAP systems so that's one the the

765
00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:23,100
in them regular is it means security guy

766
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:26,590
israeli looking at their windows they
were 102

767
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:30,150
on the man's true mark interesting or
fun

768
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:33,990
talks just seems interesting though that
is if security is your goal in mind that

769
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:37,750
he had a result you can get with
attacking the system year the firm's

770
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:41,970
something that you need to take proper
care all rights

771
00:49:41,970 --> 00:49:44,940
so thank you very much for your talk
thank you
