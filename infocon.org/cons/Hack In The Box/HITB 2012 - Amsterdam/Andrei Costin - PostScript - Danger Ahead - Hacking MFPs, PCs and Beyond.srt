1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,250
the

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:10,250
me

3
00:00:14,049 --> 00:00:18,529
well good morning everyone the thank you
for coming to my

4
00:00:18,529 --> 00:00:23,200
ok it's a pleasure to be here and to
they'll be talking about postscript

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:28,579
I am and the security related stuff
about postscript

6
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:31,869
so just the their shorts were mine

7
00:00:31,869 --> 00:00:35,559
and I'm was involved in my photo class
occur

8
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:40,340
universal tool kit writing for
recovering RFID the

9
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,410
keys from my for classic cars and the

10
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:48,030
tomorrow recently I've been doing some
printer and I must be taking for the

11
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,280
last three years I think

12
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,340
and basically reports go to the
continuation of the

13
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,370
research I've been doing and in turn on

14
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,449
a interest to the politic security

15
00:00:58,449 --> 00:01:02,129
the like in general approach so you have
some

16
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:06,090
my papers presentations on the
advisories

17
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,840
I'm maybe the student we've you recall

18
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,140
the yeah so what's sure the morning

19
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,950
I'll missus Magento the following today

20
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,550
a but before we proceed like to

21
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:24,300
to though source communication with
eight

22
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:28,780
home in your view the deal we will post
but let's say

23
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:32,030
printer drivers the

24
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,909
have you installed usually it doesn't
give you

25
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:38,409
headaches home

26
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:42,470
okay 10 percent annual you have written
any post group

27
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:46,829
air program by hand okay

28
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:50,569
free people okay is good okay so

29
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:53,840
a just for me for I

30
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,970
when I go to conference that I just want
to know how many people

31
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,479
just called or screw well

32
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,560
a quick refresher which is the

33
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,970
very helpful because it II am surprised

34
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,149
and the

35
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:14,090
to see but the 10 over years and years
the those professional who are not

36
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:17,549
a basically I'm not aware ovale

37
00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:20,689
abuse potential carried by the printers
and MFP is

38
00:02:20,689 --> 00:02:23,849
and the with businesses small they're
only shows

39
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:27,730
I'll they have the potential abuse
because

40
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,750
printers are part of your internal
network its

41
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,349
but great books have been the recorder
which nobody knows way it is usually

42
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:38,750
or doesn't care about it mud I from

43
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:42,790
another perspective or from security
perspective first of all is part of the

44
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:43,579
internal network

45
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:47,720
as you can see I and it's the a trusted
resource

46
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,670
right I'll because this bar to go into
not work you

47
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:55,250
configure it we were username password
for your

48
00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:00,069
held up with an MP and so on and so on
are it brings confidential information

49
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:03,430
because confidential information
sometime get printed

50
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:08,739
argue doesn't have like a lot of pitch
the management or is not very

51
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:12,709
a streamlined base management or I
vulnerability management

52
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:14,130
and the

53
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:17,660
a even in most of the cases or in some
cases

54
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:21,040
it is publicly accessible through
internet because

55
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,390
of convenience and the because I've
misconfiguration

56
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:29,080
and their general idea o.o is just a
printer so

57
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,360
they'll be no problems just connecting
it to the internet right

58
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,500
I'll the history of hiking yeah I'm

59
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,420
is on the printers goes back to sixties
when there was a story about

60
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,270
the Oaks putting mechanical and and
economic %uh Nicole the

61
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,970
video camera in the

62
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,540
as Xerox machine in the air so that
Union embassy

63
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:53,190
so is not something new but nowadays
it's not economic conical nowadays

64
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:56,310
mortgage though well the concept is the
same so you blog

65
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,610
the machine from inside them to get the
confidential information

66
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:04,310
I'll so from addition there's no point
of view

67
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,980
there so she goes like from 2002 and it
kept the

68
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,510
ok during every four years ever some
kind of a patent

69
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,630
so recently there was the

70
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:17,640
I'm all our interests bone because a.m.
more either so does the

71
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,660
raised for embedded devices and the

72
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:25,720
print those following 2 some kind of the
many devices so want to vote then 2012

73
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,090
where there were like three or four
different direction on researching

74
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:34,370
security printers and the basically is
starting to from 2010

75
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,590
I'm 1 I've been doing research is like
it's a small

76
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,890
the special but you can see David online
afterwards

77
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,890
I basically on the Internet

78
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:47,190
like you can see I just quickly met this
like

79
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:51,720
lesben up with a war just quickly my
more than 20,000

80
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,230
I

81
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:56,650
20,000 bring those connect the public
the internet and those are

82
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:01,200
like know the you know in jet one which
you use a point to bring their for those

83
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:01,690
bizarre

84
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:04,730
like enterprise-level I they have
everything

85
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:08,010
Fox they have scans that

86
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:12,430
all all in one one piece o basically
they're all over gold you see

87
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,500
a lotta love is going to the the
internet just don't like them

88
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,280
and it's good when you see the picture
and video with a little bit scary

89
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:25,230
now ban where there's other things where
where where for example some legacy the

90
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:28,440
a from piece of were softer

91
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:33,040
as the ability to indirectly painter and
there have been the most I think

92
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,430
now I wore document having non malicious

93
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,930
where they the for the PC but they've
had the militia stream for the printer

94
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,570
so want to get printed

95
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:44,740
the you to upload the file or changes
the screen on the printer

96
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,490
so basically vez at various revenues way
you can

97
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,960
the sent malicious dreams and your PC

98
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,220
anti virus or I D S IPS will not

99
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,630
even trigger because there is no ideas
IPS or antivirus

100
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:02,310
solution for the Panthers and I'm
selling this for the last two years I'm

101
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:05,780
I'm not pushing for a solution but there
is nothing which actually

102
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:10,170
tries to to detect malicious things
hoping there's I am basically

103
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,560
I'll the printing can also be done and
initiated for

104
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,850
the from there internet from the side so
basically if you send a link

105
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:22,270
malicious fishing I'll victim can fall
into

106
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:25,930
a link and as JavaScript and Java so
basically the

107
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:29,130
both movies can initiate and their send
the

108
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:33,500
directed to the printer or the user the
million I could control the malicious

109
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,680
seem so basically

110
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,970
you have full control basically threw
them control sequence

111
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:42,600
about to go to the printer you get the
pretty much everything from the

112
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,770
victims been so again a

113
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:49,890
for side prone to bring the free ticket
or free something

114
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,639
I with the

115
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:55,509
think twice before printing just a
general invite a

116
00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:58,740
I'm not saying everything is militias
but Vadis is there

117
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,159
I mean think think twice before printing
is because it's not just on the paper

118
00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:02,900
it's a

119
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,370
they have a better device in your
opinion I

120
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:09,560
okay so but those like it very quickly
refresher

121
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,080
really about the IMF is in print those
if you are more interested

122
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:18,080
you can check with the previous papers
but now I i want to go through over

123
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,270
we've posted

124
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:23,099
because it's the very interesting topic
in itself so

125
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:26,770
I am where a little bit about postscript
it's the

126
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:31,219
it's the let's say a technology which
was introduced in

127
00:07:31,219 --> 00:07:34,719
if I buy adobe and it's the being used

128
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:39,250
as a one of the main technologies paying
their printers they're all

129
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,940
basically it's the

130
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:44,850
you know there are two kind of printer
drivers what screwdrivers and PCL

131
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:45,440
drivers

132
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,530
and the I'll was cute is like pic
covering sixty percent of the share

133
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:54,200
a in terms of technology and read is
that

134
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,260
it's the it's one of the first languages
which was there for

135
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:02,280
formatting the that they the for the
Panthers now

136
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,810
as you can see the the picture is taken
from the

137
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,820
the from Adobe and it's very very very

138
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,910
a representative because they're all
these bumpy and it has

139
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:15,280
unexpected turns I mean it'll like very
very interesting

140
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,350
picture if you see the original so in
the silverware possibilities

141
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:24,610
not just carrier for your printer data
or for their

142
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:27,980
characters we which end up one on the
paper

143
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:31,220
posted is actually a programming
language so

144
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,279
giving air given it's a programming
language and its

145
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:37,550
I'll come back here later so you
understand you can do much more than

146
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,570
just printing they that you can actually
run

147
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:43,000
some computation on the printer or what
whatever

148
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,860
their postcode is being rendered based
on your computer or may be rendered on

149
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,270
the

150
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:50,870
printer so they've been the numbers
example

151
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:55,380
the okay graphics and others is like
bear bear the initial goal of course P

152
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,580
but then it got expended to very complex
mop

153
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:02,279
it has very powerful moderates
computation for doing the graphics

154
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:06,370
so know if people writing web servers
I'll

155
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:09,760
XML parsers the ray tracing

156
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,610
basically doing really cool stuff in
free the impossible and some people even

157
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,550
control their milling machines like

158
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:19,020
they connect they'll either pinter
because it has a step model

159
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:22,400
ankle when I controls very very precise

160
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,770
the new English so I am

161
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:28,800
what exactly is possible it is like a
very

162
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,830
very interesting technology and bed is
is

163
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:34,960
as I said it's not just the text or
first I think image

164
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,710
which she goes to the computer 30
painter

165
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:42,410
it's a programming language and
basically I'll just enumerated said

166
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:44,790
dynamically typed think okay competitive

167
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:48,820
that base during complete programming
language so maybe you you ask yourself

168
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:53,270
or the hell is this right because all
these seem very

169
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:56,459
outer space well so also you

170
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:59,720
a example by example and Ave I'll just
stop

171
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,910
now for the to incompleteness is a

172
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:06,310
bed is but if you have a general
computation let's say

173
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:10,000
password cracking or I rainbow table
computation

174
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,480
it's a general computation right you can
take this

175
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,030
competition from any language with
Python see whatever

176
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:20,170
and prove it to incomplete transform you
can't a

177
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:24,020
make it in a post good so basically you
can have a very distributors large-scale

178
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:27,690
I general purpose competition part for
so

179
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:30,790
you can use printers for this purpose as
well just

180
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:35,089
have everything for us for the to
postscript

181
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:39,410
and the yeah basically what happens the

182
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:42,829
when they have a user prints the I'll

183
00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:46,670
I document or his print button is like
I'll

184
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:50,589
what happens in in the background is
whatever it was he

185
00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:55,790
own the edit or get sent in a specific
format for all for your buck want to the

186
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,610
printer driver

187
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:01,350
I'll for Windows it says something a
Windows internal for the next is

188
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:01,890
different

189
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:06,280
so it gets sent to the printer driver
with printer driver

190
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,490
understand but for months and then it
transforms to

191
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:13,000
that they thought to the post read which
is the language which

192
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,450
the printer understand and then it just
sounds the

193
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:20,260
the post data over a wire okay the print

194
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:25,010
well however for example you can also
see post documents on the

195
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:28,550
on the computer basically II most %uh
view

196
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:31,670
overused or heard about Ghostscript
which is

197
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:34,850
reviewer for the servers 0 for the

198
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:38,670
PCs to view post documents because
sometimes you just receiver

199
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:42,300
academic or journal paper you post
before more than just open it to

200
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,730
really so a in that case it does get

201
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:49,430
render them executed on your your
machine in the

202
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:54,060
sandboxed environment because I'll post
it is like a

203
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,490
you can think of it as the Java sandbox
I

204
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:02,440
its I high-level programming language
running in the sandbox environment

205
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:07,250
pretty much like Jul a so basically all
can exploit the

206
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:10,339
Sandboxie for bass eight-member sandbox
or doing some

207
00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:14,630
other in text interesting stuff I mean
is not directly comparable to double the

208
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:15,470
parlors guy

209
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:18,900
by the sandbox environment very high
level

210
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:23,910
programming language so again we have a
very important thing is that

211
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:28,079
VoIP a program used to is not I think
that program can make a decision you can

212
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:28,490
do

213
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:31,839
the basic he fails whatever not right I

214
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,120
so I'll just start with the small the

215
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,800
now only like the simplest single then
I'll service doesn't do anything it will

216
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,370
pride

217
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:42,940
so basically opposed to being a
programming language you can

218
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,790
crossed the simple document which looks
like this like what

219
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:50,319
thinker there's less than 10 characters
and it'll basically

220
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:54,690
on something that was it you'll have to
reset bring those or just be there is a

221
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:59,100
cancel about them fall of all for
someone else author based

222
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,430
you just can't get the softer and thus
also result

223
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:05,740
you have to kill it me is no other way
you can

224
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,020
and it so I'll just so you'll how it's
the

225
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:13,480
none for Grampian MS Office because my
you might not know but

226
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,770
I also later post it is like a in

227
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:21,100
many more products when you actually
manager because you have all those

228
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:25,650
renders very deep in the product but
you're not aware because you just see

229
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:26,490
the picture

230
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:31,120
or the render aid final product but the
interpreter is still there

231
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,750
so office has like an interpreter for

232
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:38,040
I'll postscript and for example if I

233
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,040
try to insert the picture okay

234
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,810
im so

235
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:50,370
you see is like

236
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:53,800
the EPS EPS is basically

237
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,040
and in case to PostScript it's the
usually the

238
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,240
therefore representing images but at the
end of the day it's the same postscript

239
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,810
whites polled it has because normally it
has like

240
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:08,080
for their soft or or printers which do
not support

241
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,150
PostScript interpreter it has a a binary

242
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:11,990
the

243
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,470
II binary

244
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:18,050
from are funk male kind of thing which
goes like pumping like this whatever

245
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:21,330
it seemed the Heather right and it goes
like this:

246
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:24,040
also for the

247
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:29,139
I'll for the pieces of software which
the support were in there but the reader

248
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:30,570
in the press for the

249
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,899
is also Tories with do not support
opposed to it

250
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:37,130
it'll just take the bitmap fun male and
display

251
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:40,170
okay so have with the this simple as
those

252
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,019
and the

253
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:45,809
will just loaded

254
00:14:45,809 --> 00:14:49,009
and as you can see just

255
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:53,759
hangs because it it tries to read the
file right it tries to execute

256
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:57,589
in the office interpreter

257
00:14:57,589 --> 00:15:00,939
and get stock and surprisingly not

258
00:15:00,939 --> 00:15:04,959
just cannot cancel play you have to kill
it

259
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,779
and I mean its you velvet

260
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:12,069
velvet vez basically no bike I mean

261
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:15,499
the barges in using the face but biz
know by because both companies like a

262
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:17,519
programming language is supposed to do
the loops

263
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:22,149
i mean but the idea of incorporating
like posted interpreter in a bit of both

264
00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:22,509
but

265
00:15:22,509 --> 00:15:25,759
F which is their programming language is

266
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:29,039
need some more design or some more
fourth security wise right

267
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:32,499
I mean you'll be surprised to find a job
in the weather in your

268
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:35,899
I'm a soft as well right I mean you can
do a lot of stuff but

269
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:39,359
okay we'll cue it

270
00:15:39,359 --> 00:15:43,189
now I'll

271
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:48,449
when male on the previous slide when I
said is dynamically typed in competitive

272
00:15:48,449 --> 00:15:52,379
whether a actually means is bed

273
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:55,459
a you can

274
00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:59,459
actually concatenate strings or past
eight months

275
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,899
okay you can concatenate this thing and

276
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:06,759
or statements you can compare them to be
executable or not

277
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:11,069
and basically you can say in now it's a
a string

278
00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:14,639
but then it's an executable peace so you
concatenate

279
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,959
and then amplitype so you can construct
problem the

280
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,259
program like on the flight right and

281
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:26,509
made is that you cannot statically
analyze the both groups 3

282
00:16:26,509 --> 00:16:30,839
because does because of these because
you can dynamically generate the program

283
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:31,549
on the flight

284
00:16:31,549 --> 00:16:36,019
so that your static analysis will not
work and the your ideas and IPS

285
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:39,189
rules will not war because in order to
understand all the

286
00:16:39,189 --> 00:16:42,899
program does you have to interpret it in
in any environment

287
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:46,089
and I'll I'll just show were

288
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:52,159
simply example where for example

289
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:59,069
you have okay so we have like

290
00:16:59,069 --> 00:17:02,419
two functions concatenated string or
men's think

291
00:17:02,419 --> 00:17:06,379
werewolf equivalent as you can see it
and

292
00:17:06,379 --> 00:17:09,929
missus hour or regional loop right which
gets the

293
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:13,569
denial of service on softer on printers
misses the loop

294
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:16,579
but a and it is commented

295
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:20,139
it's not active is here for the or don't
social purpose

296
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:23,619
now miss is ones are you

297
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:27,319
were something these ones

298
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:30,399
the the things you see are just the
strings

299
00:17:30,399 --> 00:17:35,470
we r I'll put in in their own point is

300
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:40,090
so this is a string misses a string
missus training and so on and so on

301
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:43,090
so what happens is you

302
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:46,809
in this case you see the same I

303
00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:50,440
accolade not delay them loop to right

304
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,809
and I put this on on their aspect all
the

305
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:57,259
Ave interpreter and then

306
00:17:57,259 --> 00:18:01,830
I just as long as bad as more than one
minute string on this that

307
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,629
I just marriage so all these

308
00:18:05,629 --> 00:18:09,220
small the sequences will will manage

309
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:13,710
and it will end up in a string which
looks like this

310
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:17,279
okay and then what you do is

311
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:22,009
you do converts the executable who here
comes that dynamically typed

312
00:18:22,009 --> 00:18:25,809
think so you can make you convert
executable I mean is not

313
00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:29,649
executable in percent but the third
executable for Microsoft Windows but if

314
00:18:29,649 --> 00:18:30,720
the executable

315
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,850
called in terms of course with the
interbedded so

316
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:37,159
you can go to the executable under fire
exact so I mean

317
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:41,730
and you can see about the this one is
the simplest form

318
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:44,859
of work creating that infinite loop

319
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:48,149
I mean you can go any including you like
the

320
00:18:48,149 --> 00:18:52,929
band of this case the court and you'll
never understand what happens

321
00:18:52,929 --> 00:18:56,119
because their causes then they would be
generated through

322
00:18:56,119 --> 00:19:00,519
more to do basically infinite the number
of puffs you can generate if you can

323
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:04,070
have a generator and it'll generate
languages

324
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:07,899
or a final statement in anyway a random
possible so

325
00:19:07,899 --> 00:19:10,960
and just executed so just for
demonstration and I'll

326
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,889
I'll do very quick okay so

327
00:19:15,889 --> 00:19:18,919
it's the same thing the but these

328
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:22,789
EPS for a month okay just a little bit
different

329
00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:26,159
Heather so I'll just open

330
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:30,840
world

331
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:36,980
no

332
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:40,309
so the side effect is the same

333
00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:43,639
I mean it demonstrates the company that
Eve

334
00:19:43,639 --> 00:19:47,340
the major and bad dynamically typed
major or the PostScript

335
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:51,629
and that's why I again the bad news is
that your ideas

336
00:19:51,629 --> 00:19:54,679
and I PSM anti virus will not work
because it's

337
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:57,840
most I think it cannot have anything
should just

338
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,179
fire the generator engine you're done

339
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:04,909
up as part of my academic exercise time
the

340
00:20:04,909 --> 00:20:07,919
working on a sandbox environment which
would

341
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,070
they could most people and the in a
somewhat environment

342
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:16,450
get the trace a bit to see if it's
malicious or not

343
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:20,149
now I'll another thing is that for
example

344
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:24,619
being a programming languages I mean
home interview or II think

345
00:20:24,619 --> 00:20:28,629
at least while everybody who wrote the
c:\program

346
00:20:28,629 --> 00:20:32,099
backtrack had their records Sivan stack

347
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:36,929
credit because it never ended right so
because the program them so you can

348
00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:40,879
you can actually do the same in airports
group where you can

349
00:20:40,879 --> 00:20:44,149
take a program and the

350
00:20:44,149 --> 00:20:47,240
you basically crash been through better
because it

351
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,980
you never and recursion so you have the

352
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:54,809
a function a and the you you call it

353
00:20:54,809 --> 00:20:58,519
because the link as you can see a Coles

354
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:01,849
a inside it so it's like a record the
funk and

355
00:21:01,849 --> 00:21:05,419
if you if you do for example open

356
00:21:05,419 --> 00:21:09,669
or on these a sample on there is
interpreters

357
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:12,990
like beat goes great or MS Office or the

358
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:16,919
some other let's say even printers I
some over interpret those

359
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:20,980
being wrongly implementing bill crash
and was

360
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:25,490
small example

361
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:28,759
the bad news for for his by for this
example is

362
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:32,099
but its not directly exploitable in
terms of

363
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:35,820
it by well by passing from was getting
there better to this

364
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,340
tackle their MS Office but you get the
general idea

365
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,429
I mean a give effective pressures I mean

366
00:21:42,429 --> 00:21:46,429
you can try to to find other ways to

367
00:21:46,429 --> 00:21:50,279
to get out of the sandbox

368
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:54,349
so basically just runnin questions 100
percent

369
00:21:54,349 --> 00:21:57,740
like it personal but I'm and Res other
ways to

370
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:02,070
we exhibit the sandbox basically and the
gets to their

371
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:05,250
a memory space over there program

372
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:12,250
which in incorporates be interpreted

373
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,230
okay now well I've fall from our
perspective there like

374
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:20,279
yeah Arbor program like most people or
some other implementation which

375
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:24,460
have various custom extensions because
they have like a standard

376
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:28,500
postscript to implementation and then
they because the

377
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,599
they need more but flexibility over time
they had some

378
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:35,940
got an extension so mostly in under
certain conditions

379
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:40,599
for example if you receive a file
usually talk to print it right

380
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:44,119
you would have to read and then print
the

381
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:48,379
if you're sure but in this case for
example just opened

382
00:22:48,379 --> 00:22:53,789
okay the and want to click OK I'm not
sure if in the back it will be seen but

383
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:57,859
here the you know where they're printing
icon appears

384
00:22:57,859 --> 00:23:01,369
it will appear printing icon directly
just opening

385
00:23:01,369 --> 00:23:05,490
directly it opens their connection to
your printer and basically you can

386
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:09,179
up to a certain degree you can control
the steam it still

387
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:12,210
some some some specifics

388
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:15,750
the not 100 percent reliable but you get
the idea

389
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:19,570
just opening the file for because of
some work out some

390
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:20,240
I

391
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,460
extensions just directly prints and bed

392
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:27,030
malicious bring stream can go directly
to your printer ink printer is

393
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:30,270
own as you can we'll see invest second
part of the stock

394
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:34,200
okay so again

395
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,240
I R functionality sometimes compromise
security because

396
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,340
once opening a file you don't expect it
ultimately bring

397
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:44,480
on this too have done some other
settings month

398
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,910
I'm not sure how many do do is okay

399
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:51,660
now vere their thing which I like a a
lot

400
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:54,680
is about possibly being a programming
language is that

401
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,760
it can actually do statement none

402
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,360
right I mean it can do if else and so on
so basically when that when

403
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,590
you open a file it can detect the
environment with runs

404
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:08,700
whether it runs on a printer whether
it's wrong gonna go script

405
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,760
the software or so on so basically

406
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,040
this example shows you as you can see it

407
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,390
where you that their product operator
and

408
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:22,310
the product operate the returns on the
spec I'll the product

409
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:25,750
I mean being violent way throng and for
Ghostscript its

410
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:29,400
a string we says GPL Ghostscript

411
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,900
right so basically what the

412
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:36,720
was good can do is like you have a
postscript file

413
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,300
having a malicious payload which also in
mistaken

414
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:44,960
talk part has a malicious payload and
the it excuse for example on the

415
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,000
on a printer X but it fails I'll

416
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,310
on my own use their PC because it's not
the printer so you want the user

417
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:55,620
to print the file directly on the
printer

418
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:59,610
was what the a social evening parties

419
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:02,650
you display like a if

420
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:06,770
you detect veteran by mint is
computer-based as

421
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:11,790
is you can see he is and he fails right
so the first part is beef

422
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:15,240
if it's GPL Ghostscript then it

423
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:19,820
display the image and the mich game be a
social engineer part

424
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,820
which says the printer driver in
counters

425
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:26,450
unexpected error please bring the stock
went directly using the

426
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:30,300
printer interface so basically you can
social engineer the user

427
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:34,260
by putting some fake where you mention
so

428
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:37,320
bad user will take a final okay if where

429
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:42,170
operating system or the printer driver
says print directly to their printer

430
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:46,080
does go to the interface with the
printer and and bomb

431
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,890
and in bed health wrench

432
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:53,920
the militia stuff goes here which means
but you put the militia stuff for the

433
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,440
printer

434
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,120
and when the user goes and Prince the

435
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,460
filing between three gets you get along
the printer

436
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,870
and another party's

437
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:08,660
for example again its dynamical so

438
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:13,280
you send the let's say a post group kind
of documents to

439
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,920
a guy and usually what what happens is
the use of always like this you're gonna

440
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:22,300
construct or a document you read it and
when you print the expected to be the

441
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,540
same thing right I mean

442
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:27,120
you poem interview printed like one
hundred-page contact and go again

443
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,910
after reading it on the skin go again a
reason for the paper nobody did right

444
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:32,610
you just read on the screen print sign

445
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:36,550
them so basically because it's like
dynamically typed

446
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:41,210
you can have a situation where you send
like an invoice or icon talk with says

447
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:45,360
okay pay $100,000 the user see the terms
right

448
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,660
he clicks pink on the printer ways like
in the Feltham say

449
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:55,170
okay let's put is 1000 why not the user
will not go to page 128 from one

450
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:58,910
following pages and read the exact
number and gives us time

451
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:02,560
or the sign the sign right so

452
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,830
again is like a good example I mean

453
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:09,040
I know technical stuff doesn't get
through very well but

454
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,440
this kind of business stuff gets very
well through so I mean

455
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,790
of course is not very common but the
businesspeople exchange documenting post

456
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:18,900
be four months but to get the general
idea

457
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:23,110
so and you'd be surprised by that

458
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:26,860
bass player when I starters where
finding this postscript the

459
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:31,740
pieces and pizzeria where trial I
actually started pumping those but then

460
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:35,930
surfers seems to be a a little bit why
there so

461
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:39,480
basically I try to do so. some kind of
charting categories

462
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,860
at the bottom is the is Gadhafi's

463
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:47,330
was cute in their beds or specification
and based on these I'll

464
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:50,750
bad I am implementation of the post
group standard which

465
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,800
the or have a result the beaches
airports group

466
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:58,260
interpreter which is the most I've Wes
author bears'

467
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:01,880
the Ghostscript a in the MS Office

468
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:05,270
axis of thick other because its own
interpreter because

469
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:08,950
yeah made in the Thunder they did their
own the rather I don't think there is

470
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,110
like a very

471
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:13,700
I call them various art is because
there's a lot of a

472
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:17,840
smaller companies which will do they
mean by that versions 0 mint or better

473
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,440
out on top you can see the actual and
and the result implications

474
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,510
which use various the interpreters

475
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:29,960
inside them or they are bathed on that
specific in the rest so you can see the

476
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,560
cops

477
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:34,870
or game or a lot they they're based on
Ghostly because they're on NBC

478
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:39,040
MS Office which is based on that is so
thick and so on and so on

479
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,220
okay so another or the perspective all
seeing

480
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,340
where I web affect the softer is

481
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:48,400
is for them to have a network and I try
to

482
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:52,800
make a category where potentially can
find these pieces of thoughts also so

483
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,040
based on the client machines you can
find this bar to go through

484
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,390
packages office or Adobe products not
all of them

485
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:02,470
on their network side there on the
printers

486
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:07,030
you you have the various artists and
also sometimes you have a

487
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:10,179
print server which is if ur dedicated
machine

488
00:29:10,179 --> 00:29:14,750
or a small box we just does their
layover print jobs

489
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:18,520
and you have cops running on them or
someone somewhere

490
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:22,740
in bed the in the weather sometimes okay
so

491
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:26,520
let the small the taxonomy and

492
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,660
okay because everything is now web to

493
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,710
20 web related it's the

494
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:35,840
very interesting to find that the

495
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,730
there are a lot of services on the
Internet which I cannot name because

496
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:44,159
more details have to come and but I mean

497
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,270
if you do your homework is you find them

498
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:51,440
I there on post group as part of their
job

499
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,710
products or as part of the processing
stream

500
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:57,750
so basically phone their own 20 services

501
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:02,220
well which run the PostScript and the

502
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:05,320
even Google was running it and the

503
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,280
the had the vulnerable version and they

504
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,590
the got want to reward for this

505
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:16,240
I'll but if funding is both the

506
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,620
them for example most of them were
running

507
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:23,210
I'll vulnerable versions of Ghostscript

508
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:27,170
as part of their I'll chain of
processing which is bed

509
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:33,090
I mean bed in the sense but most groups
I if you'll go in there and check the

510
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:37,140
exploit database you'll see some of the
proof of concepts which show

511
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:41,150
a the coverflow exploitation and so on
and so so basically

512
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:44,380
running well no version of ghost written
your network

513
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:49,010
if first part of your printing subsystem
or as part of some sort or processing

514
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:52,840
makes vulnerable there but specific
server as well

515
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:56,630
well some fun finding them but some will
run

516
00:30:56,630 --> 00:31:00,690
both groups as the root user I mean you
have to

517
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:04,880
have gots to run goes good as the root
user some of them were running without

518
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,670
safer

519
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:09,100
settings right I mean bizarre

520
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,679
some basic coverage but these are
findings in religion real

521
00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:18,040
web services so web is not free from
post group so I mean is not very well

522
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:18,410
the

523
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:21,760
very wide deployed but that is bad it
gives

524
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,640
a very good insight and and very
unexpected I thought victors

525
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,809
for machines which people do not

526
00:31:28,809 --> 00:31:32,230
expected to be right because it's just
so you know

527
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:35,530
doing some conventional were the

528
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:38,900
three more ease the doing some printing
stuff

529
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:42,910
which is not quite so we once you own
but motion or get the

530
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:46,390
lot of information from admission you
get much more a

531
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:49,950
attack surface okay resources

532
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:53,540
the general very very general post
groupings now

533
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:56,350
I'll move to the second part which was
the

534
00:31:56,350 --> 00:32:00,649
which is more device specific so

535
00:32:00,649 --> 00:32:03,690
as as as a sparkle the printer

536
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:08,370
research yeah as part of printer
research I'll 13 a phone

537
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:11,809
I find the way a to medically in bed

538
00:32:11,809 --> 00:32:15,779
the Commons in the war the document or
in JavaScript or in Java

539
00:32:15,779 --> 00:32:19,570
to worries the printer I got the way to

540
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:22,610
to send to send something to the printer
which I can control

541
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:25,769
the next logical step is like now

542
00:32:25,769 --> 00:32:28,820
you what you want the payload which does
something right

543
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:32,149
once you get through foot in the door
you want proper payload

544
00:32:32,149 --> 00:32:37,080
percent and the was not thinking give a
well-liked

545
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:41,200
too easy choices PCL and PostScript BC
ellis does and not the programming

546
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,909
language was cute is a programming
language you can the more so

547
00:32:43,909 --> 00:32:47,090
will go away I go for for postpaid

548
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:51,789
and basically we start looking for for
products which support

549
00:32:51,789 --> 00:32:56,879
postscript then the do funeral is how to
make them out to my to the way some time

550
00:32:56,879 --> 00:32:58,009
just manually

551
00:32:58,009 --> 00:32:59,970
and the

552
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:03,750
we'll come annual I found the mentation
which is

553
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:07,290
good to read the condition again for not
treating the condition read it

554
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:10,620
read it twice because it sometimes it
just gives you a very personal skins

555
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:15,010
for example if you go to the condition
from the rocks may say

556
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:18,200
its the page was says is a figure for

557
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,650
telegraphy in where update file and
press the green button to send it

558
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:26,260
and missus a on the page where you
actually

559
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:29,660
prine right you see print immediately
right

560
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:35,460
and it says fear where update file will
have a final extension of both PS

561
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:39,900
I mean doesn't it raises question when
you see a post we file with other film

562
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,530
where are they

563
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:46,410
of course if has very very nice stuff in
it a new go grab it and you go analyze

564
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:46,950
it

565
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:50,630
so 13 okay the compile and that

566
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:54,940
a good part of course bit okay if it's
not very well-off was gay that because

567
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:58,440
if you do with proper way it can be of
was getting very well

568
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,050
but usually it comes you know freeway
the source overflowing

569
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:05,420
is like doubles keeping the early days
everything is with the source

570
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:09,100
so start duplicating the compiling a

571
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:12,918
vote the was 15 when update them

572
00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:16,360
actually following various a API's

573
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:20,360
which basically is an extension of the
rocks we have a basic

574
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:24,390
the post 15th or better and on Talbot
have some customization

575
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:27,419
layer which helps them do some

576
00:34:27,419 --> 00:34:30,580
management or some a a

577
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:34,360
additional stuff with the divide so make
head

578
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:38,050
big sorts plugs API so basically you can

579
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:41,230
communicate with their makes for its
operating system

580
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:46,530
they have with debugging Q-eight guys
like generate pressure or generate bomb

581
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:47,190
pair or

582
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:50,810
and so on various it to a stuff the hell

583
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:53,890
logging bomb you could send somewhere
pulp

584
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:55,410
the pumper

585
00:34:55,410 --> 00:35:00,640
parameter for fourteen well millimeters
the

586
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,860
Londis ROM and flash and

587
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,700
basically the

588
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,690
there were several the direction which
where possible to go

589
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:13,390
if a food banks worse but it's and
requires a lot of work and basically you

590
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:14,140
have to know

591
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:17,770
make that big source version and to have
the executable

592
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:21,369
and to have a secure the will to exploit
to have need to have a development

593
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,380
environment which is

594
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:26,460
again very specific so well

595
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:29,630
whether the simplest thing if you see I
mean

596
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:32,760
peak missing glistening which somebody
who

597
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:36,020
from you would choose two-goal new

598
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:39,190
yeah from yeah ROM

599
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:43,490
I okay run these keys yet would but from
yet you go directly to the ROM

600
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:46,930
mean if you have rum you have everything
and actually

601
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:51,940
I'll some somewhere institutes says that
the 2012 we'll see you

602
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:55,020
the memory scraping on mobile devices on
or

603
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:58,609
embedded devices will still be in top 10
fred's

604
00:35:58,609 --> 00:36:01,890
members get is the simplest you get to
the memory get everything

605
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:05,390
so OK within the memory dumping is just
as crucial but

606
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:08,630
that is that you go for the is this
chain

607
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:11,680
and that memory dumping his is very
powerful

608
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,200
so basically as part of offer I

609
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,510
of memory dumping basically we set and

610
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:21,760
have had to run the memory dump or
import script which is

611
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,190
not quite the funny thing the ride but
when you end up with good results you're

612
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,609
satisfied with your on

613
00:36:27,609 --> 00:36:29,550
you you wrote the

614
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:32,570
post good memory dump a and

615
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:35,960
we we found bed for example

616
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:40,780
if you said administrator things
impossible don't on the device

617
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:44,160
and the basically a the

618
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,030
and run out the you say the device is
secure it has the

619
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:51,690
possible I mean strong password and the
user's

620
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:56,140
cannot locate the device and to add
another user or do some settings

621
00:36:56,140 --> 00:37:00,000
but if you connect to their printing
stream port

622
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,530
you have the ROM so basically setting
and password on their web interface

623
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:08,680
doesn't protect to in any way from there
on like this

624
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,550
the

625
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:13,730
on from the I'm like access a dock so
basically

626
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:17,370
administration fails to prevent memory
dumping Ann Arbor

627
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:20,630
API the second the doc

628
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:23,740
well I'll I'll be showing the the demos

629
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:26,780
the calls for some other salute with
later

630
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:30,840
I'll just explain by text so basically a

631
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,860
other scenarios which we found is that

632
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:37,540
for example that means that goes and the

633
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:40,710
I'll logs into to their

634
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:45,130
account to do some management so
basically they are tiger can go to the

635
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:49,720
I made movies we've get requests this is
important because in the GET request

636
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:54,770
everything using the URL in cleartext
and that is that

637
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:58,570
a in memory they have by web server

638
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:02,500
a logging a section and basically you go

639
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:06,080
you down the memory from the proper
location and because it together request

640
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,180
the URL

641
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:11,160
including the passwords is everything in
the clear taking the memory if they

642
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,170
would have done this as a hd2 be a POST
request

643
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:17,350
it will be in buffer but it's there very
imp

644
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:21,110
interesting point but things a small
thing like this but

645
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:24,590
re: doesn't matter it's a ghetto reports
right but it matters at the end of the

646
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:25,360
day because

647
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:29,790
air with get you have the URL being
logged and the

648
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:34,420
I correct like the the passport a

649
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:38,010
the second is like a continuation of
that %ah keys

650
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:41,150
after the user I'll missus all

651
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:44,350
for the passport change basically one
the

652
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:47,950
I mean change the password you you can
see their prime

653
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:51,180
there's been change in Europe this one
is when the

654
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:55,340
administrator loading basically all the
headers HTTP headers are there so

655
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:59,820
again in the memory you can find the
base64 encoded

656
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:03,000
basic OTE authentication strings so

657
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,380
again we somewhat small pattern the
recognition and memory dumping

658
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:10,630
you get the the most violators

659
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:14,450
possible being used to log into their
web interface

660
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:18,610
so the devices again compromise and

661
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:21,900
basically you'll vivid solution which
people

662
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:25,620
try to say is okay with SSL

663
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:29,560
as a so secure nevermind Bates buy
certificates or

664
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,620
self-signed certificates just closed
eyes it's fine I mean

665
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:37,390
if you or since is good but the problem
is what to do when your private key is

666
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:38,330
being leaked in

667
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:41,910
in memory I mean this is also a part
which has to be

668
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:45,100
properly analyzed when is not only for
the printer but I mean

669
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:48,759
for all the better divisive right
in-home interview

670
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:52,420
a or so or home until developers

671
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:55,660
you're not you about general developers
I'll

672
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:59,320
after implementing a very secure
solution goals have a memory

673
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:03,090
to see whether via licking stuff or not
not so many thing and

674
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:05,100
may have a dime piece the

675
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:08,680
missed as well been injected actually
the the private key is

676
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:12,760
being in the memory Lee so it basically
a

677
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:18,010
cancels all their benefits of SSL and
also

678
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:21,020
there are some default keys the which
you're in the

679
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:25,090
being used in Example them their use it
we have a copy paste mental

680
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:29,110
okay I'll governor think

681
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:32,480
is vet when the I user

682
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,910
the sends the documents to

683
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:40,000
to the printer to to send it can stand
Vic let's go away which means

684
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,540
I'll plain text

685
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:48,260
and no bus or I'll some people started
to

686
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:52,370
doing some encryption so bad that
document itself is being created over

687
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:53,690
the wire so

688
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:57,770
simple Wireshark sniffing would not
receive a document which is a

689
00:40:57,770 --> 00:41:02,170
would step but their already is bat

690
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:06,560
how good the encryption would be on the
network anyway vet

691
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,150
file would be the created in the printer
to be able to be

692
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:14,130
bring to the right so at the end of the
day it will be some way into memory in

693
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:14,860
cleartext

694
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:18,460
so no matter what bus or a user setup
for for their

695
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:22,270
printer a before sending the paint job
so you have some

696
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:25,320
printers whale golan swipe your card
though in for a pin

697
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:28,490
in order to be able to get the printout
so the people

698
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:33,300
think but by putting but number or
having the swipe card basically

699
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:38,070
in creeps everything which is F holes
actually to a to all

700
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:41,180
false friend it gives you a force
protection

701
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:44,940
you think you put the pin everything is
secure it

702
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:48,620
even VoIP with a p/e as you'll see it
goes clear text

703
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:51,810
uneven vol where they are administrator
than

704
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:56,180
it or increase the traffic over the
network in just

705
00:41:56,180 --> 00:42:00,970
putting a layer of protection that
document is being gay in plain text

706
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:04,290
so just the

707
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:10,730
aqui okay so

708
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:13,860
we have a the Modesto cool

709
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:17,480
mistaking that be

710
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:21,010
have a very modest ok is offer let's say

711
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:24,580
high official or air hi the

712
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:27,730
high rank manager and

713
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:31,950
he wants to to print the document and
usually what happens there %um

714
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:32,680
imprinting

715
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:37,020
one thing to your when printing to
network printers

716
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:40,970
is but your printer driver connects to
the port none 91 usually

717
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:45,650
its ninety-nine percent it connects to
port 9100 all their printer

718
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:49,310
and it sends the they don't do with
bring their own but poor

719
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:52,780
Solbi showing like a simulation what

720
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:56,410
the the a printer driver would do in the
case over

721
00:42:56,410 --> 00:43:01,940
high-ranking official so the printer
driver would connect to the sport

722
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:08,690
and the a official with have a
documented

723
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:12,940
right well created in MS towards paying
the

724
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:15,960
not bad whatever have a editorials and

725
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:20,240
when bear hiring official let's say
introduces a row

726
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:24,590
a password or a pin it gets the usually
get said the

727
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:27,870
be jail said hold key like 1337 whatever

728
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:32,890
right and or a bus or you can be like
for some specific models you can be user

729
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:33,580
key

730
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:37,500
and their alphanumeric when it's cold
Keith on the numbers

731
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:41,310
so the user their parent official things
okay I put possible

732
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:45,070
I have put my pimp and let's bring that

733
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:49,450
the Panthers rival driver will take bows
pin numbers and so on

734
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:53,020
will create these post was crude other
not the three

735
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:57,390
okay

736
00:43:57,390 --> 00:44:01,630
and live but I love the doc meant to be
very secret and includes a document

737
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:05,940
because we wanted to be secret then its
for their high ranking officials

738
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:11,460
and the printer drivers take this
three-man sense to the

739
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:14,810
to the printer okay and its

740
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:21,440
link the the pinball other it's the

741
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,740
its finishing with pinto cocaine vet
printer diver disconnects

742
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:26,940
from the

743
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:31,180
printer and now we are on the

744
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:35,380
attackers machine you don't see an very
modest ok whether or not the commotion

745
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:36,210
and that I can

746
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:40,079
goes I is about security

747
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:41,500
he goes to the

748
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:44,850
a to the same printer and he connects

749
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:50,570
buy tools or mentally to the same port
9100 and Rhonda memory bumper which I

750
00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:53,930
mention and for

751
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:57,220
very specific region basically he is a
member number which

752
00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:00,440
the it tastes like

753
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,460
of near 40 X 26 and I Cal

754
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:08,930
you cannot really is because yeah the
cases to open well

755
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:12,030
okay so that I couldn't their memory
dumping

756
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:15,869
a new okay besides over

757
00:45:15,869 --> 00:45:19,710
logs on the stuff in their memory

758
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:22,930
you can see Matt

759
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:26,050
matoco got the memory

760
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:30,560
bumping and you see that against title
for seeing them so on

761
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,869
medical you get everything in plain text
memory right I mean

762
00:45:33,869 --> 00:45:37,099
doesn't matter if the pain doesn't
matter having people unit or in the

763
00:45:37,099 --> 00:45:38,380
memory the Penrith

764
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:42,270
anyway it's clear thanks so I mean you
get the

765
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:47,990
that they don't you also get the VIP

766
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:51,650
right you know who printed what's
printed

767
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:55,869
what is there a usual p.m. password
username

768
00:45:55,869 --> 00:45:59,770
a basically you get with a very good
profiling over there that

769
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:02,940
you have the the most hardcore they they
can get from a printer

770
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:05,970
so

771
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:09,349
I mean let's let's the bet the over them

772
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:14,680
you have everything in in cleartext okay
just moved

773
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:18,490
limit quicker I'll

774
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:22,849
okay a Valverde more which is i want to
show is

775
00:46:22,849 --> 00:46:26,430
for example printer besides forgetting
the documents war

776
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:31,349
pins or being a fun devices it can be
used there too

777
00:46:31,349 --> 00:46:35,300
just come silently the network because
what happens printers have a service

778
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:37,640
discovery protocols UPnP and so on

779
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:41,450
so when they connect the networks they
want to know what Prince over the

780
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:44,410
they want to know what I'm hoping
there's our because all various

781
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:45,890
configurations top 40

782
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:49,180
because of errors default software
installed in the printer

783
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:52,990
so when it starts and connects to the
network is starts conning

784
00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:57,680
right and then it keeps everything in
its memory so what they're not like you

785
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,450
can do

786
00:46:58,450 --> 00:47:03,040
it can have a full let's say a full
local topology or the network

787
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,220
we've on doing anything and it's gone
any

788
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:10,380
and a mop whatever I mean does connect
to the printer and get the pol gene

789
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:14,550
printer do that for you not no need to
to make additional noise on the wire

790
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:17,960
so again miss missus the

791
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:22,440
the next them ways for they think I

792
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:26,800
the printer do the let's come for you
and

793
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:30,170
basically I do that

794
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:34,060
just one second want

795
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:41,060
sorry for this

796
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:45,250
okay so basically

797
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:52,250
I'm running a memory dump all

798
00:47:56,739 --> 00:48:00,609
it's the Lulu painful with the member
number because some regions are not my

799
00:48:00,609 --> 00:48:01,699
job to move a

800
00:48:01,699 --> 00:48:04,749
the device keeper setting so to get them
real name

801
00:48:04,749 --> 00:48:09,429
memory map is it takes some time because
the device when the printer between

802
00:48:09,429 --> 00:48:10,089
three sets

803
00:48:10,089 --> 00:48:14,160
it takes like five minutes for it to
warm up back get back online check all

804
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,150
it strays

805
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:20,109
Jill Colvin organized what's kind of
things you get when you get there like

806
00:48:20,109 --> 00:48:20,859
and I might

807
00:48:20,859 --> 00:48:24,049
memory and basically if you have like to
congress

808
00:48:24,049 --> 00:48:27,219
at fifty-six megabytes or more is like

809
00:48:27,219 --> 00:48:30,679
takes more KK it can take several days
just to

810
00:48:30,679 --> 00:48:34,569
the keeper said think and keep mapping
the commemorates bit painful

811
00:48:34,569 --> 00:48:38,390
if you don't buy the the configuration
the

812
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:41,719
okay so as you can see four all for the
memory

813
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:45,339
the we we have the

814
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:48,630
with first is okay

815
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:51,969
the 0 got 1 and

816
00:48:51,969 --> 00:48:56,569
it's the linux-based device UPnP support
is running

817
00:48:56,569 --> 00:48:59,959
mean UPnP them on the okay

818
00:48:59,959 --> 00:49:02,470
and its it is my actual the

819
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:05,670
router which I used in my another set up

820
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:10,000
so you get the first thing

821
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,230
I mean you know lower the what is the
router what is the

822
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:16,430
the version so basically

823
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:20,599
alt what is possible to do is if you
know where these

824
00:49:20,599 --> 00:49:24,160
Linux kernel version running this to BMP
driver

825
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,400
well have a exploits you can

826
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:30,569
thank you from seeing Turing complete

827
00:49:30,569 --> 00:49:33,569
postscript all scripts printer

828
00:49:33,569 --> 00:49:37,119
on right and basically the printer loop
on your

829
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:40,289
device does because it can do any

830
00:49:40,289 --> 00:49:44,270
the basic if statement and because this
during complete the set

831
00:49:44,270 --> 00:49:47,970
everything you can do anything you can
do in most people ok it

832
00:49:47,970 --> 00:49:52,010
in this case with Xerox it helps big
because we have access to

833
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:56,130
I'll V's special API but in other cases
may have also

834
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:59,869
another vendor they have also especially
guys which you can find

835
00:49:59,869 --> 00:50:04,490
so bed is that you can take an exploit
with impose great

836
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:07,549
and check for exploitable devices

837
00:50:07,549 --> 00:50:11,869
from the printer yeah

838
00:50:11,869 --> 00:50:15,200
we will also have another device which
was a number

839
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,670
printer it was a

840
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:21,920
an HP so basically we have all the
details

841
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,200
and in memory you can see is

842
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,849
all the details days baby in the bay
model number

843
00:50:28,849 --> 00:50:32,779
so again you can start playing like
sending

844
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:37,260
militias jobs from one printer to a
novel just hoping for the network

845
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:40,950
right mean everything is possible so
basically you

846
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:44,110
its they're they're all to make the

847
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:47,580
I there could be a so spread is
spreading warm on

848
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:51,660
on the printers which is some some work
to do but

849
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:55,490
it's definitely doable having some were
some basic memory the

850
00:50:55,490 --> 00:50:58,750
dumping stuff and the some

851
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:00,930
exercise with the post group the helps

852
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:06,390
so its across the device in these over
the bullshit we r

853
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:09,790
to about Michael and also

854
00:51:09,790 --> 00:51:13,509
wavelet doorway you like bill d like to

855
00:51:13,509 --> 00:51:16,969
thought gets you know you can new
whatever

856
00:51:16,969 --> 00:51:20,739
stuff you want like connect do being
they did they tell

857
00:51:20,739 --> 00:51:23,779
from memory X filtrate in creeped

858
00:51:23,779 --> 00:51:27,449
you can implement all kind of encryption
cashing in

859
00:51:27,449 --> 00:51:30,709
postscript and textile trade the data
outside

860
00:51:30,709 --> 00:51:34,689
okay so basically lets the

861
00:51:34,689 --> 00:51:38,529
month rick's which with with up to

862
00:51:38,529 --> 00:51:43,159
to show but basically there's no
privilege level separation as they said

863
00:51:43,159 --> 00:51:47,389
now that mean the settings the not
separate the privilege

864
00:51:47,389 --> 00:51:48,660
on the

865
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:52,150
for the printing the port or printing
user

866
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:55,930
printing process well it doesn't have a
secure passwords that are like

867
00:51:55,930 --> 00:52:01,230
everything is in clear text them need to
get the HTTP requests well

868
00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:05,109
it leads to a secure base it on the
fishing day fail it leaks the

869
00:52:05,109 --> 00:52:08,789
STPs as the silkies lolol the

870
00:52:08,789 --> 00:52:12,630
not alert the old G protection I mean as
you can see into them all

871
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:16,099
no in memory book win protection which
is quite hard to do because

872
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:19,460
well anything have to be

873
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:23,220
at some way to create an but the problem
is that they do not clean up the memory

874
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:27,099
may just three hits Monday do not clean
up which is another problem like

875
00:52:27,099 --> 00:52:30,690
the front program perspectives like free
before but it's still in the memory

876
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:31,230
right

877
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:34,400
well and yet there's no

878
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,650
first look at the restriction on the on
the divisive so all love is if you sum

879
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:40,640
up you you get the very powerful

880
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:45,029
very organized the away both owning
printers are mostly from the printers

881
00:52:45,029 --> 00:52:46,069
all mobile devices

882
00:52:46,069 --> 00:52:49,079
as a they mention you can Jake

883
00:52:49,079 --> 00:52:52,079
if the router is exploitable both

884
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:56,299
explosive missed you have a big boost to
document having like 20 exploitable

885
00:52:56,299 --> 00:52:57,210
there is being

886
00:52:57,210 --> 00:53:00,410
just fired then see what what you can on
in but network

887
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:05,190
and there's like a a big number. oh
there is some of those

888
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:08,680
will which you're well fitted by the

889
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:12,109
superior API exposed the

890
00:53:12,109 --> 00:53:16,150
they're still fixing because the
apparently the

891
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:19,200
impact bases quite I month

892
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,460
yes often used since the the case is
open and

893
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:25,569
I don't know exactly when when it will
be fixed

894
00:53:25,569 --> 00:53:29,609
okay so just have the

895
00:53:29,609 --> 00:53:33,329
short time I'll just go very quickly not
chill

896
00:53:33,329 --> 00:53:36,549
and got stuck in a nutshell you both
like me is not occur send an email

897
00:53:36,549 --> 00:53:37,940
or send the

898
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:41,770
URL to the victim the they may contain
the

899
00:53:41,770 --> 00:53:45,350
non malicious for computer although
common but which contains malicious

900
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:48,630
all screwed stream embedded into it
which end up on the printer

901
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:51,820
or I love this site the

902
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:55,280
site sense to the user I'll has the

903
00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:00,030
JavaScript or Java versions sending a
malicious payload to the printer

904
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:03,960
the user opens but I spent in the open
besides

905
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:09,150
sees the freebie by the bites the bait
for social engineering at arc is a free

906
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:09,850
coupon

907
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:13,220
free ticket to Madonna concert whatever
imagination is like

908
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:17,170
limitless well P just Prince the

909
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:20,839
postscript 3 manned up in the

910
00:54:20,839 --> 00:54:23,650
MFP and from there demos

911
00:54:23,650 --> 00:54:27,049
are looking for the sensible but

912
00:54:27,049 --> 00:54:30,049
in a not so that once lied to cover a
little

913
00:54:30,049 --> 00:54:34,019
so yeah their first the stage 1 and
stage stores like

914
00:54:34,019 --> 00:54:37,130
the first part of my research from 2000
then to

915
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:40,410
11-member stage freeze the

916
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:42,020
current the

917
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:45,270
research direction okay so

918
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:48,869
the the solution as I mentioned these
because it's a programming language

919
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:51,480
again postscript uni their dynamic

920
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:55,590
execution environment and the dynamic
institution I'll which

921
00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:59,460
you analyze and see wats functionality
or Wat

922
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:02,490
Super eight guys it uses and so on so
basically

923
00:55:02,490 --> 00:55:05,740
I'm working into at having at

924
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:09,410
sandbox environment where you you upload

925
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:13,130
a postscript file through their web
interface for example it will be

926
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:14,369
published Maybin

927
00:55:14,369 --> 00:55:17,609
one month I hope the

928
00:55:17,609 --> 00:55:21,970
some kind of a better way you can upload
your file suspicious files or all the

929
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:23,490
ones who wants to bed

930
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:28,160
and it will analyze them tell well very
is suspicious militias for

931
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:32,190
does quite safe to to send to the
printer or to open on both groups

932
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:35,920
and yeah well

933
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:40,570
want their offense inside is a very
interesting the

934
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:44,480
idea to integrate some of their they
mentioned to take some exploits from

935
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:45,240
Metasploit

936
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:48,820
put them in post before mud because its
portable leads

937
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:53,080
platform-independent as well and the
have them integrated

938
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:57,869
the basically for them to PostScript and
then depending on the platform

939
00:55:57,869 --> 00:55:59,030
integrating various

940
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:03,400
have endorse exploits well

941
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:07,060
yes some solutions I'll I'll just go
very quickly because they won't leave

942
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:11,349
time for questions well some
acknowledgement they want to do

943
00:56:11,349 --> 00:56:15,660
me the Post reporter research was done
on the support of

944
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:20,170
security research loves very cool guys
well

945
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:24,230
and somewhere some thanks so

946
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:27,609
but take aways well for this is both
Emma bizarre

947
00:56:27,609 --> 00:56:31,089
like very bad the secure than general
their career

948
00:56:31,089 --> 00:56:34,570
be potential fall apart me go back to
your face

949
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:37,990
I'll they might be upcoming

950
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:41,670
I i'm not doing a few the or hype but

951
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:44,780
its potential I for

952
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:49,380
up coming up talks in form of course
group streams like whatever bye file or

953
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:50,660
by URL or

954
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:55,000
some internal autox and the

955
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,160
basically securing them appease the
requires better segmentation better for

956
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:02,530
on designing the net or is requires the
better

957
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:03,380
a

958
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:07,970
our sole source solutions which are like
engine Paul

959
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:11,019
you can then check my upcoming papers
the

960
00:57:11,019 --> 00:57:15,740
and the videos the from the store come
from previous research to come

961
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:19,599
so on my YouTube channel e4 interest in
the in them at the door in the

962
