1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:08,040
the you

2
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:21,570
thanks guys so it's a pleasure to be our

3
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,599
and trying to make it to be funny

4
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:27,919
I don't want to get I know that's what I
and probably me as well

5
00:00:27,919 --> 00:00:31,329
we will day was a retail for nice tall x
saw

6
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:35,079
missus the last one so they last a
fourth

7
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:38,550
and then we are done so all from

8
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,190
this book is about to the privacy of a
security risk a

9
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:46,610
Ave called a computing services and

10
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:50,680
to briefly about myself a so I'm i'm
italian as you can understand from the

11
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,210
accent

12
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,579
and and then moved to France II warfare
for

13
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:59,510
a five years on I spent the last three
are doing research

14
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:05,339
in a research lab in their self roth and
then previously I was working for

15
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:09,289
different companies doing at petition
past the military just says meant so any

16
00:01:09,289 --> 00:01:10,369
kind of security

17
00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:13,700
course I'll to sing Sirius and recently
I E

18
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:18,070
I joined Trend Micro a when I am their
senior threat researcher

19
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,800
okay so this is their autumn up for
today

20
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,030
so I we started nine to you seeing the
beat

21
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:28,160
up early with his car computing but I
think you are

22
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,679
but much expert on this i in particular
we focus on a1

23
00:01:32,679 --> 00:01:36,619
spittle series of a cloud computing did
which is gonna I S

24
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:41,080
and we look at the Amazon ec2 it is
probably the most famous

25
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:45,110
a service provider all these type

26
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:48,729
they wheeler define what these the
problem

27
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:52,789
eloy for use it to look but we develop
and

28
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:56,640
to automatically a analyze the

29
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,920
the Amazon easy to serious and tool to
study the

30
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,229
the different the problematic serrated
to the use of this there always a

31
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:04,860
serious

32
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,259
we've been to conclude weaver some less
on but we want to bring on

33
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:13,470
and and that's all okay so

34
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:17,180
what is cloud computing get if you look
at that the pedia

35
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,550
be a says that these are the delivery of
computing

36
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,690
as a serious rather than a product what
does it mean

37
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:27,590
it means that at using get

38
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,650
in at war it usually is internet you can
to get

39
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,770
access to the Foreign Service such as a

40
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:36,940
obligation on for example a

41
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:40,500
Google made is an application
mitterrand's over the Internet

42
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,070
platform for sample platter for
developing a

43
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:49,050
a software are not to be this already
the infrastructure are so that means

44
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,230
that there you can arrange the a

45
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:54,819
over the Internet like cast or ash or

46
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:59,560
competition so as you can see

47
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,130
clouded is some ol and the all a new
concept

48
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:06,510
in fact this be in there are on scene
the cell I

49
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:10,700
me arse so popular distributed and grid
computing get

50
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:15,750
been use their I for a while from by
year scientists

51
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,990
the government and a different
organization for example for doing what

52
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,940
about a planning

53
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,420
I'll weather forecast I modeling of
economic

54
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,490
so that is nothing new there saw

55
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:31,240
so what these that what is cloud
computing wide nowadays everybody's to

56
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,459
give cloud computing

57
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:36,840
because God computing is there is a
commodity so who does a

58
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,900
not use cloud nowadays just take for
example

59
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,290
as we're seeing a Google made that's a
cloud service or

60
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,610
I mean I guess most of us probably are
using

61
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:51,080
add the domain cell why because it's

62
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,220
easy to use a I in fact that the cloud
the is a kind of

63
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:59,280
ready to go service you go over the
Internet you choose your service

64
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,290
you pay if you have to pay you click and
you're ready to go

65
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,560
so you have been made set up for you you
have a

66
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,740
for example in the air if you think at
that Dropbox

67
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,569
you're there some store as somewhere or
a to be used

68
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:15,730
or if we look what we win looking up

69
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:19,180
Amador you can easily buying a server
over the crowd

70
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,370
unit couple of clicks so

71
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:25,699
there are three main mall the other
called service

72
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:28,789
I one is called Software as a Service

73
00:04:28,789 --> 00:04:32,699
now once called the platform is Sirius
and the first one is called the

74
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:33,690
infrastructure

75
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:38,159
the serious so I'm the first one what is
provided by the cloud

76
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:41,289
he is there software like at

77
00:04:41,289 --> 00:04:44,789
the SERM for example Salesforce

78
00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:48,330
provided CRM over a cloud so ether

79
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:52,419
Stoppers web is providing an hour the
software to work out

80
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:56,639
and the car can provide or some other
software like he made games

81
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,319
and so on bed about not having
reasonable modell

82
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:04,360
have it is called up after a service
where what is provided by the cloud is

83
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,050
that

84
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:08,199
a ver compy computing on a solution to
find a

85
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:12,289
for development for example Microsoft as
we're

86
00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:15,409
on it Google up in Jain

87
00:05:15,409 --> 00:05:18,650
and the for the mall that which is a
modded Wii Ware

88
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:23,499
try to to look at a it's a record
infrastructure is serious

89
00:05:23,499 --> 00:05:27,629
so what is provided by the by the
service provider easier if are some

90
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:30,490
computers for example physical abuse
trial

91
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:34,479
or even a store as a fire or or even
networks

92
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,939
so in peace a I S a series

93
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:40,960
the leader is a is Amazon

94
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,080
we ve is a serious with this code that

95
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,339
plastique computer clout K the

96
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:50,749
their cronies ay si tu and the

97
00:05:50,749 --> 00:05:54,969
services be the main play at about that
our van a ver

98
00:05:54,969 --> 00:06:00,169
up a lot of other competing doors for
some poor famous name iraq's base

99
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:04,279
Terremark a giant so they pretty much do
the same things

100
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:08,939
the and probably sell them for you
probably are cheaper

101
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:12,719
and and the problem this is because that

102
00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:16,960
probably fear the network a in

103
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:22,270
the amount of their coverby is it a day
that they can offer its a bit less

104
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:27,050
a.m. so what what all these a service
provider of our

105
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,050
is the access to waive your to ELISA

106
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:34,300
said a very image and their out talking
to pee

107
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,669
you're usually on a hourly or mon-fri
beezies

108
00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:42,919
so we see these winged it aid so let's
look at I was a eighties 82 Amazon a

109
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:43,749
see-through

110
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:49,259
and user can a arranged what I what is
called an Amazon machine image

111
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:52,650
okay and be said

112
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,689
I was almost machine image usually to
machina

113
00:06:55,689 --> 00:06:59,069
the diese a voter Windows
autumnleighoaks

114
00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:03,300
and is usually called the worst under
software classic example are you want to

115
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,689
set up a sampler

116
00:07:04,689 --> 00:07:08,110
a your internet site

117
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:11,999
so you can go for Outlook up for a for a
machine that there's a some specific of

118
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:14,719
you would have shown some specific web
OPP

119
00:07:14,719 --> 00:07:18,210
you just choose machine select you pay

120
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:21,789
you pal you put your credit card Seok
around bomb

121
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:26,629
and then you can ready for that in OWL
are week on a 4-yard and you get charge

122
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:31,229
have any mouth for an amount that you
with you sweetie image

123
00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:34,589
at the same time was interesting is more
that is that

124
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:38,300
at the user itself can publish image

125
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,680
to the cloud okay so

126
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,610
now free different type of user first
one is Amazon itself

127
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:49,580
summers and provide the infrastructures
but also provided some image

128
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:53,469
K bed about indeed love solar temple me
I can that

129
00:07:53,469 --> 00:07:57,680
the verity up set up an image and
uploaded to the cloud

130
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,129
they can say ok ABC's at public
everybody can use this image

131
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:05,229
K event at a food party companies

132
00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:09,610
that there should be run a business on
these Moda solve a pre-configured thus I

133
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:10,830
mean age

134
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:14,659
and then they put the middle of a cloud
and they ask your comments on a

135
00:08:14,659 --> 00:08:18,300
to charred extra cost that so in this
way when a user

136
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,869
or entity made for the for type yes to
pay twice the pay for

137
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:25,399
Amazon for BA infrastructure for rape

138
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:28,399
up processing capabilities and

139
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:31,979
the surf third party company for a for
having provided the

140
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:35,020
the midge so

141
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:39,120
our time I can be bo2 that freeway to be
done and I for teeth from alive sees

142
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,649
them

143
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:42,789
so you have your air your with the
operating system like this

144
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:46,570
located smack for the report was ever
win this yet but it will I can run from

145
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:47,529
command line

146
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:50,870
a we do what I can stop shop for the
live sees them

147
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:55,350
we put in a easel an event that I can
upload a visa on the cloud

148
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:58,560
you can be derived from a from a bf
twyla

149
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,569
I machine age which have ready all you
can clone eat

150
00:09:02,569 --> 00:09:05,810
from Ann Arbor MI say can take one which
is already running

151
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:11,620
is able to cloud I can take it grozny
and that uploaded over a cloud

152
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,660
vented in are going to start an image

153
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:18,910
okay so I was on provide the even if the
IU

154
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:22,130
but you can they're used to start the
middle from Carmel I not from the

155
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,589
scripting

156
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:28,860
all you can do it using the webapp in
any case if the specified the credential

157
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,110
between use it to login to VMI

158
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:35,509
usually for and for alien ok said

159
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:39,139
he's a mmm is there is a public

160
00:09:39,139 --> 00:09:43,540
SSH key K so you have to say okay this
is Mikey

161
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,949
star to be seen it will be skiing so
what I was in da the around the mid and

162
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:48,370
have an apple a day

163
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:52,630
yada you are a key to remit so that only
your

164
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:56,360
yourself can access to the NIT then you
have to specify the defense resources

165
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:01,250
you won't like how much memory for a
prophesy RBR your performance on

166
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:05,060
in reach a region you want to be made to
start percent believe my businesses in

167
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:05,800
Europe

168
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,899
I would like to I we it makes sense to
put the meat in Europe

169
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,959
is that if your business for simple why
did you want to

170
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:16,970
lot bottles beloved you can start to be
made an awesome it one in you ass

171
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:22,329
when he knew it up one in Asia up Sun

172
00:10:22,329 --> 00:10:26,769
okay finally when they're when you've
got a good image in you start

173
00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:30,199
the mich and you can reach

174
00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:34,199
I would only give your and of name
committees on these form

175
00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:39,029
so easy to minus I P my nose the
different regions like Asia

176
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:44,290
not a computer that Amazon ABS look calm
and that it will be accessible the %ah

177
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:49,920
SSH or a remote desktop if you are under
Windows

178
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,629
okay what is important to to see your
eyes that I weather does not care about

179
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:55,779
securing be made

180
00:10:55,779 --> 00:11:00,120
what does it mean it means that the user
is completely IRS possible

181
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,399
a to maintain this server

182
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:07,149
so that means that their abuser as
always a root privilege

183
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:11,019
because he needed to administer BC stem
so it is a key point

184
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:15,029
and we will get back to these later on

185
00:11:15,029 --> 00:11:18,430
yet a couple screenshot on IBM Amazon
the

186
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:22,199
Management Console for example the seal
the corner

187
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:25,459
up left your you can that too was very
John

188
00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:29,009
when he won the match start like a I
drowned

189
00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:33,110
yet you have a key PR so that means my
sht that

190
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:36,230
I want to use a putting the gateway to
the image

191
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:40,079
medicaid Kiki at large when you click ER

192
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,089
be set a pop come up sold out even
though he's a very quick start a lot

193
00:11:44,089 --> 00:11:45,420
about some predefined

194
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,110
email each per sample first one is in
units are provided by Amazon itself

195
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,550
because it has an Amazon logo

196
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:55,610
and is marked as their at favorite

197
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:59,430
and other wanna is that this is a red
dot this is an able to sleep can choose

198
00:11:59,430 --> 00:11:59,940
if you want

199
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:03,100
6442 when you start death

200
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,699
%uh to be made that I don't mind so much
as private

201
00:12:06,699 --> 00:12:10,370
so nobody asking around except me and be
serve the community and I

202
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:14,069
but at a most interesting why not buy em
i've a toda they are

203
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:18,990
the to be used by everybody so when it
would be made but they start

204
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:22,420
be made to get loaded and when it's
running

205
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:26,269
yet your which kind of ads all has been
run

206
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:29,360
and that's the public they left where
you can about

207
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,040
reach me image there but he's also a
private IP address

208
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,050
saw every images to interface one of the
public AP one of the Private Network

209
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:41,220
allowed them

210
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,310
okay so that's the first part

211
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:48,399
a the stability in production

212
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,730
physically RTF me your question before a
cool

213
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:55,180
all the cool part

214
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,910
okay so a popular Prachi are

215
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:03,379
in this I was on ec2 is to the possible
to create out to create

216
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:06,920
publishing share our satellite images
with other users

217
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:11,529
so if it draws from all that between
called provider in user

218
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:15,220
is well-defined in the says that I was
that is not going to hurt you

219
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:18,240
what these not clearly that was the

220
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,699
the mall the between the image provided
a and the user

221
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:25,100
in fact the user can create and share
images

222
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:30,310
as well so make the walkway Sinaloa
researches around is a bs1

223
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,350
are very threats associated with brain
team

224
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:38,100
images from public catalogue of cloud
computing providers

225
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:42,850
anti-fur OTA pratt's to text and the

226
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:46,209
saw in particular we look at three
different problems the first one is that

227
00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:47,449
cool same inga

228
00:13:47,449 --> 00:13:51,540
a securing the meet again because they
are not a tax

229
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:55,680
suppose you're antonin age and you want
to make sure that no other people can

230
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,490
access your image

231
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:00,899
the first one is a cue to be made
against many shows a major provider

232
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:05,879
because it if you start any veggie you
don't know who is great BC midge

233
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:09,389
I'm going to make sure that the the
provider because we gave it up for the

234
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:09,800
mid

235
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,069
is not money she also is not as luck
would have it image

236
00:14:13,069 --> 00:14:16,949
battle part was for you to use them

237
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:21,569
and the for trainees to about sanitizing
the midget to protect the privacy

238
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:25,560
all the provider so what we need to be
there

239
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:30,100
we develop an automated system for the
security and I season and measurement of

240
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,949
these three problems

241
00:14:31,949 --> 00:14:36,310
and the week desolate appeared a
seven-month all the public satellite

242
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:39,499
image provided by amazonian need for
data center

243
00:14:39,499 --> 00:14:43,430
okay so US East Coast West Coast

244
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:46,689
Europe and Asia and be successfully

245
00:14:46,689 --> 00:14:49,769
Es Cana more min at five thousand
machine

246
00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:52,959
in the ultimate way

247
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,980
so I would eat we did with the tool
other to call us up and cloud

248
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,209
at faith

249
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:04,740
cloud because it work on the cloud south
on because it's an avid tool

250
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:08,249
and because it sounds a bit like
SoundCloud

251
00:15:08,249 --> 00:15:11,639
and the tour is composed of three main
components of every

252
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:14,670
robot that is the seat and MI check

253
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:19,100
betty is that correctly running I
retriever

254
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,470
check with Michelle and give you okay

255
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:25,990
so battling to be when the MIS been is
both yet Ian

256
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:30,730
Pasig order to to scan their one is
called a when he's in a mood scanner

257
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:34,959
I bet scanning the machine from the
remote point of view from a network

258
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,699
dollar one is a local scanner so they
took a scandal-tainted Kate

259
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:43,249
to the machine and execute their some
past from the inside

260
00:15:43,249 --> 00:15:46,389
so he's to stand out from a compliment
or

261
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:50,779
completely complementary to each other
soviet this simple one is a remote scan

262
00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:51,370
their

263
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:55,199
let missus just a simple compliment so
we use and map

264
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,819
to collect information 11 network so we
scanned the VA

265
00:15:58,819 --> 00:16:02,829
beer they've AP address Ave a CD to wean
stars

266
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:07,300
to collectively still open port the air
the 52 that the fair

267
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,410
fight if there is a web server if it is
a web application running

268
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:16,180
at a different web modules the finances
resort reports

269
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:20,170
we see that the video visa later on just
remember that this is one things we do

270
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:24,279
when we scan the image let's now look at
the local scanner

271
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:27,819
missus with the main components of a
local scanner analyze be

272
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:33,199
and I for a known vulnerabilities using
Vanessa school

273
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,480
and at the same time ill the

274
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,750
and when we scan to be the need for a
known for their abilities

275
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:42,610
we also uploader to when I to the i MiEV

276
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:47,850
what we call it past the sweet so it s
32 is a self-extracting archive

277
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:51,199
okay that contain twenty-four

278
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,589
past but the group in four main
categories K

279
00:16:54,589 --> 00:16:57,589
the first one is a general category so

280
00:16:57,589 --> 00:17:00,790
it ethicist them out for what I've
system information on

281
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:06,579
luck fis i connect different data likely
var log or like says keep it up

282
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:10,000
Benevides another component to that
these there

283
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,589
are you a senior he can you read it yeah
I guess also

284
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:17,829
on the top you have a the first mondavi
generous best

285
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:21,579
so that collect information on the
machine at the second one

286
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:25,040
collect information on their great
information about that percent body fat

287
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,679
a summer she arse

288
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:30,840
orbit on the machine if the machine is
that connecting to summer

289
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,200
a X there are no ulcer just oppose the
other machine that is infected by

290
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,059
malware

291
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:43,059
okay this one for

292
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,970
pilot left by the provider

293
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:17,980
because I we are seeing that everybody
can provide etc and publishing mean age

294
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:22,430
so we check if they get it published the
midget may be left something like Easter

295
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,050
defies

296
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:27,500
private keys Assad kurdish I'll

297
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:32,430
for a sequel database password in
finally we have some pastor 82 is

298
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,290
security

299
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:36,460
so we tested for the machine contain a
summer rootkit

300
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:40,290
and summers a model where or summer heat
and process

301
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:43,720
and so on get

302
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:49,400
so without a finding in a

303
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,040
so a first finding at serrated to

304
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,420
software abilities the why

305
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:59,780
we passed bath it does that because that

306
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:04,110
the mall to the business here ease okay
you can rent in the middle every cloud

307
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,680
you know you kinda sad about no need to
ever serve it at your home

308
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,870
no needed to buy yard where dedicated to
your survey

309
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:14,730
no need to invest i mean they main
config audiomachine

310
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:18,700
come to us you can buy the survey are
it's easy you know you just have to be

311
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,380
made

312
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:24,290
you play can you go okay so let's see if
the image but I arrange their

313
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:27,300
are up-to-date or not

314
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,970
so using mass oh so we just in a we just
then

315
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:34,800
enable lessons to best only the critical
vulnerabilities

316
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:38,830
so they're so says the 11th from 0 to
free free every critical vulnerability

317
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,970
that means that the seventy two goal
lead ability

318
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:44,900
usually a system can get from
compromiser remotely

319
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:48,260
and we got your message to that Jack

320
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,390
given inability locally on the machine
to be more precise

321
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,950
so the to plot first place we in DOS

322
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:58,690
tell the lefties Windows and variety is
the

323
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:03,120
know the lefties mean us on the right is
Linux so you can see in Windows without

324
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:03,560
a

325
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:07,090
redial of total net ability is Terry lot
of a nice

326
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:08,130
the

327
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:11,600
more than fifteen or twenty but they
have like 50

328
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,780
critical vulnerabilities and

329
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,490
we know it is a beast like the Italian
say select the batter

330
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:22,390
butts the you know that I i under the
hundred of mushy innovate as at least

331
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:22,960
there

332
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,040
five of panic critical vulnerabilities

333
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,460
so we set up a date up to enough
original

334
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:34,860
a Windows machine cam Weaver 46 a
critical vulnerabilities and link so

335
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,880
we'd 11

336
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,350
and the possibly exploited the

337
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:43,970
the software and the

338
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:47,640
in in fight if you look ninety percent
of Windows

339
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,930
that and 50 percent W and I comical
weekly to cover your abilities

340
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:57,660
that's really an art saw sec on the butt
out a lot of a little bit it is a bit at

341
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,230
Morven

342
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:01,580
to where you are or even a free er's old
it means that

343
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:04,780
on the on the other than that what about
it energies

344
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:08,380
that guy with softer but is very
obsolete a

345
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:12,080
we also found 87 MIT at the damn I bit

346
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,600
can leave a note or SSH open SSL will
never be discovered in May 2000 8

347
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,750
where the films will never be due out at
the

348
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:23,960
vicki was not generate your own to me so
it was it possible to brute-force SSH

349
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,800
key and get access to the sea stems

350
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,080
so the message here is clear you know

351
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:33,570
you have to if used to be. midge in enid
or a cloud US you want to make sure bet

352
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:36,590
and I you bet she'd you updated

353
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:39,990
and you have to invest time in that and
you have to be able to do it

354
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:45,650
saw its not point-and-click we can look
at Model S O

355
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:48,900
we also lose can they're using time
movies

356
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,330
an SOA free I'll hope a source that

357
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:57,270
and about 20 850,000 senior to earth and
all the MIA's

358
00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:01,070
enemy beat disc over to machine to
continue on their

359
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:06,920
and I Spy at oceana but was doing key
logging process monitoring data leakage

360
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,310
and other one was it was a browser spy
why

361
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:14,860
spyware stallini Internet Explorer so
the first one has been a

362
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:19,080
configuring with me so bad when it did
the taft at

363
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:23,540
like to Wellfleet that two weeks later I
check I so I'll

364
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:27,280
10 VC made as a problem so I started we
meet again and they found

365
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,380
a bet there was be set traditionally
styled

366
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:34,710
so probably think a guy SPC study
starlet pollution in the machine to put

367
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:35,790
the machine over to be a

368
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:39,530
cloud and wait for that somebody is
using it

369
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:43,230
instead the second one as not being
called freedom and money

370
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:46,270
saw a buddy's a false-positive love

371
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:50,790
gallery or the machine got infecting
during our experiment

372
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:54,800
in fact and every machine is around for
a one-hour

373
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,550
weave out having a firewall and a

374
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:02,860
Kb that if the machine its a it has a
lot of

375
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:06,110
complete a BTS can be there can be so
one hour

376
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:10,560
a you can get compromise that by eBay
told him

377
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:14,400
but we look at the

378
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,860
at the possibility that some machine
where connecting outside the

379
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:23,590
for sending for example outta the says
city that a private information

380
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:27,900
so we found 2 Linos server but where

381
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,290
using syslog NG to send blog

382
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:34,650
to a remote of that means that the you
rent a

383
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:39,120
you're into machine to use it and all
your dog get will be sent outside

384
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,600
be so no way would be sent to the USA
that way to a russia said it was

385
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,310
collecting logs from his machine

386
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:48,440
good

387
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,910
this is an interesting point is the fact
that

388
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:57,110
there when when a user rented MI is a
westerly before yes to

389
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:00,580
provide these public key to get access
to the MIA later on

390
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:03,810
so the what is very skier

391
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:08,170
risk is that users could leave the key
be idea making the

392
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:12,130
BAE Mitch the to and motley may just
Bobby

393
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:15,300
what does it mean it means that the
sicky

394
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:19,190
if you don't delay fees if you ski still
present

395
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:23,800
on their on the image then the guy but
there's a private key can vent connect

396
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,590
to your image

397
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:28,370
so the sicky to Novi major into

398
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:32,810
into backdoor basically so you have the
same problem

399
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:36,000
be for the midge account with salameh
somewhere

400
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,440
boss for the that have been there left
enabled

401
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,400
order some users might have been the
left enabled so

402
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:47,780
yea you have the you know we did
experiment on the 40 rejoin

403
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:52,620
and it came out that one machine out of
5 the kind we left over credentialed can

404
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,100
this can be able to pass what

405
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:59,210
as enable password in anybody who's that
we shall

406
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:03,060
or can be a SSH keys

407
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:06,590
and be set weed out to to the user

408
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:09,720
but there's a a very private key or no
there the

409
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,490
the username and password to access to
your machine so you or your entity is

410
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:15,250
serving a bit somebody as a

411
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:19,580
is connecting to yasser and then more
than 900

412
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:23,720
Caseys disallow a superuser a

413
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,290
privilege so leftover credential

414
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:31,850
is a security risk at the same time is a
privacy risk

415
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:36,250
why because a if I E if I ever

416
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:39,810
if you can see here about I we found
under red

417
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:43,690
and one machine that we've left over
pasta or

418
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:46,920
so what they can do work and their I
every sposato

419
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:52,179
I can pollute for spam okay I can invent
looking last login: see

420
00:25:52,179 --> 00:25:56,400
who is the guy that approved the machine
and then I can try to use the same

421
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,530
possible art and

422
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:01,860
get access to their machine

423
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:07,240
Sobeys we bring us to the privacy risks
related to the use over I a service like

424
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,970
the Amazon ec2

425
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:13,400
so what's a problem probably is that if
the image

426
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:17,360
contain sensitive information these
would be available to

427
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,410
anybody with renting the air by okay

428
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:24,550
that make sense nor sought not only
customers have potential risk but also

429
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,760
the provider

430
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,800
it themself so we can use our the screen
a shell

431
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,940
for example to log into the server or to
start

432
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,390
installs overcrowded for free

433
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:39,470
so this is what we look your

434
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:42,860
so we look at the Forgotten keys

435
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:46,720
so we search among good all the major
for

436
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,340
a SSH keys

437
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:53,750
and for I'm odds-on as a API

438
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:57,290
keys so we find out a bit

439
00:26:57,290 --> 00:27:01,840
and mean machine over to be a little
cloudy where containing get

440
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,670
and 56 private SSH keys

441
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:11,720
interestingly 5402 fixes ceaser we're
not even protected by pass phrase

442
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,850
okay so it's easy you know I think the
lab AP log

443
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:19,179
poll from probit thrower from the login

444
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:22,220
from bottle augment mean I every private
key

445
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:26,370
and embed the if I also collect 67
unprotected

446
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:30,740
Amazon a key is be so great because when
you have 10 the ski

447
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:35,900
you can that start to you can that by
Southee over Amazon Cloud so I can buy

448
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:39,170
two terabyte of data I can buy their

449
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:42,220
on and read the email G sir weaver et

450
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:47,490
64 core process on and the poor guys
paying for me

451
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:52,320
to be some not protected by password
still be so anything like that so

452
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,300
we Amazon issued other a future where
you can at least protect

453
00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:00,870
your I was an API key with the password

454
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:04,200
are things we look look at the %uh
Shelly story

455
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,560
okay so the

456
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,929
order shall in Linux like bash

457
00:28:10,929 --> 00:28:15,080
seashell their baby record everything
can if I know

458
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,390
so it makes sense to delete this fight
before you're you're prettier image of a

459
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:19,390
cloud over rice

460
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:22,650
somebody s arraigned miss teenage you
can get access to

461
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:26,780
your shell no things in fact be such a
problem

462
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:29,830
saw it in that we we're we find

463
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:34,320
a donde read the 695 us but we're
starting to date information on

464
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,620
for total 250,000 line of common the
story

465
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:41,950
so able to parse el two parts or all
them and the iPhone interesting things

466
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:43,710
for example look at this

467
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:48,320
meister my sequel ditto you know that
you can that you can use it

468
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,730
my sequel from Carmel and you can
specify username and password

469
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:55,679
you can say my seat where michael c you
but cook minus be

470
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,700
people Aust name

471
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:02,400
it to be. let a brother that at the same
problem bet you ever

472
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,630
I own a little ever pick a show when you
press meeting for me is testing from

473
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:09,000
issues in gay catholics that the post

474
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,020
use and use an impossible thing to get
beget we recorded in a blog about Bosch

475
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:17,320
but if the employer it is the same so if
I

476
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,550
crawl I can't crawl username and pass or
so like

477
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:25,290
I a caller I ES tracked fifty-eight crew
there shall in 30 of them

478
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:29,390
are for a remote machine soul of
companies have the the AM I had suffered

479
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:30,880
a lot easier with machine

480
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,060
so at their username apostle for first
in a remote machine

481
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:37,480
44 Amazonia yes sir Irvine Sedaris

482
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:41,310
for one at the ninety Dennis board I'll
take a few ICANN fee would be

483
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:45,960
that I'm danis for vlc else on

484
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:50,570
so the next question is okay not all
recessed informational left by

485
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:54,070
that though by providers so

486
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:57,220
what the provider should do should obey

487
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:02,240
the delete their data before a putting
be made on the cloud

488
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,820
yeah maybe yes so let's look at this

489
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:11,990
so let we said the MIA can be bound on
using different methods

490
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:16,250
at sold-out extreme debase for the
friend that oath

491
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:19,320
where wanna work at 5 °c stem

492
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,350
K so that means that it's just that
they're copy

493
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:25,919
of the top K like it just the cops

494
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,370
and white free O'bama work at their
block levered

495
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:34,470
for simple and utterly no exit BD work
at block level so you can say

496
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:37,610
base my eMachine okay

497
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:41,260
think he's machine put it on and I so
and then upload a guy who would have a

498
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,570
cloud

499
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:45,919
usually these processes that it works at
block letter

500
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:50,640
to all the block of my machine better
but I free a battle it out ok bye bye

501
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,780
the tubby got into a eyes on me

502
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:57,610
get uploaded so problem

503
00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:00,740
problems that the block bays their
bonding Matt up

504
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:04,370
are vulnerable to file undulate up doc

505
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:09,240
so they remember the time of the time
when there was a Dolce

506
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,880
and that you and updating 25 because
there are no I task on

507
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,190
so you are doing air there but I most
def

508
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:19,929
del they were five and a shit

509
00:31:19,929 --> 00:31:23,700
I they do if I okay what they do we have
it is it would recall if I do know if

510
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,790
I'd

511
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:28,800
is not over for it then you can
accommodate it is the same

512
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,620
so republish add to what we do bait
cleanup

513
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:35,929
the data you for publishing the midst
but they're don't their

514
00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:39,000
white the free space

515
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,090
so what what we did weeee

516
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:46,560
yet select I mean we selected

517
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,800
thousand under Linux and ice roundly

518
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,300
we're on these ext undulate to

519
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:58,560
to covered it up we ended 828 you go by
tough the tough

520
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:02,179
as a week or five for 92 percent over
and ice

521
00:32:02,179 --> 00:32:07,760
it so each MI contain other aged 20 see
from six to forty thousand the fis

522
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:12,080
at bad air and I so that even if I for
example where

523
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,890
about 33,000 finally in the be all end
all that i three

524
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:20,450
containing a images Microsoft office
document

525
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:23,650
war x-outs on and

526
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:28,550
I was on EDS certificate in OCT risky is
one issue before

527
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:32,360
the Sun 67 had been left

528
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,670
they forgot even to delete it the cities
that have been

529
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:38,700
be at 293 have been delayed about you to
call them

530
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:42,290
then we have a SSH private keys evite

531
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:45,420
wanna from an official Amazon image so

532
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:50,100
100 percent this is the key of a lot of
a guy we're keen on Amazon but

533
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:55,210
setup the machine then we have private
keys for PGP GPG

534
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:58,720
PDF document possible defies as on

535
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,740
better screenshot

536
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:05,700
fauna for a Calder process under under
Windows

537
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:10,960
at for temple yet I was in the air in
STP over to one of the match but there

538
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,460
ain't

539
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:16,870
you can see at the IP BC's ac2 at the IP
the machine for the seized under forty

540
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,140
seven forty blah blah

541
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:21,300
or entity in the eel last

542
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:27,000
so I about cities you know your your
study we don't date

543
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,240
to you just a call that mean you recover

544
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:35,790
about 9,000 fights okay

545
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:39,570
so we had a we are almost on a so you
get yes you've seen Matt

546
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:42,580
the this unloads on images

547
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:46,880
they have both security problems in both
privacy

548
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:51,130
problem the so let's look at the

549
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:54,130
at the security problem so you know that
their first employer

550
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:58,210
one out of five apiece images have a cam
Weaver some enable

551
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:01,440
account ought to be some SSH public
installed

552
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,610
so suppose but now the attack you want
to locate

553
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:09,600
the scheme age K so me me for same price
it up in E major

554
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,460
I E I add some credential kale some key
so I uploaded

555
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:17,230
and then I'm wat I wait so I went with
somebody is using it

556
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:21,659
so even very is a like a even a star
like a client or

557
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:25,390
it's something that they're when the
mich start me back

558
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:29,280
and even the VIP only to be which is
running so I know which is why well

559
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,110
whatever they can connect to 111

560
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:35,429
of ok and it will what they can do I can
use that

561
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:38,630
I can try to match and

562
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:42,120
all the VIP's on their own got the space
of ballots on

563
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:45,450
to my Mike at a local 5,000 machine

564
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:50,700
are gonna do it I can do it they can do
it they're using a perfect solution

565
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:55,250
pretty much another perfect solution
that is based on the SSH

566
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:58,500
or ski calm Capricorn matching

567
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:03,450
order can use approximate solution like
air service banner and web on their

568
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:07,630
what does it mean it mean fat

569
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:11,550
what we need to be scared all the Amazon
IP range okay

570
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:16,820
the soviet art about 60 and red that
650,000 eyepiece

571
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:20,880
and their out of the 60 and over at

572
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,550
233,000 running in style so out all the
all the armored on their

573
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:30,040
IP space may have they're using about
one-third

574
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:35,350
of it K time so obvious 233,000

575
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:39,310
your stance but they're running there
are 113

576
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:42,760
about 50 percent bet that where that
that

577
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,960
SSH enabled K so we are at

578
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,730
means machine and if they have the same
is not

579
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:53,450
field so for this one we can use ssh

580
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:57,400
met-art so it doesn't mean that we we
using 'em-up

581
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:01,100
them up we saw before at the beginning
but all ok

582
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:04,200
we collected a fingerprint over ssh

583
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,160
and then we match peace fingerprint that
we've fingerprinted

584
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,570
and over different over different 5,000
machine that we scanned

585
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:15,260
and we had a perfect match want one for
a while

586
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:19,340
point 65 percent of his number let these
about that

587
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:22,340
but his 20,000 machine I'll 2000 machine

588
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:25,750
two for two thousand mushy talk for two
thousand eyepiece

589
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:29,880
we have the perfect match so I a very
know which kind of for Amazon MI is

590
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,540
Ronnie

591
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:35,430
any final with you fees I was a.m. eyes
runny as a some backdoor installed

592
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:41,220
I can login if a regulation then of
course if you look at the south of Bend

593
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,010
County date

594
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:45,460
we have a percentage bettys why they are
if you look at 10 to 50

595
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:48,660
different a nice it's why that's the
lead

596
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:52,740
is that Dane County this you can easily
feel that one EP can be one of the stand

597
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:53,340
him I E

598
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:56,520
you can easy test all 10 so it's not

599
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:59,710
not a big issue they have a free ever to

600
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:02,860
matching their system we have one is
based on Sirius

601
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:08,280
so we look at be only the open ports the
new Baseer be it is running and diverse

602
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:08,740
shown

603
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:13,510
every make sure to bat its Besim off 10
fwy

604
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:17,060
a.m. I bet we have in the catalog and
the last one is being on the web OPP

605
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:21,580
pitying start so we look at deep ready
for a table with Bob different able web

606
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:22,100
server

607
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,710
we try to match davir VIP's with MI

608
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:30,580
based on this information okay so I
would say that

609
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:33,950
during our experiment we wear only thing
called early ballots on

610
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:34,690
a

611
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:38,150
at security team verdi did a great job

612
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:42,020
so a little later so sometimes I don't
that feedback

613
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:45,829
from a the different provide their arse

614
00:37:45,829 --> 00:37:50,130
an hour Friday for from endorse is that
Amazon did a great job

615
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:54,510
so when we contacted them about to be
hit by repost or in public keys but we

616
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:55,349
found on the

617
00:37:55,349 --> 00:37:59,670
on the set eighty percent of the veggies
at that 1200

618
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:04,900
so they give them released over 2012 the
MIAC containing some forgotten

619
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:09,099
credential so what made either they
immediately contacted the all the

620
00:38:09,099 --> 00:38:09,839
clients

621
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:14,140
seeing a guy said be made you are
running gear contain some credentials

622
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:17,180
so make sure you remove either way say
at the back door

623
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:20,660
and the then a beer is the public polity
new

624
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:26,450
me after and the change we started with
terrible level MI from a public to

625
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:27,369
private so that

626
00:38:27,369 --> 00:38:32,190
nor more user can arrange the same I
medical about them a second time

627
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:36,260
about to be left over at the time so the
fact that about a lot of the image eason

628
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:36,930
and

629
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:40,880
where the guide published the metaphor
go to delete that they don't like the

630
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,809
study fight

631
00:38:41,809 --> 00:38:46,839
sold out a lot of clay shaw all water
now some private message key saw Ramadan

632
00:38:46,839 --> 00:38:47,799
API keys

633
00:38:47,799 --> 00:38:52,230
soviet it is within 5 days a tutorial to
webcast live to shatter the public

634
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:54,069
images in a secure manner

635
00:38:54,069 --> 00:38:57,960
ikat onto Shari'a public image okay baby

636
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,990
AB de Tierra Nashotah your sensitive
data

637
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:05,460
first for physical doesn't have it again
about a gift problem

638
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:09,609
all but according to lately the term
where you can air

639
00:39:09,609 --> 00:39:14,500
on delay to delete advice so baby fight
our finest immediately rather than out

640
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,230
some anything over the fence a mice

641
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:19,980
had to see I'm what's the problem

642
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:24,789
bad and if it makes a is to have changed
bounding sees them

643
00:39:24,789 --> 00:39:28,579
to to to make sure that it's not
possible to

644
00:39:28,579 --> 00:39:33,720
undulate data from the hard disk get

645
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:37,420
so what we learned here we don't have
apt

646
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:42,319
if we want to use the cloud a best ways
to prepare your own image

647
00:39:42,319 --> 00:39:46,930
I know it take time you know you have to
install the major you have to configure

648
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:48,150
late but many tea or

649
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:52,869
you know any if you want to a really
around a major although the cloud for a

650
00:39:52,869 --> 00:39:53,730
long time

651
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:58,410
don't trust wanna be made better feiger
just spend maybe one day to go if you

652
00:39:58,410 --> 00:39:59,720
are already made

653
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,750
and your down because if you buy the
Nativity sphere

654
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:06,180
then will tell you that the
configuration of I

655
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:10,430
all for little tom cat he's okay we'll
tell you that there

656
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:14,369
and all the software is bets currently
who tell you that

657
00:40:14,369 --> 00:40:17,509
there are no problems so

658
00:40:17,509 --> 00:40:20,930
steal if you want to use one of these he
made you have immediately update the

659
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:21,589
software

660
00:40:21,589 --> 00:40:25,660
over twice especially if it's a Windows
machine because we know machine with no

661
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,279
fire on a public IP

662
00:40:27,279 --> 00:40:28,750
we've there

663
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:32,349
50 critical vulnerability get exploited
in 10 minutes

664
00:40:32,349 --> 00:40:36,650
give to regenerate this is a tall skis
to prevent the name

665
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:42,550
mock being between a running your stance
and I if great any user password is

666
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:46,440
sage keys JV configuration file serious
you plan to run

667
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:50,880
check for suspicious connection on we
have to do all this

668
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,359
the so if you if you plan to release a
public image

669
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:59,819
then use if I base by the mechanism so
that nobody else can recover your data

670
00:40:59,819 --> 00:41:01,170
David you deleted

671
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:05,369
or shredded necessity fights invalidated
any

672
00:41:05,369 --> 00:41:08,369
their locks and history any three fights
before

673
00:41:08,369 --> 00:41:12,849
putting be made online so

674
00:41:12,849 --> 00:41:16,430
erode just two reference you can vent
don't know there's lights or

675
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:19,460
no hurry to copy them so decided to

676
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:23,490
I so when we could at Amazon eBay
they've rotor

677
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:25,160
up to

678
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:28,660
bossed on there will be solve this
problem first one is all too

679
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:31,849
sharing is public MIT secure manner miss
a call

680
00:41:31,849 --> 00:41:35,010
the second one is that in mind their own
about separately sharing the using

681
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:35,820
public and I

682
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:39,869
so this is a call could joint worker

683
00:41:39,869 --> 00:41:43,400
the I'm you know among me and

684
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:47,920
a jonatha doc I read about that I'll
keep the ending and in Keokuk IA

685
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,100
in savage or I work with them it in a

686
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:57,210
a new to come last year and we also
publish a paper on this topic

687
00:41:57,210 --> 00:42:00,350
name the proceeding overconfidence
couple more fickle

688
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:04,700
so MVP pottery to what you have there
there are actually all

689
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:08,770
faced by the weedy them select 10 pages
of details on the problem

690
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:12,770
so maybe for interesting he swore to to
read

691
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:16,720
okay that's all i/os pretty fast

692
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,990
saw you have time for a question on for
coffee

693
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:24,010
to work over before a final keynote

694
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:27,300
I think we can go for some questions if
you're up for it so yes you won't have

695
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,390
any questions from Argo

696
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:32,400
top with

697
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,620
when was the did that notice about
public keys in in

698
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:41,320
in a beast that was quite some time ago
wasn't it

699
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:45,880
the first problem by the public in I
think it was in September

700
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:49,150
October last year he and Outback

701
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:53,490
I wondered why all of a sudden they
started looking at that one so

702
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:57,620
think I yeah i'd get the notice from
from man is on cell

703
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:01,350
okay and now I know why hey you could

704
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:06,160
there is good reasons to have II
deployed training machines in the cloud

705
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:10,580
and there is a good reason to have a
public key on there so that students can

706
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,460
actually log into those machines

707
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:15,600
sure to share them talented

708
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,800
yeah in this case that uses

709
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,610
sort of nullified I have it make sense
to me know if you have any made you want

710
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:24,360
many people use the C major

711
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:27,560
you have to something better lead their

712
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:34,560
at of course

713
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:44,410
e be home the sophistication of a lot of
the mines the people

714
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:48,820
creates with homebrew and you know of
and very

715
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:52,780
heterogeneous how did your research

716
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:56,190
and find sorry the optimize the
fisherman's

717
00:43:56,190 --> 00:44:00,000
to Microsoft's optimized image Amazon's
that might imagine simply

718
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,470
they understand you almeda suitor in
other words

719
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:06,690
and I don't I think for me miss we're

720
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:10,060
we r rightly afraid have other people's

721
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:13,240
you know home created public game eyes
for from

722
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:16,690
all these reasons but how bout Amazon's

723
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:20,150
image have at Microsoft optimize image

724
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:24,109
use you know there's it by five or six
an better put out

725
00:44:24,109 --> 00:44:28,609
night into the marketplace you know by
third parties but I

726
00:44:28,609 --> 00:44:33,470
the primary you know vendors or
impacting this region folks

727
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:37,300
I'll get she asked me the old the
marketplace but I'd image provide by

728
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:38,099
Amazon

729
00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:42,380
itself byee individuals are my third
parties

730
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:46,630
you ask me for a reason de France among
the my wife are somewhat but are more

731
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:47,680
vulnerable

732
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:51,300
dollars actually hope you're gonna tell
me that Amazon Microsoft

733
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:54,859
optimize Harding images did much better
yeah

734
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:59,540
me we didn't make it de France because
we don't be they want to say al Madani

735
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:04,160
skid a steady provide that Microsoft is
bad or provide a CE skid

736
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,670
you know we tried to look a partially to
all of them

737
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:12,720
but the very sexually make sense that
the image provided by your

738
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:16,910
without wifi surely provide are probably
more secure than

739
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:20,210
arse so I know that there is this site

740
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:23,410
at the called it's called cloud

741
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:26,630
market like care

742
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:29,790
if they don't remember but when a
actually the user can

743
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:33,370
can say okay I try BC made in UK

744
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:36,710
I they can give some star so that a mark

745
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:40,670
they can give a both from one to five so
they can say

746
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:44,830
5 this is a good one is like a Google
for the rest on you know you want to go

747
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:47,980
to a restaurant you check me out to say
I did a lot of people teeth wrestling

748
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:48,450
skewed

749
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:51,480
so they've something similar for the
cloud market Obama done

750
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:55,530
say suggest that too to use the Site
just google internet like

751
00:45:55,530 --> 00:46:00,010
proud market Amazon ranking and there

752
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:03,780
you can before using any made you can
check me out what the people safe

753
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:07,099
nobody say nothing maybe you better use
another one

754
00:46:07,099 --> 00:46:14,099
yep Perth

755
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:22,619
you said you were contacted to the
security team of

756
00:46:22,619 --> 00:46:25,999
a missile and the juror had an
indication that a

757
00:46:25,999 --> 00:46:30,400
detected you before because sure comes
to machines to start scanning them

758
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:35,549
so would look like suspicious activity
see i

759
00:46:35,549 --> 00:46:39,910
asking Eve when a cantata them they knew
