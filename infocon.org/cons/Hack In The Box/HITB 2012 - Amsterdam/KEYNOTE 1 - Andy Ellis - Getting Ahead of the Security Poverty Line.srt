1
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:10,570
the

2
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,480
this is my pull off

3
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,540
with 0 yet so who

4
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:33,140
on who Paul was your

5
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:37,440
all along with my won't you

6
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,739
your or I no

7
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:45,670
resources you didn't know all you

8
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:49,190
pools relief by all

9
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:52,340
well you know it

10
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:57,320
lyle you pool of I'll

11
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,890
a yes someone who will be

12
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,250
we your odds home

13
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,540
you this lololol

14
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,670
what happens you wouldn't mind

15
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:16,340
a although your youth group

16
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,750
with is that is then you can't believe
in you

17
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:24,490
a reason you want to cover your own ass
all we could do

18
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:28,440
is cover your ass because the last thing
you want to have a home

19
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:33,369
well didn't always admired who said they
were all playing with the

20
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:38,080
your only source call it you know or
knowing about higher

21
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,540
following I'm coloured you know every
with

22
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:48,050
mandoline I'll the mentality that when
you think you can do enough

23
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:52,490
and you better not do with anything
different and differences with security

24
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,729
needs to be about

25
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:57,860
so we have to do to go forward use if we
don't

26
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:01,100
what we're going to do is restart
accruing technical that

27
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,479
a technical data that work would you
cast into the future

28
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,420
I'm it's just like deficit spending its
deficit spending

29
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:12,670
about reengineering ready to build
something you intentionally leave a

30
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,660
capability out for the future

31
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:18,260
that technical that you're going to have
to come back and fix that if you don't

32
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,060
make yourself for maintainable

33
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:24,810
if you leave you anything done in the
future you have more risk

34
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,750
you in the future is going to get much
harder and what makes technical that

35
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,510
very painful is you very rarely know
that it exists

36
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,290
in fact in most companies the people who
keep track of technical that

37
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,739
have very high turnover I'm very unusual

38
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:43,989
I that I've actually work for Arkham I
for twelve years

39
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:47,470
so every bit of technical that that
happened on my watch

40
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:51,340
we wrote down we know about 12 your

41
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,150
technical that the face is our business
and what we're going to do about it

42
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:59,430
average longevity in the security
industry for chief security officer

43
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:04,630
doesn't even hit two years but we turned
over the people who might keep track of

44
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,090
this

45
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:10,620
this increases our risk so it's a little
about the security poverty line

46
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,939
now let's figure out how to measure it
or how did you think about it

47
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:15,230
suffer

48
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:19,170
but security value what value do we
bring to our organization but we're

49
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:19,950
defending them

50
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,879
so many find the values quite simply
your resources

51
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:28,329
multiplied by your capabilities how well
you can leverage those resources

52
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:31,390
resources that the easy one time

53
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:35,579
and money the time of the people that
you have to implement things

54
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:41,010
and if the money you have to go buy
stuff capabilities is a little bit

55
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:41,700
harder

56
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:46,659
three things going to capabilities with
your skill

57
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:49,670
it's your effort and it's your affective
miss

58
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:53,250
your skill that seems pretty easy if I
ask you to go

59
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,459
implement a firewall do you know how

60
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:01,120
Cisco I O S Works do you know how
NetWitness work you have any these

61
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,349
technologies work

62
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:07,069
right or do you have to go work your
effort how will you apply yourself

63
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:11,250
also seems pretty easy this doesn't mean
working 80-hour weeks

64
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,340
although most of us probably have that
addiction in our systems

65
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,180
this actually means you going and doing
the work

66
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,349
in a timely fashion affected with the
interesting one

67
00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:26,440
how do you measure being effective
sometimes that's not beating your head

68
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,710
against a wall

69
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:31,650
sometimes it's about your environment in
fact last year we look at our

70
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:32,669
effectiveness

71
00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:36,990
reset your our information security
community time was eleven people

72
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:40,300
and we had five of them focus on
enterprise security

73
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,360
just our corporate network with the
largest

74
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,560
cloud businesses in the world and we had

75
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,000
have a poor security team just thinking
about corporate security

76
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,630
not even thinking about our production
network we looked a little why are we so

77
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,000
ineffective that half

78
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,470
more resources have to be focused on a
problem it everybody faces

79
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:05,340
and only half a plumber doing the novel
work and we actually realize it was

80
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,449
environmental

81
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:10,080
it wasn't about those five people it was
about the fact that they work for

82
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,539
information security

83
00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:15,880
and not for CIO and every time they came
in and they said what this is what you

84
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,789
should do

85
00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:20,870
the people that organization said why is
an outsider telling me what to do

86
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,880
I don't want to do it there without
explicit but that was you know the

87
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,960
behavior you see

88
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,320
it which we expect to see most
organizations if they didn't come in and

89
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,740
tell you what they want to do

90
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,430
the later they say will you didn't give
us any guidance how are we supposed to

91
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,539
know what to do

92
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:39,430
and so we did a year ago as we can to
those five people to the CIO

93
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:43,990
with that you have your own security
organization now about twice the fact

94
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,400
that now as they were

95
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,039
did get rid if anybody didn't change
that organization

96
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:54,880
prices effective just because the
environment very important to measure

97
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,969
very pretty understand because every CFL

98
00:05:57,969 --> 00:06:01,080
and every business has a qualitative you

99
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,130
your capabilities the fact that we're
going to go to a reversal

100
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:08,710
we will look across the organization and
they'll say well here's the median

101
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,560
capability of my organization

102
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,380
anybody above it gets more resources
there clearly applying them well

103
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,620
anybody below it we're going to take
resources away from

104
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,900
you don't have control over your
resources

105
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,370
we have its control over your
capabilities now in some sense I'm

106
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:29,050
preaching to the choir because everybody
here

107
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:33,360
is here about increasing your own
capabilities you're here to increase

108
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,310
your skill

109
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:38,900
you here to make yourself more effective
but many organizations are really

110
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,870
thinking that way

111
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:45,039
so how much security value

112
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,610
is good enough we'd all love to have
perfect security

113
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:52,599
we're not going to be there this graph
is not to scale so please don't count

114
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:53,240
pixels

115
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:58,000
but if we think about some point on this
line that we will call

116
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,150
good security and I'm just going to put
it out there is a strong man for a

117
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:01,750
moment

118
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,680
but think about what good security might
mean in relation to other things

119
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,169
I think we all like to agree that if

120
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:12,589
on Monday a chaotic actor decides to
attack you

121
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:17,349
and they conduct an attack on Friday you
should be sufficient against that attack

122
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:18,839
if you have good security

123
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:21,919
so clearly good security is better than

124
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:27,339
with the casual adversary is going to
bring to bear I think we probably also

125
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:28,139
agree

126
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:32,319
that if you're worried about a nation
state after good security probably isn't

127
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:32,840
enough

128
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,789
right Stuxnet is probably going to beat
you

129
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:40,069
if you have a nation-state adversary if
you're any

130
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:44,520
were paraded adversary in fact is
probably aren't the right terms

131
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,930
probably want to say determined
adversary

132
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:52,650
because it might be that you are faster
than your neighbor every throw back to

133
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:55,509
your country faster than the bare you
just have to be faster than your

134
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:56,180
neighbor

135
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,180
Apple's pretty clearly running faster

136
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,229
with I O S that Google is with the
Android that isn't necessarily going to

137
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:08,360
protect them from the rumors have an
untethered jailbreak tomorrow

138
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,169
not that that's happening on

139
00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:16,909
so clearly above this is some concept of
perfect security

140
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:20,189
right and this is the something we have
to worry about is the industry

141
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:23,810
nobody is going to implement perfect
security

142
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:26,870
I have put it here to show that it that
ideal

143
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:30,259
it's that thing we look at but if you
implement perfect security that you were

144
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,069
taking no

145
00:08:31,069 --> 00:08:34,900
risk businesses are about taking risks

146
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:39,140
the goal is to take risks so that you
can do something you can make money you

147
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,579
can be successful

148
00:08:40,579 --> 00:08:44,380
perfect security means you have no
arrests businesses don't operate that

149
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:44,790
way

150
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,520
they like to take risks it's in their
DNA we'll talk in a few minutes about

151
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,900
that the enact

152
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,839
so in the middle saddam we talk about
the adversaries let's talk about

153
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:59,110
in theory your partner's who sometimes
might be adversarial

154
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:03,500
so there's assessors and their auditors
I like to distinguish them

155
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,120
to be I want have a good assessor and
about auditor

156
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,930
assessor is somebody that you bring in
and you ask them to help you

157
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:14,520
you say please tell me what I'm doing
wrong to somewhere in this if you bring

158
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,220
in a bit if that's true I'll tell you
something you were doing wrong

159
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,610
and they could help get you better an
auditor on the other hand is there

160
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:25,620
they have a checklist they're doing a
PCI audit and I so audit

161
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,970
I you name it they're doing an audit
against you don't want a good one

162
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:32,990
you want a passing grade so if you go
hire a competent auditor

163
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:36,760
who serious that what they're doing this
is probably where they're going to get

164
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,470
you

165
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,560
they're using a checklist that with
standardized

166
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:46,930
maybe three years ago but before with
standardized it took 18 months to write

167
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:51,420
so it's based on a consultant to view up
an adversarial model

168
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:55,760
that is defining risk in terms of return
on investment for an adversary

169
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,640
were adversaries value your data is the
same as your own

170
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,060
might think most of us recognize is that
what adversaries value

171
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:08,220
is not what their targets value

172
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,430
of course most people don't hire serious
auditors

173
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:17,100
with a higher is the standard auditor
and then they play a game

174
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:22,740
how can we fool are audible how can we
write down things that are mostly true

175
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,180
spin them in a way that makes us look
good and we will give that to our

176
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,260
auditor

177
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,300
and that's all the security we're going
to do because that's all we're required

178
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,280
to do

179
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,650
and so that's what we're going to give
for auditors that's probably what most

180
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,900
for businesses are doing today

181
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:40,209
most def yours all actually say

182
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:44,800
but there's a line below that what if
you don't have an auditor

183
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,290
what if security is a chord your
business

184
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:52,610
right this is what many organizations
think they can get away with

185
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:56,130
even less than what would follow a
casual auditor because they don't have

186
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,930
to hire a casual auditor

187
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:00,540
maybe you're a small merchant and you
can fill out a self-assessment

188
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,800
questionnaire

189
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,990
for the PCI DSS standard you get to rate
down whether you're doing enough

190
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:06,970
security

191
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:10,980
anybody ever going to rate down I'm not
doing enough security be so please don't

192
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:11,760
give me

193
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,010
anything I don't think that's how it's
going to work

194
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:20,300
so that's basically where these are some
drug couple wants so the first one in

195
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,230
trying if the security poverty line

196
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:26,829
this is the cover your ass line if your
organization falls

197
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:29,810
you know either those bottom two dots
that that's how you define how much

198
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,829
security value you need to have

199
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:35,829
you're stuck below the security poverty
line and quite likely you think in terms

200
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:38,069
of security subsistence syndrome

201
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:41,620
I'm gonna do the minimum I can to cover
my own ass

202
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:45,490
there's another line since I said how
much is good enough I'm deposit the good

203
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:46,500
enough

204
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,630
is probably below where a good assessor
can help you

205
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:52,630
you'd like to always be able to bring in
those good assessors

206
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:56,309
get better you argue that third-party

207
00:11:56,309 --> 00:11:59,890
but if you can fend off a nation-state
for most businesses

208
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:02,970
you're spending too much money on
security

209
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:07,419
very few people actually run into this
problem so we won't worry about it

210
00:12:07,419 --> 00:12:10,720
these aren't static lines however
they're changing

211
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,980
this is the direction they're all going
you'll notice that most of them are

212
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,470
going on

213
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:18,770
upward curve again not to scale

214
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:23,530
that the standard auditor in the series
auditor are really changing over time

215
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:26,890
anybody who's been on a PC I receive
will recognize this

216
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:30,860
but from year to year the PCI standard
is in substantially changing

217
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:36,189
despite the fact that adversarial tools
have significantly changed in that time

218
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:39,459
that's led to the rise of other
technologies hopping

219
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:43,309
which it screenshot makes it look like
technology probably from about seven or

220
00:12:43,309 --> 00:12:44,939
eight years ago

221
00:12:44,939 --> 00:12:48,600
but hobby democratized people injunction

222
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,790
anybody can download this point it at a
web app compromise that

223
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:59,100
like not being successful enough led to
the rise to the high orbit ion cannon

224
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,280
which now useless booster packs for

225
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:06,059
so what we're starting to see anonymous
do another chaotic captors

226
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:09,740
is tell people here's where we will
release the booster pack the booster

227
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,959
pack is the targeting

228
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,780
we will release it 30 minutes before
operational

229
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:18,569
come get it doing it out trying to get a
faster

230
00:13:18,569 --> 00:13:22,270
loop observer or you decide to act loop
would a loop

231
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:26,329
venue defenders got does the public have
recorded in public

232
00:13:26,329 --> 00:13:30,110
means that your targets get to watch
what you do so instead they released

233
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:30,740
tools

234
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:34,699
but let them get faster be smarter

235
00:13:34,699 --> 00:13:37,110
and of course the slide wouldn't be
complete without a screenshot of

236
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:39,380
Metasploit

237
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:43,010
Metasploit for the greatest tools out
there right we use it for penetration

238
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:44,459
testing ourselves

239
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:47,900
but there's nothing with stops in
adversary from using it in fact if you

240
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,010
go to Metasploit community

241
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:53,699
and go look at what people are asking
about half of the question are people

242
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:54,510
who are saying

243
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:58,069
I want to break into a system how do I
do it

244
00:13:58,069 --> 00:14:02,030
but that's what the tools are being used
for this rising tide has lifted all

245
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:02,750
boats

246
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:07,069
and the adversaries are using them more
than the defenders

247
00:14:07,069 --> 00:14:10,270
so that's why things are getting better
for the adversary

248
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:13,929
wire things getting worse for the
organization this comes back to the

249
00:14:13,929 --> 00:14:15,520
pelts min a fact

250
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,839
sample them is an economist at the
University of Chicago

251
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:22,199
who went in the United States we were
debating seat belt laws

252
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:25,579
should people be required to wear a seat
belt when driving

253
00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:29,339
he said if you make people wear a seat
belt they will drive faster and kill

254
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:31,400
more people

255
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:36,470
simple things pretty much right when he
says that if you take a waitress

256
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:41,059
people will go and be riskier nASCAR is
a great experiment

257
00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:45,220
those you not familiar with now start
it's our rethink our league in the

258
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:49,160
United States people drive parts in a
circle 500 laps

259
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:53,299
I'm not really sure at the dream about
watching it is but I can understand the

260
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:56,220
thrill of driving one of the fastest
cars on the planet

261
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:00,319
500 laps in a circle but it's an
experiment every year they drive on the

262
00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:01,669
same roads

263
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:06,569
it's the same tracks every year we give
them better safety technology

264
00:15:06,569 --> 00:15:10,539
and every year they drive more
recklessly there are more accidents and

265
00:15:10,539 --> 00:15:12,140
ask for the used to be

266
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:16,679
the kill fewer drivers the safety
technology works

267
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:21,730
but the accidents are bigger right
people have this mindset

268
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:25,650
if you take a waitress they will go
absorb more rest

269
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:29,530
was very important to understand with
the way your businesses operate

270
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:33,110
everybody will take risk if you take
away from them

271
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:36,140
would you like to know how to make
people drive more carefully

272
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:40,100
both men had a solution for this if you
like people to drive carefully

273
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:44,439
stick a spike on the steering wheel if I
give you risk

274
00:15:44,439 --> 00:15:48,400
you'll take risk away it's a great model

275
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,870
no none of us would buy a car with the
spike on the steering wheel

276
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:55,339
but I guarantee you everybody would be
driving very slowly

277
00:15:55,339 --> 00:15:58,419
in fact I noticed this I went for run
yesterday

278
00:15:58,419 --> 00:16:02,939
along the canals in Amsterdam I should
have ask somebody what all the lights

279
00:16:02,939 --> 00:16:06,069
were four clearly realize I was running
in the bike lanes

280
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:10,900
I am probably not the wisest thing I
almost got knocked into the canal twice

281
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,299
but I noticed something up by simplicity
Amsterdam so I'm free

282
00:16:14,299 --> 00:16:17,990
I'm from Boston in Boston we have a turn
a bicyclist

283
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:22,699
and some of them drive really fast third
moving more rapidly than cars

284
00:16:22,699 --> 00:16:26,000
and some summer driving very slowly %um
stirred a.m.

285
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,270
nobody was dry riding their bike very
quickly

286
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:33,000
I attribute it to the fact that it was
you got awfully warm out

287
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,669
but in somebody pointed out to me
yesterday that these bikes don't really

288
00:16:35,669 --> 00:16:37,220
have breaks

289
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,860
right yet certain pedal backwards to
slowed by going to do quite grasp what

290
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,760
this was

291
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:46,069
it's slowing the bicycle down his hard
if you go fast

292
00:16:46,069 --> 00:16:50,150
your address of not being able to stop
if you need to

293
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:54,030
a US bike you have here breaks to
squeeze a break the bike stop on a dime

294
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:57,910
works very easily people drive rapidly

295
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:01,380
Dutch bikes you can't stop so you don't
drive quickly

296
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,839
you've taken risk out of the system by
taking away

297
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:08,709
something the broad in safety

298
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:11,980
oh and then if you wear helmets like
that with the amazing thing like in

299
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,650
Boston if you know where a helmet people
look at you like

300
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:18,740
you're in India here I think if you wear
a helmet people look at you and say

301
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:23,260
you're ruining your hair you're getting
hat hat

302
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:27,179
so this leads to what I call the set
point theory a risk tolerance

303
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:30,600
basically said that people can perceive
risk

304
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,039
very important for your perceived risk
not actual risk I'm not trying to

305
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:34,950
measure

306
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:38,570
actual riskier I measuring perceived
risk

307
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:41,570
people have a set point that they want
to live at

308
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:45,730
if you take risk away they will absorb
risk to get that set point

309
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:49,630
if you introduce wrist they will act to
remove that risk

310
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:54,160
so we can look at this and say you as
perceived risk increases

311
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,179
we will apply security value to push it
down

312
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:01,549
that's why the inverted security value
here I'm not saying that security value

313
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:03,440
nose is decreasing the fashion

314
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,070
I'm just going verdict that's the
pressure downward risk is the pressure

315
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,400
upward

316
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,419
so we can think about so perceived risk
possibly is an impulse we have some

317
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:13,320
abante

318
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:17,740
we're going along we get some risk we
asked when we close the risk they'll

319
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:22,049
you could think about this incident
management I have a breach

320
00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:25,049
I act to remove the risk that I just
discovered

321
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:29,130
and then I move on and you notice we
return to about where we started from

322
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:32,929
we think we're safe now or at least as
safe as we were

323
00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:37,650
going into our incident this is a good
mindset for humans to be a

324
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:40,900
read it for like a loser brain inside us
we want to apt

325
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:46,090
we see risk we deal with that we move on
that's how it's been operating

326
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:49,880
now unfortunately most of the time we
don't remove risk when were presented

327
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,900
with that

328
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,409
so instead what we see is something more
like this were going along

329
00:18:54,409 --> 00:18:59,640
we get some rest we apt and we are
insufficient to remove the rest from our

330
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,679
system

331
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:05,280
and worse we know it now we have a
problem

332
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,799
we have more risk in our system than we
know what to do with

333
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:13,280
know sometimes they're perceived risk
didn't increase from an outside force it

334
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,650
increased because one of us went to our
boss

335
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:20,510
we went to the CEO and we said look we
have more risk in the system

336
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:24,440
you we just discovered this thing we've
had and now we have to go fix it and

337
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,070
it's a crisis

338
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:29,360
and so so yours is great do something
about it and it turns out doing

339
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,940
something is very hard

340
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:34,200
there's a reason that risk existed just
nobody knew about it

341
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,880
so you do something for nine months
later it turns out Europe I

342
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,320
so what happens the human brain cannot
tolerate this

343
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,020
this is not a state of affairs that is
acceptable to it one of two things

344
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,260
happens

345
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,490
one is we tell ourselves the story

346
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:54,760
and we say to ourselves that risk was
always there

347
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:59,700
I knew about it that episode that I had
nine months ago when you told me about

348
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,340
it

349
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:04,460
that was the operation that risk has
always been my system

350
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:08,580
I have a new set point I am now
comfortable with the rest

351
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,880
let us move on long-lived risk

352
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,630
is a problem for you because this is
what will happen you will change your

353
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:16,710
set point

354
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:20,230
and you will believe you did it or

355
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:23,070
and this is what gets most security
professionals in trouble we tell

356
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:25,610
ourselves a different story

357
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:30,460
you're lying to me that's not really a
risk

358
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,630
what do you mean this person could do
something bad to me they've always been

359
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:38,020
able to we've been in business for ten
years and it still hasn't happened

360
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:41,910
so clearly it's not as bad as you think
it is

361
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:45,820
everybody's probably heard a story like
that before

362
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:49,030
also welcome you group wanna fight
what's the percentage chance it's going

363
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:49,900
to happen

364
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,420
you say well 5 percent

365
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,930
and summer look through all five percent
we've been 20 years we should expect it

366
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,580
to happen once it hasn't

367
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:01,810
so what we call at three percent are you
sure it's not three percent

368
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:06,020
all good 3 percent awake sure 3 percent
maybe not one percent

369
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:09,990
we negotiate ourselves down into a
different state and while we're doing it

370
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:12,440
you notice we actually got lower

371
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,690
we actually rode out more perceived risk

372
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:18,670
because while we're doing that we're
taking our expert were saying we don't

373
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:19,710
trust them

374
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:24,490
they tell us lives so we'll take more
risk out of the system

375
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:29,190
so what we'd like to see is a wave
dealing with problems that a business

376
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:33,710
something a little more routine we move
along we have some risk we remove it we

377
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:34,580
have numerous

378
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:39,370
we remove it we have numerous we remove
it we get into a habit

379
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:42,620
of removing risk from our system in
small chunks

380
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:49,620
stay just double it's not disruptive
this is how businesses like to operate

381
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:54,920
now I talked about perceived risk
there's also actual risk I don't pretend

382
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,200
to be able to measure either one of
these

383
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,690
but I would posit that ideal set points
are where are perceived risk in our

384
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:05,630
actual risk approximately equal one
another

385
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:11,050
and I think six different things can
happen here one is

386
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:15,080
the really bad thing we at risk im

387
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,210
something like an undisclosed breach you
break into my network

388
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:21,610
you do something you walk away with it
you go sell that information

389
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:26,580
and I never find out about it my actual
risk just increased

390
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:30,910
but my perception didn't change so set
point theory doesn't help me here

391
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:36,380
I don't act another thing we might look
at all

392
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:39,640
known vulnerabilities tomorrow

393
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,440
Apple's going to go up this well they
have unknown vulnerability

394
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,590
they will know about it they're
perceived risk for actual risk in theory

395
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:48,740
will move in the same direction

396
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:54,250
this is good for our brains we can act
with these

397
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:57,380
then of course we have everybody's
favorite fear uncertainty and doubt

398
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:01,220
let me scare you with something that
could possibly happen to you

399
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:04,470
I will meet you scared I will increase
your risk perception

400
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:09,320
your actual risk didn't change this is
one of the favorite tactics have

401
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,230
security managers all throughout the
industry

402
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:16,420
it's really bad because when you get
caught doing this you have no

403
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:19,540
credibility

404
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:23,170
there's some good things that can happen
on this as well

405
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:28,540
sometimes we fix things sometimes we fix
things and don't tell people

406
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:33,240
these are also cool perception doesn't
change

407
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,660
actual risk to us sometimes that's good

408
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:40,780
in the long run that's bad at some point
somebody will catch up and say oh my

409
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,700
goodness

410
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:46,840
things are much safer than I thought
they were let's stop doing security

411
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,880
but this happens all the time sometimes
you system to give you problems get

412
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,470
decommissioned and nobody told you about
it I actually had that happen once

413
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:57,330
were tracking a whole bunch of security
problems with the system that didn't

414
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:59,110
exist anymore

415
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:02,520
and it took us like nine months to find
out with somebody had gotten rid of this

416
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,620
system for us

417
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:07,800
we're very happy we threw them a party

418
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,800
sometimes you know about your risk
reduction sometimes you

419
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:15,890
actually manage to line up perception
reality in a good direction

420
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:19,910
and finally your prior lot about this
tomorrow

421
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:24,860
we have security theater activities that
we take the claim to reduce risk

422
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:28,290
that do not will be flown through the
state's recently

423
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:32,160
been through TSA mostly security theater

424
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:37,350
I'm of ATSC was actually more efficient
than be a security affects to give me

425
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:40,320
some props for that I flew through
Heathrow here and that was a

426
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:45,610
very inefficient so let's look at some
ways the People Act and will include a

427
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,600
couple of my anecdotal your

428
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,780
first one is it me so I when I took
three different

429
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,830
terms but I thought would be interesting
regret the most

430
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:56,970
recent news headline so I wanted more
money

431
00:24:56,970 --> 00:25:00,150
and I mean the habit begging for money
here's what I might do

432
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:05,670
I might say oh my goodness look at this
we had a data breach in Utah

433
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,740
the seas he owes responsible for that
Mister Cee to do you want to be

434
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,020
responsible for that

435
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:13,730
I didn't think so so we need full disk
encryption right now

436
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:18,640
in the data loss prevention tool I'm
gonna go get some money

437
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,320
people do tend to discover this or

438
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,730
I might say hey look at that you could
suffer a denial of service attack

439
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:29,930
it doesn't even matter if you're
for-profit business

440
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:33,200
we need to go by de dos protection right
away

441
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,780
a match in the business of selling that
full disclosure I'm

442
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:44,160
or you might say look web application
vulnerabilities that this is the hot new

443
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,240
thing:

444
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,790
so we need to get around and maybe we
should have

445
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:53,330
you know either us as dynamic
application testing to Loris

446
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:57,790
static 1.com and look at our coding
practices and see what we can do

447
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:02,480
you never seen any of these dynamics and
if you've ever actually marketed to from

448
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,630
a security vendor

449
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:07,510
this is what they do they will walk in
and they will throw headlines in front

450
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,470
view

451
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:13,240
and say now by our technology because
you don't want this to happen to you

452
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:17,630
the problem is this comes back to that
model of creating perceived risk and

453
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:20,110
then not actually reducing it

454
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:23,160
people stop believing that this might
happen

455
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:28,720
so instead of begging for money I would
argue that you should waste your crises

456
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,600
this is the real thing was a real breach
happened to occupy eleven years ago

457
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,470
fluffy bunny family remembers fluffy
bunny I've had this really cool

458
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:41,840
SSH trojan where they would break into a
system

459
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,640
they would get root access they would
what replace SSH

460
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:49,450
and then when you log into somewhere
else it would record your password

461
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:52,640
your rss feed entity enter passphrase

462
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,890
and then they'd come back in they would
collect those me go log into another

463
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,480
system using that

464
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,120
very me technology thank goodness they
had about

465
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:05,820
didn't actually ever write your private
key so if you use Cubase authentication

466
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,840
you were safe

467
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,080
simply due to a coating your always take
a coding error on the part of my

468
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,190
adversary

469
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:16,780
I so they broke into whatever systems we
actually notice almost immediately

470
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:20,710
simply due to be blind luck so you
noticed the

471
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:24,010
second to last line here has a password
at the end of it

472
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:27,360
that if anybody it actually kinda hard
to read my apologies it's in a light

473
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,050
grey

474
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:32,100
it's about 30 characters long and the
person whose past with this is

475
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:36,260
when fluffy bunny went to use that to
logging into MIT

476
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:40,179
the person's login scripts automatically
started instant messaging service that

477
00:27:40,179 --> 00:27:43,450
sent out a broadcast peeing thing they
were online

478
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:46,679
the person with standing in a dorm room
one of their friends when they got the

479
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:48,429
notification that

480
00:27:48,429 --> 00:27:53,309
I'm online he said that's very odd
because I'm not

481
00:27:53,309 --> 00:27:57,630
is that I only ever log in from two
places my laptop which is in my pocket

482
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:01,530
and from Arkham I clearly autumn I
suffered a breach

483
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:05,320
give us a call we went we look at this
we dealt with that

484
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:08,520
know what it means to have dealt with
this now we could have said oh my

485
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,130
goodness this is a crisis

486
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:13,820
this requires us to completely change or
login infrastructure

487
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:17,400
and we actually had people are going for
that saying that we should we should

488
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,220
take this opportunity

489
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:23,970
to rebuild everything from the ground up
we look at what we build everything from

490
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:24,850
the ground up

491
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:28,530
isn't something we can do overnight but
overnight we can do some pretty simple

492
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:29,330
things

493
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:33,290
right that login server why is it that
people actually get a show on it why is

494
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:35,300
not just a passerby way

495
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:38,559
Turner SHP with into VPN since that

496
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:42,230
right you'd still use ssh but behave
like the VP and now we didn't have that

497
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,210
risk

498
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:47,059
we change some other authentication
models

499
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:50,330
so we took that and we said you here's
this big

500
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:54,780
risk let act to bring it back down let's
make the business more comfortable

501
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:58,540
and instead let's take a long-term
approach

502
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:01,780
and look at our wrists to affect
long-term change

503
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:05,350
because that system wasn't our biggest
authentication risk

504
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:09,670
this was our biggest authentication risk
when I started off to my

505
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:14,450
every single developer have a copy over
root key for logging in

506
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:19,400
to every single machine that's a way
bigger risk

507
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,559
but what fluffy bunny presented to us
but fluffy but I got access to corporate

508
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:24,900
network machine

509
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,940
stole some source code this

510
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:31,360
I had developers who had left the
company that had root access to every

511
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,240
machine

512
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,770
this was far more dangerous so we look
at this and we said

513
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:39,809
you there's a lot of possibilities here
and we know what our

514
00:29:39,809 --> 00:29:43,640
end goal is but nobody will let us get
their day one it's too hard

515
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:48,429
but what we can do is we could convince
people we need to rotate that key

516
00:29:48,429 --> 00:29:51,720
people left the company with it we're
gonna give out a new one in fact

517
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,190
even better than giving out a new one
will set up a gateway machine that

518
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:56,630
people can log into

519
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:59,940
the new one will be preloaded on an
agent for you and if you need to login

520
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,630
somewhere you can do so

521
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:04,770
we're not gonna force them to change
their practices

522
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:08,370
many several developers said to us or
we'd like you to give us the new key

523
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:10,710
just in case that system doesn't work

524
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:15,179
so we celebrate the old he the root of
my we will give you a popular route to a

525
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:16,179
doctor might

526
00:30:16,179 --> 00:30:20,960
made them very happy so we did this roll
forward and we loaded into those ssh

527
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,450
agent

528
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:26,429
route 38 of my I and everybody was able
to only get out to the network from

529
00:30:26,429 --> 00:30:27,400
those machines

530
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,270
some people were left with the youth
whiskey we told him we had a problem in

531
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:33,660
the rotation move forward to read three
instead

532
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:38,000
but that was just a step so we brought
up will here's a rest

533
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,500
developers who left the business now
we've dealt with that risk

534
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,500
now we said we have still have this
problem

535
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:48,330
now we have people who are logging in
through machine we don't really know

536
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:50,080
who's logging in where

537
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,100
and people can login everywhere that's a
problem

538
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,140
now let's deal with that as a separate
initiative

539
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:59,590
so we built our own SSH application
proxy

540
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:03,840
users now logged into are deployed
network using their own identities

541
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,429
going through proxy which has on a
role-based access control list

542
00:31:08,429 --> 00:31:12,830
says are in dealers you like to log into
this machine with a read-only account

543
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:15,340
will you have a grant that will let you
do that

544
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:18,520
and it will pass through more
importantly our ground floor to say

545
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,970
things like

546
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:24,990
I the developers of our mapping software
can log into up to 10 mapping machines

547
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:26,370
per day

548
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:30,510
we don't have to specify which time as
they log in

549
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:34,210
they get access when they hit and
they're done what is the 4th least

550
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:36,610
privilege in a scene fashion

551
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:40,900
without having operators trying to grant
access continuously throughout the day

552
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:45,460
and more importantly our developers view
this as an improvement

553
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:50,890
over having to log in for Gateway
machine so we did two step change

554
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:54,809
that not only dealt with the first
vulnerability dealt with the second one

555
00:31:54,809 --> 00:31:59,559
and let me cut out over ninety-nine
point nine percent off all access to or

556
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:02,049
deployed network at the time

557
00:32:02,049 --> 00:32:05,309
but that was massive now we can actually
say things like

558
00:32:05,309 --> 00:32:09,230
only a small handful of people can login
to even remotely large numbers of

559
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,690
machines

560
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:13,690
I'm if you thought on the previous like
a soft fluffy bunny said you

561
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:18,070
what if somebody executed a pink floyd
from 6500 machines

562
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:21,100
I don't have sixty five hundred machines
anymore

563
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,340
I have a hundred thousand more than that

564
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:28,120
right that's a very large weapon of mass
destruction I really don't want even my

565
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:31,780
own employees able to use that weapon

566
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:34,940
so these are ways to think about
affecting long-term change know where

567
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,610
you want to end up

568
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:40,580
and figure out what are the steps to get
there that your business will tolerate

569
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:44,910
because it will not tolerate too much
risk reduction either

570
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:49,160
so took a couple other problems some
things we've done to deal with them

571
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:53,920
security awareness anybody here involved
in security awareness training

572
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:57,780
I feel sorry for all you raise your
hands so this is the problem

573
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:02,480
right we let auditors talk to us about
security awareness and 10 auditors say

574
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:07,440
every employee needs to have security
awareness training once a year

575
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,730
I and we have to write it down that they
took that really

576
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:16,380
I'm in fact what's really funny about
this one is we decided when we went SSH

577
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,700
keys for network

578
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:21,010
that we would have every one of our
employees sign a policy about the

579
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:23,920
passphrase requirement for their SSH key

580
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:27,790
because we were going to monitor we
don't want to be able to look at the SSH

581
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:29,080
identities

582
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,420
so we had them sign a policy that said
they would do in our auditors found out

583
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,350
that we they were signing policies

584
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:38,020
and they said well we want to audit
those policies

585
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:41,830
so by the time the ASIST of those
policies we had a stack of paper about

586
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,040
this big

587
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:47,900
there was every policy ever signed stuck
in somebody's filing cabinet

588
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,970
the auditor showed up and said well here
the ten people we like through the

589
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:52,740
policy for

590
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:57,000
so the first thing that one of my
employees did was add well put it at

591
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,780
least all into a binder alphabetized

592
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:03,940
made it a little bit easier but this was
ludicrous we were spending time

593
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:08,559
chasing down pieces of paper but
ultimately only our auditors cared about

594
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:11,879
and we're making people spend time
printing it out and send you back to a

595
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:15,000
singular managers to find that they had
done so

596
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,190
so we decided is let's get the auditors
out of the loop

597
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:23,480
actual awareness training right first
thing I have to do is i to teach people

598
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:27,750
makes a look security is a core
principle everybody has to know that

599
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:31,490
so this is our entire security awareness
training program

600
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:34,669
from memb perspective this is it

601
00:34:34,669 --> 00:34:40,990
one web page right you go to this web
page with those why do we care

602
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:44,389
this week here because our customers
care our customers are

603
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:48,309
doing financial transactions health care
this is that

604
00:34:48,309 --> 00:34:53,240
they get to the bottom of this page and
make sure they know what they're doing

605
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:57,119
you look lik sign which says here's what
clicking this means

606
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:00,730
this means that you have read this
policy you understand how to get more

607
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:01,869
data

608
00:35:01,869 --> 00:35:06,329
because we have links on that page and
your technology you can security

609
00:35:06,329 --> 00:35:07,829
awareness training

610
00:35:07,829 --> 00:35:12,819
and you click the button up and when you
click the button

611
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:16,640
apps

612
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,630
because into a database internet
database this is my entry add to that

613
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:22,710
database as the couple days ago

614
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:26,230
it rates down when you last receive that
treating

615
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:29,650
this is so effective you can see how
many other departments came to us and

616
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:30,260
said

617
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:33,579
can we use this system to

618
00:35:33,579 --> 00:35:38,329
occupy maintains ninety 7.6 8 percent
compliance with the annual security

619
00:35:38,329 --> 00:35:39,140
awareness

620
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:43,119
up to be training people actually up to
date

621
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:46,380
it took me two minutes to go find out
that number

622
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:49,809
those were the only two minute everybody
spent overseeing our security awareness

623
00:35:49,809 --> 00:35:51,660
program

624
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:55,890
that that now we don't stop there
because we acknowledge

625
00:35:55,890 --> 00:36:01,000
this is for auditors but to human
minutes per year to go look at how much

626
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,799
time is being taken on security
awareness training

627
00:36:03,799 --> 00:36:07,460
and about another three minutes to go
read the page to make sure I don't need

628
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,099
to update it

629
00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:12,470
another all we're doing that's our
entire costume

630
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:16,690
that is security value we're spending
almost new resources

631
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:19,990
massive capability and when our auditors
show up

632
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:23,339
we have a query that gives them the
whole database so when they show up they

633
00:36:23,339 --> 00:36:25,660
say will we want to look at these 10
people

634
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:28,740
we say that we don't have time to find
ten people

635
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:32,309
here's all 2500 you can go find them

636
00:36:32,309 --> 00:36:36,859
then we go around and we teach people
very specific security awareness things

637
00:36:36,859 --> 00:36:40,000
we teach everybody who answers the
telephone lock my about social

638
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,400
engineering

639
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,270
we r recovery at least within the tech
business

640
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:49,430
has caused us to be a target for social
engineering

641
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:53,210
not from the normal quote you might
think about headhunters

642
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:58,520
they're calling this all the time wealth
management folks call us all the time

643
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,980
so we have a system where if you get a
social engineering call

644
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:05,980
you send the email about it to social
engineering about my dot com

645
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:09,710
it's not actually quite that sucks and
mail their work it won't work

646
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:12,819
but you send mail to that list and
you're on that list

647
00:37:12,819 --> 00:37:16,210
if you answer a telephone your on that
mailing list

648
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:20,280
so as soon as somebody calls one of our
phone numbers and gets caught

649
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:24,069
we send mail to everybody else will in
through telephone

650
00:37:24,069 --> 00:37:27,559
which says here's exactly what the
profile of the attack was

651
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:31,380
here's who they pretended to be here's
what they wanted here's how they tried

652
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,309
to claim

653
00:37:32,309 --> 00:37:36,410
but I should help the and then when they
call the next person expertise already

654
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:38,239
ready for it

655
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:41,479
if you give you something out send mail
also

656
00:37:41,479 --> 00:37:46,400
we do not punish failure if you get
caught by social engineer

657
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,099
we expect that to happen from time to
time tell us about it so nobody else got

658
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:51,269
spot

659
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:54,650
this is the type of important training
to give people

660
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:57,979
because we have this training written
down for auditors they don't make us

661
00:37:57,979 --> 00:38:00,180
write down any other trainings

662
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:04,170
and that's the important thing ensuring
that we can provide good value

663
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:07,799
into our business

664
00:38:07,799 --> 00:38:12,099
another area we've recently been looking
at its third-party security reviews

665
00:38:12,099 --> 00:38:15,499
you know everybody probably has this
certainly this Dave outsourcing

666
00:38:15,499 --> 00:38:19,710
your businesses want to move things to
the cloud or to some third-party

667
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:24,059
in theory your process look something
like this:

668
00:38:24,059 --> 00:38:28,660
we will define a requirement for what we
would like to do outside our business

669
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:31,729
we will then go evaluate some vendors
against that requirement

670
00:38:31,729 --> 00:38:34,630
the vendors are probably our friends the
ones who've been taking a small thing

671
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:37,079
but will ignore that for a minute

672
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:41,489
then we will go select a vendor and once
we have selected a vendor

673
00:38:41,489 --> 00:38:46,619
we're going to implement a solution know
at some point in this notional process

674
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:50,019
we need to get the security team
involved and we need to have the movie

675
00:38:50,019 --> 00:38:52,069
value a what we're doing

676
00:38:52,069 --> 00:38:56,680
now what we all rate down should happen
is that the security evaluation should

677
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,450
be part of a vendor evaluation

678
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:01,599
if you have three vendors that your
valuating we should look at

679
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:05,579
you took those vendors so that you
understand the risk associated with them

680
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:07,190
when you make a decision

681
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:11,930
that's what we all write down what often
happens

682
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:16,039
is that once a vendor is selected we go
value at the vendor

683
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:19,890
we say well here's what we know about
the vendor and in fact I would argue if

684
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:20,910
you're doing this

685
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:25,739
you have a very easy metric of success
for your third-party security reviews

686
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:30,979
metric of success is quite simply this
how often do you change

687
00:39:30,979 --> 00:39:34,849
what's happening how often does the
business say well we're not going to go

688
00:39:34,849 --> 00:39:36,190
with that vendor

689
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:39,329
or you force the vendor to make changes

690
00:39:39,329 --> 00:39:44,319
if the answer is never which is quite
likely what most people run into

691
00:39:44,319 --> 00:39:48,859
been you are providing no security value
here your effectiveness is zero

692
00:39:48,859 --> 00:39:52,789
which negates all the resources you
apply

693
00:39:52,789 --> 00:39:56,029
it might even be that you don't do a
security evaluation

694
00:39:56,029 --> 00:39:59,849
until the solution has been implemented
and somebody implement something you

695
00:39:59,849 --> 00:40:00,420
find

696
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:03,509
out about it then you go look at it

697
00:40:03,509 --> 00:40:06,880
and your that's usually where you find
the most interesting things

698
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:11,359
and in the very very rare cases you
might actually get to do security

699
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:15,279
evaluation with the requirements design

700
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:18,970
right what can we do better what should
we be thinking about when we talk to our

701
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:19,930
members

702
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:23,329
now have different names for each of
these faces I'm

703
00:40:23,329 --> 00:40:27,849
if you have to do vendor evaluation
security you're trapped in vendor hell

704
00:40:27,849 --> 00:40:31,489
because they will business will quickly
understand that the right way to deal

705
00:40:31,489 --> 00:40:36,700
with you if they will we're looking at
15 vendors can you please evaluate all

706
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,789
don't let them do that to you that's a
little bit painful

707
00:40:39,789 --> 00:40:42,989
because the vendors are not going to
give you very useful data and you don't

708
00:40:42,989 --> 00:40:45,569
have enough time to deal with all

709
00:40:45,569 --> 00:40:49,229
or vendors already been selected

710
00:40:49,229 --> 00:40:52,609
what you're really doing here is
covering your ass this is the security

711
00:40:52,609 --> 00:40:54,950
poverty line right there

712
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:58,130
right you're not actually changing
anything the only reason that you're

713
00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:59,410
doing a valuation

714
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:05,460
you so that you can tell your auditors
you did an evaluation

715
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:10,130
I think what our favorite is security
professionals as the scapegoat month

716
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:13,680
right you've already implemented it let
me go see how I can get you in trouble

717
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,670
for all the bad things you did

718
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:21,950
into the I didn't have a part in this
I'm certainly not responsible for it

719
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:25,220
and then your honor business alignment

720
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:28,599
when we actually get to help define
requirements

721
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:32,660
what are the security needs the company
this is awesome when you get here

722
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:36,979
it doesn't happen very often but it here
this is where you have the most security

723
00:41:36,979 --> 00:41:41,759
value

724
00:41:41,759 --> 00:41:45,630
another story we have a 10 petabyte
clout

725
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:50,369
in which we store third-party data by
the river customers can put the Internet

726
00:41:50,369 --> 00:41:51,259
Data

727
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:55,559
in that location we support FTP for some
more customers

728
00:41:55,559 --> 00:41:59,670
nom which has its own problems and maybe
those customers discover that the

729
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:02,999
computers they're uploading software
firm get compromised

730
00:42:02,999 --> 00:42:06,140
an awful lot a box will look for FTP
credentials

731
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:09,349
and go inject an hour into their content

732
00:42:09,349 --> 00:42:14,729
so tease me we find now or in the cloud
10 petabytes is not an easy problem

733
00:42:14,729 --> 00:42:19,170
how do you want from our you cannot go
look at 10 petabytes of content that is

734
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:20,710
fast moving

735
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:24,890
simply not computationally feasible so
we look at this problem for quite a

736
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:25,670
while

737
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:29,180
and we actually have open source in our
work if anybody wants a copy but you can

738
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,729
go get a copy of it

739
00:42:30,729 --> 00:42:34,930
so pretty you're all here for you but we
actually look at this and we said

740
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:39,069
what is the interesting malware the
people will put in a cloud

741
00:42:39,069 --> 00:42:43,640
that sits behind web servers some other
interesting now where

742
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:48,509
is now we're executing Bulls and we look
at the anti-virus pace for ideas here

743
00:42:48,509 --> 00:42:51,569
in our biggest idea was don't bother

744
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:55,140
right things that are going to get put
in there likely you aren't going to be

745
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,039
spotted by

746
00:42:56,039 --> 00:43:01,019
anti-virus scanners any anti-virus
scanners are expensive to run

747
00:43:01,019 --> 00:43:05,430
but were interesting we're delivering
HTML worry antivirus things not ever

748
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:06,569
look at

749
00:43:06,569 --> 00:43:09,859
HTML by they're looking for executing
balls

750
00:43:09,859 --> 00:43:12,859
but each emails very interesting it's
human readable

751
00:43:12,859 --> 00:43:16,660
it turns out it doesn't have an awful
lot of entropy it turns out that most

752
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:17,880
malware writers

753
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:22,739
are writing things that look very
unusual to the human eye

754
00:43:22,739 --> 00:43:26,299
right or to a computer I'm much more
importantly and the stick out like a

755
00:43:26,299 --> 00:43:27,289
sore thumb

756
00:43:27,289 --> 00:43:31,059
so this template a bike cloud is a
haystack

757
00:43:31,059 --> 00:43:36,380
but looking for a needle in the haystack
isn't very heart

758
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:41,039
because now we're really into HTML
sticks out like a sore thumb

759
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:44,609
youth each email ultimately is designed
to be human readable

760
00:43:44,609 --> 00:43:47,839
so most obfuscation techniques actually
cue stick out

761
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:52,369
even more very few obscene obfuscated
JavaScript

762
00:43:52,369 --> 00:43:56,999
so that it can be evaluated which is a
standard technique that people will use

763
00:43:56,999 --> 00:44:01,130
to deal with people I'm we're trying to
reverse engineer the malware

764
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:05,529
you stick out so far from normal HTML
but it's easy to say

765
00:44:05,529 --> 00:44:09,269
let me just go fight now are there
certain things nobody actually use the

766
00:44:09,269 --> 00:44:10,569
Javascript

767
00:44:10,569 --> 00:44:14,109
so if you put that in your row where
hoax they're easy to find

768
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:17,589
so this was our solution very
lightweight scanner

769
00:44:17,589 --> 00:44:22,589
doesn't cost us an awful lot to run very
effective at finding indications of

770
00:44:22,589 --> 00:44:23,859
malware

771
00:44:23,859 --> 00:44:26,969
not perfect we weren't looking for
perfection

772
00:44:26,969 --> 00:44:30,339
what we were looking for was the hint
that somebody's account has been

773
00:44:30,339 --> 00:44:31,859
compromised

774
00:44:31,859 --> 00:44:35,609
that would let us work with them to
clean up what they were doing insider

775
00:44:35,609 --> 00:44:36,869
system

776
00:44:36,869 --> 00:44:40,559
solving a problem very usually very
cheaply

777
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:47,559
very official Mike and that's what
security value really needs to be about

778
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:54,489
its security professionals we have a lot
on our plates with a lot of things to do

779
00:44:54,489 --> 00:44:58,779
many people here juggle trying to your
key people like only a few people so

780
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:02,910
if you try to learn to juggle you start
with one ball right you take one ball

781
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:06,670
and you throw it from one hand to the
other hand and you do that for a while

782
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:09,670
until you can learn to throw the ball
from one into another

783
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:12,819
and then you take two balls 11 each and

784
00:45:12,819 --> 00:45:16,319
when you throw one ballin before the
other ball gets here you got a broad

785
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:17,559
across and catcher

786
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:20,719
and you do this for a while until you
learn what that's like and then you'll

787
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:22,089
take three balls

788
00:45:22,089 --> 00:45:25,319
two in one hand one over here throw one
ball

789
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:28,609
get the ball out of the way I get this
ball out of the way get this plot away

790
00:45:28,609 --> 00:45:33,119
juggling three balls is pretty easy
almost anybody can do it

791
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,960
so forgive you three things to do

792
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,109
you're gonna be able to juggle those
three things go through things could be

793
00:45:40,109 --> 00:45:43,890
any tasks that you have a hint

794
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:47,640
now what if I give you five balls to
juggle

795
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:51,269
how easy is that is it easier

796
00:45:51,269 --> 00:45:54,380
or harder

797
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:57,920
then if I give you 70

798
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,239
which one are you going to be more
successful at all the incident probably

799
00:46:01,239 --> 00:46:04,710
jumped into everybody's head is five and
nobody wants to stick to the north trick

800
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:05,690
question

801
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:08,779
you that's wrong the answer is seventy

802
00:46:08,779 --> 00:46:11,769
because if I give you five things to
juggle your now below the security

803
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,029
poverty line

804
00:46:13,029 --> 00:46:16,819
and you think you can do it so you will
try

805
00:46:16,819 --> 00:46:20,539
and you will fail if I give you 70

806
00:46:20,539 --> 00:46:24,650
if you're smart you put forty love them

807
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:29,829
and now you're juggling three balls you
fail the 14 but you succeeded at three

808
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:33,200
which is better than you would have
gotten with Fife

809
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:37,829
and that's an important lesson right how
do we figure out what are the things

810
00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:42,890
that we're going to fail at anyway put
them off to the future

811
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:45,640
very hard thing right our brains don't
want to deal with that because we know

812
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,299
what that risk is

813
00:46:47,299 --> 00:46:50,950
but if you're just gonna fail fix
something now

814
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:55,630
fix something that would give you scale
ability into the future

815
00:46:55,630 --> 00:47:00,380
ten years ago I had to do this Arkham I
got caught by the dot-com bubble

816
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:04,869
we laid off 29 percent of our employees
in one day

817
00:47:04,869 --> 00:47:08,269
and that was only one of our reps we
went through several them it was very

818
00:47:08,269 --> 00:47:08,989
ugly

819
00:47:08,989 --> 00:47:12,249
we were told hundred-person company by
the time we came out of the bubble we

820
00:47:12,249 --> 00:47:14,579
were five hundred

821
00:47:14,579 --> 00:47:18,559
right I lost half my security team by
those the first management thing I got

822
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:19,569
to do

823
00:47:19,569 --> 00:47:23,440
I got put in charge for security team
had been five us his peers

824
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,759
I got put in charge of it and the first
thing I got told to do with let to have

825
00:47:26,759 --> 00:47:28,910
them go

826
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:32,900
right how do you make a good decision
like that and then what do you do

827
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:36,859
so we went through this period were in
what we call the lifeboat exercise

828
00:47:36,859 --> 00:47:40,369
but the boat sank now we're on a
lifeboat

829
00:47:40,369 --> 00:47:43,729
and we're trying to bail water as fast
as we can

830
00:47:43,729 --> 00:47:47,359
right we're taking a lot a risk in we
knew it because we were losing money

831
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:49,059
quarter after quarter

832
00:47:49,059 --> 00:47:52,489
and there's a very good chance we didn't
have a business at the other end a bit

833
00:47:52,489 --> 00:47:55,719
so what could we do this is what we did

834
00:47:55,719 --> 00:48:00,680
we dropped balls intentionally with that
this problem is for the future

835
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:04,979
we implemented our own GRC system always
laugh when people come for the Sony gr

836
00:48:04,979 --> 00:48:06,759
seek they built it myself

837
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:10,469
I'm it simple GRC is a spreadsheet

838
00:48:10,469 --> 00:48:13,799
take a spreadsheet and write down
everything you're casting forward to the

839
00:48:13,799 --> 00:48:14,839
future

840
00:48:14,839 --> 00:48:19,289
so that you don't forget and so that in
the future you can go look at that and

841
00:48:19,289 --> 00:48:19,849
say

842
00:48:19,849 --> 00:48:24,630
what are the problems that I have to
deal with

843
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:28,559
so coming back to how to measure
security value I said values about

844
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:32,650
resources times capabilities

845
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:36,249
the gold any security program should be

846
00:48:36,249 --> 00:48:39,619
to increase your value over time

847
00:48:39,619 --> 00:48:42,999
if you are not doing that you're doing
something wrong

848
00:48:42,999 --> 00:48:47,710
right you want to provide more value
tomorrow the new provided today

849
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:51,989
however if you are below the security
poverty line

850
00:48:51,989 --> 00:48:56,549
you probably only think about value in
terms of resources

851
00:48:56,549 --> 00:49:02,049
how do I get more time how do I get more
money

852
00:49:02,049 --> 00:49:06,539
this is not a good goal because if your
capabilities are low people are going to

853
00:49:06,539 --> 00:49:08,329
give you more time for more money

854
00:49:08,329 --> 00:49:12,180
in fact if the view you as an
operational entity

855
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:15,710
by definition you get fewer resources
over time

856
00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:19,369
operational groups were supposed to get
more efficient therefore the less

857
00:49:19,369 --> 00:49:20,420
resources

858
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:25,589
that's in everybody's heads if you want
to run a good security program

859
00:49:25,589 --> 00:49:28,869
your goal is to create technical surplus

860
00:49:28,869 --> 00:49:33,710
increase your capabilities year after
year so that you're doing more with your

861
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:35,420
resources

862
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:39,059
figure out how next year with the same
amount of resources

863
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:43,009
you will provide more value I'm not
saying do more with less

864
00:49:43,009 --> 00:49:47,569
even if it sounds like that I'm actually
saying make yourself more

865
00:49:47,569 --> 00:49:50,700
make each person's murder year after
year

866
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:55,489
week each person better doing better
able to do their tasks

867
00:49:55,489 --> 00:49:59,499
if your tasks are not effective stop
doing the

868
00:49:59,499 --> 00:50:03,789
go do something else do things that
provide value to your business

869
00:50:03,789 --> 00:50:07,390
the money will follow right so I talked
about how

870
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:12,479
a year ago I had 11 people and we give
five problem to the CIO organization

871
00:50:12,479 --> 00:50:17,359
I'm assuming everybody can do now that
leaves you with six people right

872
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:23,569
I have 17 now because the organization
said well you're much more effective

873
00:50:23,569 --> 00:50:27,650
your capabilities are re here's more
problems for you to go deal with your

874
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:29,039
some people

875
00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:32,940
to deal with those problems know they
granted the problems they tended to give

876
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:35,839
me came in trunk that you need about
three people to solve

877
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:39,890
and they gave me two people are the only
things will never give you enough people

878
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:41,390
to solve your problem

879
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:44,459
what they were relying on with our
proven ability

880
00:50:44,459 --> 00:50:48,489
to make those people more effective to
give them better keep abilities they

881
00:50:48,489 --> 00:50:49,680
were right

882
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:53,729
we're still very busy I'd love to have
more people but what we focus on is not

883
00:50:53,729 --> 00:50:54,869
get more people

884
00:50:54,869 --> 00:50:59,589
its be more capable

885
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:02,869
so thank you I have about five minutes
which means I'm

886
00:51:02,869 --> 00:51:07,930
happy to take a question or two or five
from the crowd if anybody wants them

887
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:13,900
I'm this is your opportunity and I think
there's a mic wandering around

888
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:17,359
alright no one knowing that ok we got
one up front up

889
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:21,819
02 polka I um

890
00:51:21,819 --> 00:51:26,390
the don't introduce myself or Justin as
my question to you can be anonymous the

891
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:27,359
but

892
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:31,249
the book The my question is um

893
00:51:31,249 --> 00:51:35,089
the the wat often the the the

894
00:51:35,089 --> 00:51:37,900
a big mistake that companies use to make
was the

895
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:42,559
the well security considering security
feature that is tacked on layered

896
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:45,559
as opposed to be interwoven in or facets
for

897
00:51:45,559 --> 00:51:49,510
are over organization and later the

898
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:53,130
the with people come to realize that is
actually has to be

899
00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:56,690
driven down for management because it
encompasses all of the

900
00:51:56,690 --> 00:52:02,440
the of the organization the only the the
trap where many organization fell into

901
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:03,240
was the

902
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:07,240
that they well-appointed a/c see as
older CISO

903
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:11,819
but the more mike is said the security
poverty line they just

904
00:52:11,819 --> 00:52:16,200
appoint him to to look good a they don't
don't want to get in the way so they

905
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:16,940
don't get many

906
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:20,099
a any budget they don't give them any a
already

907
00:52:20,099 --> 00:52:23,390
as we ends up being scapegoated how did
our

908
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:27,690
did ACA my avoid that trap so I think
we've waited that trap with a couple

909
00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:28,329
different

910
00:52:28,329 --> 00:52:32,140
systems one is we appointed RCS openside

911
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:36,740
right side income in his autumn ICS so I
came in as a security engineer

912
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:40,450
work my way up to being a chief security
architect ran our security team

913
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:43,819
then became CSL so I was somebody

914
00:52:43,819 --> 00:52:47,210
occupies a meritocracy I'm for good or
ill

915
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:50,599
so if you've been there for a while you
have been screwed up an awful lot

916
00:52:50,599 --> 00:52:54,730
then there's a very good chance people
will listen to you rather than your type

917
00:52:54,730 --> 00:52:58,190
that's a big piece of it a second one is
I don't say no

918
00:52:58,190 --> 00:53:01,740
I also don't say yes so give you

919
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:05,579
temple for that we review every single
product launch

920
00:53:05,579 --> 00:53:09,690
so every product we take to market gets
reviewed by our security

921
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:14,920
they don't say yes or no what they do is
they provide a great a pass or fail

922
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:19,359
as to whether or not you did a good
security job and if you fail you can

923
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:20,700
still watch that up at

924
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:24,190
we're not walking the launch because we
used to be a week to approve or

925
00:53:24,190 --> 00:53:25,599
disapprove a product launch

926
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:29,109
now imagine that your product you're the
vice president of product group

927
00:53:29,109 --> 00:53:32,880
your product managers trying to launch a
product to the security team is sitting

928
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:33,640
here saying

929
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:37,210
what we have a problem because for some
reason your folks truth

930
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:42,119
md5 is your hashing algorithm instead of
choosy

931
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:45,220
you know Shaw winery really would have
liked Shah 512

932
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:49,400
your midweek first of three I'm
everything in this conversation at some

933
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,010
point

934
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:53,750
and you have a VP of products who
sitting here saying

935
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:56,950
are you telling me you're not going to
let me launch

936
00:53:56,950 --> 00:54:01,010
something that might be worth $250
million dollars to the business

937
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:04,660
over the selection of a hashing
algorithm how many other places are

938
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:05,630
using md5

939
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:09,059
and when you answer that with an
unpleasantly high number

940
00:54:09,059 --> 00:54:12,710
is a great I'm not taking any more rest
are you really going to hold up this

941
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:15,740
product what are you really going to
hold up this product launch over about

942
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:19,059
and they're going to put you on the spot
and I do you say no

943
00:54:19,059 --> 00:54:23,150
in which case well there is no security
problem or use a

944
00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:27,410
yes in which case they over will you and
no build a little sister around you

945
00:54:27,410 --> 00:54:30,430
right will say we're not gonna listen to
this person anymore

946
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:34,170
neither one of those is a good approach
so instead we said look

947
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:37,700
you can launch this product were feeling
you

948
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:41,670
because for some reason when you decided
to choose a crypto algorithm

949
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:46,170
you a didn't read the policy that we
have which tells you which crypto

950
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:47,400
algorithms to use

951
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:50,579
be didn't talk to one of our security
architects

952
00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:54,190
we have enough for them to provide you
with basic advice like that

953
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:58,240
and see waited until you had written it
to come for security review

954
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:01,339
you failed on that pic account don't do
it in the future

955
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:06,369
but you can't afford it wants a product
you understand what the risk is now

956
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:10,539
you understand what you have done
because what happens in a business

957
00:55:10,539 --> 00:55:13,839
is I decide I want to do something to
here's what I'm going to do

958
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:18,680
security person is this safe or not and
I don't let you tell me about rest

959
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:22,510
I make you give me yes or no I'm going
to ignore your answer

960
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:26,890
so any risk that you find out about his
risk you have to live with

961
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:30,680
I don't have to live with it as a
product manager that's a bad dynamic

962
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:33,970
the product manager should know what
their risk is inside yes we're

963
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:35,839
comfortable with that level over us

964
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:39,799
and that's one of the things that we've
done to prevent that isolation from

965
00:55:39,799 --> 00:55:40,910
coming in

966
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:45,190
is we don't let ourselves be used as a
risk dumping ground

967
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:49,250
you basically taking moreover advisory
role than a goal no goal or

968
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:53,609
know like I don't have to be anonymous
letter where my name is a folk art from

969
00:55:53,609 --> 00:55:54,520
such d by the way

970
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:57,549
yeah I don't have accountability for a
profit loss flight

971
00:55:57,549 --> 00:56:02,190
I don't get to say yes or no right I
have to give advice because I don't have

972
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:04,319
accountability to the bottom line of
business

973
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:07,680
if I have accountability to the bottom
line then I get to say yes or no

974
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:11,920
but that's not the business structure
thank you

975
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:16,900
rock I think we're about other time
myself just hit out of times but i'm for

976
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:17,710
one question

977
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:21,200
but I'm glad you asked that because the
let me bring out an anecdote I forgot to

978
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:28,200
think their own very much have an
awesome conference

979
00:56:33,099 --> 00:56:34,460
you
