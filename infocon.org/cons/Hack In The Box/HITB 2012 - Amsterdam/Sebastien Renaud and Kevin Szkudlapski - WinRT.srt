so

38
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,090
would start at first lawyers aren't

39
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,489
searching for in something you in now
and as a 24 hours

40
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:45,660
released as develop

41
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:52,660
for you

42
00:02:55,209 --> 00:03:01,040
you

43
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,140
rate cuts we have some problems the
microphone setup

44
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:11,140
substituted is Mike

45
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,230
yeah

46
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,900
thanks

47
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,660
so I first we were in 30 40

48
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:27,670
something %um now in his eighth Susu and
I went as a Karen

49
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,980
so we simply def

50
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,100
windows 7 our team turmoil and

51
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:38,250
Windows sad developer her term am waist
down

52
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,260
across I'm function

53
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,270
which was interesting just by its name

54
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:49,580
and his name is anti-free at low
bookstore so

55
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:53,200
and mining this rant finally in a

56
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,480
but but I'm happy approach

57
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,120
refined its related

58
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:06,560
to the Windows Runtime re RT cell

59
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,460
with C Y is windows 8 and you injure
face

60
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:19,460
skoal meter if you haven't seen already
have windows 8 just

61
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:26,700
take a quick look

62
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,870
so these now windows 8 when you when you
log in

63
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:37,520
so that you can see that the disk has
been replaced by

64
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,970
Demi true the stop

65
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:46,090
so it's an is composed of times

66
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,940
and that is tough is now time

67
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:55,880
with other applications so this is the
usual this time

68
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,070
as you seen from app reviews releases

69
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:03,860
a for Windows as you can see the star

70
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:10,860
than disappeared

71
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:19,740
to me apt across a cool miss you

72
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,830
applications we Windows RT

73
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:27,080
is the backbone of

74
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,120
Mitra applications and nine cam

75
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,580
also see a new program

76
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:40,580
and at Target Windows 8 application

77
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:55,620
feature

78
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,680
application to

79
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,680
me true application sir

80
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,210
only through Windows Store is a new
feature

81
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:10,539
of %ah Weiner's a so if you want to
install

82
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:13,610
on an app and me true

83
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,660
application you have to go through
industry you cannot

84
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,270
in sound application Zach going through
the windows were

85
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:25,240
its am December in future biko's

86
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,560
you you can do

87
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,880
um

88
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,990
applications are executed in what is
called

89
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:38,600
and ap container and not container

90
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,949
is process secure through them box

91
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:45,820
it as Sara Lee limited resources

92
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:52,099
axis an issue what to axis sound a
future

93
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:55,680
now operating system unique and explicit
permission

94
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,490
explicit permission she's even by hooker

95
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:02,820
the application am

96
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:07,610
finally major applications are using
restricting chipset of

97
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:13,870
doc win32 API these

98
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:18,520
be feature we are G AT&T's pleats

99
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,470
in two parts a reason on

100
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:26,229
undecided at this time applications as
usual as

101
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:30,970
they can be seen in produced windows
apparently system release

102
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:35,510
and a new parties are not down metres
our applications

103
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:39,530
as you can see some

104
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:42,940
dairies we RT API's and days

105
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:47,750
which can be target I am different
languages

106
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,320
like you see yourself slurs on

107
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:58,320
languages like sharks and BB not net and
I if you want to program

108
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,539
you I for his language you can use and
example

109
00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:04,950
and you also can use

110
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:09,250
JavaScript with HTML and CSS to target
the Wii archie

111
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:16,250
one senior that he's important is dat in
December in this line you can see that

112
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:23,300
win32 is at the day's as after disturb
applications

113
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:28,219
that Tom in fact we 32 we still have two
bays

114
00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:31,500
I be true style applications

115
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,958
it's sad I really steal at the core of

116
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:41,329
we RT it so so you used we stock company
object Muslim

117
00:08:41,329 --> 00:08:48,010
so

118
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:51,110
mom applications

119
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:55,130
them that I use for and the Windows
Runtime

120
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:58,140
me true applications are instill

121
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,430
by user this is a member to future
because

122
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:06,329
issue and town an application UN staff
for the Cure in shooter

123
00:09:06,329 --> 00:09:09,410
am am my niece mean

124
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:12,709
you do not need and ministry real
privileges

125
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:17,870
to his town an application on

126
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:21,610
applications are the cage through am

127
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:25,870
for deployment now even a PIX packages

128
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:32,370
which are effect simply easy fine so the
pic HR

129
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:36,089
compressed narrow also sign disease

130
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:39,900
certificates and from

131
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:43,110
packages contains only two fights

132
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:46,310
so you you don't need to rely on
external fights

133
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:51,680
for example I am only find reprise for

134
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,579
for your %ah applications arm docket for
example

135
00:09:55,579 --> 00:10:00,510
if you use doesn't language are DC plus
plus runtimes

136
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:04,750
which are sushi wheeze your application
package

137
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,000
packages can

138
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,170
target multiple platforms I can its

139
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:14,490
86 x64 are

140
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:18,630
Aram RMR is a new feature of

141
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:21,959
coming Windows 8 system because

142
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:25,690
this is the first time that Windows is
targeting the

143
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:32,690
AR and noms sipped system

144
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:38,959
com 3 instilling application

145
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,079
you simply go through the Windows Store

146
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,459
and I'm on

147
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:49,839
inside an a package you have and affects
many fixed

148
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,260
not XML which describe and application
registration

149
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,980
inside dad the registry so

150
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,150
Windows registry steel hurt of

151
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:08,150
we know it. and the windows 8

152
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:20,860
so we'll see how is built big cage

153
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:48,050
so this is a simple pic H up contest

154
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:51,690
application on expected

155
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:56,660
backed as if I'm as you can see inside
the biggest our

156
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:00,360
main executive and distaff duck easy

157
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,490
which comes

158
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,660
reason for example in our

159
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,680
is accompanied cheese

160
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,120
a DM which is required bad

161
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,730
applications the DL it comes inside the
package

162
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:20,170
and on

163
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:25,740
the interesting arts is epics manifest
which is used

164
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,160
during and installation I found the pic

165
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:35,240
to

166
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,930
yours what look like affix manifest not
be too high

167
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:45,930
it as them the application market which
is dead the main market farm

168
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:49,360
which is the core the restriction

169
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,459
so in fact at pics manifest is an not

170
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:57,990
inside Windows registry and during in
session all keys

171
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:01,160
are an in fact an

172
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:08,160
coming from these external fire

173
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,350
so entire Iran many Espana

174
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:16,610
an application which the

175
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:20,330
registration capabilities which tell

176
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:24,870
what application is below to do and
extensions

177
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:28,690
which are for example our geo so on

178
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:32,730
it as what application can use and

179
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:36,900
recent version previously accuracies
mapped onto the registry in

180
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:43,900
a ski see you key

181
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,300
so we have instant our at the haitian

182
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,550
so if you we'll look into

183
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:59,770
I'm its case you she's accurate user

184
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:04,280
we have our application is a software

185
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:10,690
India's classes you free

186
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:17,690
it down

187
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,270
we can't I'm our package this is dead

188
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:26,990
dist Edition package inside diana

189
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:33,990
the windows launch extension

190
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:46,410
so Werner candidly tease have ATT's on

191
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:49,950
by default and

192
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:53,130
application is severly meted in what can

193
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:56,240
axis so capabilities are here to

194
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,030
22 now black debt application

195
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:04,470
and I can do for example can only Tease
arm

196
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:09,650
can be regrouped into 3 3

197
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,880
three main points we have network hi
system

198
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,750
and devices for example let's %um if you

199
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,970
if the developer want to access and
intern

200
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:23,420
and he can tell

201
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:27,140
during development that in meet

202
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:30,590
is application needs to access the
internet

203
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:33,760
so eenie to put the capital ET's

204
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:40,540
on as tree out of the internet so we
have these capabilities you

205
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:47,540
you can't axis all of these things

206
00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:00,230
arm so we have Tina

207
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:04,200
everything is mapped onto the the
registry cell

208
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,230
applications can be can be seen

209
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:10,410
as classes in in there is history

210
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:13,510
cyl on

211
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:18,720
contracts and extensions some

212
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,790
for example if you develop an
application and

213
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:27,120
automatically am implement still launch
contract those contract is

214
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,380
simply for displaying now data
application time

215
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:37,160
in their windows 8 and messed up so

216
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,320
when I user tap Oakley time it fax

217
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,940
it cold there launch contract am

218
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:49,720
we can see him ammm

219
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,350
that extension is an abstract concept in
fact

220
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:57,790
wild and the class is a concrete
implementation

221
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:01,240
for example an in our case

222
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,290
now our just obligation is an extension
the

223
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:08,030
fight beaker contract which is just on

224
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:11,860
and a simple jog to my

225
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:15,069
be on a fine you YouCam peak

226
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:22,069
a file without asking the system at
first

227
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,110
still dumb all

228
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:31,420
and application he started actors

229
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:34,840
danis his family Crary am

230
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,840
and extension Capello to find

231
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,420
the right extension so everything starts

232
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:45,760
in expert dirty when

233
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,130
you you tap Arkley a time

234
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:54,160
inside the Windows 8 and desktop on

235
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,980
it it is extradite exit at ease call

236
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,040
at first so it simply tech

237
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:06,150
now on extension cantana am

238
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:10,210
jerky the rightobject can be activated

239
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:14,470
monster Activision man take place

240
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:17,770
and Explorer dirty sound they were

241
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:21,850
a requests to apcs so every CSS

242
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:25,060
is is service in

243
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:28,480
Windows which is running at dan network

244
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,810
privileges itself lower pew

245
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:36,560
privilege an if the process

246
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:42,730
not already running RPC uses sound they
were pressed to the decom loan service

247
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:47,630
which is running as system service and

248
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:50,660
application is started at that point

249
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,740
so we're thinking about doing

250
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:57,910
how some an live did not going on stage

251
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:01,260
I'm directly

252
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,860
Explorer that easy and their pieces is
she's quite the challenge

253
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:08,760
so sometimes when sure the beginning at
the CSS

254
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,030
if something goes wrong you got a BSOD
so I am

255
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:15,650
we we choose to not giving in-state

256
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:19,950
am at the base

257
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:23,720
of Windows RT we still have

258
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,580
win32 and come so

259
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:31,060
companies here mine the fact that it

260
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:34,930
object is in fact am implementing

261
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:39,420
I unknown interface as

262
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:43,630
specifically for Windows RT object we
after

263
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:46,830
I inspected all mmm interface

264
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:50,130
and

265
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:54,860
API at the haitian been re- interface is
here too

266
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,600
unify and all languages through

267
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,790
projection a project and in fact

268
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:05,690
is now is here too

269
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:09,640
to you you'll be fine all language means
out for example

270
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,730
if you have programmed a component in
now

271
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:16,270
c plus plus and on you

272
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:20,040
you can use and Dez company from

273
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,240
another language like your javascript or
an

274
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:30,240
are any document language though these
what looks like now where is the object

275
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,520
to

276
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,320
there the object is here eating firm

277
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,910
I am now and I can spectacle on

278
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:46,550
it implements three interfaces and

279
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:50,330
its runtime class its fine information

280
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:53,360
to will take an user simpler

281
00:20:53,360 --> 00:21:00,360
example

282
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:10,690
this is simple easy to clean house at
this list in fact

283
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:15,520
if you want to target the Wii knows RT
you can use it less plus

284
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,310
Res campanas extensions

285
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:24,440
cheese not really in a new language but
and the addition to the set list list

286
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:24,990
language

287
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:29,480
in fact everything in the house at this
place

288
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,830
and wheeze company extensions is mapped
to

289
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:37,580
lower level seems like an mom

290
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:40,990
templates in acid listless are

291
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:45,710
come behind-the-scene still

292
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:49,590
anti simple company and tuna is

293
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:52,770
implementing 3 minutes

294
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:56,670
government and divide to

295
00:21:56,670 --> 00:22:01,360
here is that wonderful implementation am

296
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,710
its object

297
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:07,990
now dis company can be used

298
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:12,850
nineties for example in now this
compound mister

299
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:16,500
we just to create a new

300
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:22,470
cock Weiner G Campana is it object we
used to hand it over with to printers

301
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:25,700
and convert and dismantle to

302
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:32,320
the search result to text this is a

303
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,770
the same example but this time and now

304
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:41,270
we are using a feature a of

305
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:44,430
on c plus plus by using

306
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:48,030
and Islam better function table

307
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:51,230
the object because each object

308
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:54,720
on is in fact having

309
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,790
visual function table so

310
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:07,790
you you reserve how look likes an object
and we aren't you have checked this is

311
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:10,270
%ah

312
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:14,050
our cow company at bashas

313
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:17,140
up there object yet in fact they have
checked

314
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:20,340
is now here eating from between RT

315
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:26,410
place which is cool object at the days
we have the arbitral function pointer

316
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:30,000
as you can see we have we still have

317
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,260
three methods of high and no which are
for interface

318
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:37,710
Andrea and release is subject is

319
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:43,410
in fact rifkind object the three-year
their meter

320
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:47,120
get I these it run thankless and get
risley those

321
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,160
are and metal from I N spectacle

322
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:54,510
ice pick tool in fact she's am use for

323
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:59,280
it's useful for down the street when you

324
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:03,190
when you need to you to you

325
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:06,460
when you count I really called a query
interface kit

326
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:12,530
just use I speak till is used to get
interfaces

327
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:17,490
from your dick following their I
inspected all three minutes

328
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:21,940
we have the middle the meter it's are
implemented are

329
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:26,270
I hear how our object so we have AB I'm

330
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:30,200
multiply FBI I had and AVI

331
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,350
these meet its are

332
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:37,110
in fact and clearly using

333
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:40,690
Abii of wean archie their abou

334
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:44,440
energies toner calling conventions is
typical

335
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,890
Annan wheeze

336
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:50,980
additions at you past these the

337
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:54,030
the sporter in as the first argument

338
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:58,510
the object also have mu

339
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:02,210
and then deem it hurts which are them

340
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:07,060
flowing did we know it. maybe and

341
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:10,360
years gore or two

342
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:17,230
be disassembly this is the same meter
that we have seen previously

343
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:22,330
is dead dismissed

344
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:25,690
is dead had and convert to

345
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:31,180
stream to

346
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:36,760
at first we have now DC's

347
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,930
now the constrictor the object which

348
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:46,930
and I in fact we learned axiomatic the
uptick

349
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:52,310
we have as we can see

350
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:56,000
beautiful the beautiful

351
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,670
their insurance

352
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:03,910
an the following

353
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:08,990
he's the head meters which is called
inside the table

354
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:12,120
index 7 and

355
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:15,370
following their because

356
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:20,810
its come object

357
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:25,450
now we have

358
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:29,870
we have we knows the extreme which is

359
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:34,880
using the in fact just string object
from Windows RT

360
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,710
that its come string object

361
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:41,920
behind-the-scene and finally we have

362
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:46,310
this router up the object

363
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:49,330
to now we have seen how

364
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:52,730
object on 10 used

365
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:57,450
and now I will if you talk

366
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:03,090
are you sir Windows

367
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:07,030
me okay thanks

368
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:10,450
as we saw previously Windows

369
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:14,520
is thanks and you way to download Win
car to pick a sham

370
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:20,679
and asherz microsoft employs a wall
applications that can decide

371
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:23,679
is a real or not your applications

372
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:27,860
and ask you to respect requirements

373
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:32,889
medically series your application must
be

374
00:27:32,889 --> 00:27:36,090
leach with Sarah Flagg like a safe

375
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:42,679
ch dynamic days and is compact on
deputation the rebound investment hang

376
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:43,509
or crash

377
00:27:43,509 --> 00:27:48,210
and asked to define the stuff fun with
an RPI

378
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:52,340
but the cases win32 API

379
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:56,440
microsoft provides a Windows app
certification kit

380
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,240
since we are big for win32 API

381
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,179
would try to call by good by PI

382
00:28:04,179 --> 00:28:08,840
and many dates check of acceptation
keeps

383
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:15,840
okay to do so

384
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:21,360
we have to medically user well mansion

385
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:26,580
picnics which weekend address of
canada-based

386
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:31,539
idea then we pasts appear for Mark to
retrieve

387
00:28:31,539 --> 00:28:36,230
RPI which went to court here is

388
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:43,230
crap process which of course is from
within by in my purse ok ass

389
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,460
effect click here

390
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:51,460
medically it's fun CMD box

391
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:55,450
hi mom

392
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:59,730
even see three sixes corner for me a PI

393
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:06,730
as you can see nasty enzyme so

394
00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:14,210
%uh we warn microsoft with this issue
according to them the pass from Mark

395
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:17,909
task before the planes applications

396
00:29:17,909 --> 00:29:21,610
and things stopped dis ecosystem

397
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:26,299
coach Lewis last two proficiency in
Windows

398
00:29:26,299 --> 00:29:30,009
fine stance even see if

399
00:29:30,009 --> 00:29:33,499
asked addition kids last name add to
cart this program

400
00:29:33,499 --> 00:29:37,129
both additional updates from Microsoft

401
00:29:37,129 --> 00:29:41,119
and now free on users to meet again this
issue

402
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:44,669
I

403
00:29:44,669 --> 00:29:47,789
now on

404
00:29:47,789 --> 00:29:49,519
capabilities which we're

405
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:52,769
detail later the new flying from

406
00:29:52,769 --> 00:29:56,110
p be theirs by the CLI

407
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:59,669
to crap process has a tradition

408
00:29:59,669 --> 00:30:05,080
be around I am

409
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:08,169
this is a just capabilities

410
00:30:08,169 --> 00:30:13,080
as a million this is my side dish

411
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:20,080
receive Ye's such okay debris from and
about what some box

412
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:26,009
by the cases mechanism which to

413
00:30:26,009 --> 00:30:30,360
is interested processes and Yuri

414
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:36,670
somebody's campaign is rated process

415
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:40,430
somebody process which one with very
limited rights

416
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:43,780
so brooker process which

417
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:47,050
Kaiser eyes at the process to

418
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:51,860
is a specific actions is that we not
cheap days

419
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:56,720
its diabetes and finally we found
eyepiece mechanism

420
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,910
which to cook which I both

421
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:06,210
from this process and Booker to
communicate mom

422
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:09,870
Microsoft provide the mansion of
copyrights is it the process

423
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:12,960
medically we have the recipe for can
which

424
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,730
to are restrict side dish

425
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:21,900
and did privileges lesser fines and up
to objects

426
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:25,010
which when assigned process

427
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:29,140
to limit access to this talk tomorrow
and song

428
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:32,840
for me the question of the process

429
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,990
and restrict the use of CPU memory exit

430
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:40,570
it's one thing that's on Windows

431
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:43,950
is Mitch desktop

432
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:47,420
medically application come communicates
across

433
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:50,620
this top if you want to isn't a process

434
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:55,460
you can simply treating you to stop and
but the new process

435
00:31:55,460 --> 00:32:00,630
on on and finally

436
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:05,450
since when does this Microsoft designs
into rich

437
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:09,290
use area applications

438
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:13,450
one reason the gym if you say too low
its

439
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:17,460
in a bird to restrict access to
undefined ass

440
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:22,270
data look at for the Chargers and
injuries three

441
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:25,980
subtract did once again for the charger

442
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:29,450
there are so interesting feature which

443
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:32,560
is you iPic user interface

444
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:36,100
communities additions which to for major

445
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:39,840
right that missus process

446
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,870
I

447
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:49,520
intuitive process if your application is

448
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,840
low integrated between

449
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:59,840
will not be at two chances two villages
on fraternities

450
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:05,180
some restriction about this there's a PI
like as a ZnO went too far with the

451
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,540
process to

452
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:09,660
could any Cisco liza compromising

453
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:12,860
lanix so images run average

454
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:17,970
Cisco medically will not ship addition
could possibly

455
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:22,350
this is going into Gaza an average our
sizes

456
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:25,530
some music which can be secured by
design likes

457
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:30,240
for system acaso

458
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,550
this compound from win arches I am

459
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:39,580
we decided to choose from because it's a
win the summer implementations

460
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:43,640
its OpenSSL say when the commentator and
he designed for on

461
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:48,740
security unleash workout partner is more
like

462
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:53,650
Microsoft that puts a software there is
between processes

463
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:57,460
in order to compare them with use

464
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:01,059
Sarah points like hola some box

465
00:34:01,059 --> 00:34:06,180
is it's a process house a broker is
designed and finally how's it can

466
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:06,980
communicate

467
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:10,919
of crime

468
00:34:10,919 --> 00:34:14,590
this offense peace confusing but

469
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:19,090
in fact sitting restrictive SADC

470
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:22,200
restrictive makes

471
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:26,090
accessed 6

472
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:29,320
from a double check it was first check

473
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:33,000
if access object current account

474
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,649
to access the subject

475
00:34:37,649 --> 00:34:40,820
see is a restricted SAT is

476
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:46,050
is urs now supports

477
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:49,240
must SAT works eyes as

478
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:53,360
is a which basically means is again

479
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,100
are used by

480
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:59,460
the night only produces is addition
relies on

481
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:04,510
job and discount for Windows XP into
Richard this time

482
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:09,850
this and its fermenting vats
applications stocks with

483
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:13,720
know my rights Anderson this is process
asked to put lower

484
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:18,860
took to be is rated on the map as a sign

485
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:24,160
decided to implement is rationing come
basic reason we define the structure

486
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,510
took Anna which answers like packages
side dish

487
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:31,900
his side ish and design a new flight

488
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:35,110
which leaves at the carnies in ap now on

489
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:38,910
if you want to

490
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:42,000
creates app but not the kind you must

491
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,960
call anti-crime books that can which

492
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:50,600
do uses a new fires said into which you
need to know

493
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:56,740
and change access right to access fights
out and on the crow a funny stratos

494
00:35:56,740 --> 00:36:01,000

check with on axis prissy some buses
processes

542

causes antitrust fine wheeze

544
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:30,730
rights finally if

545
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:33,950
the function succeeds since

546
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:37,300
our process as it home

547
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,520
100 table it asked to

548
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,830
duplicated and invited to the shimmery
to

549
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:49,830
to give it back to the some buses
process on with the cheese

550
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:54,360
from us improve because Microsoft
designed a new LP I am

551

with some objects house was this report

553
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:05,150
so it will

554
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:09,010
mister subject martian its sinus was ABC
Fox

555
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:12,990
on the progress anyway and nationally to
institutions object

556
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:17,420
things is process context

557
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:21,130
and then he will 60s summers it was as a
good

558
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:24,590
commit suicide each is so we will open
the final

559
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:28,060
and user once again the cum object

560
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:34,420
son Max is a visit to the synthesis
process just for fun we

561
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:37,610
just super huge displace

562
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:40,860
on NTSB cease and whites receive

563
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:43,980
on the progress either too many cases

564
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:47,260
what kinda data San across

565
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:53,560
some this process and Booker so I use a
simple application which

566
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:57,040
just right to set down to the final
that's it

567
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:01,160
so as you can see in mark actor week
retrieve

568
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:04,170
jugg which describes come

569
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:09,400
interface fertilizer its name and benno
is there is

570
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,119
unique under

571
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:17,220
mastering can use a back its eyes do you
mean that is

572
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:21,069
retrieve as animals are fine and

573

to conclude wenatchee

576
00:41:34,049 --> 00:41:37,220
provide new design you a PI which

577
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:40,520
to is a designer very own

578
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:45,079
management applications decided to

579
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:48,859
rely on com technology because it's

580
00:41:48,859 --> 00:41:52,970
it's a good choice for sharing data
across process

581
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:56,170
I was out cold

582
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:59,740
it's provided with a degree of is
rations

583
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:03,079
it's very tough bounce from us user give
a pass

584
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:08,400
and its its misconduct decided to
implement it in common

585
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:13,559
rising use my stance receipt to Kansas
prefer not to modify

586
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:16,770
assisting function to do the same thing

587
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:21,760
