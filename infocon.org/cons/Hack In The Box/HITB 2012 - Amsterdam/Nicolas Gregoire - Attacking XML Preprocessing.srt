00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,299
Firefox have a sideways a knife where

18
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:12,490
on but they're you ok and some libraries
which are used to write

19
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:16,090
I

20
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:19,730
that's what I will speak about I went
first to introduce

21
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:23,220
XOM at the cottages as and I we speak
about

22
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,710
a church I contrition which is a fact of
hiding some

23
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:32,670
interesting that the inside XOM a
printing house is and I we have

24
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:33,410
presented

25
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:36,600
I am 18 they are also be setbacks

26
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,750
which I I

27
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,820
use for in black box mod in order alone

28
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,130
detect the first specific kind of
processing a QoS

29
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,500
Anza main technique or boss

30
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,880
which is expedition of bus xxc

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,000
and excessive changing our abilities

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,500
so except best chance for extensive
mock-up language

33
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,860
we went right to be fine sir three times
mock-up

34
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:07,070
its a 2011 its like

35
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:10,130
a shame and everything between

36
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,269
angle brackets and lost some bags

37
00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:16,950
I you are some a trumpet saw

38
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:23,950
here talk so it's very December
extensibility his family and her sons

39
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:29,450
in order to understand extensibility we
need to understand them spaces

40
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:34,430
and I'm spaces I he was told he finds
the

41
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:38,220
precise meaning of attack and yeah

42
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:43,620
shorty defined by Ewing wire so is that
serve every December

43
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,890
exam for we had edge chairmen

44
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:51,080
such amount with dawn m spaces that is
good for

45
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,510
truck what which is a access Jamie
expect him and namespace

46
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,950
and her for wine which is plant 12:08
a.m. space

47
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:05,250
I with the my oh I know you are and then

48
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,390
price I went white all and upright he is
their commands

49
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:12,840
ISO wall to wall when me and just called

50
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,370
because a brotha no ID also meaning

51
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:20,190
officer you a dike in this namespace
okay

52
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:24,069
so as a main US

53
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:28,329
of namespaces is to avoid Mb which is
for example or

54
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:32,180
show all fine fun dike you need to know
if it's free

56
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:38,950
all all or various better fit your

57
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:44,810
or a character recognition fight but
there is some

58
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,209
more interesting stuff all echoes you
can use some

59
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:52,790
namespaces in order to with preggo some
very specific features

60
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:56,269
following some parts her first one can
be used at all

61
00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:00,709
called PHP code from XSLT it could be
used for

62
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:04,540
service upon one can be used to all
create fire

00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:57,560
answer is yes is the commands

is set for our interesting sinks death

92
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:04,570
first some XM and that's how we as
embedded ex ante cut

93
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:08,000
its are so self-contained

94

if we you feel fantastic command in
serum bozos

98
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,469
in Firefox across a mix

99
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:31,229
is a into name also extension you out
the

100
00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:34,529
win soccer it seems okay I

101
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:39,010
in up there are you Kansas M Resort and
any

102
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:42,750
prong from young man suffering a and
Marc Staal

103
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:47,840
you will get a right sacher and you will
need to check your champion directory

104
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,729
fall

105
00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:55,729
fight just shrugged

106
00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:02,300
XML is used in there are tough but the
courageous

107
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,409
so I read this book about is BGN

108
00:07:05,409 --> 00:07:08,659
excess NT each offering some

109
00:07:08,659 --> 00:07:12,449
drugs you are probably using all SS all
item fits

110
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:16,000
so of is the commands

111
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,469
almost the XML what's obvious

112
00:07:19,469 --> 00:07:22,539
you lose a lot of estimate the carriages
for example a sub

113
00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:25,860
all xml-rpc and you can

114
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,259
evangelists and music using some X

115
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:33,529
xspf painless which are supported by
AT&T

116
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:36,860
so there is a some XML

117
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:41,060
documents everywhere and they are some

118
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,400
real-life screenshot of application
using xom.n

119
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,389
saws thats a because %uh flank

120
00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:51,680
I um unlike some miss and

121
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,909
as as a usual you can provider

122
00:07:54,909 --> 00:08:00,490
xom.n fight which will be the boss by
separatism so you can on trigger some

123
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:02,180
specific processing Summerside

124
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:06,039
the w/free CA

125
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:10,699
offers is kinda functionality which is a
XSLT and Shane

126
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:13,819
a bit more online you can provide you on

127
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:17,150
you I tall excess NT and XML

128
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:21,360
so it's very dangerous I didn't check
but you can probably

129
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,830
executor job cuts have aside uses this
kind of

130
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:29,550
interface I'll plan to post

131
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:34,589
is a French I shipping service and if
you are using

132
00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:37,630
professional Nash on of the interface

133
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:42,289
you have some link okay you have some
inca Alexis

134
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:45,579
and so fun park is not

135
00:08:45,579 --> 00:08:49,420
this giant of Sublette and this

136
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:54,010
power meters all is a key is a same
insert some for a petition

137
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:58,839
provide in with with exile NJ so it
could be isn't gonna post

00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:02,120
is using in protection offers Internet

139
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:07,410
samper excellent reputation which is
very even there a bar to a lot of thanks

140
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:11,480
I didn't play with it but you could
write

141
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,610
dumb

142
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:18,130
that some hunger wizard are looking fall

143
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:23,180
n you already X excess said he already
acquired HTTP

144
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:26,850
is fun ball is at you up

145
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:31,260
are at the coaches you up aspx annual of
some

146
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:35,050
X where we you of some Java selfless

147
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:38,069
and hearing loss some PHP code

148
00:09:38,069 --> 00:09:42,270
so it's really a cross-platform
everybody's using XSLT

149
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:48,380
worm admonish are using impish Pook

150
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:55,380
X speaks everything is a person born in
Dec summit when auditing some

151
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,800
application using XML we

152
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:05,089
need the to ask of self social question
as a

153
00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:09,870
first question is ok and we feed some
XML the command to Lizzie application

154
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:13,290
its always the same program the

155
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:17,990
auditing and issue or find a way to or
submit

156
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:22,230
that %uh for example or file a fraud all
rest interface

157
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:26,329
or anything s you need to ask

158
00:10:26,329 --> 00:10:32,160
he said that %uh process based
application so I have a a nice example

159
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,769
or

160
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:36,010
issue all approach to is usually fight
to which email yeah

161
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:41,079
poison for Wikipedia there is an
automatic on the shuttle

162
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:46,220
PNG which appeals so it can be a
difficult to detect

163
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:51,199
you'll just can approach some is usually
fine but you need to know is that syriza

164
00:10:51,199 --> 00:10:54,800
some processing done Summerside but a
month but the sacred

165
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:00,170
are so is there some processing

166
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:03,930
you need to find who is doing is a
processing and where

167
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:07,209
it's mostly crap side and sell side

168
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:11,329
in some b2b and even months you can find
some

169
00:11:11,329 --> 00:11:14,380
gateways which are doing funds have
tried

170
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:19,029
awesome a shunt in order to loose you
bought severed echelon of the same for

171
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:19,490
the or

172
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:23,329
on some poor and the every message

173
00:11:23,329 --> 00:11:24,940
example or is the

174
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:29,550
a Tom all rss feeds which can be either
way to try on side

175
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:32,590
in your brotha all into a dedicated
software

176
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:36,190
or sever site for some porn in your
Google homepage

177
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:39,970
and then

178
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:44,020
what once you know where also processing
points

179
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:47,210
unit till I some pressure on about

180
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:51,570
sapphic status so if you can submit some

181
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:54,910
I before E that %uh all processing
instruction

182
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:55,699
I

183
00:11:55,699 --> 00:12:00,559
some executed by stipulation issue
consummate some

184
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:04,889
from all all expert on titty a result if
yes you'll probably

185
00:12:04,889 --> 00:12:08,720
a XML external entity been a meaty and

186
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,980
issue can provide some exited he cud
wish

187
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,600
extension all have a more you can of
something like a

188
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,569
I am accessing databases or anything
meetings i cud

189
00:12:20,569 --> 00:12:24,350
I

190
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:27,600
are exerting more pressure on the Rings
a torch all Bay

191
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,850
on item fits site to the rave

192
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:36,249
a its Fort but it's a a simplistic view
of

193
00:12:36,249 --> 00:12:40,019
unfit you either with dike which is
fitted the updater

194
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:43,519
and for ish and where you are runners-up
iight

195
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,319
the the morning pressure to ease

196
00:12:47,319 --> 00:12:51,089
I from empower we have free summer sign
the petition

197
00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:56,499
one using power and our index and a
dedicated library

198
00:12:56,499 --> 00:13:00,179
I one using PHP and online next

199
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:03,709
and for my saying he's done with exit
SNT

200
00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:06,709
and one and a Windows using the

201
00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:11,559
NJ JSP and excess NT and a ton

202
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:16,869
content is provided by some me in
Concord someone's internet

203
00:13:16,869 --> 00:13:19,949
and hear his is editor

204
00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:26,949
arm

205
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:37,800
so if thats a copy of the Atom feed from
so US cell

206
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:44,800
as you can see it here and a free some
it was a

207
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:49,270
for a petition we have a very simple
Despres for each

208
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:52,960
and we we have the size of the entry and
its name

209
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:57,560
and we have exactly the same layout

210
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:02,770
on PHP and

211
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:09,770
in Java

212
00:14:13,939 --> 00:14:15,089
okay

213
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:19,730
so everybody is no okay with XML we
speak about

214
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:24,670
think it's a shame and XD PE Zor fight
for my

215
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:28,300
defined by Ida B it's a there we are to
fight for might

216
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,529
and this is a screenshot of its leaky
PDF page

217
00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:35,889
the interesting point is that

218
00:14:35,889 --> 00:14:41,769
I is this for my gun and be used as a
container for PDF and be safe a

219
00:14:41,769 --> 00:14:45,529
at that %ah and he he can actually use

220
00:14:45,529 --> 00:14:52,120
I inside pgm the German so it's easy to
see we can play with some darts

221
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:58,709
I eggs the peewees inside PDF file
inside XD be fired inside the PDF

222
00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:03,069
and we will try to find some interesting
used

223
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:06,110
like you're bypassing ninety various

224
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:09,209
I am so

225
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:13,509
it's a is a MSF we typed the PDF file
ease

226
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:16,959
generated by Middlesbrough it it's a
very basic pizza

227
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,579
we have always been a meaty and

228
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:24,170
guzmán its did eighty that here 80

229
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:28,220
out of nine and here 27 out over 40 free

230
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:32,709
anti-virus think its in fifty I will try
to avoid

231
00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:37,649
at least some anti-virus I

232
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:40,889
that's the patch call me despite its

233
00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:46,980
something like that tan lines long and
it's very simple you take your PDF

234
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:52,680
you do some basics the following kidding
and you put a raise your two here

235
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:59,680
and you yet the XTP fight and if this
image is exemplified to

236
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:03,350
anti-virus we get 0 out of nine

237
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:07,310
and she will out though forty three-e_

238
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:10,639
anti research on so we have the for

239
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,430
I some facades and detection a invasion

240
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:18,380
is the fun part is that XDP fights

241
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:23,630
all 02 Michael E automatically open by
either be under Windows

242
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:27,010
its there we see me at all icon so if
you can

243
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:32,220
as you send an email with a XDP I
dismantle and a user KK kinds at this

244
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,199
month's you get

245
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:40,199
your money issues PDF open entitled to
be

246
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:49,410
so know we fly to kuwait some limited
resources have a sham

247
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:53,750
in order to detect some kind of
processing in black box mod

248
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:58,140
so if we go back to the

249
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:01,810
I'm as busy to PNG collection by a week
amid yeah

250
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:03,890
we may want to is the

251
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:08,330
DTD processed and so we will use the

252
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:11,890
billion enough I'd like which is very
well known I

253
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:15,510
it's quite simple how you define your
DTD

254
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:18,570
and I would you define her daughter by a
bug its value

255
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:22,760
Israel or and zarar one bad but its
value is ten times

256
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,730
there are by and large extra writes that
the rights that iraq and in your

257
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:29,400
documents you in September lar 9

258
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,430
by Amber so you love 'em something like
it

259
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:36,290
in memory I extension I was the

260
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:40,970
by Amber and if we do some quick might

261
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:44,580
we will get tests 1 billionth
after-hours trading

262
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:49,560
which is a free gigabyte which could be
enough to slow down sir salvo

263
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:53,820
and detect that GTE's effectively
processed by so we

264
00:17:53,820 --> 00:18:00,820
Wikimedia application for know we want
to we detect

265
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:07,700
if some xman did our signature up a
geisha and he's supporting

266
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,920
City the gnome say

267
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:16,480
it should be toward Anza best practice
by Sir W free see sage word and

268
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,630
so we are something similar all

269
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:24,180
you of the excessive number of function
which we combat

270
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:29,430
one number to in and has a format we
will try to combat so

271
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,750
one fifty-seven and the I for much

272
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:39,200
is fall room and and you know what so we
get this kind of

273
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,690
output and interesting seeing

274
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:46,440
is that the and is the be guest unit

275
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:51,070
in New remind me watched so if we asked
for all be gone by US

276
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:55,970
we will get a lot of am cell

277
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:59,640
well we get sweet requesting some very
large number

278
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,780
you and we will get

279
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:07,650
1 gigabyte of and so it's see me know it
is our previous week

280
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:11,300
but you are be addicting exit had tea
processing

281
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:16,790
and not DTD processing so I have a few

282
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:23,790
demonstrations the

283
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,690
so is that since the

284
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:32,100
billion love attacks I just love a user
like six

285
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:39,100
in order not to crush my computer the
saudis

286
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:45,890
I submit as a Barbie dish I need walks I
get for me a bite Strang

287
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:51,520
in PHP you out the kind of care or miss
H

288
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:57,990
because mean excuse me here there is the

289
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:01,070
and then entity reference group which is
depicted

290
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:05,140
I i dont other look to the caused it but
maybe can bypass

291
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:10,320
its PHP it is it's good

292
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,760
um and in JSP

293
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,890
we we get on there all because

294
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:21,670
we can ok no so it works it soon as a
team

295
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:28,670
and it works in JSP to

296
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:34,600
and here it's the extend number

297
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:41,600
proof of concept solos upon occasion is
not using city so no point in texting

298
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,260
the PHP one it walks

299
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,630
I don't know to Caesars part by its very
small

300
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:54,280
and if we submit to JSP

301
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,540
we get and they're all because it can
combat

302
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:00,800
values which are great too goes on

303
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:06,210
foale for sons I don't know why it's
probably in order to avoid he's kind of

304
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:07,220
been a bit is

305
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:10,420
but there is no documentation related to
assess

306
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:13,840
to this bag of future it depends

307
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,020
ok am

308
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:25,020
and I love seeing if I try to a pens the

309
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:29,770
feed directly in Firefox the week

310
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:31,999
detect some

311
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:36,399
it's some atom and we propose some to
subscribe to the field

312
00:21:36,399 --> 00:21:40,019
and as you can see we have the

313
00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:43,450
extension which appeals so it's very
funny

314
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:50,450
rod

315
00:21:51,639 --> 00:21:58,639
okay

316
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,470
no and I we no speak about XML exxon
entities

317
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:07,130
which is probably is the

318
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:10,700
must come on XM over in a rarity it's
very

319
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,830
simper you would define a doctype

320
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,770
and a

321
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:19,179
ninety which is yup harassed and

322
00:22:19,179 --> 00:22:23,240
its by you is the cunt and of the DTC
bus boss fight

323
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,470
so each time you weed I use is this

324
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:30,779
value in your the commands it will be
replaced by the cunt aunt

325
00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:37,779
I was the ATC but what fight is that
some

326
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,789
x6 even a meat is finished all Holland

327
00:22:43,789 --> 00:22:49,549
since I last summer in blood that he'd
serve in a bit is iPhone myself

328
00:22:49,549 --> 00:22:54,029
and in red it's been a bit is in some
libraries

329
00:22:54,029 --> 00:22:57,039
call for example our rest let

330
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:01,610
I was touched as the switch and there is
the

331
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:05,059
some seemed like a 10 or 20 application

332
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:08,179
using this labor week so zell

333
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:11,760
or impacted and he it's now up to speech

334
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:17,010
Rights Museum piggish on to see in every
fire you want including continuation

335
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:17,520
fight

336
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:24,000
in my opinon za and backed is mostly you
underestimated

337
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,440
thats I

338
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,470
what is well known about xx yet act you
can read some

339
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:35,529
ask if I x5 all utf8 and you can

340
00:23:35,529 --> 00:23:38,380
is a internet walk I

341
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:42,690
and I mean you can see is the net walk a
scene from the bottom

342
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:46,560
and you can find some poor do some by
now rubbing

343
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,090
all do some blind eat in a doctor who

344
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:53,260
exploit tom cat in turn ourselves like

345
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:58,780
for some poor you have some specific
creeks

346
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,810
Ian windows and Iran months

347
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:05,000
you can use as a fight and

348
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,260
in order to do some but she by sash

349
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:14,340
all of T and TL and ashes and outright
lie you can ease

350
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:18,080
Canton to directories which is very
useful

351
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,630
if you don't know is a said that absurd
I get

352
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:24,750
and sales

353
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:30,110
is and we have some advance said and if
it shows you can

354
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:33,760
read by now we find it's a in PHP

355
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,770
you john I access some end up in turn
our servers

356
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:41,170
using girl and you can execute some

357
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:47,620
arbitrary command in PHP and much more
everything the band

358
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:51,480
on context of execution he defines

359
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,750
of on the XML posso it said

360
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,450
and

361
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:58,360
as the operating system as we just see

362
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,519
under Windows you have some specific
breaks is a

363
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:04,860
programming language because must as I

364
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:09,220
it's a sin ti posso I'll 02 executes job
i cud

365
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:12,909
and the application if you choose which
called I'm

366
00:25:12,909 --> 00:25:15,929
I the some addition our I URL

367
00:25:15,929 --> 00:25:20,019
under tell if thats

368
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:24,360
the if I do I'll and well under Unix you
can access

369
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:28,389
to the fight sees them like Brock which
could be useful for all

370
00:25:28,389 --> 00:25:31,629
exploit expedition of memory corruption
but

371
00:25:31,629 --> 00:25:35,820
later in the process as a buzz I should
know Windows

372
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:41,289
and directory listing and also about PHP

373
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:44,539
as a reader lot of the means

374
00:25:44,539 --> 00:25:48,350
spish or are you alright Andre in PHP

375
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:52,529
is a HTTP one is very friendly

376
00:25:52,529 --> 00:25:56,759
because if you can get some Iran message
you can now Rick

377
00:25:56,759 --> 00:25:59,820
against the by now so it's a SSH

378
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:06,720
its VNC as there is a

379
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,580
PHP you I dunno which can be used to do
some prep processing

380
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:15,190
on opened fire as this means that

381
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:18,409
your plan as the sky and of you all at

382
00:26:18,409 --> 00:26:22,320
and each time you call related unser
fight this crypto

383
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,379
you will get base 64 encoded

384
00:26:25,379 --> 00:26:28,580
I raise it saw

385
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:34,119
and is this fight in prague I will
contain some new byte

386
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:38,580
every time and using the straight you
can I get the

387
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:41,290
Bay 64 lecture on and

388
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:48,290
the they could it an 80 and you can act
so use the

389
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:52,490
ssh2 to access 0 can machine

390
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:55,540
of some into an hour was our mission

391
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:58,590
you I need to find

392
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:01,970
which I use on a minibus log so

393
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:08,020
I'm using Oregon white not now and you
can use this big cool rate if I on

394
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,159
as a mission and

395
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:17,159
I have a demo using za loci with account

396
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:26,700
so it's very simple we're we suppose the

397
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:30,590
for self maps fire Enzo production and

398
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:35,669
absolute latest M so under PHP

399
00:27:35,669 --> 00:27:38,799
as we can see we i kno approach to

400
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:45,129
apache2 process and you get some nice
information

401
00:27:45,129 --> 00:27:49,730
about this dike and the purposes and
every month you to

402
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:55,789
loaded if we do the same saying enough
per artist

403
00:27:55,789 --> 00:27:56,800
and

404
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,680
SCG I a beautician we yes

405
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:04,060
everything great to compel including

406
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:11,060
out and defense like address and of
course he

407
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,870
it walks just as well with a ATC
personal

408
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:19,890
such as its

409
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:23,720
the that's for our index if you want to

410
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:27,480
play Wii is window it's very simple

411
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,880
an equal

412
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,830
arkin

413
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:40,580
something more interesting here we will

414
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:43,970
we will use PHP and Mel twice

415
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:47,940
14 although somewhat for 10

416
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:51,490
confession and one fall Bay 64 including

417
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:54,720
and will rate to to specific fire

418
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,300
as you can see here so I talks

419
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:06,300
only you and PHP

420
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:13,330
sold sites you all of that is beer is
fine

421
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:20,330
no program and here we get there come on
line is that your own process

422
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:26,720
so we have apache2 than

423
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,820
an invite is and and menus K send an
invite

424
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:35,500
then start so it's that any impossible
to read is kind of fight

425
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:39,350
without using that this piece which
because it's not a nasty fight

426
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:46,350
know we connect to the

427
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:51,260
SSH port 10 can mission

428
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:54,860
and we get everything you need

429
00:29:54,860 --> 00:30:01,860
so I'm using you been to

430
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:06,100
and here is there a pattern with the
count

431
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:10,200
as a week by Swan and I we try to read
the

432
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:16,920
UTC shadow fight but

433
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:21,320
it's a little longer because you we need
to lead to a nation that SSH connection

434
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:25,230
and him I would buy swan you can take
pictures

435
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:30,050
okay

436
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:35,320
and just to show the directory listing
international law

437
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,350
I we'll request program fight for dinner

438
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:45,350
and a window

439
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:55,749
question

440
00:30:55,749 --> 00:31:00,610
okay let's go South I we no speak about

441
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:04,370
XSLT XSLT is I

442
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:08,210
event with actions like yes accident is
a

443
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:11,220
functional programming language which is
the

444
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:15,600
as a functional warning is part of the
program and I we will see later

445
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,610
and its defined by the

446
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:23,620
w3c since I wrote of shells and his
steely

447
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:27,380
misunderstood East it seems tell us the

448
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:32,120
close above this language Eastwood was
farm XML document to

449
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:36,160
something which could be XM and for that
I expect run

450
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:40,910
which could be. AC GE at the maze you
can produce

451
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:45,049
chart from Exadata all PDF txt what you

452
00:31:45,049 --> 00:31:48,170
it's doing complete

453
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:51,200
as there is some proof a little more
online

454
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,740
so we know you can we can play a lot of
tricks

455
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:59,580
and its maine use

456
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:03,480
all expecting that %ah a

457
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,140
is a to disobeyed to you mind people are
all

458
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:11,559
to feed it to one is %uh petition and
for example or

459
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:15,100
under I'll OpenOffice and probably
Microsoft Office

460
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:19,090
when you call on them to a wine of use
the command to

461
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:22,530
runners of all mods X cities use beyond
the San

462
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:27,090
to lose a condition and where can you
find some

463
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:34,090
exit e posso ISO your wild horses so is
using city your brother is using XSLT

464
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:38,049
you or that the bus lol is using XSLT

465
00:32:38,049 --> 00:32:41,500
by some party intellectual it's very
easy to look reveals a

466
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:45,820
Texas City boss a and in XML desire
signatures

467
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:49,840
you may find some accent issue both
indie bands

468
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:55,059
as the implementation thats

469
00:32:55,059 --> 00:32:58,270
earliest of exit he engines

470
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:01,530
I've played with 18 boo

471
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:04,900
LP green its parcells

472
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:08,710
where I didn't find uneven or BT

473
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:13,640
Ian drew one its bus cells which are
safe by default

474
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:17,040
but you can easy the change
configuration

475
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:21,100
option to gate to get some the vanilla
birth date

476
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:25,240
and in red it's been a robotic City
parcels

477
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,650
I love your body it could be two design

478
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:32,210
issues all memory corruption on or
anything else

479
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:39,070
so as as a introduction to XSLT

480
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:44,169
as a fizzing part I have done some very
stupid fizzing

481
00:33:44,169 --> 00:33:47,750
on Texas NT I mean stupid I'm

482
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:51,340
its mission base for zinc it's very
simple

483
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:55,120
you take a lot tougher Texas NT engines

484
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:00,080
you take a lot of input find such we
find on go girl

485
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,610
all in bed like a rose all in the

486
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:06,900
conform answer verification software

487
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:10,190
and you use the diversify yo

488
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:14,419
which is a tool which we link but they
can amplify and produce

489
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:17,720
still a lot output fight with a small
modification

490
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:21,810
and you do stuff got some kind of
monitoring looking for but

491
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:25,500
the diversify your

492
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:30,219
I use is what I'm sup which she is very
very very cool

493
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:34,399
and so home i engineer I T E

494
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:37,940
give eats I have 5k fight

495
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:42,440
and eyes vol.1 beyond in output and I
feeds the

496
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:47,629
I feed them to the possum their
monitoring was done

497
00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:50,760
I with vibrant if I don't

498
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,810
%uh accesses the source code for example
or four so all reiker

499
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:58,230
XSLT engine and done with the

500
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:00,829
from address to meet a cell which is the

501
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:04,410
nvm Pragyan when II can work combines

502
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:08,829
possible hours for

503
00:35:08,829 --> 00:35:12,500
any EU fizzing sessions the only
interesting seeing

504
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,869
is all next venue phone: so I farm

505
00:35:15,869 --> 00:35:19,180
a lot and this is I am

506
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:23,579
I am very few published advisories
because the Bandos of slow

507
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:26,579
as he sees what's ya and

508
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:31,530
I interesting seeing about his bag
outsiders a free t-shirt

509
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:34,599
is the Baggett said insight

510
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:38,140
I to could is veggie MH I

511
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:41,430
only we place a is fishy namespace

512
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,910
by is a X isn't she wanna and heat
caused

513
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:48,119
there really a on the specific and cut

514
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:51,250
bus in Fairfax nobody was

515
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:55,210
able to understand what up an and we
don't know if it's

516
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:57,349
expert they were or not I

517
00:35:57,349 --> 00:36:00,499
on Magyar choose to

518
00:36:00,499 --> 00:36:05,289
play safe and sakes its expert they were
down but

519
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:11,279
the modification it's like a a copy
pasting at 20 characters and you 30 a

520
00:36:11,279 --> 00:36:11,829
crush

521
00:36:11,829 --> 00:36:16,779
in Fairfax our cases 22

522
00:36:16,779 --> 00:36:20,329
is interesting I so-and-so

523
00:36:20,329 --> 00:36:23,979
law well part as you can see as this is
the

524
00:36:23,979 --> 00:36:27,049
alright current it will cause flaw

525
00:36:27,049 --> 00:36:30,170
same edition fight and I UK

526
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:33,390
as you can see the dogs the frame
pointer

527
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:38,430
is controlled by ziko so we have a very
basic cycle of roe

528
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:41,710
and follow everybody interested

529
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:46,249
that's as a way to access as a XML and
Texas en ti posso

530
00:36:46,249 --> 00:36:49,680
in all reiker I is this means that

531
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,619
issue other sea port injection on to a
record database

532
00:36:53,619 --> 00:36:56,839
you john there is any 3d artist kind own

533
00:36:56,839 --> 00:37:03,839
of all the fro and get to share unser
that a possible

534
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:11,050
the season at the retail 9 and Linx

535
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:14,579
it's the it seems it's a new crush

536
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:18,650
but it secures the Rings a my love
country Nate

537
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:21,880
so it's the it corruption

538
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:26,500
and is not a very nice but that's why I

539
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:30,290
I'm a bike to give some information
before either the patch

540
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:33,640
but they are some was our butts walking
very well

541
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:37,890
on a doubleheader then under Windows
which is their latest fashion

542
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:43,910
and but not much so they'll be much more
there is some way

543
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:47,839
key it alright to appear are Brady
recollect

544
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:51,700
ok

545
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:55,390
cell now we speak about advising
constricts

546
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:59,000
is the

547
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,119
program with X city is that its and
functional language

548
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,210
is this message is that add byee

549
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:10,160
construction you will not be a boy to
great state

550
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,430
and you will not be able to have the

551
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:17,190
them an right to better their bikes

552
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:20,470
tell

553
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:23,609
and from explanation point of view it's
a big program

554
00:38:23,609 --> 00:38:27,410
because we camp wat look we come great

555
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:31,150
Nisar follow all why and every

556
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:35,640
by employees with only but we have some
very specific

557
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:39,280
I objective we want to do some Brittas

558
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,910
so we want to other follow-up and we
want to execute the commands

559
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:47,420
and get is he output so we need why nope

560
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:51,079
sole bread sauce

561
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:56,140
its quite simple we will put all that
%ah

562
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:59,420
for the wine for the Farooq

563
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:03,180
in XML and we will use excess and for H

564
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:07,380
for the processing Sat Sun &

565
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:11,740
is and an example from the web kid
number eighty dropping five

566
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:14,839
under local drive irn-bru

567
00:39:14,839 --> 00:39:18,240
its content up the fight I want to drop

568
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,480
and the grain eat some

569
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,510
pussy better bus and a wheat white

570
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:27,559
I would want to try every person might
pass

571
00:39:27,559 --> 00:39:32,470
so we get this kind of flu

572
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:35,930
bomb at you need to see is there with

573
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:41,530
dike is that %ah and then location so

574
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:44,710
we go to the wood died and fall H

575
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:47,900
location we gets the value

576
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:51,930
and with white to great 25 in this
location

577
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:55,339
with this content so we effectively

578
00:39:55,339 --> 00:39:59,809
follow if you have some

579
00:39:59,809 --> 00:40:03,010
sequin extensions in your ex ante pasta

580
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:06,599
you can use these kind a for loop in
order to

581
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:10,040
brute force within charts for internet
database

582
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,819
and once you find it but it wouldn't
charge you can't use the

583
00:40:13,819 --> 00:40:17,280
X isn't extension to run that up and

584
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,319
I have the cuts the a brute-force

585
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:24,400
I am Biswas quite go

586
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:30,690
it should be a be a Birnin under which
is a while loop

587
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:35,240
is much more complicated so we want to
read STD ELT

588
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,670
the solution is to use some

589
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:42,290
templates Rica CBT and according to rate
of

590
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:47,210
I code generator on was created by your
German guy

591
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:50,420
and between and three use 3

592
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:55,000
and you'd bags which %uh loop a date
that you can use to

593
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,100
I've summer

594
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:59,450
right about available answer loophole
and

595
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:03,790
loop why prospect just

596
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:08,230
two shows the complexity that's a 49 of
Delmar

597
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:13,210
cool reads the

598
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:17,170
r9 at the need to resurrect

599
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:20,490
and at sea and will print a recent its
49

600
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:24,920
if we use the XSLT look combine a

601
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:29,350
its 89th so

602
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:34,660
we can see already nine hiya an arm

603
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:37,950
and as he and we went white to print

604
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:41,390
where here with quite to trains are
recent

605
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:44,940
and but this is a invalid city could

606
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:48,270
because you out as his kind of tax

607
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:52,610
which are forbidden so you'll use the
code generator

608
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:57,040
and you gate this is kind of a valid XTT
cut

609
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,340
which is 50 E

610
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:02,910
the lines long but and which we will

611
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:09,910
as a.m. XACT look

612
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:21,360
ok

613
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:24,260
ansel closer look demonstration we have

614
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:30,400
the very large at least of job
opportunities and we want to

615
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:35,770
gets down by you and we get

616
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:39,770
the 40 here for each property

617
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:42,830
and we get its value its name

618
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:46,070
its value and we display everything

619
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:50,410
and he talked

620
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:54,180
everywhere an as you can see the

621
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:57,370
I am using XP sp3

622
00:42:57,370 --> 00:43:00,660
on a French computer blah blah blah

623
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:07,660
and its jump up 17 all

624
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:13,640
for the while loop we other xman

625
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:17,369
the command with the least of command we
want to

626
00:43:17,369 --> 00:43:24,369
executed and

627
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:30,200
you can see is a square mile you we have
a very long

628
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,250
existent edict you man which

629
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:36,340
only I'll infect you have something

630
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:40,960
skin something you're printing of the
underlying operating system

631
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,190
in order to choose bed between the bash
and CMT that exit

632
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:52,190
and then need to execute the command

633
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:58,839
so it well you can see Vera we get is a
member so Vashon

634
00:43:58,839 --> 00:44:02,030
we get her directory listing follows the

635
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:06,490
love CD Drive and then

636
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:13,490
the output of the said come on

637
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:22,520
our camp

638
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:29,520
neck last part

639
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:33,770
there is and I'm to run way

640
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:35,660
to gain and

641
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:39,729
the execution of I love a cut index en
ti posso

642
00:44:39,729 --> 00:44:42,729
may need PHP dot net and Java

643
00:44:42,729 --> 00:44:48,549
our fight is on par innings LNG by
default you can execute Java code if you

644
00:44:48,549 --> 00:44:50,279
can execute Texas City could

645
00:44:50,279 --> 00:44:53,359
in PHP you can execute PHP could

646
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:56,400
if the register PHP function is called

647
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,010
and easy Xmas by which is the

648
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:04,440
okay on-site software with use for
generating all

649
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:08,109
ok rating XM if I you can by default

650
00:45:08,109 --> 00:45:14,720
music you don't net or chocolate now in
PHP it's the

651
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:19,280
very December and we will use as this
namespace

652
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,460
that a show I'd the big inning and we we

653
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:26,069
associate it was a foo cue water and Zen

654
00:45:26,069 --> 00:45:29,390
in York City the two months you need to
could

655
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:34,700
full-function and send PHP from China
and its arguments

656
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:37,720
so place and park winning pitch careful
it just

657
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:43,000
at foo from China kisch fearful is the

658
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,589
bad news is that require your include

659
00:45:46,589 --> 00:45:50,210
and include once and Eve II are

660
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:55,690
can be called using this kinda stuff I
don't know why it seems it's a

661
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:59,260
I pitch the specificity and its

662
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:03,710
miss that functions better we can use
asap

663
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:07,549
and people taking place which are all
when known

664
00:46:07,549 --> 00:46:14,319
to I know PSP clarification is advising
more complicated

665
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:19,000
I in fact I down inside the light last
year

666
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,700
I A say that is that it seems impossible
to

667
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:24,660
gates some to get some

668
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:27,810
Java and it isn't he indirect chief Sher

669
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:31,810
because we can't wait suede and we can
create

670
00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:35,200
or in places so it seems very difficult

671
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:39,390
and just after our bed inside a
published my content online

672
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:41,380
and they have the

673
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:46,349
German guy which is me he 42 who told me
that I was wrong

674
00:46:46,349 --> 00:46:50,920
and it was pushing back to execute I
meet or we may 64 Kleis

675
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:56,630
classifies in Java toll for me it was
there we have big win because it seems

676
00:46:56,630 --> 00:46:58,680
to be impossible for

677
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:03,190
mmm two of three months I spend zones is
kinda

678
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:06,720
banks and in fact a

679
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:10,029
me he s the the beast is a lot they know
that

680
00:47:10,029 --> 00:47:11,520
which is the

681
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:15,730
us with knife all 42 likes bright and
you can

682
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:18,840
I'll quit I wrote of payload

683
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:23,810
in lot of for might welcomed by you
can't wait jar file

684
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:27,830
upright and this is interesting to me
exile NJ output

685
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:30,950
so you can choose your period which is
the

686
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:35,510
with a share for example and ice fogs
l&J output

687
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:40,300
and you get to extend this tax shit
which would trigger a a robust a yes sir

688
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:44,530
be no doubt who

689
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:49,530
gets things done he's your I occurred
amid this button with your

690
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:51,620
which should be:

691
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:56,660
the perhaps and then there's that next
session which is 4.3

692
00:47:56,660 --> 00:48:00,900
and for some amount you can steal the
access the

693
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:04,030
to get as a code is a bar in the ticket

694
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:07,460
and it's a very easy way to get some

695
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:13,880
PSP or job I meet up with the ship and
yes some

696
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:20,880
demonstration

697
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:29,720
so that's as a way to get PHP meet up
with a share

698
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:35,040
in Texas in tea and a PHP when PHP was
used a function is called

699
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,950
tell we car P lately brace

700
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:42,460
a trust here the namespace

701
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:45,670
which is a city a city to to PHP

702
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:49,079
here PHP function be late will brace

703
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:52,310
and here of code

704
00:48:52,310 --> 00:48:56,750
a PHP code and all PHP code is here it's
very simple

705
00:48:56,750 --> 00:49:02,829
we went to a nearby islands the Bay 64
degrading of this kind of scream

706
00:49:02,829 --> 00:49:06,440
mmm

707
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:13,440
so the basic sequestering is generated
automatically by Metasploit

708
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:20,270
okay told me to bright it's very simple

709
00:49:20,270 --> 00:49:23,720
you you is irons exploit

710
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:27,300
docket 0 ismael PHP

711
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:31,700
doggett wine these false alarm okay

712
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:36,110
I

713
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:39,440
thats the some a

714
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:44,480
F he resources miss by force of just to
avoid a taping every command

715
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:51,480
so I have

716
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:56,170
I don't know if you see from the back

717
00:49:56,170 --> 00:50:00,280
I have the to jobs who are waiting

718
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:07,280
its PHP international one and if I said
me too. PHP

719
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:14,640
much

720
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:17,550
thank you

721
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:21,320
arcane

722
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:24,700
as you can see it said PHP meet up with
a share

723
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:31,700
and Apache

724
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:38,610
arc is a show when he's much more
complicated

725
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:42,910
in fact that we will use reflection in
order to

726
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:46,430
access enough a in 10 outta function

727
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:50,940
about to create on cases and we will use

728
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:55,120
in a function 82 download to extend
their job fight

729
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:58,540
which is a.m. which include the

730
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:01,840
Metasploit meet up later and we will
just as you would

731
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:07,590
it and just to show you if somebody
understand is calmer for

732
00:51:07,590 --> 00:51:14,590
Angelica shooters and Syd Mead to JSP

733
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:18,760
it a little longer

734
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:23,980
ok it this completes and I know saddam
interpreter share

735
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:30,640
which this time is

736
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:35,540
in Java and as you can see I get to
assist mph

737
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:42,540
and Elsa a Windows machine which is game
over

738
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:55,599
okay and the last 1

739
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:59,009
that as the this morning after folks
crush

740
00:51:59,009 --> 00:52:03,420
I have as you can see there is there
right

741
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:09,239
parent is is missing here and this will
break the possum

742
00:52:09,239 --> 00:52:12,739
and you can get something like that

743
00:52:12,739 --> 00:52:19,739
whom by ok

744
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:23,359
completion XML is everywhere

745
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:26,460
you really need to wander off oh you up
the eastern

746
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:29,950
is forcing XML and not is it passing
examen

747
00:52:29,950 --> 00:52:32,960
an Xmas is much more than that up

748
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:37,750
the Excel X him an extent it yet I can
are 82 is a promo

749
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:41,349
the ex ante attacks are 82 predication

750
00:52:41,349 --> 00:52:44,680
it's not that %ah and you need to check

751
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:48,740
the very carefully issued %uh commands
and bird

752
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:53,849
more than that %ah on oh you obligation
we passed this is kind of content

753
00:52:53,849 --> 00:52:57,559
felt points the offensive side

754
00:52:57,559 --> 00:53:01,070
Cosmo and walked towards I

755
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:04,400
I'm in peer pressure and testing I

756
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,810
again the sometimes some chess

757
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:10,840
us big big big the

758
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:15,560
I can like you're processing credit
cards using XSLT

759
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:19,030
and so it woke rally the wedding we had
a life

760
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:22,070
and less point which is not a good news

761
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:25,880
is that as this kind of TTD and X isn't
yet tax

762
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:28,900
are known for more than 10 years

763
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:32,000
the first publication wall

764
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,800
wherein to to freeze on one

765
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,810
a buying binge cue for example

766
00:53:38,810 --> 00:53:45,810
and we still find a lot of both
venerable reputation he should have some

767
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:47,410
question it's time

768
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:54,410
and thank you for coming

769
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:04,460
thinkable

770
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:07,869
nice position most of I

771
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:12,070
basically a clear so question so where
can we find the law to do

772
00:54:12,070 --> 00:54:13,130
publish a bad

773
00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:15,050
the mall

774
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:18,940
all light beige you'll have been using
for the presentation can we get

775
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:22,250
their source calls for that downplay
okay

776
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:25,250
as a you and it was in the last night

777
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:28,540
which was already a shift it's a okay

778
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:32,170
thank you and so I'm zeese the wiki

779
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:35,470
you will find most of my spending's

780
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:39,840
and ensure the every the source code and
everything

781
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:43,210
is a find part is that as this

782
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:47,280
we keep as the rest and FA spoke to BK
shun

783
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:51,360
and it's been there but we're x6 yet
likes which is too young but she'd

784
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:54,800
so pleased in that at my on wiki

785
00:54:54,800 --> 00:55:01,370
