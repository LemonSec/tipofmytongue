1
00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:08,639
the

2
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:29,710
you

3
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:32,780
you it's a pleasure to be here

4
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,430
on short notice the computer security
field

5
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:39,470
I as I'm sure you're aware is funny

6
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:42,680
and there's some interesting forces at
play in a in a very

7
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,210
crazy an interesting in increasingly
strange world that we live in

8
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,940
I'm one of the things that I'm sure
everybody here

9
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,600
has looked at is the way companies and
governments to security

10
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,260
arm credit card companies

11
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,710
banks and the way he they do

12
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,670
a they do their security and and the
lack security that sometimes prevalent

13
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:10,740
with banks with governments all over the
place

14
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,600
I'm and every time

15
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,600
the security community we as a group we
tell them what what did you expect it

16
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,250
was broken by design how did you how
could you ever expect this to be secure

17
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:22,810
how

18
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:26,490
why didn't you invest in proper security
to begin with whether it's

19
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,240
a a chip cards for public transport
whether it's

20
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,320
a the companies doing add

21
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,020
doing SSL Certificates whether it's
disaster after disaster we keep asking

22
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,610
these people how could you ever expect
this to be secure

23
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,509
at and as i've concluded that the cops
its imposing as well

24
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:50,210
what these people expected is to gamble
on security

25
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:54,570
and the gamble is cheap because if they
win

26
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,149
they get to keep the profits for the
gamble if they lose we pick up the tab

27
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:03,229
in a world where corporations banks

28
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:07,299
and even governments are allowed to play
risky because the population picks up

29
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:07,950
the tab

30
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,200
you get very risky gambling I'm

31
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,579
they expect society to pay for the
prosecution for the arrest in the

32
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:18,900
prosecution a rumanian skimming gangs

33
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,910
even though a tactic in ninety-one we
published

34
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:27,250
how easy it was to copy copy magnetic
stripe with just off the shelf materials

35
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,459
in literally 20 more than twenty years
ago

36
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:33,470
and the banks are still using Macs
tribes as their

37
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:37,350
means of identifying that this is really
a chip to a bank card

38
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,889
at and it still as easy to copy as it
was back then

39
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:43,970
I'm so

40
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:48,120
they didn't expect this to go to go the
way they wanted to go

41
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,690
all the time they just know that that
that there's no consequences for them

42
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,419
because society picks up the tab

43
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:58,459
we get to deal with the increased crime
we get to deal with the increased call

44
00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:00,130
for more repression more

45
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:03,299
more a surveillance everywhere

46
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:08,519
at you could wait for it when that mean
that public transport ship cards were in

47
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:10,100
secure and and and

48
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,790
at the time there was no way to make
them secure and immediately

49
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:17,549
toensing systems the people that built
this thing said well that just means we

50
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:20,799
have to have cameras everywhere so we
can send the police after all the people

51
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:21,120
that

52
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,600
download this program from the internet
and make make the chip cards

53
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,109
I'm so the call for repression is
already built in

54
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:32,320
I'm there's this belief

55
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,160
that all I cops and intelligence
officials

56
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,910
must be able to see everything that if
we can just simply press rewind

57
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:44,900
we can somehow address these these these
issues whether its lack of security or

58
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:45,470
any other

59
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:48,620
problem that we perceived to have as
long as we have the rewind button

60
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,639
long as we can look at at at what
happened in the past

61
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:57,810
we can somehow fix it I'm and

62
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,290
this is this is this is a perception

63
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:05,320
that we need to fight that it's at its
deepest group this is a perception that

64
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,190
we need to fight

65
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:10,859
that you can somehow creates the missing
security that's missing from somewhere

66
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:12,600
else by having this rewind button

67
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,919
I'm and

68
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:22,540
having the rewind button happens now
also be cheaper than it's ever been

69
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,970
everybody's wanted this every every
government on earth has wanted this

70
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,990
dictatorships have been more open about
it and have gone further in wanting it

71
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:35,800
have have spent more on getting it when
when when the time wasn't right

72
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,330
a east germans wanted a system where
they could follow every typewriters that

73
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:40,770
they had

74
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:45,229
they had tried open they had a cards
where every typewriter in the country

75
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:45,849
had written

76
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:49,219
although all its letters so they could
figure out who had written any

77
00:04:49,219 --> 00:04:50,509
particular piece of text

78
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:53,629
right now that's built into every color
printer that you can buy it with the

79
00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:54,430
yellow dots

80
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:59,879
I'm we're still alive

81
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:03,439
which is remarkable if you look at at
this discussion if you look at this call

82
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:05,250
for the property called for

83
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:09,719
total surveillance I'm we're still here
after two hundred years of industrial

84
00:05:09,719 --> 00:05:11,750
societies

85
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,849
where we didn't know who was where

86
00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:19,590
we didn't know who was talking to whom
we didn't know what they were saying

87
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:24,409
and yet we've survived all this and now
know that we can finally afford

88
00:05:24,409 --> 00:05:29,530
total surveillance exactly at the in the
same decade that we can

89
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,270
there there happens to be the the
eternal you merge in C

90
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,280
that requires us to have it so now that
we can

91
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,409
all of a sudden it's required I'm

92
00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:43,069
and the funny thing is this but not too
conscious doesn't even help us

93
00:05:43,069 --> 00:05:48,939
it doesn't get us anywhere I'm if cyber
crime goes up by a factor of 10

94
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:52,340
what good does it do you that you can
rewind can you arrest enough people can

95
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,289
you prosecute enough people to make a
dent

96
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:59,919
in in the profitability or can you make
a dent in indeed the wave of new people

97
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,409
that come online in new countries as as
they

98
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:06,490
discover these vulnerabilities
reinstated the roam the net

99
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:10,379
I'm so it's all a distraction

100
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:13,729
we're going to in the end needs the
computer security that we're now

101
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:15,300
skipping

102
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,499
because we're calling for more security
or more are more a surveillance

103
00:06:19,499 --> 00:06:25,389
we're going to need it in the end anyway
I'm

104
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:30,340
there's a lot to talk about national
security I'll

105
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,969
we need to be need to be active in the
cyber re not to fight for our national

106
00:06:33,969 --> 00:06:35,999
interests what our national interest

107
00:06:35,999 --> 00:06:41,259
these days a its when I look at that the
international arena I see multiple

108
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:43,180
transnational groups

109
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,379
stealing from from from a diminishing

110
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:50,979
a middle-class wanted I couldn't even
define what

111
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:54,620
corporations are part of my national
interests what corporations are part of

112
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,279
somebody else's

113
00:06:56,279 --> 00:07:01,050
I'm and intelligence traditionally is
looking at data for us to corruption

114
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,249
worldwide

115
00:07:02,249 --> 00:07:05,710
a I do for us to people lining their own
pockets

116
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:09,749
and trying to identify real threats
within all this corruption but

117
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:14,039
we increasingly live in a world where
where the corruption is

118
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:17,050
is feeding on the population is feeding
on everything away

119
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,669
the corruption is the problem is the
threat and an intelligence bureaucracy

120
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:24,300
aren't set up to look at that threat
because they are

121
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,590
generally part of it

122
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:32,020
I'm there's major elephants in the room

123
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,160
I'll as we are all aware a

124
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,980
nobody really knows what's in the

125
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:42,000
the Chinese networking gear the Chinese
a

126
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,440
base stations where for cellular
networks nobody really knows what's in

127
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,419
the israeli

128
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:51,060
a lawful intercept here or in the
israeli

129
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,570
a billing systems I'm were all

130
00:07:55,570 --> 00:08:00,270
uploading or our data to the United
States be it on Facebook yet on LinkedIn

131
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:00,810
be it on

132
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:05,130
we're all continuously up goatee
updating a picture of our lives and and

133
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,440
and RR

134
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,580
to correspondence personal or business

135
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:15,120
I'm there's we live in a world where
there's three major power blocs

136
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,350
and we're uploading our data to a bar a
block that isn't ours

137
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:26,350
if you're in Europe that is I'm weird we
live in a world that's

138
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,360
thats centralizing still at least for me

139
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,440
it. from an IT perspective it's
centralizing its systems it's placing

140
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,669
more and more data

141
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:41,169
in the cloud reducing local
infrastructure more and more to just

142
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:46,070
a at the slams and and Rogers to get
online and everything else is fixed

143
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:46,950
somewhere else

144
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:51,320
I'm where in reality we're already

145
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,360
past peak centralization were already
passed the peak

146
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,010
up globalization we're decentralizing

147
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:03,820
a as the cost of oil is going to is
going to skyrocket over the next decade

148
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:07,140
as at transport becomes a factor again

149
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:12,140
I'm as power blocks fall apart the world
is is is

150
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:17,140
is is increasingly becoming a mess so
what we're we're we're

151
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,230
going the wrong direction on that I'm

152
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:23,690
and we see the same thing this this this

153
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:27,740
warfare a also in the cyber environment

154
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:32,000
a many of you are aware up the economy
is 0 days

155
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,110
a 0 days can be sold your days can be so
I can be

156
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,670
can be published responsibly
irresponsibly I'm

157
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:44,990
and increasingly the parties that you
can sells your days to are no longer

158
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:48,030
a Romanian criminals in russian
criminals

159
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:51,820
their nation-states and intelligence
agencies

160
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,410
I'm and

161
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:59,050
if you look at at that the development
if you look at Stuxnet and Duqu who

162
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:02,890
I'm we are seeing the effects of warfare

163
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:06,610
true warfare on civilian populations

164
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:10,230
the fact that there was all of a sudden
for Windows bugs out there

165
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:15,080
a that that were not responsibly
disclosed that were not fix

166
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:20,060
immediately a is a direct result of
warfare and who gets hit by that warfare

167
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:20,709
more

168
00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:25,110
than anybody is the people in
industrialized and advanced societies

169
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:28,410
so weird we're looking at a population

170
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:32,290
dramatically exposed to to security
leaks and we're going to see an increase

171
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:32,980
in that

172
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,670
we're going to see more and more and
more security problems

173
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:41,100
first coming to light as part of
somebody's weapons payload

174
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,839
that has somehow escaped whatever target
they where they were

175
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,580
trying to inflict and we're going to see
more and more of that happening without

176
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,670
attribution

177
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:55,570
rare it's going to be completely unclear
where something comes from

178
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:59,530
we're going to see false flag we're
going to see all searches above

179
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:02,829
na na tribution or false attribution in
the

180
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:08,550
in the weapons arena I'm so if

181
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,800
if you as a security specialist a
generally worried

182
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,350
about making the world a safer place I'm

183
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:18,540
you need to fight this you need to
responsibly disclose

184
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,910
I'm and I've heard people talk

185
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:25,459
talk to me and tell me that what you
have but but but the peace oh well

186
00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:28,640
when it's safe it's not like criminals
and its its

187
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,970
it's for national security or doing
something for my country

188
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:35,010
I'm I'm

189
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:39,660
but you didn't work for some Russian a
rumanian crime cartel for a reason

190
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,930
was not only because it was more safe to

191
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:46,680
disclose responsibly was it only or or

192
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,200
or is it really just about the money I'm

193
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,050
and how are you so sure that working

194
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:57,959
foreign intelligence agency all is more
safe

195
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:03,050
I mean I've spoken to people that that
in my mind we do scary things

196
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:07,540
cell exploits I'm sometimes even tell me
about it

197
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:12,220
and other people I presume I

198
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:16,400
these people that that sell exploits to
intelligence agencies or to military

199
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,060
bureaucracy should really

200
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:22,329
think three times at there's a
remarkable amount of jargon in the

201
00:12:22,329 --> 00:12:23,959
intelligence world

202
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:27,680
that deals with making people disappear
getting rid of the bodies

203
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,910
and and making it look like a suicide or
an accident

204
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:34,350
up the security researcher

205
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:38,640
that discovers vulnerabilities and sells
them to an Asian state for

206
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:43,530
surreptitious hughes is generally one of
the few people that could point the

207
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,660
finger

208
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:49,000
in a world where lacquer retribution is
really

209
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,569
a key factor a which I really want you
to think about

210
00:12:53,569 --> 00:12:58,110
I'm but there's enough to be cynical
about and I don't want to be cynical

211
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,760
especially on a wonderful day such as
this

212
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,870
its great outside I'm hope amid have
been outside

213
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:08,130
I'm I want you to think

214
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:12,829
abouts making the world a better place
and I want you to think about

215
00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:15,839
putting your knowledge to work to make
this happen

216
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,660
making the world more secure create a
more secure and more livable online

217
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,270
planet

218
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:24,690
and a selling security problems

219
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:27,860
to nation-states or two intelligence
bureaucracies

220
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:32,470
a is not some novel form of responsible
disclosure

221
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:39,160
I'm that's really it thank you very much

222
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,780
and

223
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:45,240
I'm I'd really like a discussion I
really like people did too

224
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,700
come up with because I just basically
thrown in the room

225
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:53,370
five six seven different field with what
crazy things that I think been thinking

226
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,110
about for the last year or two years

227
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:59,600
ok but people home other interesting
thought searched and all this

228
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,780
I love them all them he did admit that I
was the only one talking

229
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:08,310
rooms please come to the microphones if
there are any that we got my cruiser

230
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:12,440
us microphones great hello

231
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,280
I am bustier from SOC d and mmm

232
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:20,560
it's not that I E if you were to Shane M

233
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,060
I'm thinking fahd but it it shorter
sounds like fun

234
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,150
all these nations are doing bad things

235
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:30,860
a mmm how old do you

236
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:34,100
present this to somebody to make it the

237
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,770
some more realistic and and and
supported with this

238
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:41,900
if you know statistics et cetera and get
it out of

239
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,790
miss something like fun in a way we are
screwed

240
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:50,900
we live in a very we live in a very
precarious and an interesting time in

241
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,370
history

242
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:56,010
a much your world is built on the
availability of cheap oil

243
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:59,810
a we we live in a very

244
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:04,320
a precarious time we've reached should
have what we can do in terms of growth

245
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,380
we cannot grow the human economic
footprint another four times over

246
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:13,340
which is what we're used to doing sold
you can truly be

247
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:16,880
in my view tell people about the world
we live in

248
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,010
without at least conveying that it's
going to be

249
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:24,880
difficult so if that's what you mean is
that if that's it

250
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,560
she can really paint a rosy picture
without being dishonest

251
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,970
a but you can at least but I find this
is the future is also very interesting

252
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:34,990
place and

253
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:39,220
the president also has a lot of the
problems that come with

254
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:42,430
shoulda shoulda the decadence right
before the collapse

255
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:46,800
people are tremendously lonely
tremendously unhappy

256
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,140
medicated a to make them happy a

257
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:54,150
not in touch with each other not in
touch with where their food comes from

258
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:54,640
or

259
00:15:54,640 --> 00:16:00,530
a soule there's going to be interesting
and sometimes positive changes in the

260
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:01,150
future

261
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:05,880
and probably the ten years that we get
to terms with all of this are going to

262
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,200
be very interesting times not not only
in a negative sense

263
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,350
so there there are positive light seen
in all these developments

264
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:20,350
that make sense it does

265
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,889
hello and thanks for granted topic

266
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:35,739
nice conversation I'm ideal from here on
and

267
00:16:35,739 --> 00:16:40,349
I wanted to point to the something
that's

268
00:16:40,349 --> 00:16:44,289
you know it's not always abouts for
example selling

269
00:16:44,289 --> 00:16:48,079
0 de su agencies or whatever parts

270
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:52,169
and making own profit you know for your
own profit

271
00:16:52,169 --> 00:16:56,599
but in some cases considering for
example the current situation of

272
00:16:56,599 --> 00:17:02,449
Iran and being in at cyber war with
other countries like US or

273
00:17:02,449 --> 00:17:05,829
whatever other countries Israel or
others as well

274
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:09,720
no at sometimes you have to be ready

275
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,919
and to be able to fight back know and

276
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,029
so you shoot somehow help your

277
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:20,759
country I'm not talking about politics
or whatever

278
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:23,759
part considered as some researchers

279
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:27,149
in your in here in Europe or other
countries

280
00:17:27,149 --> 00:17:30,250
the have to help their con

281
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:34,230
agencies or such I want to know me your
ideas a

282
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:37,570
about this he come from different places
I'm yes auto immune to the

283
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:41,570
to the you must help your country
argument because I

284
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:45,710
I should have lost my belief in country
somewhere along the way I'll

285
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,789
I think I think countries in borders
armenia fraud

286
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:52,629
to keep people from seeing that their
interests RR

287
00:17:52,629 --> 00:17:56,509
much more aligned a with each other than

288
00:17:56,509 --> 00:18:00,200
hand and then they are all against each
other

289
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:04,340
I'm so i'm i'm not so much

290
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:08,320
the borders in countries person but but
but coming from from where you are

291
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,440
I'm there are problems with cyber
warfare and one of them

292
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,600
is the lack of attribution if its
nuclear weapons

293
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,059
a could be launched without attribution

294
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:24,809
mean the first thing the major super
powers did when when when nuclear when

295
00:18:24,809 --> 00:18:25,860
the nuclear row

296
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:30,159
came to be was to launch satellite so
they could spot launches

297
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:35,169
I they could see the rocket the infrared
from there from rocket launchers

298
00:18:35,169 --> 00:18:39,490
a why did they do this because the only
thing worse than an adversary with

299
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,619
nuclear weapons is

300
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,820
is if you don't know where it comes from
I'm

301
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:48,240
and with information warfare

302
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,330
as as we now see it with with Stuxnet
have

303
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:56,080
and the lack of attribution I you're
going to see some terrible terrible

304
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,350
things and

305
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:01,269
the collateral damage from these

306
00:19:01,269 --> 00:19:04,820
from these attacks is basically
unlimited

307
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,980
I when there is a lack of attribution
some

308
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:13,899
must you help your country I'm I'm
having trouble with that because I don't

309
00:19:13,899 --> 00:19:16,029
necessarily trust countries

310
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:19,480
and I think I think the world is better
off if we

311
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,619
as a community defend the population and
defend the system's

312
00:19:23,619 --> 00:19:27,799
yeah bytes my question surged it might
be better to ask it

313
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:31,289
in this way we already are in a cyberwar

314
00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:34,860
okay so what can we do to prevented

315
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:39,559
or stop it from going further I think

316
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:42,690
I think if we creates or or or

317
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:46,360
through their systems that that are
maximally secure

318
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:50,320
and help people understand the risks of
computer technology

319
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55,070
and help them maybe not creating that
one database that holds all the medical

320
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,879
records show that one database that
controls all that

321
00:19:57,879 --> 00:20:00,919
a all the industrial gear or the or the
or

322
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:04,990
that the one system that controls all
the the floodgates in Holland or the

323
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:08,869
a if we'd try to convince people that

324
00:20:08,869 --> 00:20:13,399
that maybe computer security is not I'll

325
00:20:13,399 --> 00:20:17,659
as wonderful as they wanted to be if we
resist the vendors that say that they

326
00:20:17,659 --> 00:20:19,480
can make it all secure if we can

327
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,779
a I think those are those are valuable
contributions

328
00:20:22,779 --> 00:20:26,179
and I'll helping

329
00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:30,070
surreptitious parties launch cyber
weapons

330
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:34,080
a is is in my mind maybe not

331
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,010
a

332
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:38,940
a contribution to a safer world because
the risk of

333
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,090
look the then launched Stuxnet somebody

334
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:45,210
launched Stuxnet up

335
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:48,250
realizing falwell probably that it could
get out

336
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:52,460
which because it effects the major
population is is

337
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:56,130
in a biit so probably a work right by
current definitions

338
00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:00,200
a but they also realize that somebody
could quickly turn around and turn

339
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,210
Stuxnet into something that would make

340
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:06,260
chemical facilities explode all over the
world or could turn it around to

341
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:10,850
to do terrible terrible things and they
took the risk

342
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:14,460
knowing that that that that was in there
I'm

343
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:18,520
do you want to be part of that

344
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,870
do you want to be part because then you
are part up the

345
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:25,940
a of the military complex then you are
building

346
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:29,620
weapons no different from building bombs
are building accept that these weapons

347
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,049
are are poorly understood

348
00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:36,440
and used by people who themselves may
not be convinced of all the risks

349
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,850
which scares the shit outta me

350
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:43,370
and I think it should scare the shit out
of him a lot more people

351
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:49,159
if that means I hope that's a good
answer thanks

352
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:52,840
so

353
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,230
maybe to add to what you just said the
packing for peace

354
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:59,840
a hacking voting machines to to get them

355
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,380
can cancel two attacking the

356
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:07,510
public transportation system so the
society realizes how bad

357
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:11,150
badly it is is that a solution well

358
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:15,140
II will I was hoping that the the public
transport system hacks

359
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:20,120
be would get more attention for the fact
that that that these backend database is

360
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,190
still hold

361
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:25,440
who is going where because whether or
not the transaction with the

362
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,970
the payment transaction is secured does
not change anything about these backend

363
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:30,890
databases

364
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:35,320
holding everybody's transport movements
so I was hoping that the discussion

365
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,980
which we more in that direction

366
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,330
%uh the huge privacy implications the
backend

367
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:43,740
I'm because I don't think whether or not

368
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:48,230
the the transaction is secure is is as
interesting as the discussion

369
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:52,799
as as the size of the discussion in
whole but

370
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,600
yeah baby these things can be important
it can be important to show people that

371
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,159
that

372
00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:01,159
computer security is not a finished
field we're now handing the

373
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:01,639
the

374
00:23:01,639 --> 00:23:05,320
electronic patient record for the whole
country I'm

375
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:09,329
to the insurers now that now that the
populations by and large

376
00:23:09,329 --> 00:23:12,599
through through represented through its
representatives and said

377
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:16,499
no we don't want the I'm twenty patients
the database to be developed

378
00:23:16,499 --> 00:23:22,589
a as a as a as a national thing as as a
thing by the government

379
00:23:22,589 --> 00:23:26,089
the government's immobile the mall just
have the insurers do it these are the

380
00:23:26,089 --> 00:23:29,039
parties that you least want to have
access to all this data

381
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:33,950
that you want to keep the furthest from
how everybody is because the insurer see

382
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:34,759
a profit

383
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:39,059
the profit is knowing which people to
not give cheap insurance

384
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:42,869
or even affordable insurance because
they're they're they're the

385
00:23:42,869 --> 00:23:47,109
represent a net loss I barely graze

386
00:23:47,109 --> 00:23:50,570
cells but these these are these are I'm

387
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:54,419
these are important issues demand we
needed

388
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:58,429
for them to be to be fully understood
people need to understand

389
00:23:58,429 --> 00:24:01,599
what a complete mess computer security
is

390
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:05,209
and how how come how in complete
shambles

391
00:24:05,209 --> 00:24:08,809
mean I'm not telling the thing new to
anybody here but I'm doing something new

392
00:24:08,809 --> 00:24:10,129
to anybody not here

393
00:24:10,129 --> 00:24:13,509
that all that computer security is

394
00:24:13,509 --> 00:24:16,589
is is an not properly understood

395
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:19,739
for you populated by dickhead vendors

396
00:24:19,739 --> 00:24:22,869
just want to sell anything to anybody at
any price

397
00:24:22,869 --> 00:24:26,700
I'm and ice

398
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:31,029
I see no progress in telling this to
society because society still wants to

399
00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:31,729
believe

400
00:24:31,729 --> 00:24:36,539
but this is not the case still wants to
believe that we can build the same I

401
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:40,839
totally safe electronic patient record
or a totally safe than sorry completely

402
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:41,950
bullet proof that

403
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:46,349
arm and I we're not making enough
progress because

404
00:24:46,349 --> 00:24:49,679
because we keep fighting it's like y
como you keep

405
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,339
you fight one thing and then urea
already three things are popping up its

406
00:24:53,339 --> 00:24:53,690
not

407
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:57,239
we're not making progress on the
fundamental issue of telling people that

408
00:24:57,239 --> 00:24:57,599
the

409
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:00,649
look this stuff is on me not securing
its going to be not secure

410
00:25:00,649 --> 00:25:05,849
probably for a couple more decades stop
trusting it to the extent that you're

411
00:25:05,849 --> 00:25:06,479
trusting

412
00:25:06,479 --> 00:25:13,249
it yeah I

413
00:25:13,249 --> 00:25:16,459
a how do you suggest we make it known to
the general public

414
00:25:16,459 --> 00:25:21,149
because obviously per I'm you're
standing here but I'm I'm up for bright

415
00:25:21,149 --> 00:25:21,839
ideas

416
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:25,479
I I I've done what I can do when I'm

417
00:25:25,479 --> 00:25:29,549
I'm just noticing that it that its tends
to be not enough

418
00:25:29,549 --> 00:25:33,859
I'm I don't think there's there's all
that much more disaster

419
00:25:33,859 --> 00:25:38,319
that could happen it's already happening
at a pretty and I had a pretty tense and

420
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:39,609
increasing speed

421
00:25:39,609 --> 00:25:42,700
and it it its I think there's a there's
a

422
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:46,969
a general belief in the population in
that progress is by definition a good

423
00:25:46,969 --> 00:25:47,719
thing at that

424
00:25:47,719 --> 00:25:51,309
they're seeing all this cool stuff
happening on the iPad and that therefore

425
00:25:51,309 --> 00:25:54,269
the world must be going into a positive
direction

426
00:25:54,269 --> 00:25:59,859
I I think that's hard to boston i'm i'm
i'm sort of generally out of ideas but

427
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:01,619
but if you have any bright ideas

428
00:26:01,619 --> 00:26:04,779
please I'm thinking about a like a Bob
Dylan

429
00:26:04,779 --> 00:26:07,919
2.0 but I don't know how to picture this
but

430
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,259
you know it's something like that
because you know I already have a pretty

431
00:26:11,259 --> 00:26:12,190
bad for his

432
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:16,069
I also did he yeah I'm yeah I'm

433
00:26:16,069 --> 00:26:23,069
last question

434
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,179
maybe knocking hi a menfolk

435
00:26:28,179 --> 00:26:31,809
she also facility a my cricket it

436
00:26:31,809 --> 00:26:35,989
connects to be other question a little
bit from when speaking to people

437
00:26:35,989 --> 00:26:36,819
influence

438
00:26:36,819 --> 00:26:42,749
politicians the mmm CEO's politicians
are no longer people with influence

439
00:26:42,749 --> 00:26:45,789
they're just people that pretend to have
influence alright

440
00:26:45,789 --> 00:26:48,879
who are the ones with the influence %uh
the ones that are

441
00:26:48,879 --> 00:26:52,599
politics politics is nothing more than
telling us that they're not responsible

442
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:55,679
we don't do healthcare corporations to
health care the market does does

443
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:56,479
everything the

444
00:26:56,479 --> 00:27:00,539
we don't determine our budget that the
bank's determine our budget by the rates

445
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:01,899
that we can lend money at

446
00:27:01,899 --> 00:27:06,669
I believe a politician I was worried
that my son is in the beloved how do you

447
00:27:06,669 --> 00:27:11,450
what ways in trying to convince the
people of influence

448
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:15,169
a a %uh these necessary changes

449
00:27:15,169 --> 00:27:20,269
have you found are at the somewhat
effective most many things don't work

450
00:27:20,269 --> 00:27:22,940
you mentioned rate the many things I
don't but don't worry I think but you

451
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,839
may have found

452
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:27,549
every now and then that certain things
to work the depressing thing is the only

453
00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:29,469
thing that's somewhat effective is is

454
00:27:29,469 --> 00:27:33,849
is chaos may have a disaster which is
really freaking depressive

455
00:27:33,849 --> 00:27:37,460
I I'm but does that scare people and

456
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:42,099
and and but I mean and fear is always a
pleasure to perfectly coherent argument

457
00:27:42,099 --> 00:27:43,440
about these voting systems

458
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,569
in the summer of 2006 look this is wrong
and there's no transparency and and

459
00:27:48,569 --> 00:27:50,379
that's probably in secure and and

460
00:27:50,379 --> 00:27:53,519
nobody's ever tested whether it secures
a by definition that means that the

461
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:54,619
probability

462
00:27:54,619 --> 00:27:58,289
that is insecure is really really high
I'm and

463
00:27:58,289 --> 00:28:02,179
read we pointed out all these problems
with the system everybody just shrugged

464
00:28:02,179 --> 00:28:02,960
and said Well

465
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,339
the vendor says it secure I'm how can it
be in secure how can you prove it in

466
00:28:07,339 --> 00:28:09,039
secure its just you saying it

467
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:12,079
and then we got hold of one of these
machines improve that it wasn't secure

468
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:15,089
and then the whole discussion sway the
other way so

469
00:28:15,089 --> 00:28:18,999
unless you can you consider packet

470
00:28:18,999 --> 00:28:24,119
a it its it stands unless you you can
hack it it it's perfectly secure and

471
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:24,879
wonderful

472
00:28:24,879 --> 00:28:29,499
and a eighth so what theoretical
argument

473
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:34,089
or or or I would see fundamental
argument about why things are wrong and

474
00:28:34,089 --> 00:28:36,029
certainly in right another way

475
00:28:36,029 --> 00:28:40,389
just simply doesn't seem to cut it so I
think the only way to make an impression

476
00:28:40,389 --> 00:28:41,629
is just jacket

477
00:28:41,629 --> 00:28:45,569
break it showed it broken and I think
increasingly

478
00:28:45,569 --> 00:28:49,940
where we're seeing at least in the Dutch
press we're seeing a coherent argument

479
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,099
that the whole

480
00:28:51,099 --> 00:28:54,329
a I team industry is is is

481
00:28:54,329 --> 00:28:57,519
corrupt is just I'll

482
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:01,190
a either either malfeasance or
incompetent

483
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:04,269
or some combination of both and it's
just a

484
00:29:04,269 --> 00:29:08,029
just doesn't cut it that these people in
their expensive

485
00:29:08,029 --> 00:29:12,249
lease automobiles are driving around the
ministry's

486
00:29:12,249 --> 00:29:16,999
crazy with laughter honking their horns
but are not actually delivering anything

487
00:29:16,999 --> 00:29:18,649
that all these people are doing is

488
00:29:18,649 --> 00:29:23,369
is brainstorming about who to blame for
the next delay in some major project

489
00:29:23,369 --> 00:29:24,769
that they've just cashed in

490
00:29:24,769 --> 00:29:27,959
30 million euros for a

491
00:29:27,959 --> 00:29:31,569
and we need to we need to coherently
keep making this argument that that that

492
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:32,089
this

493
00:29:32,089 --> 00:29:35,619
this industry is is by and large corrupt

494
00:29:35,619 --> 00:29:39,669
and that bad have software and
networking and services

495
00:29:39,669 --> 00:29:44,609
are by and large broken probably by
designed and built by people

496
00:29:44,609 --> 00:29:48,059
and and commissioned by people that have
no idea of the priorities are up

497
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:49,399
security or

498
00:29:49,399 --> 00:29:53,259
have anything I'm and if we keep making
that argument

499
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:59,979
long and hard and repeatedly enough
maybe the word

500
00:29:59,979 --> 00:30:03,519
honestly think that's a bit term
depressing /url

501
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:08,359
that true but also a rather than it
doesn't really do a lot of people the IT

502
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:10,259
industry which do

503
00:30:10,259 --> 00:30:14,809
tried our best justice as a lot of good
people working out there and

504
00:30:14,809 --> 00:30:19,829
surrounded by clowns and they yeah but
you make it sound like it's 80/20 or

505
00:30:19,829 --> 00:30:21,389
something

506
00:30:21,389 --> 00:30:25,899
inevitably they end up being sucked down
in this in this wall above

507
00:30:25,899 --> 00:30:28,919
pretending they can do more than they
could then they then they can because of

508
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:31,690
competition dozen they can't compete if
they don't

509
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:35,629
a writing more hours than they have to
creating complex to the incentives are

510
00:30:35,629 --> 00:30:36,749
just all wrong

511
00:30:36,749 --> 00:30:40,899
this whole bureaucracy is is built on
billable hours

512
00:30:40,899 --> 00:30:44,509
if you if you build it if you build
systems based on how many hours people

513
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,799
work on it

514
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:48,999
you going to get very complex systems
because anybody that can build something

515
00:30:48,999 --> 00:30:49,969
simple

516
00:30:49,969 --> 00:30:53,559
just works is going to price themselves
out of the market

517
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:57,940
so I the incentives are just all wrong
and all the good people drown in a sea

518
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,479
of corruption and plumes

519
00:31:00,479 --> 00:31:04,629
but you may be may feel differently and
and and I apologize to anybody that

520
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:08,519
does wonderful things but that's just
all I see is just the incentives are

521
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:10,469
wrong it's all good people just

522
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:15,459
drown by evolution all my whole phone
thing I i actually agree with the things

523
00:31:15,459 --> 00:31:16,929
you're warning about

524
00:31:16,929 --> 00:31:21,859
but the whatever you very very cynical
that than that and I do notice

525
00:31:21,859 --> 00:31:25,259
just how

526
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:28,769
anyway I'm I think we're out of time so
I thank you very much

527
00:31:28,769 --> 00:31:35,769
tonight thank you very much

528
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,940
you
