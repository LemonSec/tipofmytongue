1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,980
the lot a welcome everybody

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,170
I'm I think the next to the real
instruction

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:11,969
but sent you thrown out talk

4
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:18,969
I alright

5
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,350
I'll Josh will have an army ants

6
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,580
passenger up really happy

7
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,820
here today with all or

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,860
up there corps members a is there Joburg

9
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,070
dream team Nasher quite Howard

10
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:44,399
well

11
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,190
basically Lee E broke up presentation

12
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:51,570
into two parts I

13
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:57,789
perspire gonna cover

14
00:00:57,789 --> 00:01:01,480
I O S security basics and then have

15
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,629
I'm gonna cover directing

16
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:08,520
for matching attacked Halloween use the
to gain

17
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,000
the initial unsigned code execution and

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,799
Siro is going to be giving

19
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,580
to cut hair HFS kernel exploit

20
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,590
and house he manage

21
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:30,590
tapas and bind so ish

22
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:43,150
okay hi well we're stuck with a small

23
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:46,250
introduction to and a security feature
of

24
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:51,320
iowa's its operating system I was first
introduced

25
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,420
2007 with the release of the year iPhone

26
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,670
and twice initially named iPhone OS

27
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,750
one I know and later renamed

28
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:07,040
after resolving then naming issue with
Cisco

29
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,120
because they use it for their protesters
name for their

30
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,980
operating system and yeah

31
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:19,090
the current lease a stylus 5 11 and

32
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:23,940
Roos has I'm a condom large development
process

33
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:28,530
and pass gained a lot of security
features over time

34
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,820
so it has grown to releasing

35
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,959
was sure operating system and its
considered to be a

36
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:40,520
one of the most situations OS's around
some

37
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:46,040
yeah come the flaw ass

38
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,380
that we use for chair 18 are attorney

39
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,380
even each time more and more Hampton

40
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:57,530
find and another pointless

41
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:01,239
thats 23 not release a jailbreak then

42
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:04,680
its in the creek that Evelyn push out a
fix

43
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,000
from from web Dane this is and

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,709
yeah what and the problem that me each
time

45
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:14,810
new release comes out have to %uh

46
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:18,549
yeah basically the start from the
beginning because

47
00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:22,180
they close on our how its views to

48
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:27,060
get into the system on this a retired
yeah

49
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:32,610
quite a big challenge I'm

50
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:36,630
yeah um

51
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,700
yeah on Star Plus first

52
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,709
the security features and the food chain

53
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:46,769
as the first markets are up

54
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:50,799
its its a.m.

55
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,269
onto from pilots that I use for stunning

56
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:57,810
device her signature checks on these

57
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:03,070
signature checks prevent modifications
of the from the files to

58
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:06,630
boot the system are change the kerner

59
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,810
pets whatever have to due to

60
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:13,209
may be entered this is and yeah

61
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:17,590
missus no a.m. followed by

62
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:22,130
code signing which prevents modification
of the binary

63
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:25,810
that get executed so if you will

64
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:31,130
try to patch a program it would just
don't run because the signature doesn't

65
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:31,820
match

66
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:36,280
the next part in this Data Execution
Prevention

67
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:41,510
this is the future that protects memory
pages

68
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:44,720
in the way that you can user right to
this page

69
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,730
or execute coke from this page but but
you cannot do

70
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:52,580
and both at the same time am

71
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,990
now Sr this the next feature

72
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:59,650
this is them designed

73
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:03,050
I to waive that did

74
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:07,169
memory reach you for libraries

75
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:11,680
and on social programs randomized so

76
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,320
yeah medically you

77
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,139
a half and different address space for
yeah

78
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:23,030
to libraries in use and for the program
but

79
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:27,110
I'm then we have secondary is

80
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:30,510
this is basic only um

81
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:34,190
implemented by putting random values on
this day

82
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:38,169
but a check at the beginning of a
function and when the freshness

83
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:43,110
return and then these values are
compared to check for any

84
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,360
stick em in prevention um

85
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,560
yeah partitions this is sir very
specific

86
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,860
to have the iPhone because we have to
system partition which is

87
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:58,090
read-only usually so cannot

88
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:02,669
cheap shirts for some fires and you have
to use a petition updater

89
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:05,840
storm take photos our so

90
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,340
you know the system you already clear
separation

91
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:13,500
I'm the then we have to know users

92
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,900
this is pictured in only route and more
work there

93
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,270
more use fun to and so

94
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:24,949
every process has specific term

95
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:28,729
user drugs with so to just prevent

96
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:31,780
private kitchens but it doesn't meet

97
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,139
its can exploit them um

98
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:38,370
another features some boxing this is

99
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:42,289
a finer a final written restriction

100
00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:46,389
for processes that prevents

101
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:50,659
process from doing and stuff like
reading files are

102
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:54,110
opening up our connections so

103
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:57,539
this is the yeah another and

104
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:03,280
step in the protection of the operating
system um

105
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,530
the food chain her can be exploited

106
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,849
withstand miss ok online right next part

107
00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:13,240
business people of law that allows coat

108
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,759
execution a double drum never its a
hamper

109
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:20,449
exploit that cannot be just patch was a
newcomer

110
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:23,580
um this allows us to

111
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:28,560
physically I'll start a device with a
customer understands

112
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,840
patch.com whatever you need to

113
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,210
the with a new heights this is softened

114
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:38,669
the first enter fun hot so-called
tethered jailbreak

115
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:41,680
um to

116
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,969
this is a graphic showing the regular
who chained

117
00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:49,030
where we have to build wrong on which
authenticates

118
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:52,330
yeah and and be 'em which than

119
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:55,879
authenticated I boot and you next image

120
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:59,249
colonel scoff indicated and even defy
system

121
00:07:59,249 --> 00:08:03,629
a sister also check to or any
manipulation

122
00:08:03,629 --> 00:08:07,659
and if you know you said Myron exploit
we have hung

123
00:08:07,659 --> 00:08:11,289
physically a.m. week we skip

124
00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:14,439
this signature checks and just little

125
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:17,449
the patched images

126
00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:20,680
and can this way want a custom ROM this

127
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,300
so we just does all this at of Education

128
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,530
steps and the whole Gucci

129
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:31,009
com year for Corona I'm

130
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:35,390
we have the

131
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:39,320
first thing is we disable the address
space layout randomization

132
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,340
might just setting a specific

133
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:45,520
launch Tiki so that on startup we

134
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,620
just of this feature disabled court I
mean

135
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:53,779
the and this case is used a fine just
running the original binary which s

136
00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:57,860
of course government signature um

137
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,930
this binary has the same box profile but

138
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:05,370
them for some reason and the entitlement
section

139
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,740
is not included in the signature
checking so

140
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:12,310
we can patch the central fire to
actually break it

141
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:17,650
and this way runs his program but
without any sandbox restrictions

142
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:22,130
can just unlike read any fire are
executed

143
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:25,460
don't whatever me to read on um

144
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:29,700
than a Coronas I

145
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,980
loaded with the country Gration profile

146
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:36,080
that includes the so-called

147
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,029
format string vulnerability of this is
what just went present a bit later

148
00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:44,710
and also the detection prevention

149
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:48,110
as and bypassed you seeing

150
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:51,810
are he to achieve

151
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:54,810
the next step of exploiting a

152
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:58,120
this is then edge as poss on ability

153
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,540
to actually exploit the car this is 17
present

154
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:08,510
but management council yep for a TA for
perot know we had sperm

155
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:14,620
and distributed and isn't up package for
the city of packaging system

156
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:17,630
since a a tethered jailbreak whatsapp
ready

157
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:20,730
present for quite a while um

158
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:24,420
we decided to put Ortiz

159
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,880
at this Corona I'll setup into

160
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:32,420
turbine package for the studio system to
construct install this package which

161
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:32,930
were

162
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:36,480
put the penalty in place and starts to
copy

163
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,839
but we patch of this mckuen demand um

164
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,920
and then a were executed on stop

165
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:52,920
okay

166
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,370
are uncovered the

167
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:01,380
unsigned code execution and Allegheny
initial

168
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,640
actual jumping

169
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,480
chucking the usual I sucking getting

170
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,900
Kochhar patched

171
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:19,060
and for mass transit 2012

172
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:22,910
thats not right day

173
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:26,100
was a short-lived but only rack maybe

174
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,520
two years for the most part it was
really really

175
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,690
a lot of fun and not quite sure

176
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:36,720
I was pretty amazed show brought the
Sydney

177
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,800
I never got to work on a format string
but for I

178
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,510
basically shows total above

179
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:48,640
a is actually in

180
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,310
the warning each an air function so

181
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:56,080
basically any morning for heirs

182
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:03,080
planet to the law would trigger this
format

183
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:07,710
I while I wanna

184
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:12,310
housing the me p

185
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:16,740
calls you which

186
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,500
basically just three formats dead

187
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:25,040
I both

188
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,590
it passed variable argument function

189
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:31,590
into their

190
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:37,110
here Italy or manage interest rate and

191
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:43,130
passed a new format back in the key of B

192
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:46,640
and but that in checking it

193
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,260
just sent it Siuslaw or

194
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:57,260
china doll little

195
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:02,520
basis on Form this can do lots a little
meeting

196
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,830
percentage sign it

197
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:10,390
it all printout the value in hex on say

198
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:14,540
and but too many percentage sinuses

199
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:19,870
it will actually trying dereference
whatever interests there

200
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:22,950
and credit string add

201
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:28,290
says thank you but said share see

202
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:32,010
upon where tanks puede

203
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:35,510
put a nap before it it all

204
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:38,610
padded so sexually a longer

205
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,860
like this his a secure line

206
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:46,840
search height: had two dollars

207
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,490
it allows reference are

208
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:54,290
I stay relatively

209
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:57,400
so lab yes a

210
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:02,060
play referenced a are gonna say I

211
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:07,350
HH iPad one day and the most important
one

212
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:12,880
centers actually writes the number

213
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,530
Heights printed so far onto

214
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:23,530
whatever address

215
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:27,580
all the way it was they actually

216
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,990
bro the address they wanted

217
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:34,950
for national and referenced

218
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:39,100
that bad but unfortunately

219
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,140
at that way work anymore

220
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:45,959
yes that only other formats:

221
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:50,380
training sexually happy didn't he and
they're not actually

222
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:53,480
on stack cell cameraperson

223
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,910
yeah but

224
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:02,519
dual is another way we can explain it by
using

225
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:07,010
frank one ish a short like

226
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:10,880
at all linked lists on stay yeah

227
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,880
they basically whole

228
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,399
of the hotstepper punish to allow

229
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:24,820
second winding I

230
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:29,680
delay on stage in the prologue any

231
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,500
all a function at

232
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,370
see it's usually held in dire

233
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:41,390
register are seven you see here

234
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:46,170
pushing the old are seven on Tuesday up

235
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:53,170
damn moves current setpoint into our
said

236
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,879
I she allocates space for

237
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:02,269
local variables ed any traction

238
00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:05,509
because Bay claims abstract for us

239
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:08,639
K pops

240
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,160
are seven and return address ourselves
Frank wanna

241
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:19,769
actress back up the stack an Italian
team since we're

242
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:25,699
at all yes

243
00:16:25,699 --> 00:16:28,730
pointers instead at all

244
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:33,379
point to buy another this example up

245
00:16:33,379 --> 00:16:39,059
the actual payload I'll 38 with chronic
I

246
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:43,079
same use criticizing

247
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:46,980
you so that I actually

248
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,930
headed out way for the number is

249
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:55,110
so 11 you the padded out 11

250
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:59,839
s up to $11,000 add

251
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:05,179
the next for mastering it uses the

252
00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:10,319
relative upset one basically allows us
to

253
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,850
breach deep in this Dec and years

254
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:17,779
variables our way when we don't have to

255
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:21,630
address them directly at

256
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:25,679
coursing HH and that basically means yes

257
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,580
tear right that number

258
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:34,429
prayer yeah the number I spent so far
onto the screen

259
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:38,019
which

260
00:17:38,019 --> 00:17:42,159
a yep tak kak ad on the right shot their

261
00:17:42,159 --> 00:17:45,490
for their other format thanks heading
into their

262
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:49,110
but it right one by

263
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:53,580
in jail whatever interests was away

264
00:17:53,580 --> 00:18:00,580
part outstanding top

265
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:05,630
so

266
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:09,070
basically as hell we explain it

267
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:12,980
de Paul

268
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:16,900
one wanna tranquilized

269
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,260
whitish each one punched

270
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:24,900
the next time wanna buddy from the
credit

271
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,630
one by Chile did different appoint

272
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:32,390
to playing to the last night in HS

273
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:38,550
sense nine-inch cell

274
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:43,640
if we actually change that after watch

275
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:50,640
which changed his friend wanna to
address the section I'll

276
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:59,640
different weekend

277
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,240
well you basically over right tire

278

dress to be whatever trash what

279
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,920
possibly down need to know

280
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,020
any saw the dresses because we're just

281
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:28,020
using addresses that are already on
stack modifying change basically allow

282
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:29,490
us to

283
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:32,490
ride any size

284
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:37,130

00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:31,280
loss at the bypass the SR which

296
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,550
it's not a problem the spot but

297
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:39,850
the can be done am by me answer let's
play headed

298
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:44,280
topped much for but how

me too batch the security features of
its

306

same time

326
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:25,680
this is not possible except for

00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,120
your that far status its

335
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,430
in of performance so

336
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:03,520
yet she 25 leads there

337
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,750
right this this exception to

338
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:11,160
to their restrictions and and

339
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,660
decay is a well-known Ameritech I shot
into

340
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:18,180
astound the whole a this a

341
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:21,500
ants process just

342
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,790
for Smith's a and Asia was a

343
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:28,020
which transaction codes collecting

344
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:31,420

distributions with the fam where outside
of the container profile son-of-a-bitch

349
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:54,130
so now what's

350
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:58,660
he want to execute a psycho itself what
do we need to do

351
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:02,930
to should just go achievement

352
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:08,950
me only should the college to seoul s2
money by

353
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:12,080
camel church a hard this

354
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,850
security features this could cite
enforcement's

355
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:21,760
big problem with this

356
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,080
that the camel s watched you saw that

357
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,150
precisely the Celts testified

358
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:32,780
I points Wis essay

359
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:37,790
such a case such so it's not really
possible chain modified it to my face on

360
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:38,260
disk

361
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:42,330
so we have two to its

362
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:46,710
at the meantime in memory because we
don't have and exploit the porch

363
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:49,890
for

364
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:53,340
assessor and because a at the boots when

365
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:57,780
line registered executed a you don't
have an exploit

366
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,810
the chain some we need to to me

367
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:04,650
at right time later when the camera is
tilted to much

368
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:08,690
his security features what is nice about
the

369
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:11,830
camera memory in that s nearly all

370
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:18,830
read write and executes this really
interesting use it later

371
00:25:20,249 --> 00:25:23,659
saw arch batch the candle in memory

372
00:25:23,659 --> 00:25:27,029
year a use a process

373
00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:30,869
like record exploited with format
strings

374
00:25:30,869 --> 00:25:35,450
changes at because only the camel kept
excess

375
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:40,429
can deliver so to patch the camel

376
00:25:40,429 --> 00:25:45,859
just be the kennel kept us

377
00:25:45,859 --> 00:25:49,999
going into exploits could could exploit
that execution exploit

378
00:25:49,999 --> 00:25:53,840
to instructs account but she said

379
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,139
so is

380
00:25:57,139 --> 00:26:02,399
their attitudes fell earlier in the HFS
mucho

381
00:26:02,399 --> 00:26:05,999
this is changed a US 5

382
00:26:05,999 --> 00:26:09,139
5.1 so me

383
00:26:09,139 --> 00:26:13,340
basically a theirs and to get industrial

384
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:16,460
in the ending of HS

385
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:19,919
Catholic facts up to the US

386
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,429
I adults quite understand the back
really

387
00:26:23,429 --> 00:26:27,059
yeah and instead it's

388
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:30,619
just I just so thats it crashes

389
00:26:30,619 --> 00:26:34,350
the process when I said when I try to
bounce

390
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:37,999
trash to campus sorry when experts

391
00:26:37,999 --> 00:26:41,159
felt a specific image set a then we
fight

392
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:44,769
but trillion system and

393
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:48,190
walked scarred OS X anywhere and

394
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:51,299
to his death is quite complicated so

395
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:55,070
here is HFS first

396
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:58,720
figure skates appeared with his Mac OS X
10 for

397
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,829
it supports of eyes

398
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:04,679
to to but 63 backs

399
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:07,889
was such expense sixty

400
00:27:07,889 --> 00:27:11,789
31 sorry bites his friend use

401
00:27:11,789 --> 00:27:18,789
HFS pressure and finance templeton up to
255 Unicode characters

402
00:27:18,829 --> 00:27:22,089
and what's this anyone before and

403
00:27:22,089 --> 00:27:26,820
was the Cheetos yes

404
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,829
house 13h the Turkish

405
00:27:29,829 --> 00:27:33,149
black members which means that we can
access

406
00:27:33,149 --> 00:27:38,559
many more blocks said by the best songs

407
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,940
the next soul because bank they changed
side

408
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,120
the change to the

409
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,300
them maximum club members now can access

410
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:51,570
be good for him both to exponents

411
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:58,570
63 fights a maximum also the next 15
scallops

412
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,789
once harry's increased because at this

413
00:28:02,789 --> 00:28:07,260
and a also there's a and other features
it was at its

414
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:10,769
a 15 enough cheaper but by Sri s

415
00:28:10,769 --> 00:28:14,019
up I think a any number

416
00:28:14,019 --> 00:28:17,440
of by stress but don't use it right now

417
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,760
a question only by the best data

418
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:25,299
harkin devices for so to keep talking
about this

419
00:28:25,299 --> 00:28:28,340
fires a 81st this

420
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:31,880
index are also 5s their

421
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,899

424
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:47,529
overthrow fire which loves the beach %uh

425
00:28:47,529 --> 00:28:51,559
all the fires as well again was a
standout fights

426
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:54,600
nativist less as well at attributes

427
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:59,340
Petri the ties between stuffed inside a

428
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:03,429

432
00:29:14,049 --> 00:29:19,000
block s dedicated that's all tenets

433
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,269
a change HFS engine

434
00:29:22,269 --> 00:29:26,049
church is some rights blocks the right
trademarks

435
00:29:26,049 --> 00:29:31,200
when you create by a

436
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,769
this also the catalog file which

437
00:29:34,769 --> 00:29:38,049
indexes or find names side attributes

438
00:29:38,049 --> 00:29:41,510
basic attributes and approach

439
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:44,700
8 first XTS the Extensa

440

for consecutive blocks

442
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:56,970
in the face so the cat fights have so
they treat a

443
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:00,059
and

444
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:04,799
the he holds a parent-child relationship
between folders in fact

445
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,440
at the last want to talk about here

446
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,809
if the extensive official site which is
a bit

447
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:15,190
trillion so ants which defiance

448
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:18,659
additional expense of fires more than 86

449
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:21,820
well the

450
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,210
the bank the back happen in the volume
header

451
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:28,520
see that's that's what that's why I'm
talking about its

452
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,990
a defined debate basic

453
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:35,340
William meter data of

454
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:38,679
HFS version to tie the block size

455
00:30:38,679 --> 00:30:41,679
a number of blocks at all

456
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,120
the number of three blocks a

457
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,240
ever so it points to the difference
index fives

458
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:53,170
for you Paris

459
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:57,330
one example so a

460
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:00,880
as you can see the first bites updates
plus

461
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,290
and their fashion that we can reef after

462
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:08,250
and desist pointless

463
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:11,890
a to 35 it show the other values

464
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:14,980
because we're not really interested in
since and

465
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:18,030
bets there are different for home

466
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:22,720
Falzone zones to define search for
somebody for fast

467
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:27,210
the temptation fine the extent by
Catherine Tsai and attributes: fact

468
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:31,130
Inessa to stretch the structure

469
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:34,130
defining this

470
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:37,880
hysteria weekends K

471
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,950
the first

472
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:46,240
a member of the structure is energy
costs I S

473
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,270
of the fork %uh then

474
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:52,320
we have to clamp size I once a

475
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,390
gives you more details about that says

476
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:59,250
this is kind of complicated the club
side their extends

477
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,890
it's kind of complicated so I wants give
ASM

478
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:06,320
but she takes about this but one which
is

479
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,350
really interesting if the total blocks

480
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:15,660
used by the fork to

481
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:19,310
initiated words

482
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:22,510
if we modify the total number of loss

483
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:26,440
of kept at about five to be less that's
really he's

484
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,720
like this

485
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:33,310
Betsy

486
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:36,790
gonna try this all

487
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:41,850
OSX 10:06 eights we're

488
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:45,200
we'll creates and HFS MH

489
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,330
using standoff tones TPH

490
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:51,510
nice and FS HR systems

491
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:54,520
mountains and in some fine ass

492
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,590
announce them best this famous

493
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:00,940
where it myself previously this one

494
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:05,650
a ends trying estate amount sequence

495
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:09,600

00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,330
then will and Kedia

499
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:23,030
the the directory with we want amounts

500
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:26,860
and whale amounts this this

501
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:31,620
major some back device

502
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:38,620
lips Sat crashes I just keep

503
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:47,370
the the same boards FCS a disbanded
because

504
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:50,680
just pointless I mean its

505
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:54,280
different it right any to trial it once
I'll

506
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:58,780
it will crash special extension you try
it and those outside

507
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:02,040
expression another function a yet

508
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:07,430
SS render so

509
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:10,500
says himself what test

510
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:14,360
in fact I use all

511
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:18,200
first it the stack trace

512
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:22,200
dice ice thats it happened a lot

513
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,580
said see other Canon train so

514
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:28,649
it has something to do with the with the
heat some things like

515
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:32,980
every correction somehow so after SATs

516
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:36,030
like a explain it are you I try to spend
six

517
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:42,210
a trench connects to the see

518
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:46,149
to fit Ramesh miss Katie I tried

519
00:34:46,149 --> 00:34:49,980
stated in the day the license of the
code up

520
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:53,460
Mac OS X II really

521
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:56,630
don't understand what's what's it
happens the coast

522
00:34:56,630 --> 00:35:00,840
so shall I whose time on this

523
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:06,170
no I'm going straight to explanation
what tools

524
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:09,980
tweet a helpless

525
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:13,340
adjusted the this memory corruption

526
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:16,920
hopefully the its own dedicated

527
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,480
as depicted parts if you

528
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,750
us dash sets achieve about

529
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:30,000
hours of the camel a special ranch

530
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,050
says Tom by a

531
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:36,870
him from song a

532
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:40,030
which spawned by see elegance differing

533
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:44,560
and to check in next three unions

534
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,990
in address space on the Council on the
arts also kept

535
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:51,070
dashed said p a

536
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:54,430
but arguments that's me just feels

537
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:59,190
the whole offering memory is that these
which is interesting

538
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:02,360
so adding his part

539
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,520
us ep helps can trash

540
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:10,030
rights on the optional to surrender
position so

541
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:13,980
desist Kenneth Cole SS a

542
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:20,260
also this

543
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:24,650
one special features sets lowest said
the Calder

544
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:28,310
%uh right on on the crash to a remote
machine

545
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:31,850
smash just I

546
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:36,310
the changed service running the

547
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:39,960
as a for the for the example I

548
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,980
the it was a comment to do it into

549
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:47,430
and a arrests affected system you watch
test

550
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:52,190
yeah

551
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:55,800
Wes with Sis a Guinness

552
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,940
its easier to understand what happens

553
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:02,590
we have the message over there

554
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:06,610
a 3d so events has been modified

555
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:11,650
yeah nice me the

556
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:15,730
back to us so

557
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:19,280
what we have caught us

558
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:24,210
we have diverging boots arguments

559
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:28,130
okay GB is now useful

560
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:31,860
so you

561
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:35,670
you just need the camel advocates that
I'll tell

website developer website the

564
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:46,050
you just need feedback and all days
simple

565
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:50,110
informations and this little Kb

566
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:53,350
a sorry search scraped change

567
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:56,680
metrics which is really useful

568
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,970
here's comments to start shipping and

569
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:03,560

mackerel utilities upside

571
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,600
a so Minister simply somebody catch

572
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,640
factories yep said CMOS a

573
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:19,000
will see that happens in the in the HFS

574
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,230
in them a tip balance HFS plus volume

575
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:26,380
and said a its tries to such

576
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:29,400
the tree and yes

577
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:34,000
but arise the block and trash

578
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:41,000

factors detention macros a in such a
change

582
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:53,620
after dis trent's that will show you the
different

583
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:57,620
keeps owns a answer

584
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:02,100
me the address I on to say that

585
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:06,170
yeah

586
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:08,440
in red is this a red

587
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,470
s the next three elements of the

588
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:17,390
as that the sole mia es

589
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:21,799
said overslept so distress

590
00:39:21,799 --> 00:39:26,999
you it's me let's see use the free block

591
00:39:26,999 --> 00:39:30,960
there is the frame luck so because we
added

592
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,999
the said Piedmont Oct should be of dead
this

593
00:39:33,999 --> 00:39:38,460
year and this is not the case we have
some thoughts

594
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:41,490
up me image the HFS image

595
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:47,450
in the frame so

596
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:50,880
yeah this should be Dennis too fast

597
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,559
and last worse cash next three elements

598
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:58,660
of this change list of

599
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:05,660
units

600
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,880
now watchin dole

601
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:15,090
even herself with the debugging tools

602
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:18,130
by adding a said lockport iraq

603
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:21,660
a now that we know

604
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:24,800
the the compromise TSO they its

605
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,060
birth 496 all

606
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:33,000
anchored sets that showed you anyway
said that the points

607
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,810
yes the his own name so now we can add

608
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:41,190
his suspicion iraq that heat race
allocations

609
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:44,420
and for his questions

610
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:48,070
me nice to each to know

611
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:54,720
when you want to perform essentially so
he has the comments to

612
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,890
tunes that doctor the special so

613
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:02,070
now

614
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:05,840
okay me we know that we can overrides

615
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:09,400
a a free elements

616
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,410
is a custom miscues to data coming from
the

617
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:16,950
HSH itself so

618
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:20,160
yeah we have to complete rest

619
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,220
latest allegations trainees miss that
stack

620
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:30,220

621
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:34,620
I try to play with this butts content it
sets

622
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:37,730
the 4786

623
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:41,540
bias the best so much play miss because

624
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,770
Shastri of as

this special sheep so %uh

628
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,830
so unseen after that we need to change
that

629
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:03,520
zone China the one a one a pot

keep his to fragment S on the

638
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:34,540
OSX to have to change

639
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:38,750
the wage this two ish like so

640
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:42,420
exploitable a

641
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:46,150
weekend right commentator to next

642
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:49,840
which a free block memory

643
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:53,550
a free she elements

644
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:58,400
yes exploitable because this is the
journalists

645
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,280
and if you can overrides and a slight
crush is also

646
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,570
if you can overwrite the the first he
would've

647
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:08,810
next three elements s

648
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:12,330
you can't choose a location obtuse at
then yes

649
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:15,950
this a location happens control

650
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:22,690
was controlled position yeah

651
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:26,230
as I said which switch to a different
zone

652
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:30,810
so to do that I just modified to block
size of my image to be

653
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:34,990
5 a dreaded 12 banks and just

654
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:39,470
point to No the press size in mens of
occasions paramount's

655
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:43,450
and the precise amount author returned

656
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:47,770
three-plus hurt sentiments

657
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:51,720
of him a speech its sonya

nursery in fact okay

659
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:01,609
so there's all it can exploit exploited

660
00:44:01,609 --> 00:44:04,980
we her sry

661
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:08,329
im ages one that's just mean standard
one the

662
00:44:08,329 --> 00:44:12,089
original one and another one sets his

663
00:44:12,089 --> 00:44:16,410
the image that wendell where we just
have changed

664
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:20,520
day at the famous a words I showed you
profusely

665
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:24,440
though this so-called keep overthrow
image

666
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:27,849
then we have a surgeon image

667
00:44:27,849 --> 00:44:32,530
that is a payloads to be returned in the
a controllable

668
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:38,500
a location up the cam appearance

669
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:42,109
be exploit sequence we gotta

670
00:44:42,109 --> 00:44:45,329
mounts twice the first time but image

671
00:44:45,329 --> 00:44:49,400
said amount its Maunsell on

672
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:53,900
one-time overflow image and now it's yes

673
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:57,819
oil Mitch mounts became age 11 time
again

674
00:44:57,819 --> 00:45:02,549
Venice the payload image at last

675
00:45:02,549 --> 00:45:09,549
so

676
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:14,299
in stable of the a page

677
00:45:14,299 --> 00:45:17,780
in the camera he you have

678
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:21,630
in the first code the offsetting the
bench

679
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:24,700
if it's allocated on us

680
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:29,099
ans dis quite related to to be

681
00:45:29,099 --> 00:45:33,540
offsets Asha a protest any

682
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:36,700
a square but OK this is an extreme

683
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:41,880
p.m. interests so

684
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:45,010
s what happens when we try to announce

685
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:48,180
the clean image that's you remember

686
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:51,280
its allocates 3 memory

687
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:56,540
blocks first look

688
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:59,809
second one and you can see the

689
00:45:59,809 --> 00:46:03,770
extremists is modified at the center

690
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:08,140
then search sick once

691
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,920
the the NHK mounds happening here

692
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:18,880
okay

693
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,020
and

694
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:25,559
notes this these images

695
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:28,980
so that we can control

696
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:34,369
where the overflow up its K

697
00:46:34,369 --> 00:46:39,500
okay

698
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:43,710
so next next three defendants with will
be at

699
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:50,710
offsets 800 in X the amounts

700
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:59,710
clean image again

701
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:07,360
hustling okay I'm just confused

702
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:10,640
okay there

703
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,870
yes is better

704
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:18,270
when mounting overthrow image

705
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:21,590
one block to block

706
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:24,710
three blocks until the show opens

707
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:29,030
and its overflows five blocks and

708
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:32,970
what's really interesting thats it
overthrows

709
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:36,550
this last one which is

710
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:43,550
the next a 3d elements self-financed

711
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:49,120
you know it's and again

712
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:53,740
we mount the clean image sees

713
00:47:53,740 --> 00:48:00,740
overflowed elements up next this year
there

714
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:07,360
we try to mounts give you any page

715
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:10,580
payloads ants it is

716
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:15,540
mountains in a a position we control

717
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:19,250
because overflow data is controllable

718
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:22,490
up

719
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:29,490
exploit the

720
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,210
idea now is two sets says aunts

721
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:38,530
address 10 to Francisco Los

722
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:42,849
in this a won't

723
00:48:42,849 --> 00:48:45,670
data last first

724
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:49,670
words the sentiments

725
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:53,910
points to scorn we we watched and me

726
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:57,469
and what could happen is that for the
overwrite this is called table

727
00:48:57,469 --> 00:49:04,469
Wis our data so

728
00:49:05,049 --> 00:49:08,890
we're re pretty close to a

729
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:12,559
a camel exploit here the

730
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:15,849
what's

731
00:49:15,849 --> 00:49:18,949
what's we with done next is to

732
00:49:18,949 --> 00:49:22,420
a so basically we're

733
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:27,410
me replaced death five 112 by some
assistance

734
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:30,959
Wis year some controllable dat

735
00:49:30,959 --> 00:49:34,150
data which is a house assistance health

736
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:37,910
HFS so that we can her applied the

737
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:41,229
VHS protocol roles on

738
00:49:41,229 --> 00:49:44,449
on our image the

739
00:49:44,449 --> 00:49:48,479
then we have replaced the particle a
Cisco always

740
00:49:48,479 --> 00:49:52,269
the right anywhere gadget and thats

741
00:49:52,269 --> 00:49:55,969
right anywhere gadgets that right any
worse his call

742
00:49:55,969 --> 00:49:59,349
we have created he's in utilized

743
00:49:59,349 --> 00:50:02,779
to restore the choc corrected C span's

744
00:50:02,779 --> 00:50:05,859
and I play the jailbreak cannot purchase

745
00:50:05,859 --> 00:50:09,130
me just the

746
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:12,150
replaced once a school we iz a

747
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:16,599
killer right any worse school that
sweeney

748
00:50:16,599 --> 00:50:20,069
then hung use in the I will rip

749
00:50:20,069 --> 00:50:23,369
Rupp payloads to churches a Generac

750
00:50:23,369 --> 00:50:26,519
here is that the famous to

751
00:50:26,519 --> 00:50:29,940
Rupp gadgets we used acqua

752
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:35,209
for Kim right anyway the to stick to
that one

753
00:50:35,209 --> 00:50:38,359
at the two param it says which is the

754
00:50:38,359 --> 00:50:43,650
where we want rights and what we want to
write

755
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:46,380
then store and returns

756
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:53,370
okay

757
00:50:53,370 --> 00:50:56,430
so if you need more infomations

758
00:50:56,430 --> 00:51:00,220
about this stuff we're gonna really is
the source code

759
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:03,830
of proof of concepts after back in the
box

760
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:07,200
completely and you can read of course

761
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,390
CIOs hacker's handbook to know which
batch

762
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:15,120
to apply with the child the Canon right
anywhere to church a brick

763
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:21,920
she's out of scope here any question

764
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:28,920
it must have been a challenge

765
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:33,750
ever the FBI on the actual I on

766
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:37,680
sorry to I your where are you okay

767
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,860
am could derail perhaps

768
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:45,080
talk a little bit about the process he
used

769
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:51,020
answers it's kind of difficult for me to
understand its distance

770
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:54,560
meeting make

771
00:51:54,560 --> 00:52:01,510
you anxious discontinue their question
please

772
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:06,150
okay I'll if you could perhaps expanded
about about their process or the tools

773
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:07,280
you use to develop

774
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,910
on the iPhone which is very hard to

775
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:14,340
develop exploits on seeing as a
debugging is very hard or

776
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:17,100
possible and

777
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:20,500
and the migration from and the Mac OS

778
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:24,410
into the iPhone I see a question is a

779
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:28,640
it it's difficult to develop directly
develop exploits directly on the iPhone

780
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:28,960
and

781
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:35,560
what tools three years to develop these
exploits which

782
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:39,320
him police difficult to develop

783
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:46,320
explain directly on your iPhone because
there's no about of course

784
00:52:47,110 --> 00:52:50,820
the out the big angels on the iPhone you
can

785
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:54,609
just use a serial cable

786
00:52:54,609 --> 00:52:56,580
and

787
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:59,050
a user the KTP put a call to

788
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:02,750
to remotely deberg the council year

789
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:05,910
you you can you have heard the right to
begin to miss two

790
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:09,650
to exploits and I was this is not the
point the point is that about

791
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:13,540
if we have dipped to booking tools on
knot's the point is that

792
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:17,530
its really difficult to write exploits
on now is because it's a

793
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:21,160
really secured operating system

794
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:24,570
this is a point that's that's right the
quite the

795
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:31,570
we have difficult times on the or
questions

796
00:53:47,110 --> 00:53:50,190
I am after a bit we walked into this

797
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:53,880
the presentation a bit later so maybe we
missed for

798
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:57,160
the on not all officers for

799
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:02,290
have just such a low level knowledge
what I basically get that you use an

800
00:54:02,290 --> 00:54:02,920
export

801
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:06,850
in the a HFS driver to gain access to

802
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:11,250
well tattoo to make a colonel execute
privilege where

803
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:15,730
ek access pressure privilege memory but
I still miss the part how you

804
00:54:15,730 --> 00:54:20,230
get to you by phone two were Ted

805
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:23,110
how are you get the kernel to brewed
with those

806
00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:25,860
with those different parameters other
triggers our

807
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:30,060
went up with the chicken and the egg
that's the part I miss text key you

808
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:31,740
could you clarify the apartment

809
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:35,170
right now well actually going over so
that part in the

810
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:38,760
second part the afternoon top part of
our talk but I'll

811
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:42,590
the basic idea is that you can use large
Siemens

812
00:54:42,590 --> 00:54:45,960
a launch d2 lot though a copy

813
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:50,750
a fraction which is signed by Apple with
them exploit configuration file

814
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:53,910
troll launcher are drop chain that

815
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:58,000
than executes a Cox Plate 7 cents

816
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,200
writer and recording has already been
cleared by Apple for

817
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:06,510
site record was signed by Apple then yes
track us

818
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:09,860
iraq has the IT sector demand for the
piano ni

819
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:13,140
I'll essence sign in sheet on every
iPhone

820
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:19,310
support a a I messed thank you merchants

821
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:25,290
them questions

822
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:28,830
old daughter

823
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:29,350
thank you guyssss
