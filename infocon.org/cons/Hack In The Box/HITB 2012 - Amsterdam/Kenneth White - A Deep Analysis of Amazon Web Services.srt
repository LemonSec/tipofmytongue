1
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:10,719
the

2
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,540
part about the hiccup there and then

3
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:25,560
and is an in zone and in this is
probably one at that

4
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,810
more an orthodox tax that

5
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,970
you have at the conference and then
essentially

6
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,250
it's a story if an k Hannah a group

7
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,059
really and unlikely people in a nap

8
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:43,059
becoming obsessed about the BS
infrastructure an

9
00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:46,790
and I'm can walk you through a little
bit E I would ask

10
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:50,140
patients just a little bit because
there's there's some admittedly

11
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,230
non-technical

12
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:55,489
and and bearing on security contacts and
I think Alps

13
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:59,370
answer frame lessons or explain are mine
satin

14
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,239
pendant you know when our approach was
named Molly discovered

15
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:06,320
am citation per start saying I have no

16
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,330
and you know financial interest ur you
know and

17
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:13,400
your contacts anything

18
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,620
and with Amazon an Internet friend or
two

19
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,680
the nearly everything that many
presenting

20
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,090
is happening on the web it's public
information I'm

21
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:26,610
also this is a and chips and scientists
artist and bang

22
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,610
and speaking as a security researcher at
night say

23
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,090
through official person for my company
cell

24
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,530
its so if you read the bio its prolly
not the typical out by love

25
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:41,909
that's a comment here and I'm so this
isn't about me

26
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:45,130
am most migrant last 15 years have been
spent clinical research

27
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:48,649
and clinical trials and drug
specifically I work

28
00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:53,270
at the intersection at and genomics and
medicine and pharmacology

29
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:56,719
complex information systems Sam sense
for them

30
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,979
Minges 10 snarky comments and complexity

31
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:03,049
okay I'm tell dragons wing

32
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:07,270
so I can imagine shame or something and

33
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:11,950
hope that's not true I don't think it's
true so

34
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:15,830
here's some things in my group is
working on am we're effectively the

35
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,020
nonprofit arm for the National Institute
of Health which is concerned that

36
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,420
and major by medical and government
funding agency in the US

37
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,740
now we also have pre close ties to the
World Health Organization

38
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:30,540
at the UN we do some work with our
nation's second only to gates

39
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,980
and and the MacArthur Foundation backed

40
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,370
and we are and commercial company been
met probably

41
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,640
is this is nine EE $8.95 per cent but
work is coming grant

42
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,960
so working on some big complicated
problems and

43
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,060
you know candy making plans and bird
swine flu h1n1

44
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,350
antibiotic-resistant reconnaissance I'm
I'm

45
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:54,150
and unlike and I think

46
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,400
that perception buying some large

47
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,710
pharmaceutical companies and actually
make the sanction we're

48
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:04,800
and and Clinic research operations come
across her execution

49
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,220
we don't develop drugs we don't have
chemists and

50
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,720
you know monster super computers and
things and I don't know where this

51
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,680
just in terms of compute power an you
know there's the top 500 less messy

52
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,300
I'm against everybody year to go in it I
think

53
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:25,350
45 should be honest but they're not
because a privately held by farm

54
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,500
self I Z for example one basic computers
world

55
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,600
and and they don't so I can be credited
back

56
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,490
but its its it's almost like the hidden
when in a sense because you

57
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:38,820
it's just and because and competitive
nature

58
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:43,850
and Drug government some matches your
personal work on project for seven years

59
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,890
and every other talk about it you can
accomplish this

60
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:50,270
you can explain something really cool to
me techniques and serve with a guy

61
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,750
and cell it's in that context so

62
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,780
I mention complex system so you know
because I mean exactly

63
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:01,500
well in my vernacular and you know this
group been around for about 30 years

64
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,310
our team right now is going to support
the operations and largest bank try

65
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,490
research and work tomorrow

66
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:09,920
so live people working and

67
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,060
you know and developing nations and this
isn't new

68
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,699
am what's complicated is am

69
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:21,039
the scale and speed am after execution
team

70
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:24,110
and I'd say there is and this pin prick
inside

71
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:28,190
six years ago or so that said you know
it's not enough to have great

72
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:32,720
epidemiologists not a great it's an
Afghan pharmacologist think Ms in this

73
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,330
work thing

74
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:37,240
you can have the best potential compound
or vaccine whenever

75
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,800
if you don't have solid technology the
its you know

76
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,880
these projects 9 sign of you have heard
this statistic

77
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,950
and their few group that and

78
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:51,000
for debate the fine appointment it's
estimated $700 million to about 1.2

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,130
billion dollars

80
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:56,160
to bringing a compound marking so that's
from the Discovery Point

81
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,560
computer modeling up wat een being able
to be using patient groups

82
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,420
and in its really insidious in the
developing world because

83
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,920
there's a lot of what's called an you
orphan diseases

84
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:11,250
I'm which may have you millions in
people suffering that they don't

85
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,400
you know there's no profit motive
because effectiveness and happiness and

86
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,650
canada generic drugs are arm you know

87
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,800
things that are not acting there they're
completely and alignments for the North

88
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,560
American

89
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,340
and Western Europe business model so so
that burn his fall

90
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,639
I'm a lot to government agencies an

91
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,170
despite 20 banking thing conceptual
connection with them

92
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:38,770
I'm places like NH like the National
Health Service

93
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:42,590
and by Health Canada and and forget the
name technically

94
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,810
the pulling bodies in Japan I'm its

95
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,240
it's not bad and you know these large
farm is an

96
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,790
thousands scientist working when land
and working on you can turn

97
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:56,160
and you come can think this

98
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,280
it's much more complicated there is such
close time between

99
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,020
foundations academia and private sector

100
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,550
am particularly these days extending
last

101
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,600
three years worked well to them

102
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,830
the 14 compounds that when of and
trademark protection

103
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:18,110
so and some the other ones coming up so
this is you know

104
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:22,430
and by a Grand Am there and us
medication pain medications and

105
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,860
psychiatric medications

106
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:28,360
and you know and high blood pressure
medications

107
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,410
when this come off Big Pharma and

108
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:35,460
and dynamic $10.23 billion dollar
companies be really

109
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,860
have been screaming last year's to find
new and compounds

110
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,910
many businessmen we're obviously not
estaba

111
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:45,120
poignant so in that context they're not
looking

112
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,830
and metal on the sorting have at and

113
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:52,389
your contacts and at night actually live
and

114
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:56,050
for larger farms are not interested in
you know things for

115
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,740
basically government an health efforts

116
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,790
so what I mean by phase one thanks for
and injustice and condos me a little bit

117
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:04,440
if you like

118
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,150
so you guys will back here you be served
by timmys

119
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:11,230
and I'm coming down so clinical drug
development online

120
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:15,480
at a0 or preclinical thats where we have
an idea

121
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,510
there's maybe some big a day and I think
wrenching economic side

122
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:22,949
lot simpler to review lots understanding
if in a complex multi-disciplinary

123
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:26,530
and areas lots and lots of a computer
mouse

124
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,660
his you know that's cheap and Beatrice
studies

125
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:33,490
thats when you first start looking at
you know it company working on toxic is

126
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,980
beneficial in tissue

127
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:38,790
you need a sense that's and you know
that's when there's an AMM

128
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:42,290
so phase 1 through 4 part in the US
where

129
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:46,220
begins the parent for and said he's
prior to human research

130
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:49,880
so face wanna 4 clinical so you do the
same thing that you

131
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,480
people and and there's lots more rules
cell

132
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:57,520
am too lazy then read because I think
research works

133
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,139
I thought are you an evil genius I
computer model

134
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:04,440
tissue mouse monkey college teen

135
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,000
that technical research works and
eventually

136
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,340
when we can figure out way maximum power
in doses

137
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:15,380
and with the campaign's tax unit Texas
the into port

138
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:19,410
and if it's actually say than women in
the case to with actual patient groups

139
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:24,380
on you be at all times you know Yale
Cancer compound

140
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,690
and then when we show some evidence
there and

141
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:31,889
these are as you can imagine 10-year
processes phase 3 are large scale not

142
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:33,079
seen trials

143
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:36,240
I'm not saying I mean am you know

144
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,490
Boston University Anna UCLA and

145
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:43,169
you know major institutions around the
world

146
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:47,060
cell you're saying that going in this
matters to me has

147
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,389
well drug development clinical trials
are highly regulated

148
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:54,490
and show when we implement missus and
talking about

149
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:58,209
it's a formal process attack white to
that level and DOD

150
00:08:58,209 --> 00:09:02,079
I think that if you're and it's not
distract you by the way she say devices

151
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:05,720
if you're developing an any pacemaker

152
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:10,069
you know the way the bill topper for
that you're not doing happened on

153
00:09:10,069 --> 00:09:13,249
you know it I compiled into your
shipping right I mean

154
00:09:13,249 --> 00:09:17,379
you really don't want to do back you
know lean development for

155
00:09:17,379 --> 00:09:20,970
I'm my preferred device development and
also if you're

156
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,999
if you're looking at released essay
group

157
00:09:23,999 --> 00:09:28,209
and with drugs and in some cases have
never been given to human ever

158
00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:31,930
an it's really critical that if you get

159
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:35,050
named I attributes that bear

160
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:38,300
absolutely consistent at their insane
that

161
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,779
the systems are a complete your bass and
transactional

162
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:45,459
in addition all that there are all kinds
have for you rules and things

163
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:48,680
and I like in the office and I me about
scary poverty line

164
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,100
and this is a great example newly
founded this way to four but there's

165
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,149
their slogan a subtle and

166
00:09:55,149 --> 00:09:58,910
and secure the party line in this world
because in academia

167
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:02,160
an where it's at profit driven you have

168
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,300
and potentially great ideas and

169
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,959
and innovations coming back of an

170
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,999
really and 89 taint

171
00:10:11,999 --> 00:10:14,779
what the regulatory burden is to
actually get it from the lamp from the

172
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:15,509
bench

173
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:19,100
at united in tibet cited patient groups
and

174
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,809
that permeates is so many levels when
the ways we see it

175
00:10:22,809 --> 00:10:28,160
isn't security sign is Anthony in church
sign is on this from repeatedly sign

176
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,170
and increasingly people are talking
about and

177
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:34,740
and have a story to frame this is a
race-based so you know in this crime

178
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,459
movies when

179
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:38,689
you know some he's been murdered and but
like the evidence the crime scene and

180
00:10:38,689 --> 00:10:40,269
there's always this conversation back

181
00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:43,559
the chain cassidy anti-semitic the a
sampling

182
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:46,949
well you know officer Bigelow gave it a
you know

183
00:10:46,949 --> 00:10:50,399
this guy in this and yet again you have
to be able to say

184
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,720
from the time that today to learn were
picked up for ingress

185
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,929
where it was every step way this really
is a 10-year programs

186
00:10:56,929 --> 00:11:00,839
so you know it's one thing to think
about drivers ed

187
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:04,269
supporting vendors innings a couple
years actually things are 10 12 your

188
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:04,970
time

189
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:09,119
that missus and price cell

190
00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:12,540
at this is for one of my systems wine
for

191
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,459
a relatively small part company this is
the documentation burning

192
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:20,089
and requirements I'm

193
00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:23,149
testing plans risk mitigation plans

194
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:26,699
deployment NASCAR to training hard nets
for one

195
00:11:26,699 --> 00:11:30,160
system out but

196
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,569
it also lazy because I think when people
who

197
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:37,089
have a strong engineering course of a
backgrounder ski back meant

198
00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:40,949
for it starting in this world well it
can't be that much different than say

199
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:44,050
and yes earnings actually ran financial
world with

200
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:47,179
and is regulated K at badass

201
00:11:47,179 --> 00:11:50,839
its its crucially different because if
this

202
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:55,410
we're dealing with life and death issues
if you're interested there's an

203
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:59,170
I a great now and fascinating read

204
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:02,829
happy about three years ago and whose
Oxbridge

205
00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:06,439
and it's going UK there was a there is
an

206
00:12:06,439 --> 00:12:10,920
at clinical trial for and

207
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,689
it was basically they can apparently
compound as I recall

208
00:12:14,689 --> 00:12:19,079
am had beautiful computer models great
anal casting

209
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:22,679
other tissue resulting with fantastic am

210
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:26,050
and when the brain and basically these

211
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:29,529
young college student age kids healthy
healthy people

212
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:33,649
and to do this trial they made a mistake

213
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:36,829
am which was to say I think you're right

214
00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:40,259
11 people in the trial all 11 got the
dose at the same time

215
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:44,410
I'm an its it said kinda

216
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:47,839
hideous and moniker whatever but he
Google

217
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,819
Elephant Man hour of men syndrome or
something like that with my fam

218
00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:55,379
at clinical trial you can read the story
basically am

219
00:12:55,379 --> 00:12:58,509
there was was called in as cytokine
storm

220
00:12:58,509 --> 00:13:02,449
the body did not lie bedroom on and
there was

221
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:06,149
permanent massive hideously painful
wrist

222
00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:10,739
you know effect immediately am so I
think this is a sure thing you know if

223
00:13:10,739 --> 00:13:14,769
it memcached guys and it's not like
we're missing a comment

224
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:18,619
in cash dying to databases and
eventually consistent

225
00:13:18,619 --> 00:13:22,800
I mean you we have to tie attributes
time is critical

226
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,910
and so many different data points being
collected it's just a different thing

227
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,649
and it's not different just because
there's light pink were connected

228
00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:30,339
understand that

229
00:13:30,339 --> 00:13:33,800
regulatory side its differ because
they're

230
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,179
cell mailer better East Coast racin my
sights high

231
00:13:37,179 --> 00:13:41,959
so you get lost in this opportunity you
know on and movies what are the Hartley

232
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:45,329
their people who spend their entire
careers I'm not getting

233
00:13:45,329 --> 00:13:48,989
their entire careers focus 9 that part

234
00:13:48,989 --> 00:13:53,230
heartbeat and if he kgz CG's

235
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:56,259
have been around for and a hundred years
or so when

236
00:13:56,259 --> 00:14:00,389
and more desperate forms there are and
it was discovered about

237
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:03,459
mid-eighties heavily there's an healthy
young woman

238
00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:06,679
I think that 36 to sell she presented it

239
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,889
a suburban hospital just outside DC I
with

240
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:13,569
and you know severe chest pains things
great shape

241
00:14:13,569 --> 00:14:16,899
and I'm you know his previous we thank

242
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:20,429
thanks am an

243
00:14:20,429 --> 00:14:25,139
you had a pattern on a hurry that people
hadn't seen that the position 6 minutes

244
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:27,089
1 seconds where we think

245
00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:30,259
culture saipan syndrome and what it is

246
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:33,459
is a very saddle to catch that

247
00:14:33,459 --> 00:14:38,819
very subtle change and not be social a
dozen top lieutenants talking heart

248
00:14:38,819 --> 00:14:42,860
if I claim directly on yet cell

249
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:46,230
this little push out this little delay

250
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:50,709
in at Bon on the way for me as little as
five milliseconds

251
00:14:50,709 --> 00:14:54,470
is enough to kill a $300 million dollar
compound dead for the game and go

252
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:57,629
now it's too risky

253
00:14:57,629 --> 00:15:01,230
it says single I'm yet complex

254
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:04,850
not long at and signed by the way if
you've had money to South

255
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:08,230
you may have had one or two you know
electric stickers I'm in clinical

256
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:09,600
research least 12

257
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,309
we we use a deadly drive 12

258
00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:17,629
so let's do some quick math I'm thousand
hurts

259
00:15:17,629 --> 00:15:22,470
12 signals am 24 hours a day

260
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:26,470
maybe seven days per subject multiple
conditions across several months this

261
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,389
gets into La today

262
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:31,220
really quickly and its its its and

263
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:35,579
its mission cation problem but it also
is a safety issue

264
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:39,160
cell and with this man just his
paperwork burden the systems are just

265
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,079
databases and Web after getting a
six-person

266
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,859
it's not obvious ones and and
screenshots probably

267
00:15:45,859 --> 00:15:49,209
that we have a an IP rating of 5

268
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:53,540
at Becca measurement system where
literally pixel by pixel we're measuring

269
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:57,679
the voltage time on its way from times
so in the way you think about that we

270
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:58,769
design and

271
00:15:58,769 --> 00:16:01,850
at the way you hardness systems and

272
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:05,600
its it's just a different mentality from
I'm offline and among

273
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,119
that you and I may be used to working
with and as we go from here most human

274
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:10,939
trials whose

275
00:16:10,939 --> 00:16:15,399
makes where applications the camps so
much more packed

276
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:20,230
and rapid dominance just not so much

277
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:23,619
so this is actually to where we are so

278
00:16:23,619 --> 00:16:28,009
what does this have to do with security
and and technology morning are

279
00:16:28,009 --> 00:16:31,170
the cloud is having a major disruption
on this

280
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:34,819
at multiple points at multiple levels
and I'll try to

281
00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:39,549
minimizing stupid passwords think the
stoppers service and wanna be my part

282
00:16:39,549 --> 00:16:42,600
involvement in had really changed the
dynamic

283
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,489
in huge waste and I like the city where
the Taurus

284
00:16:47,489 --> 00:16:50,689
so there's get anything back titles and
got six innings

285
00:16:50,689 --> 00:16:54,129
so there's the institutional sloth these
people that are just

286
00:16:54,129 --> 00:16:59,540
deadwood that light you know you have a
pulse and breathing somehow

287
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:02,589
a you know think stay in organizations

288
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:07,120
and they let me say no or we can do that
we never done it that way

289
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,959
ban an there's a there's a very into
that in ninety

290
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,870
which is turning the big iron 90 you
know like

291
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:19,089
my sister my great let's hope we meeting
sit down you know put out five

292
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:22,559
you know competitive bids to down HP
analysts now have

293
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,919
fifteen people sanity you know in an
signatures on signatures and maybe some

294
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:30,210
time to make you get your stuff

295
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:33,360
then there's the fact that these people
have no clue but they're just

296
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,990
vaguely nervous in that stack to keep
anything since then

297
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:40,580
cloud we don't know where yet as if in a
large organization

298
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:45,460
I'm people really understand in less
than caring honest america's

299
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:49,279
but there's an awful lot upright man
just have no idea where the data here

300
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:52,510
no idea when the infrastructure is no
idea how the revocation marks the back

301
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:57,840
exactly every other step and so it's
it's an easy tactic mixing

302
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,409
back on the other side so what's the
appeal we get them

303
00:18:01,409 --> 00:18:05,529
ran revision we can do this on different
scales I'm

304
00:18:05,529 --> 00:18:08,720
the enlightened people or those in
quality when

305
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,840
compliance him maybe they're not
technical am

306
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,880
but they're open minded and willing to
engage bank

307
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,929
configuration first customization this
is the notion that

308
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:22,049
if you am I can mass customization if
you develop

309
00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:25,649
spend an inordinate I'm to condemn
validate one system

310
00:18:25,649 --> 00:18:28,769
and policies surrounding controls around
there

311
00:18:28,769 --> 00:18:32,059
if you can kinda cool and backpack but
he kinda

312
00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:35,929
if the recipe for Stan you know your
system going down through

313
00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:40,049
back on a conveyor belt if you can
qualify that process

314
00:18:40,049 --> 00:18:43,690
rather than each individual system or at
least make each individual systems

315
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:47,669
sorting you know really see the point

316
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:52,000
and dramatically shorter by then you
when the game in the pic of patience is

317
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,610
a Cinnabon

318
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:57,529
so here's a promising baby s we will
look that early on

319
00:18:57,529 --> 00:19:02,330
and this tale an your season just a
second but just in terms of sheer

320
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:05,809
server infrastructure and IP range in
appearing

321
00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:09,809
an think you know we start looking
around poor thing is

322
00:19:09,809 --> 00:19:13,779
we had understand insistence on you know
all these billions we popped up in a

323
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:17,760
your own child and at a college to in
hammock Kansas happened you got boxes

324
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,230
and

325
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:22,840
essays like you know I'm investment want
to make sure this thing that expansions

326
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,960
for the great but it's behind the VPN or
something and collecting

327
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,019
you know exactly like going two for two
months you take two or three there's a

328
00:19:29,019 --> 00:19:30,690
larger scale is killer

329
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:34,110
its absolutely killer and also my
opinion

330
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:38,010
its its evidence that there's this
disengagement

331
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,500
I'm you know I this where the devil
options

332
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,799
you know in whom like to use the day but
there is something about that

333
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:50,590
partnership at a really loud and in this
morning anti panic attack

334
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:54,460
when you see that networking because
means no means owning nobody's looking

335
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:59,730
and just general pain reduction now and
also the cost

336
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:03,580
0 human headaches them this is one
ranking

337
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,630
and if you're working with the 45

338
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:09,630
person shopper maybe 10 or 12 the maybe
this is not

339
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:13,630
you know this is a non-issue you get two
hundred 200 people in the company

340
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,220
organization much less

341
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:20,630
the Fortune 50 its its its crippling

342
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:23,720
is the opportunity cost in my opinion
that's the killer feature Excel

343
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,009
and maybe a Merry things that are
survivors to me %uh them her maybe some

344
00:20:27,009 --> 00:20:28,080
you're thinking

345
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,630
you know this you never advertised check
your systems

346
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:35,440
you know it somehow seems but but I
didn't look at this nasa if this is what

347
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,480
happens

348
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,750
I can't tell you how many times I've had
conversations with CTS or

349
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,980
you know heads a IT group who had

350
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:46,710
the opportunity to through you know
think more

351
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:50,990
progressively long-term and we start
cackling okay Western Digital hard

352
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,519
across this match in my

353
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:56,240
del 2920 you know to you serve a crisis
much

354
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,429
well much because after a few months and
he's teasing here

355
00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:02,610
you're missing the point I'm because I'm
gonna

356
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:06,029
trying to guess what we're paying for
electricity in pagers and

357
00:21:06,029 --> 00:21:09,139
guys 24 hours a day nights at

358
00:21:09,139 --> 00:21:13,240
and then there's this whole private
cloud thing which week it's been a

359
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,259
and norse minute I'm I will save you if
you

360
00:21:16,259 --> 00:21:19,990
have been pushing position having to
deal with quiet I

361
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:23,029
clue phone managers and not just in that
but to get in trouble

362
00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:26,370
there's a fantastic report call that at
Pats K

363
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:30,620
a coke or 51 am units by people for free

364
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:33,639
truly you know no exaggeration

365
00:21:33,639 --> 00:21:37,559
this to me was one of the best and can't
neutral

366
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:40,850
industry wine looks at this whole thing
they

367
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:44,200
they went to him a small mom-and-pop and
you know in

368
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,419
in rural areas in the states and europe
other way and I'm

369
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:51,940
and then really detailed analysis and

370
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:55,820
you know and what their and in with the
features were with Paris where he then

371
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,899
the players we met that's one thing and
basically when the things that came out

372
00:21:58,899 --> 00:22:00,830
with send in the cloud space

373
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:04,500
and you know there's make coping pepsi
in

374
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,630
aims and scope and yours there is no
Pepsi I'm

375
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:12,570
so but let's say let's say you want to
do this I'm

376
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:16,450
you really want a fan of a large-scale
the US can and if you do

377
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:20,179
and how much you time using

378
00:22:20,179 --> 00:22:24,279
as so and this may not be as community
service for

379
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:27,289
people here but I'm Iron Mountain is
this

380
00:22:27,289 --> 00:22:30,419
there well established company it sorted

381
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:34,559
you know it's like that three you know
topical I'm

382
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,870
for document management and they clearly
have

383
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:41,049
at mountain you know in the basic
mountains in

384
00:22:41,049 --> 00:22:44,679
in West Virginia and storage areas and
things what some point a few years ago

385
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:46,450
they decided they weren't open a file

386
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:49,539
you that pays you go Pat sort service
and

387
00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:53,789
it then quite last and and you got
something essentially

388
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,980
EMC still an you know there

389
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:00,350
trying to get in this and figure out the
strategy an

390
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:03,370
I would not want to have that
conversation my boss after a year and a

391
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:04,039
half

392
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:07,090
you know build up to their to their
product

393
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:10,370
cell back to a US ABS

394
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:14,590
and again now this is things that you
can finally honey just expect you have

395
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,380
to do it

396
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:18,539
am I mean that this this is very easy am

397
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:22,230
I think people are generally wear that
an on policies you really

398
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:25,889
brilliant I think I and but I think like
a man and no his

399
00:23:25,889 --> 00:23:29,679
many came from academia and he had a
really interesting influential

400
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,279
an series in and research and papers on

401
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:36,870
the gas in that predicament if you have
some time it's worth elected because it

402
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:37,529
is

403
00:23:37,529 --> 00:23:41,970
I'm its good staff James Hamilton if you
really want to get in the end I believe

404
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,139
ATVs

405
00:23:43,139 --> 00:23:46,830
me this guy's block because he's no BS

406
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:50,630
he's his honest ex-prime Minister
transparently i've seen

407
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:53,960
I mean he is a BP citizen little bit
salesmanship and you see a little bit

408
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,720
this with the

409
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,090
you know some press reports but in terms
of

410
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:02,110
real magnets to to places that

411
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:05,549
you're the best sources of information
for us am

412
00:24:05,549 --> 00:24:08,940
one with the SEC filing then social
security and

413
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,970
Exchange Commission filings I'm and the
other is

414
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:15,980
is an hamilton's Bob now at I should
just say this:

415
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:19,149
right now ABS has an ounce clergyman

416
00:24:19,149 --> 00:24:23,230
and if your customer there's in sinus me

417
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:27,740
and you know that the access to their
and there are findings whether that's in

418
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:31,049
and and essay 16 space

419
00:24:31,049 --> 00:24:34,240
or and unity I so that's working

420
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,759
they're not nearly as transparent an ass
they should be

421
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:41,429
and I think it became struggling with it
because then

422
00:24:41,429 --> 00:24:44,590
I think he their instinct is distorted

423
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:47,710
say as little as possible hoping he's
tie

424
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:50,799
in in on a need to know basis you know
for auditors are

425
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,600
you read it or tories answer it you know
let things out

426
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,769
but that's a problem position
fundamental things and I can even I can

427
00:24:57,769 --> 00:24:59,269
have a conversation

428
00:24:59,269 --> 00:25:02,730
if I don't know where my date are in the
US were in Ireland

429
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:06,409
by having the conversation and Canada
same way

430
00:25:06,409 --> 00:25:09,600
you if we don't

431
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,960
have and you know reasonably presentable

432
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,100
and documenting you know

433
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:20,899
practices Technologies Inc you know then
people training and so forth show

434
00:25:20,899 --> 00:25:25,129
and it causes just not gonna happen so
this for a vague staff back

435
00:25:25,129 --> 00:25:28,559
you know the availability zones in well
they're not you know they're

436

500,000 physical servers and through
Amazon

458
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:57,919
and I think that's fairly low actually
because the BBC's obviously

459
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,110
and have you know private Senate that
iraq

460
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:06,250
you know nightmare advertising at sign

461
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:10,559
okay so and then if you want that we
link to their butt back to refuse to

462
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:11,450
give an example

463
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:15,990
manana said that's where they are by by
region

464
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:20,200
saliva capacity on yeah I think it's
kinda funny to me after starting

465
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,769
looking at his I'm we having to say much
less do we get a legal

466
00:27:23,769 --> 00:27:28,059
to get get a answer the binding
non-disclosure cross our fingers and

467
00:27:28,059 --> 00:27:32,210
hope that Scott level detail we need
comments our editors and responses

468
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:35,850
and because their cat and in some ways
our commercial

469
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:39,919
and government sponsor tougher than the
government regulators

470
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,629
because I these things our guidance is
there not hard-and-fast rules

471
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:47,759
which frankly it should be I'm mitos we
started hearing

472
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:51,070
it's amazing we can find information and
makeup acid

473
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:54,490
in there and Virginia office for

474
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:57,820
pollution control or something and I got
written up for like a

475
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:01,149
him six hundred dollar fine anyway to
court documents

476
00:28:01,149 --> 00:28:05,230
in there they have all kinds of
Information Act the backup generators in

477
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,120
much the model

478
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,269
and who's responsible here who's
responsible in Seattle in unisom

479
00:28:09,269 --> 00:28:13,110
you there's a little bit a puzzle and
and this threatening the entire

480
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:16,779
and the capacity think I and number
staffing support

481
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:20,379
getting to is we spent a lot of time
looking at the end at the job ads

482
00:28:20,379 --> 00:28:24,549
there there a wealth of information
actually

483
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:29,450
because you can to find out about you
know where particular group here

484
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:32,779
are no you know where their base tan

485
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:36,749
and kind im and even hint sometimes a
month between Van to get

486
00:28:36,749 --> 00:28:39,960
half a dozen camps this them he was
interested

487
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,320
for new products coming out and
listening to this

488
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:47,190
so this acronym soup: this please
probably them the biggest reason why we

489
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:47,600
even

490
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,909
went down that road now and if you're
not clear the anarchy not had the story

491
00:28:51,909 --> 00:28:52,220
it's

492
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:57,190
and and the Obama administration at two
years ago the initial call ephedrine

493
00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:01,070
I'm iran says UK 10 to 20 percent in the
IT costs

494
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:04,259
putting in a have a counter a cloud I'm

495
00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:07,830
and so there is a you may have seen
something stories back and forth and

496
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,129
Google Microsoft and

497
00:29:09,129 --> 00:29:13,370
Amazon Grambling you know throwing barbs
back before it back who really had

498
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:14,139
clouding

499
00:29:14,139 --> 00:29:17,669
was really compliance support this
aren't so much to me but what is

500
00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:18,919
interesting is

501
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:22,730
then member agencies have high-level
agencies and critical infrastructure

502
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:23,320
there

503
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,450
this is energy this is the NSA FBI

504
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:29,879
I mean its partner Jess major
infrastructure

505
00:29:29,879 --> 00:29:33,809
there is an at conference in November in
the scene

506
00:29:33,809 --> 00:29:38,179
there's a link later where vocals and
his team presented their an

507
00:29:38,179 --> 00:29:42,399
at and compliance a contract and this
has been a multi-year process

508
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:45,480
I'm into uses a quick aside:

509
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:50,120
if any have to deal with that there's an
some misinformation out there which is

510
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:55,110
amazon has a very special at said they
sent cocoa cloud

511
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:58,860
to my cat and you have to be an name in
the US

512
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:01,879
me if you somehow related to their US
federal government and

513
00:30:01,879 --> 00:30:05,370
in and really the only difference is
they put stricter

514
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:09,399
procedures in for hiring so and 9
uniform hiring

515
00:30:09,399 --> 00:30:12,470
people there's saying that I tar
regulations

516
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:16,840
import but anyway there's some notion in
order to be with coke is my complaint

517
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,490
which is

518
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:20,490
in the Federal Space Center and and
levels

519
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:23,940
control I'm at minus reach for certain
contract

520
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:27,009
an and I seventy three things you know
to meet that you have to be in that

521
00:30:27,009 --> 00:30:28,110
special

522
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:31,370
really expensive in you know really
while guarding

523
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:35,129
it's not true I God dozens examples
where

524
00:30:35,129 --> 00:30:39,590
new compliance is absolutely consistent
across all groups

525
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:42,620
in part 11 that's that part in
healthcare spectrum

526
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:46,830
and so I'm you and that that one inch es
mas

527
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:50,309
so when we have our risk a mass am the

528
00:30:50,309 --> 00:30:53,309
sometimes as much as much a month they
say

529
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:56,539
where my day hatchback adapt me see it

530
00:30:56,539 --> 00:31:00,070
me see your back at miss you people
straining am

531
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:03,440
if somebody says they maintain
University Chicago whatever

532
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,889
and University Texas I wanna see the
Diploma

533
00:31:06,889 --> 00:31:09,789
if we have physicians on staff they
wanna see the board certifications and I

534
00:31:09,789 --> 00:31:10,889
see that a promising

535
00:31:10,889 --> 00:31:14,009
the really do then and said its you
don't

536
00:31:14,009 --> 00:31:17,470
you know you know a try for these people
and in certain meaning

537
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:21,440
into and by the same token we're and
with the press room

538
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,809
critical consumers kept simmers
acclaimed it's sort of like

539
00:31:24,809 --> 00:31:28,179
okay well that's interesting outlets in
more detail so

540
00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:31,210
I'm this is awesome

541
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:35,049
any customer again just to show parents
Digital Realty Trust

542
00:31:35,049 --> 00:31:39,629
how you know that name yeah there were
the most important companies on earth

543
00:31:39,629 --> 00:31:41,330
for technology

544
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:44,999
this is such great these guys going

545
00:31:44,999 --> 00:31:48,379
and do really boring things may go in in
the US

546
00:31:48,379 --> 00:31:52,409
and in Asia and in and in Ireland

547
00:31:52,409 --> 00:31:56,399
and that get the big burly guys with the
concrete foundations and put this lapse

548
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:56,850
at

549
00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:00,840
and figure out how the plumbing works
merely applying and the electric lines

550
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,320
and all the local permits

551
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,179
zones in dealing with it citizen action
words making sure no

552
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:09,669
you know have any impact on my millions
when I think and they do a lot in the

553
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:10,529
past

554
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:14,669
you know building infrastructure the
biggest client Amazon Google

555
00:32:14,669 --> 00:32:19,360
and down an apple in their multi-billion
dollar company

556
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,309
so may bring up these days and basically
to spec so you can say

557
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:26,340
I want you know some me make a wise I
want

558
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:31,039
I want 15:05 a linesman the Senate
building 15 on the west side

559
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:34,440
if this was cut with a backhoe we're
still good I want three different

560
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,559
substations

561
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:39,309
1 I'm site wanna go further out and
third when you know some rest they can

562
00:32:39,309 --> 00:32:39,960
do that

563
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,249
they literally partner with local power
utilities to add more and

564
00:32:43,249 --> 00:32:48,110
you know electrical grid I mean that's a
highly specialized think

565
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:51,129
but they also are publicly traded
company between

566
00:32:51,129 --> 00:32:54,139
everything they do and the biggest
client it on the record

567
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:57,720
so it you know whenever there's an

568
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:02,100
it's a bit more than and working one run
in california and some new data center

569
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:02,820
roping

570
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:06,350
two years earlier if you look at the SEC
filings they talk about

571
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:09,919
you know Care Act appliance hear their
dresses here's the

572
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:13,740
properties that we put up for the bank
for you know credit line 24

573
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:17,340
and I'll same here auerbach Devonshire
place Ashburn Virginia

574
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:21,419
dc1 auerbach and you know LA West

575
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:24,730
are trying and Westwood Wester something
like that you know

576
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:28,100
which is there you know Amazon West I'm

577
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:31,249
awesome if you're an analyst I'm

578
00:33:31,249 --> 00:33:34,429
so they have some these I'm not sure
people are familiar

579
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:37,820
with Canada the distinction between
their edge at work in that

580
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:42,440
their core computer I'm it seems like
every week they got additional capacity

581
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,139
for

582
00:33:43,139 --> 00:33:46,259
your content distribution network I'm
and those are fairly

583
00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:50,419
and well at least to the city in the
world their transparent me on that

584
00:33:50,419 --> 00:33:54,769
you can you let them are taking term

585
00:33:54,769 --> 00:33:59,389
cell I'm Direct Connect much for folks
who from a US madison's

586
00:33:59,389 --> 00:34:02,610
actually really clever this this new
technology developing the Virginia

587
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:03,139
office

588
00:34:03,139 --> 00:34:07,169
I'm aware that I sell really hard to
find out phone numbers and addresses

589
00:34:07,169 --> 00:34:11,250
at their offices bank big win in Seattle
are I mean that's easy

590
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:14,429
that you know where the developer said

591
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:18,000
where do those things get built well I'm

592
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,909
its it kinda clusters by product
actually

593
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:25,140
its little bit unsigned int and there's
an

594
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:29,000
miss a great and turn

595
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,659
I benefits and a rant or

596
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:36,570
you know not sure exactly how you refer
to it but and

597
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:39,720
there's a guy I was with the senior
engineer am

598
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:43,400
and im signing six years showing when
are we going

599
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:47,300
three years ago he read internal memo to

600
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:50,429
what he thought was his friends on
Google SERPs inside

601
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:55,610
in fact you get commissions public and
so there is some really can staff back

602
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:59,230
the only basis in dealing with am you
have a product group work how the

603
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,360
mindset is

604
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,840
just the grind I'm end the inning

605
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:08,120
Canon chaos and that 61 corporate
culture

606
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:11,470
it's a fascinating read at an anyway

607
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:15,790
the Amazon's incredibly flat at I didn't
go to any pains to get or chart because

608
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:16,890
it wouldn't matter

609
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:20,940
people can argue all the way up to Bay
Sands I'm still

610
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:25,460
You Think You Can idea make get back I

611
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:30,380
it's a painful painful processes and
understood

612
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:34,500
because SMB put in japanese nurses jobs
pre-match to

613
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,420
wake up in the morning dress in South
namely presentations and does that

614
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,290
really well

615
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:42,860
his last time I'm so reckoning when it's
when their products

616
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:46,400
and what about the Virginia group I'm
where

617
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,360
you can there early if you've got and
colocation

618
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:54,310
at Equinix which by the way that's a
rather major

619
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:58,230
it's not a secret people in and
networking Rebecca next the future

620
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,270
presents pay

621
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:01,900
I think a lot of people didn't realize
that the really really tight connection

622
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,920
between connecting

623
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:06,000
in Amazon one of the reasons that

624
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,450
Amazon was able to bring up seeing a
corporate sample so quickly is because

625
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:13,350
there directly tied in the in the last
five yr that I mean

626
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:17,220
submarine fiber from ethnics well you
know when you can't main competitors

627
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,770
going to millisecond

628
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:22,190
latencies and you can you in six that's
pretty compelling

629
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:25,980
I'm at it is it's a weird relationship
because

630
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:29,610
and you know an extra toward a little
bit with

631
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:32,700
cloud can you think that they think not
answer what they do really well as

632
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,770
comply time

633
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:37,160
keep than you know ninety-plus different
ISP's going

634
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:41,440
and keep this you know pipe set up all
the time and they're going as well

635
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,970
you I am if you can locate any data
centers

636
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:48,920
you plug in an you got you know since
nineteen to their

637
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:52,160
and to their maximum

638
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,860
so Simon Cancer confirmed at that

639
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:59,640
and

640
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:03,800
yen so that physical controls processing
and technical

641
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,340
if this is something if you're in an
industry am

642
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:11,650
that is regulated or if you just we
don't care any really want to understand

643
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:16,420
how you know it to what extent they
kinda pic

644
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:20,180
and their systems in place to maintain
order am there's actually three or four

645
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,050
white papers

646
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:24,380
and where they land internees in detail
actually I'm

647
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:27,760
you know the boarding process there your
name you imply process

648
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,960
I'm journeys in details about the and
separations and

649
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:36,310
I'm in kind and metaphysical much
partying at work it's

650
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:39,490
it really is and 13 so

651
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:43,580
and you know what our readers my first
question asks

652
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:47,780
like Europe tiny part mine bigger
problem

653
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:51,310
but you saw something for me so if we
interest you are with

654
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:54,550
with our data the me knowing that a lens

655
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:59,150
well Amazon doesn't give tours main game
at precisely one

656
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:02,460
came with their own ardor and scan and
who wrote this

657
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:06,020
giant report in bring someone from sSAE
16

658
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:09,430
answer case which is replaces the old
sas70 Malik

659
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:12,700
American and it's basically
infrastructure and data center

660
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:16,850
am 10 you can't can standards

661
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:21,370
I'm so just a few details

662
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:25,780
they don't do blades I'm this contract
Hamptons bonnets been

663
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:28,930
happen from by civil engineers your
donations

664
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:32,430
these are fairly clunky generic white
box I will not now

665
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:36,180
naturally lightboxin you have no idea
but my buttons and

666
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:40,550
might be down my BHP I might be so
graphics exit for the largest I'm

667
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:43,710
until about a year and a half ago seven
percent the machines work

668
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:46,750
STI and manufacturing

669
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:51,670
genetic he seems 30 service car accident
it's not dance

670
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:56,330
I'm I i havent picture on this one but
they usually things now

671
00:38:56,330 --> 00:39:00,120
upper deck switcher got on with its way
to look like a giant

672
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,950
trash can contract came and trash

673
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:07,620
anti-communist these things better like
outside buildings and mass transfer the

674
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,710
tracks the whole thing you know

675
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:13,530
there shipping containers that even on a
fine you know uniforms I shipping

676
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:14,340
containers

677
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:17,420
that and make a comeback tracking
anywhere

678
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:20,970
I'm so that's made it even trickier and
their

679
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:24,660
didn't holla on

680
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:28,490
there's three locations in Oregon I'm I
can get there

681
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:31,610
more information people actually anyway
those were

682
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:35,300
nearly and completely per tix the
meaning of the words

683
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:39,010
you know kind of it's like when this
portable storage buildings on wheels

684
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:42,920
and you know is pre-wired up to happen
when you go

685
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:46,240
and the power consumption these things
it's all over the court they do have a

686
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,940
complex in these next two major

687
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:51,700
an you know major waterfall cell and as
I said

688
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:55,870
here let me see to East am we gotta for
each in their data centers

689
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:58,950
am except and

690
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:02,060
except in Tokyo thats been

691
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:06,040
much trickier public opinion and speaks
Japanese doing this research but

692
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:10,000
an very very

693
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,930
beefy security and United by metrics him

694
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:17,280
KJ name you know to mint white mist

695
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,800
and to rethink this was kindly eric s
seen this guy cranks cable map

696
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,980
this is the underworld in this is the
turn the International

697
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:30,060
core am yet you know so many can cables

698
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:33,390
net and top ISP's in global exchanges
used I'm

699
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:36,620
I thought I had a second many and men
with me but there's

700
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:40,370
mash this with their data center
locations you can actually see

701
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:43,910
you know how far out they are on the way
it's not worth

702
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:47,040
flannel pant I'm if you're

703
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,080
a network and if you really care

704
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:54,760
you can it's been a week on this staff
and again this information go out there

705
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:58,250
and public and private peering I'm then

706
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:01,730
you know who who has privileges

707
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:05,610
what their where the addresses whose
contacts are

708
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:09,050
I'm I would never ever actually right
activity

709
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:12,680
some spammer something we try to go in
like you know yes great day

710
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:15,890
phone numbers for these guys kiss would
be all not night

711
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:19,400
good am but this is that a complex link

712
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,620
have every major ISP in all exchange in
the world

713
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:27,180
and it ties and directly to their CDN
and to the whole engine at work

714
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:31,480
an and this is this is one site you can
surprise me with that there's

715
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,920
several others like this anticipated all
all the time

716
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:39,020
and a lot of times informs you see
things like

717
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:43,210
and trying to get in a key I prom in my
meaning that thing figured out

718
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:47,030
and getting air the CAS can connect to
you

719
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:51,840
you know eighty excommunication Inc you
know and yes and mr. Obama

720
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,880
a recent entries appear here as I can
you know

721
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:00,610
and thats that scantron and

722
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:04,390
this is going to be an and written Pines
papers Astana

723
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:08,520
index is really good I'm I don't know if
if I mention early many times their

724
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,760
security sign

725
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,220
I'm and 2009

726
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:16,920
and 9 2009

727
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:21,310
their CISO kind guided the FBI's

728
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:25,240
man cyber crime unit Mason anyway
because I was going

729
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:29,050
was kinda bank by an by and I miss a
couple months ago you know

730
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:32,830
call I'm so I am her they're still
hiring

731
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:35,870
he was on Dec 23 and their best guys am

732
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:39,370
and working to ensure on time so I got
much more

733
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:42,870
details five pictures and me we should
through

734
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:47,160
open at and if it makes sense

735
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:51,510
as I said it's been a project for and
then you can hang out by the way

736
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:55,340
the things you say is the punchline all
this is and

737
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:58,610
this isn't like an you mad me
advertising

738
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:01,650
ever been when the outcome to this was
our group was able to

739
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:05,790
take to use am their public
infrastructure

740
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:10,570
and a way that in one for sinn fein
industry

741
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:13,860
times we can we can right now bring and

742
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:18,400
infrastructure up its forgot I am fully
qualified prequalified self documenting

743
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,670
and by that I mean you know isn't it he
said correctly

744
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:25,860
how much lag is there to have a best
connections and yes me from the chaos

745
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:26,500
monkey

746
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:30,860
you know I Netflix gas market society
and you know if if you say that year

747
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:35,020
back resistant air mane and tail your
the best we actually

748
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:38,310
make it happen yesterday you know
programming

749
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:41,900
pragmatically kilns and

750
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:45,150
at random members some percent sure you
note in a you know

751
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:49,220
March Questor kill and and everyday see
what happens

752
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:52,220
it's there you know its kinda gets the
Internet %um

753
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:55,760
separates the man tree from you know
then

754
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:02,600
the Buster I'm meant anyway

755
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:06,410
the toughest auditor I've ever had

756
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:10,630
spent prior week on this model and
basically came back in San

757
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:14,220
I can't find a problem with it when
things we do in our contract with a

758
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,700
client say

759
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:18,900
after the state is that you have to
destroy data yet physically shred it

760
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:22,360
yet insurer net things aren't ample

761
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:26,910
so we have to worry about that we have
to worry about

762
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:31,530
and whatever doing nothing wrong but
some guy in his car located

763
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:34,590
you know one want every damn is yeah

764
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:37,850
bestie for porn and gambling or
something can if it's coming

765
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:41,190
you take the equipment when the US in
the pricey and India

766
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:45,160
and Patriot Act your ISP's not even
obligated to inform you

767
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:49,340
and so sometimes and there's marking
things like this so we've addressed

768
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:51,460
that's one way to do that is

769
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:54,650
you know you do and striking picture you
keep the keys are

770
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:59,500
and of cloud and you but yeah I think
today there's going to be a certain

771
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:00,610
level trashed

772
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:03,920
has been touched by his noodly and
bonobo is rather

773
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,650
and that big reveal in December of last
year

774
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:10,880
well as an XML am and

775
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,120
so the signature tackle and in love
singer attack problem

776
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:18,330
they got great API speaker built-in
everything media so when there's a

777
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:20,090
fundamental security for like that

778
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:23,470
and in you it can be painful to mediate

779
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:27,100
am so anyway and we wrap

780
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:30,370
I am obligated to know in the a unity

781
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:35,290
Amazon on my company and and have an
answer questions and if you miss me

782
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:42,290
things yes

783
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,980
so you you're seeing the hwy you

784
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:53,340
encrypt your data in Amazon Web Services

785
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:58,090
but the is it doesn't resign in memory
on the machines or

786
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:01,170
I don't understand how you would do this
so

787
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:05,890
of and then the that's why I would never
put anything on the cloud because

788
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:09,460
picture Dec can always obtain the data
an

789
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:12,560
beginning depart with a pitcher at Peter
tact

790
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,590
thank the the government can always
access to data so

791
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:19,420
I would could never put anything in it
in the club right

792
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:23,109
show internationally if if it on my
whole volume

793
00:46:23,109 --> 00:46:27,170
encryption and it's gonna be time and an
ass and my clocks

794
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:30,450
I'm and you know

795
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:35,100
KS kitchen is put on a beat I'm and for

796
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:40,740
that Davis I things with applications i
think is best but I think on reboot that

797
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:42,619
machine has to do with your sis call out

798
00:46:42,619 --> 00:46:46,060
after token and if not I look at is

799
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:49,330
this game Jan anything interesting it's
an SSL connection

800
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:53,820
am chill presuming at you know at the
risk

801
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:57,320
man middle attacks fine take my drive
take the whole server

802
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:01,230
its I get the key in its United applying
the cryptic

803
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:04,320
the implication for that is really hard
there's a

804
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:07,990
coming Colin stratos thats and I got
louder seconds guys if they're open

805
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:10,290
source temple on the product I think
they mean actually

806
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:13,730
and hangs on SourceForge actually am has

807
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:17,119
this mechanism I'm many unisys

808
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:22,430
one chance to many there is a level of
trust do you trust me there's no I'll

809
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:27,200
you know when when statements made in
federal government in the NSA

810
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:31,140
and the FBI NSA you know be

811
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:34,160
technically disallowed on

812
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:38,230
McKenna monitoring that concert punches
through

813
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:41,660
well okay but that's one risk

814
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:46,520
so what are the risks if you buy that
new stuff to worry about

815
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:49,600
a tendency you have to worry about
Christ I

816
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:52,910
in on these things and Eunice that the
Holy vs

817
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:57,810
the last box for engine it's in storage
I don't know why

818
00:47:57,810 --> 00:48:01,010
at this point for serious applications

819
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:04,090
it's not clear not relying on you CBS

820
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:08,380
all the architecture guidance is using
I'm I know that people are

821
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:12,410
this religious wars about this weekend
back if it's instance pay storage

822
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:15,790
I'm and you penis like this

823
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:19,380
growing too by the way Amazon doesn't
finish like this between users

824
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:23,550
any they got some kind and gonna head
unit of card

825
00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:27,930
I'm even if you know it can go faster
you pippen already and I think

826
00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:31,760
it it's like limited governor the
comment it sounds like a software

827
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,280
governor

828
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:35,560
I L if you pre-initialized- yes

829
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:40,150
it's something like 35-40 percent I'll
improvement so there's some things like

830
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:40,580
that

831
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:44,380
where yeah I wouldn't ATVs because
you're in Giants and

832
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:48,170
I'm I do storage and do the traditional
description

833
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:52,050
am that check comes in the time if the
key is not down

834
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:55,250
and I'm you know it doesn't matter in
for monitoring and

835
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:58,500
a mean thing I find you know an online
colonel

836
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:02,470
so William I actually they came in with
my ex

837
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:07,800
their your version partly because it's
fine I can handle sent to ask

838
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:11,740
bank balance Red Hat and that helps with
some we know when things like 40

839
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:15,780
penalty I'm badass like as you know it's
the GPL

840
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:18,840
%uh I'm anything she mention

841
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:22,470
home at the in the Commons

842
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:26,810
am in his arm and lectures

843
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:30,109
planks has never been released at a time

844
00:49:30,109 --> 00:49:33,450
its TPL so what you doing something
can't

845
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:36,810
online and you can get a package in time

846
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:40,760
you get between knowing interactive
script tight you don't mind

847
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:44,500
that's annoying and multiple levels
because

848
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:49,550
thing but song

849
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:52,830
we're dancing in design annex yes

850
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:56,320
full source code is going to be online
tonight after

851
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:59,320
conference and get having

852
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:04,020
attack would say that these are all got
back to sell

853
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:07,790
there's no you're not being license
issues

854
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:11,780
and on the order three factors that
young

855
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:15,490
