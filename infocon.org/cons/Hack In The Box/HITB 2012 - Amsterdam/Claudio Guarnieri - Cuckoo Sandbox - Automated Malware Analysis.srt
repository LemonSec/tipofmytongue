1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:08,040
the yo

2
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,890
we're going to talk about me member and
not don't give a brief introduction what

3
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:30,550
that means

4
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:36,050
so we have some problems that we have to
pay when you have met with my

5
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:36,920
grandmother's

6
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,430
well into alert to Matt so we can go up
through with them at all

7
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:43,950
and doing metal analysis takes a lot of
time trialling

8
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,050
so you have to go deep in the reverse
engineering and stuff like that and can

9
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:48,320
but we always do that

10
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,080
depending on what the research to do
with their policies you

11
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,750
and we'll send you an hours worth from
schools that

12
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:00,400
and you have to face sleeping bag may
learn to bring back a situation you

13
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,210
can't base back

14
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,460
one more big so many fine go do
something that it can make things more

15
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:05,040
difficult

16
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,300
and will perform dynamic analysis Manali
its gonna you use word

17
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,080
so we can automated and we see that
solution in the sandbox

18
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,260
so what are the pros a

19
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:20,470
running a sandbox or running for
automating Miller analysis

20
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:23,520
all we can to make the whole process
most the times

21
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,380
you can process i volumes of malwares

22
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:33,170
and that help you out facing what's out
there is you'll be told by anyone

23
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:36,990
so wants to normalize the results are
consumable to

24
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,070
normal users which are not properly in
our analysts Nyssa Snelling so that's

25
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:41,590
very good

26
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:44,790
you get the actual executed code so

27
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,850
if you run a marina environment live
then

28
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:48,960
yeah you what

29
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,710
have them

30
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,280
bring it back what the Maori does get
like

31
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,740
so commercial solution orderly very
expensive which was one of the reason

32
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,870
West under the project

33
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,930
but first I was just doing a good enough
for buying a sandbox

34
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,730
myself so the photo just build one and

35
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:08,190
another program that is that some
portions of the Maori good could not be

36
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:08,840
executed

37
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,800
so you probably won't see all the
capabilities of the Maori but just what

38
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,330
it does

39
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:18,270
under specific situation environment
could be detected of course

40
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:22,690
scenes Charlie instrument analysis
environment you leave some traces and an

41
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,180
hour could probably find them

42
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,330
and try to spot that he's running on a
not

43
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,640
more money environment and you could
terminate or older than ours is

44
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,880
bring around the results and it's
difficult to

45
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:40,730
success with made exploit analysis a
mainly because exploit target different

46
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:41,320
type of

47
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,360
publications different versions
obligations and you can always recreate

48
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,000
all the possible so all the possible
environments world Mallard

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
the next what good successfully run and
wasn't for long thing that we don't

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,590
proper consumption of the results it
gets useless

51
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,680
so you don't want to have a bunch of the
XML files

52
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,920
stuck somewhere we don't know me
actually possible to

53
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,110
puree them or research upon them and I
could do some proper consumptions

54
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:10,720
that's a very good point so when we a

55
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,720
for you to deploy apps and books about
the way the system

56
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,160
there's some things that we have to take
care of you need to keep our your

57
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,320
requirements your expectation at months

58
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,650
soon the proper planning on what do you
expect and what you want your some books

59
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,519
to do with the above information in one

60
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:31,430
from your my our analysis YouTube signed
a deal

61
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:35,000
new environment carefully so you're to
prepare

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,200
everything a fun so that you could go
over as most scenarios as possible

63
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,670
so we'll need think about working style
which version of

64
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:48,030
softer installing things like that and
of course as I said we need to design

65
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:48,959
implement

66
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,060
a proper use I of the day then the
results again generated

67
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,590
and in eventually integrate them some
larger framework or some pretty

68
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:59,850
intelligent framework that you're ready
yet so that you can actually get a

69
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,790
proper use of the results for December

70
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,990
generates 3 to ask yourself some
questions

71
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:08,500
crucible why do I need a sandbox to
actually do

72
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,740
for what reasons why organization need
to analyze my words

73
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:16,330
and the for important to understand
before starting designing and deploying

74
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:16,959
1

75
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,280
what do you expect to achieve so what
they're going for making you looking

76
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:21,900
forward

77
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,039
are you looking for not only sporting
botnets

78
00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:28,340
are you looking for I don't know find
new exploits

79
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,680
or whatever need to know in advance so
that you can prepare the whole

80
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,360
environment in a proper way and as I
said what information is most relevant

81
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,849
in Europe americanization

82
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:42,430
and who's going to consume the results
in what for

83
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:46,460
so is it going to be a morale alice is
gonna be on IT security guy

84
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,310
is gonna be job in or around them
analysts it doesn't know anything about

85
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,110
think both of

86
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,539
to any no was going to use in order to
better

87
00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:59,890
prepared the results in a consumable and
that's exactly

88
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:05,510
the are questions of course no one to
analyze PDF exploit want to live off

89
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,250
base exploits going to live

90
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:12,050
PHP auto typer scripts don't analyze
browser exploits

91
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,570
a would also want to live so

92
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:19,520
nor did through if you know in advance
what you want analyzing you can

93
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,140
preferred

94
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:24,630
Marmon properly so you can choose okay I
want to run PDF exploit so the most

95
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,410
exploited version about a reader is

96
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:30,760
there is some going stop these on on a
gas environment as well as for the outer

97
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:36,090
they both exploiting document the wanted
from communicate with the

98
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:40,500
with outside we want to isolated want to
emulate the networks with that

99
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,560
it doesn't go outside and do shootaround
network but still I can see the

100
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,890
the the communication to does these are
all things that issue

101
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:53,320
to consider think this if you're going
to talk about Google Sandbox

102
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:59,160
a which is basically a out with mahler
know the system never developed its

103
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,690
I am so pincers

104
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:07,390
he make mailing makes use every position
armies

105
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:12,419
fairly easy to use an extremely easy to
customize and yeah every single piece of

106
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:13,260
its officers

107
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:18,150
so we can to be modified and do whatever
you want with it a little bit of history

108
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:22,099
so it started as a Google Summer of Code
2010 project would be on it

109
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:26,050
project and I started as a student and
the Sun

110
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,680
that same year we participated with that
your juice agreed innovation grant we

111
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,770
didn't win at No Script

112
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:34,289
when it but that we produce a bit again
in 2011

113
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:38,500
Google Summer of Code know we open mat
where the film which is our website

114
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,700
that acts like up front and love the

115
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:46,150
sandbox in the back but you can submit
my wearing that results back

116
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:49,520
then we are producing bedding and again
this year in Google Summer of Code

117
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,580
and we're essentially won the first
round of the repeat something

118
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,409
magnificent 7 program

119
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:57,810
with you still running by the way so if
you have any project that you would like

120
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,200
to see supported you can go to that
website you will find all the

121
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,930
information

122
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:05,190
so what can do we can the analyze

123
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:09,520
you know into the cubital PDF documents
basically any kind of thing

124
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,909
you could imagine if you can scripted
properly

125
00:07:12,909 --> 00:07:16,469
you can be fully customized do whatever
you want so we'll see later with the

126
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:20,070
module some things we can right then run

127
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:23,560
and can easily be integrated with larger
frameworks or

128
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:29,969
are a type of environment storage use
that the US that could be used

129
00:07:29,969 --> 00:07:33,140
the doubling from HP generates saw 9 in

130
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:37,440
degenerates a trace of the the article
spinning being bought by the miller

131
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,520
on the drop it file so the files being
created on the file system or deleted

132
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,890
in a bowl system some screenshots up
that's the

133
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:48,640
all I want my route-running the net for
traffic dome

134
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:53,159
and some reports some crimes impressive
Reaper

135
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:56,339
is still unstable so when I'm sure when
I'm gonna show a few days out

136
00:07:56,339 --> 00:07:57,149
development

137
00:07:57,149 --> 00:08:01,390
willie's it's not ready yet will be bob
I'm will be really is probably soon

138
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,719
after the conference

139
00:08:02,719 --> 00:08:06,149
the sorry you gonna could expect some
members going to be worth

140
00:08:06,149 --> 00:08:09,820
I'm gonna you're putting has in
abundance

141
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:13,300
inexcusable some component to it as a
scheduler um

142
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,750
and analyser and other components that

143
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,360
are made of Adam the mixed analyzer
militantly

144
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,700
the scheduler is the main component a
it's what is a good use

145
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,640
batch old I was stuck to the pool of
mentions available

146
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:31,630
and Iran solar modules that the the Sun
book is provided to

147
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:34,990
and its 100 percent by some code

148
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:38,219
the analyzer is basically the the
component to get

149
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:42,120
thats and abuse instrument inside the
guest solute and solvent said the gas

150
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,710
run and it's basically what manage the
whole analysis process in size 13 site

151
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:51,779
the analysis environment its chosen
depending on the platform

152
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:55,790
I will say it will see later why for now
it's only for Windows

153
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:58,839
but it potentially could support other
platforms still on

154
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:02,920
working on and the Iran smattering stuff
with it

155
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:07,890
and also they have is 100 percent by and
there's to see monitor which is

156
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:11,390
basically just the law which use a
custom working library

157
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:14,910
and get seen yet been seven-member
process and it's basically what

158
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:18,570
those tracing a baby I khalsa from our
processes

159
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:22,290
a.m. he gets nicked it would be for me
birds depending on how the process was

160
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,300
created and stuff like that

161
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,930
and yeah it looks the function calls
files that are later than bars

162
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:31,230
and information gathered track and see
who

163
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:35,060
is as a set a custom um putting LaBrie

164
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:38,899
um a Los the definition of multiple

165
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:42,050
from blinds and we'll replace and what
you see

166
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:45,860
replace my computers for couple reasons

167
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,459
a the first one being that he'd it just
use one from playing with his

168
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:53,630
just the three jump and it's very easy
to detect so we didn't like it

169
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:57,070
and once you began as a set against this
by different rumblings

170
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:00,520
so for example on every um

171
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:05,010
every FBI call that we who in in from
the mines it from going to be used so

172
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:05,580
for each

173
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,779
each one of those there's a different
company which makes like to be a more

174
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:11,330
difficult to detect

175
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:15,730
in the second reason is that for I don't
know really live but basically every

176
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:16,350
time you

177
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:19,470
cook something with Marcus Peters will
also load a

178
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:22,500
yellow and seven other processes which
are cool

179
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,990
which is called to rebut yellow and it
is the content of the dealer which is

180
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:28,280
basically empty so it does not

181
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:33,320
and that's very easy to spot as well
wasn't good enough

182
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,580
so the journal execution flow the
sandbox um

183
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:41,190
its budget does from a local database I
prefer them out as if so if see if there

184
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,690
are some specific configuration and
stuff like that

185
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:47,790
launch individual mashing and then the
analyzer in further information

186
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:52,070
than the analyzer X analyzer execute on
another this package

187
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:56,500
we'll see later with that is and once
analysis completed

188
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,540
it gets the results their store it and
then their process

189
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:06,540
to create some sort of reports

190
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:13,440
that is what it looks like when you
started and I am going to show you

191
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:20,440
it works gonna show you quickly out
looks like

192
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:28,000
so for these example I will use

193
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,110
I will use a very unique and the OP

194
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:35,610
piece of malware that was submitted to
do it my website

195
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:39,600
so this is what the the Cougar there are
three looks like when you open it

196
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,040
and there is some do with you that you
can use them to submit stuff

197
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,430
so I'm gonna some meat and I'm not
worried

198
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:49,630
analysts say 25 seconds

199
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:54,220
I'm out and about the mail

200
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,620
so the task is that good know you

201
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:01,600
we can start your will send works hope

202
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,640
runs okay the resolution display

203
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:13,790
little X

204
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:17,370
3.no the be too much music scene is
launched and

205
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:21,890
now it's um installing some components

206
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:25,750
preparing the analysis environment and
stuff like that now in some seconds

207
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,960
should start that were yeah it is

208
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:34,690
a simple example stuff that they get on
my website for example I'm

209
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:39,590
o'hara so yes it is it will run

210
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:43,660
a.m. as long as the process runs or as
long as the time on it

211
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:47,250
is it so if I want to specify the time
limit for an awfully

212
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:52,750
so when people want to specify the time
out if analysis goes longer than that

213
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,400
then it the people making

214
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,040
shutdown agency now and then it's
running some

215
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:05,040
processing stuff

216
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:13,850
thing

217
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:17,320
okay

218
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:21,380
so you're um the study consummate and
now we're in different ways

219
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:24,500
you can use to meet with a common light
duty with the dividend show you

220
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,850
you can use a Python API or directly
right to the single light that the base

221
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:32,500
you can specify the file path come to
know this package

222
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,240
for you later and eventual options with
the execution

223
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,320
and now you can specify to mention that
you want to use

224
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,370
so if you have different types of
missions would be for operating systems

225
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:46,270
you can specify which one of those who
want to run the malware on otherwise you

226
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,480
can specify which operating system to
use

227
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,840
so if you're running different usual
missions different operating systems

228
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,590
surging

229
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:56,120
injustice if I which one of those who
want to run tomorrow on and then you can

230
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,160
specify a time out

231
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:03,320
and %uh priority so that there are
different modules

232
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,400
um that are the physically term

233
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,770
constitute that that's and books and
that you can customize

234
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:13,150
so there is another this back issues
there's a matching managers

235
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:17,570
and there is some processing module some
reporting module some some seniors

236
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:22,070
their noses packages a core component of
the sandbox

237
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,430
are basically just buy them places that
define old analyzer

238
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:29,420
should and the lamellar ho should
execute it and I should interact with it

239
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,770
and again completely customize it and

240
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:36,260
you can create as many as you want a
modified 12 Texas

241
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,490
men against the fine I'm usually when
you submit them our so

242
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:43,660
it gets executed on that specific test
an example is

243
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:48,480
a the basic one for executors bowls as
you see there are three functions

244
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,580
on there is a run function which is the
first one being executed

245
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:56,010
and there's a check function in a pinch
function the first one you see just

246
00:14:56,010 --> 00:15:01,400
um get the best of Bill the mailer
checks in 30 some arguments to pass the

247
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,250
time hours they can specify I don't like
the matter I want some

248
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:07,820
argument to be passed from the gum line
against this by them then it gets

249
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,650
executed

250
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:11,720
get scenic that and gets resume if the
process was

251
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,550
with a suspended and yet the returns to
process it

252
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:18,830
the check function is used um

253
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:22,380
is basically executed every second
during the analysis and you can use it

254
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,860
to specify some conditions

255
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:28,590
so for example if you want to terminate
analysis when a file was created you can

256
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,800
just laser

257
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,860
check your conditioning said that
function and then when it gets

258
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:37,510
triggered an hour this week terminate
the finish function is just the function

259
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:40,320
gets executed before individual mission
is shut off

260
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,580
on so whatever type operation you want
to do before

261
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,600
them environment gets restored

262
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,050
you can do it in that function a
slightly more complicated

263
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:53,500
example ways for example for of these
documents

264
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,460
since the basically just the same thing
instead of using the path

265
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:01,010
executed just I guess the bathroom our
impassive to

266
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:08,010
the word to office word executed
injected and was on it so from the most

267
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:15,400
again

268
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,590
three

269
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:24,590
biking its solution

270
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:39,260
good

271
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,560
okay

272
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,570
arm so for this example I'm gonna run at
your spot

273
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,830
physically since I don't want it to go
outside

274
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:51,760
and do crazy stuff from the network I'm
offline

275
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,649
and I will run a couple of scripts so
this is a simple

276
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:58,850
think the nest server

277
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:03,640
here

278
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:09,959
and then I will run just a simple HTTP
Server

279
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:13,040
so they're

280
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:17,179
running on the post and they will be a
risk visit to respond to the matter when

281
00:17:17,179 --> 00:17:19,130
he makes a mixed cement mix some

282
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:23,949
its you replace so now I can get the
simple

283
00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:30,949
which is this one

284
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,330
ok sure you out to use the with the

285
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:46,330
ok to use the Python API for example

286
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,800
so I specified both I can specify the
timeout 0

287
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:05,800
say if the second okay

288
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:15,779
executes embarks

289
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:22,779
from national its launched

290
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,070
so you can see there's these is the
agent that is executed inside the

291
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:37,240
%um and its exchanging stuff run the
malware

292
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:43,940
know we should see yeah you can see that
inmates and you know it DNS requests

293
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:47,520
who his maynes and he should be
redirected to our

294
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:54,410
locally the server know it's running in
the background

295
00:18:54,410 --> 00:19:00,010
should run for a month 60 seconds the
meantime

296
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:04,010
the post checks every check I'm every
second what's the status of the dollars

297
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:04,340
is

298
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,750
so these requests are a visit with those

299
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:11,250
and it will shut down when the agent
response

300
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:18,250
that amount is completed

301
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:25,820
okay

302
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:29,660
see a the mileage is finished know it's

303
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:34,230
processing the results than it should
have created some

304
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:37,760
some stuff so if we go to

305
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,100
and I was his birth there is some

306
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,860
some files so there's an another
configuration

307
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,900
which is created by the analyzer and

308
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:51,550
it contains some formation some options
arm

309
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:54,570
of denial is this and there is a lot
well

310
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:59,100
with nobility contain some information
on what the analyzer did

311
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:06,080
and if something went wrong stuff like
that there's a there's a binary file

312
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,710
there's a peek at them and yet there's
locked files

313
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:15,300
which are basically just see is the
files that contain API calls

314
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:22,300
it was empty and the other and there's

315
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:27,530
screenshots and the reports that are
generated

316
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:34,530
we can go to see example a report

317
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,900
yes we do next an example over HD memory
for the degenerates

318
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:55,420
on the other some basic information and
there is that a lot

319
00:20:55,420 --> 00:21:01,020
welders all the screenshots that has
been taken some very basic static

320
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,420
analysis if it's on

321
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:06,480
u32 so usual stuff

322
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,600
version information sections imports and
things like that

323
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,160
and there's a not the information so
that you know it's requested

324
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,630
the and yet %eh you requested

325
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:21,130
so in this case it was physically
checking in with the C&C

326
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:25,220
trying to retrieve some comments of
course I since I was in leading the

327
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:28,300
service it didn't get any stuff back so
did in proceeding to the

328
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,900
to the infection then we have basically
the

329
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:38,410
give real results which contains all the
chronological history of the API calls

330
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:39,070
that made

331
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:42,520
so the other times them the function
named arguments

332
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,560
if the function succeeded or not if we
doing in the value

333
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:49,940
are many times it was repeatedly people
sequential and yes they contain

334
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:50,540
everything

335
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:55,350
now we can see for example the

336
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:59,550
an example of this document

337
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:02,930
so I'm gonna use an exploit a.m.

338
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:09,930
2012 01 58 going will be over

339
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:18,909
going to modify also the dollars Becca

340
00:22:18,909 --> 00:22:25,909
so you can see the I do know this
package

341
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:29,120
a modified very simply to just

342
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,059
wait for two seconds and dump the memory
so they're different table functions you

343
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:34,779
good news insider analysis package

344
00:22:34,779 --> 00:22:37,970
their summit guys that are provided by
default versa cam

345
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:41,509
add some more plays with every table
operation include you want to run inside

346
00:22:41,509 --> 00:22:42,029
the

347
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:46,200
the analysis earlier in this case I
would just want to dump the memory of

348
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:46,460
the

349
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:52,309
over the upward while executing them our
so I'm gonna

350
00:22:52,309 --> 00:22:58,539
ahead

351
00:22:58,539 --> 00:23:03,750
exploit the you

352
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:09,820
going alone sandbox again

353
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:16,820
hope it works

354
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:32,110
no of you should pop-up here organ

355
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:35,120
so busy for the exploitation with
successful images

356
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:42,120
opened on empty document

357
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:43,809
okay

358
00:23:43,809 --> 00:23:49,220
was terminated quickly

359
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:54,290
right processing if you go again to the
storage birth there's the same

360
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:57,330
things as before. tourists a couple more
directories

361
00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:01,410
so in this case it dropped some files
for example so if we go to the phone

362
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:03,720
directory you can see everything has
been created

363
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:08,390
so when word that X for example it's

364
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:12,210
they don't let it drop so the man with
the got executed and then probably the

365
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:12,930
other ones are

366
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:19,930
just random stuff used by office and
then there is a the same stuff as before

367
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:22,300
so there's no unlock files

368
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,500
there's the Reaper its Thursday mystery
shots

369
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:30,000
and then the results of the dump memory
command the large

370
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,060
sewing demanding the Member Directory
there's to

371
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:36,990
a.m. reprocess eighty and on the right
through the process city

372
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:40,760
and then there's a timestamp when the
thumper created

373
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,910
and basically all the the memory dump

374
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:50,480
sorted by region there's

375
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:57,480
all the stuff they're see sample

376
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,520
yet so we can see for example the
command in use launched in Marin things

377
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,180
like that every time we take

378
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:07,650
different a snapshot of the memory will
create a different directory

379
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:14,170
containing all these files you can go to
see the

380
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:19,400
the Reaper in this case yet similar
thing

381
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,630
and I was like screenshots

382
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:26,180
on being created and then the proper
file so there's some

383
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:29,250
a basic getting information on the files
that are being dropped

384
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:33,260
Anya network which was known

385
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:40,260
and be around houses again

386
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:51,619
so are examples of I love this package
is that it that you could

387
00:25:51,619 --> 00:25:54,649
you create is basically anything that
you can skip

388
00:25:54,649 --> 00:25:58,289
by them so some examples of people that
have been using the sandbox

389
00:25:58,289 --> 00:26:01,339
are a beautiful example Monique line so
teachers

390
00:26:01,339 --> 00:26:05,119
created analysis package with takes a
lease to view or else spawns

391
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:08,159
Internet Explorer and pass it to your
old school open

392
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,729
so that they can see if it was an
exploding stuff like that I have another

393
00:26:11,729 --> 00:26:13,940
friend for example to use it
specifically

394
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:17,049
with Dom configuration Weapon X a
banking Trojans

395
00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:21,279
by I it's used and things like that see
created a dedicated know this package

396
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:25,349
response from a weird number memory find
the %ah said and dump the stuff that it

397
00:26:25,349 --> 00:26:25,769
needs

398
00:26:25,769 --> 00:26:31,639
a USB on it but for example that's
something I was playing with I install

399
00:26:31,639 --> 00:26:32,039
the

400
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:35,479
on importance I use be on a body inside
the the

401
00:26:35,479 --> 00:26:40,139
dollars's environment and I was checking
if he was creating stuff on the fake

402
00:26:40,139 --> 00:26:43,419
USB device and they can we create a the
to get it back for that

403
00:26:43,419 --> 00:26:47,349
with that specific types on a analysis
what is basically up to you so whatever

404
00:26:47,349 --> 00:26:49,710
you can skip it by then you can
basically do it inside their

405
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:54,080
or other type of module so you can
create

406
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,330
and use the with who the are basically
for

407
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:02,320
so they're the motion managers
processing reporting centres

408
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,619
the mission managers to simply by some
glasses that define and direction

409
00:27:06,619 --> 00:27:07,279
between

410
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:11,979
the sandbox and the utilization software
a.m. buddy full

411
00:27:11,979 --> 00:27:15,690
I use VirtualBox and it's very easy so
your bi

412
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:19,279
struck that you can use for the class
you can specify demand that you want to

413
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:19,700
use

414
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,940
and you can do with everything so are
you also do would be

415
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:29,799
VMware be KVM and stuff like that then
there are some processing modules

416
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:33,690
um basically these modules are used

417
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:36,940
the to to process the results the role
results

418
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:41,089
and to normalize them and to give some
in context of information

419
00:27:41,089 --> 00:27:45,009
and they create a whole container that
open things all their normalized

420
00:27:45,009 --> 00:27:51,019
information and analysis and now you can
create as many as you want an example is

421
00:27:51,019 --> 00:27:54,779
just a simple module that you think get
some information on the file being

422
00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:57,269
analyzed another example

423
00:27:57,269 --> 00:28:01,129
want to improve our historical results
again create a processing module

424
00:28:01,129 --> 00:28:05,399
these should work nothing injustice if
I'd API key

425
00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:08,539
and then you live inside your container
the

426
00:28:08,539 --> 00:28:12,320
a diverse unitary submit our you can do
any any kind of stuff like this

427
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,919
so you you just have access to the role
results and then you can play with it

428
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:16,399
and

429
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:22,399
normalize it over to someone else is up
on it and scripted I am going up

430
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:27,190
seniors I am to physically see you there
sorry I can't buy them classes

431
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:30,669
and them our use a

432
00:28:30,669 --> 00:28:34,729
for looking for at specific events so if
you don't know if you're running a lot

433
00:28:34,729 --> 00:28:38,450
of matter and you want to find a
specific type what i love. mentors

434
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:42,979
specific type information a.m. then you
can create a scene third that

435
00:28:42,979 --> 00:28:46,649
find some condition that is executed on
the results

436
00:28:46,649 --> 00:28:50,089
and if this condition match that it
means that it's something you want to

437
00:28:50,089 --> 00:28:55,129
you but deeper look at is very I think
it's very useful

438
00:28:55,129 --> 00:28:59,479
so I'm of course you can assign a
description of severity level and stuff

439
00:28:59,479 --> 00:29:00,039
like that

440
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:04,179
and it's very useful because it gives
context the reports so for example if

441
00:29:04,179 --> 00:29:04,710
the

442
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:08,909
your users are not properly technical
the long maybe don't understand what

443
00:29:08,909 --> 00:29:13,469
these FBI cool or that API call means
from a huge perspective giving a

444
00:29:13,469 --> 00:29:14,179
simulated

445
00:29:14,179 --> 00:29:18,139
gives a brief description what that is
its but most of the times were useful

446
00:29:18,139 --> 00:29:19,769
for them so they understand better

447
00:29:19,769 --> 00:29:23,789
what the level maliciousness of Maria
run is

448
00:29:23,789 --> 00:29:27,190
and Mia I i cant use

449
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:30,210
also for good email alerts for example
so for

450
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:34,339
I'm for personally interested in thank
intrusions and mean

451
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:38,489
exploit and stuff like that I created
some theaters and whenever my some books

452
00:29:38,489 --> 00:29:39,049
at home

453
00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:42,320
runs into one of those I get an email
saying

454
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,570
babies these military you specifics yet
there so I want to be a bit deeper look

455
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:47,129
at this

456
00:29:47,129 --> 00:29:50,799
an example of a co-author the

457
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:54,499
very basic um uses

458
00:29:54,499 --> 00:29:57,759
people one is included as an example one
can write some

459
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:01,339
just checking if created some X

460
00:30:01,339 --> 00:30:04,409
Expendables on the filesystem the %um

461
00:30:04,409 --> 00:30:07,859
running through all the files been
created in CI extension is 2x

462
00:30:07,859 --> 00:30:12,259
than in the standard triggered I specify
to severity level he's too

463
00:30:12,259 --> 00:30:16,979
a description in the name something more

464
00:30:16,979 --> 00:30:21,569
specific for example want to move for
PDF documents that loads

465
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:25,309
the embedded Flash Player but that would
probably mean that it's running at the

466
00:30:25,309 --> 00:30:29,379
I'm flush exploit so you agree that you
see it there

467
00:30:29,379 --> 00:30:33,329
visit by the name and description the
summer level 23 with you hi

468
00:30:33,329 --> 00:30:36,569
and yeah I'm checking if the

469
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:41,009
physically that the following runs a PDF
or not

470
00:30:41,009 --> 00:30:44,749
I'm going through all the processes
check if the process name is

471
00:30:44,749 --> 00:30:48,649
actually occur but reader and I'm going
through all the API calls

472
00:30:48,649 --> 00:30:52,809
check if the API call Lisa load library
yeah and I'm going through all the

473
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:54,579
arguments of these API calls

474
00:30:54,579 --> 00:30:57,659
and check if they learned their lottery
been loaded is I'll

475
00:30:57,659 --> 00:31:01,589
labor yellow which means is the Flash
Player

476
00:31:01,589 --> 00:31:04,879
embedded Flash Player it's loaded

477
00:31:04,879 --> 00:31:11,879
santiago's mall example that as well

478
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:23,039
separatism gonna use i think im older in
2011 exploit

479
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:43,930
seconds

480
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:47,740
its that's without the then we can see

481
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:51,370
them and I

482
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:55,860
created this winter and slowdowns at the
system so just that the created in place

483
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,360
it in that specific directory

484
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:04,360
and then it gets ultimately executed an
actor on the sandbox again

485
00:32:29,029 --> 00:32:34,630
thanks to the people time

486
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:41,630
the PDF is open doing some nasty stuff

487
00:32:43,619 --> 00:32:50,410
but the exploited been triggered

488
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:54,160
in India and open just an empty duckman
with wrong

489
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:58,200
with inside it so that means the decks
with one

490
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,380
Tom the profit drops medal or something
like that and a

491
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:06,200
create an empty document and open it
just to give some sense that you to make

492
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:13,200
execution

493
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:26,779
I was is even

494
00:33:26,779 --> 00:33:31,369
to we go again the results

495
00:33:31,369 --> 00:33:34,739
you know about the same stuff as before
created some files

496
00:33:34,739 --> 00:33:39,989
and we can go to reports again we can
find reports been created

497
00:33:39,989 --> 00:33:43,730
so want to go through a little bit the
structure of the results

498
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,759
order normalize resort

499
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:50,259
so for example upon we also create do
some reverb people

500
00:33:50,259 --> 00:33:54,519
we've been things basically everything
that the processing modules

501
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:58,779
generated so we can see that the to see
there was triggered

502
00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:03,519
and it was at the to the the report
Spaniard contains

503
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,059
the view overall results all the PI
goals and things like that

504
00:34:07,059 --> 00:34:13,290
lineup

505
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:20,290
stuff

506
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,270
yeah

507
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:38,419
so yeah oh well all the the the FBI
coasters across the street and then

508
00:34:38,419 --> 00:34:39,389
there's a summary

509
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:43,369
so basically just very specific
information you might want to look for

510
00:34:43,369 --> 00:34:46,839
a so there's their files being opened
been created

511
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:51,589
sorry

512
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:58,589
group in temporary files Rondo my to be
read your stuff

513
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:02,730
from there is it is probably is a member
that is being probed

514
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:07,420
them free directory and then there's the

515
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:14,420
registry keys that are being opened

516
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:19,150
and you know the mood pictures that have
been open as well buddies is very useful

517
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:23,930
people want look for a specific
indicators you about very small and use

518
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:25,030
it a summary

519
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:29,000
all the files and they're bitches fees
in with ex's the tomorrow with the

520
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,930
been created so you can check up upon
that you probably find some specific

521
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,860
indicators to give you some contexts

522
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:39,590
on from our and many others say
information on a drop the files

523
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:43,810
the static analysis is empty because the
PDF I know never done it yet

524
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:48,570
30 PDF analysis component and %um
basically

525
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:51,960
yeah the files created

526
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,490
there is a debug log and the network

527
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:59,300
um activity it was just you to do stuff

528
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:05,200
and that's it if we go again

529
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:12,200
to the HTML Reaper do we should see yes
only see for example that the

530
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:15,790
theater was triggered so it's a lie I
like that as a

531
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:22,790
priority thing there is again on this we
should some files and stuff like that

532
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:35,119
three burning on the reporting modules I
i can buy them classes

533
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:39,700
a.m. the use the normalized results that
are produced by the processing modules

534
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:43,619
it take it take that for example Jason
stuff to do so inside that

535
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:48,239
and do something with it 'em they wanted
I just showed you

536
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:51,779
I just created a simple Jason file
containing all the information

537
00:36:51,779 --> 00:36:54,849
what he can do whatever you want with it
so for example with

538
00:36:54,849 --> 00:36:58,150
I my website at be there just a simple
module that gets stuff

539
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:02,400
send it over to our API to gets it and
storing but other days

540
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:07,640
or you can use for example Mongo use
another module which includes side

541
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,680
provided both saw your ad

542
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:14,329
I am at among the DB

543
00:37:14,329 --> 00:37:17,630
freedom is running locally what I was
doing now is this

544
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:21,769
and it is very useful when you do I'm
our intelligence people want you

545
00:37:21,769 --> 00:37:24,569
searchers across then I was resolved
said you'd you'd

546
00:37:24,569 --> 00:37:29,150
that you perform that it's very helpful
so we can connect to database

547
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:36,150
okay so

548
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,300
so your work for an older so they want
to run and

549
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,590
we can do some some nice I am

550
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:47,260
searches across that so we can find for
example on No

551
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:51,180
up it's a

552
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:54,750
let's see if will

553
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:58,530
I want to find all the malware for
example that use a specific API cool

554
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:03,630
so I'm going on to a fury saying

555
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:06,970
I want to see

556
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:10,780
if it created if you use a creed remote
tried

557
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:14,400
and nuclear processes

558
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:21,400
it be I

559
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:31,080
then I want to get it's a the young 25

560
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:37,410
all the men were the did it

561
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:42,060
be with the Leah

562
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:45,080
if we want to search for a specific type
of thing second search across all

563
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:45,570
channels

564
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:49,690
results not very helpful saw in study
for want to search a tunnel

565
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:53,420
which one of the men were analyzed
triggered a specific co-author

566
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:57,810
I can do the same thing so I'm gonna
search for

567
00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:01,760
'em theaters but name

568
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,859
being that's a tree a me a

569
00:39:05,859 --> 00:39:09,339
remember excerpt and I want

570
00:39:09,339 --> 00:39:12,369
get senator's name:

571
00:39:12,369 --> 00:39:19,369
and them be fine

572
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:25,789
sorry I we can you do you can do these
kind of things so these are the results

573
00:39:25,789 --> 00:39:30,420
a all the md5 with metal waste that
triggered that specific slender

574
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:34,299
so you can do this type of searches and
makes a very helpful for ass finding

575
00:39:34,299 --> 00:39:37,479
specific indicators if you're looking
for a specific Miller family

576
00:39:37,479 --> 00:39:40,809
want to look for are in line with the ex
that is being created

577
00:39:40,809 --> 00:39:45,450
for examples by I create a specific
pattern look new text can do the search

578
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:47,749
is in final display matter is that you
analyze

579
00:39:47,749 --> 00:39:51,660
to that have a big feet up man was
coming into your son looks against but

580
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:58,660
things easily

581
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:07,890
moon soft there is another thing I want
to show you which one its circling the

582
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:14,890
program but I am so as I told you

583
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:22,720
as I told you you can as a sacred
different level modules that and OT but

584
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,200
different everything's

585
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:29,370
for commercial manager for example in
this case I wanted to run Mac 26

586
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:33,250
stuff so I created a VMware a simple

587
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:39,260
and it later I would be the single
package that runs

588
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:44,210
on you more fusion so I can run mega
sick stuff but I think it's the only one

589
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:46,640
that actually reach a life make the 6
operating systems

590
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:53,640
so that's very easy I just created a
VMware module

591
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,590
and than a specified in a configuration
file

592
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:01,710
but I want to use that module for the
realization

593
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:07,110
and then I created

594
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:10,950
corporation pile specifying which we
shall mention a want to run

595
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:15,050
so this is the best a moment the 63 to
mention the platform reviews

596
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:18,980
Darlene and stuff and

597
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:23,250
you can create different type of
analyzer so able to see if the windows

598
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:23,640
one

599
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,770
but it can create darling or Linux
analyzer

600
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:31,860
a.m. we're working on having mac os x a
border but it's nothing ready yet

601
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:38,580
some gonna show you let's see if it
works so I added

602
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:42,420
the desert eagle eye that the base

603
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:49,420
I did a simple tax the sea flying that I
won't run on darlene

604
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:59,980
so yeah it takes the different mention
manager module

605
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:05,120
and up where the the VMware mmm Mitchell
mission and run it Mitchell mentions

606
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:09,830
very your you are pitching is very happy
so the exploit a lot of time to run it

607
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:16,830
any also slows down the network
communication for some reason

608
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:48,740
the started

609
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:14,020
so the agent that runs in the guest is
platform-independent

610
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:17,250
so you can run it on any operating
system YouTube run fine

611
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:21,720
and then you have to create a dedicated
analyzer that instrument the cast and

612
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,280
doing stuff specifically for that
operating system

613
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:28,320
um indicates a VMware

614
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:31,570
I just create a simple one that
basically just

615
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:35,430
a just launched a meddler and doesn't do
anything else

616
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:38,680
but is just to show you they'd actually
could do it

617
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:45,680
I'm could be instrumented to do with it
something actually

618
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:52,470
bill some reason

619
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:54,230
yeah

620
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:58,820
aka it's funny so it will be the mail or
through the home directory

621
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:01,960
and I need executed his mother was just
simply a

622
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:06,620
shell script to just be a data file on
desktop and that's it yeah but this is

623
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:07,770
just a show you that you could

624
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:10,740
according to different platforms and
running on different type of operating

625
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:11,420
systems

626
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:16,310
I am still lacks the guess analyzer
component so

627
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:19,490
you know that is filled legitimately so

628
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:23,280
some I don't get an analysis results for
mega 6

629
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,510
if there's someone here that is akin to
make the six-wheel

630
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:33,510
and we're super work on it though
reentry

631
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:50,560
so that's basically that's basically it
so um

632
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:55,060
out of these you want to create a
business look community effort so the

633
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:58,220
next thing we're probably going to do is
create a community propose the three

634
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:01,820
where people whose summit their own
modules as yours and stuff and share

635
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:02,310
them

636
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:06,360
a.m. that is very valuable so if you
create some 100 they want me only with

637
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:06,690
the

638
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:10,850
21 would probably be able to believe
there's new or we could the other

639
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:15,210
cuter than iraqgate and models and
things like that I we're still going to

640
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:17,850
expanding online I love developers and
confirm with her

641
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:21,370
there's so much stuff that we need to do
there's so much work to be done

642
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:22,470
especially on

643
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:26,970
the Watson dollars's I'd so process and
the resulting data mining and things

644
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:27,760
like that

645
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,840
and and then we want to

646
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:33,870
a pro allowing the humdinger

647
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:37,240
and try to make it up major new research
from our research

648
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:41,770
my who do research from amused research
and

649
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:44,980
there's still some some work that we
need to do %uh

650
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:49,390
is still basically I development were
used it's not public yet

651
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:53,430
I you still are human bones that would
probably be ready in the next couple

652
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:54,120
weeks

653
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:57,820
up in the long run yours good things
anyone who

654
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:01,450
we're still already working on the web
interface there will be no

655
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:04,450
upon along with the another base

656
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:08,830
%uh so will you rose weasels in the same
way as he did with it

657
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:12,990
HD Marie Bruce Peninsula run the surges
on a web interface

658
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:17,380
do some utilization and things like that
we definitely need to know who windows

659
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:18,510
and all the components

660
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:23,390
so it's sometimes is unstable especially
when analyzing complex applications

661
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:26,500
like of these documents or brother's
exploits

662
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:30,420
and things like that where nobody in
communal lines is very big very complex

663
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,380
there are a lot of warnings and things
run

664
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:35,460
sometimes is unstable so we need to
improved

665
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,680
and yeah we were like summer will be
below

666
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:42,870
raises them not just windows a Mexican
will probably be the next choice

667
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:48,050
com eventually Linux we had a product
lineups but we need them but would you

668
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:49,420
be willing leaving

669
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:52,850
lead yet and we were in really
satisfying and

670
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:56,430
but we'll you could basically implement
any kind of over existing jury

671
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:59,100
eventually Android you can create a new
leader

672
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:02,520
don't use anymore i doing reno
components and Andrew system

673
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:07,140
and likening this morning should should
work eventually and also for another

674
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:07,780
mentions

675
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:13,030
so as a sub sometimes another in the tax
increases the individual mandate

676
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:16,230
I'm I don't you were going to look
components are very you for using his

677
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:16,720
butt

678
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:20,240
up to running stuff on a new mentions is

679
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:24,640
sometimes better I should be very easy
to implement as well

680
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:28,010
I'm so that's something that we want to
do in the long run as well

681
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:33,370
II eubanks more information on these
addresses

682
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:36,520
owns the river is one is the main the
main website

683
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,770
and then you there is that he doesn't
was either you or you can find all the

684
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:40,540
first goes

685
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:43,860
both for that the sent to sell and

686
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:47,520
for the yellow and you can also buy new
my worry there

687
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:51,830
save want to use didn't think we'll ever
that we used to go by Nick Thayer School

688
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:54,940
that will buy it was more like

689
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:59,030
we keep updates members looked on as a
side is a public and

690
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:02,250
phasing and dry out it's just yeah

691
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:06,170
running setup who had only web interface
and I'll it still running on all

692
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:08,800
versions so we're gonna break it next
time with the

693
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,650
with this new one buddies ready is
working to a contrite right now

694
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:17,700
and %um was on your network so you will
find the more information we will Summer

695
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:18,320
of Code

696
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:21,540
I want to participate contribute and
things like that in a while

697
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:25,840
that here well if you have any questions

698
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:29,040
strain you wanna has

699
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,650
question I think we have to stir know
that I

700
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:35,650
buddy

701
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:39,770
thanks value for a it'll be interesting
I want to leave but

702
00:48:39,770 --> 00:48:43,820
if you want to contribute to we the quiz
solutions was a 120 said

703
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:47,430
to top Cooper said about it it or more
make company

704
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:51,380
and they want to connect it to your
mother to dot com like that is possibly

705
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:52,850
an API or does it work

706
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:56,220
yes a no actually the first idea was to
have

707
00:48:56,220 --> 00:49:00,390
to make it up Ralph kind of thing so we
have so maybe I some

708
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:03,690
use that we can give you any good luck
in your set-up and you can submit

709
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:06,820
no obvious that we receive anywhere from
as well

710
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:10,230
to the the centralized system Associated

711
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:13,570
that is possible we lost little most

712
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:18,270
you possibly the next version of my with
gum whom we'll be more structured and

713
00:49:18,270 --> 00:49:18,690
stuff

714
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:23,890
but is already possible with different
yeah I think at

715
00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:27,130
many company been me be interesting
contribute

716
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:31,600
and they're being access at the same
time at the at the data to process

717
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,710
yes so the the plan is to make burn

718
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:39,070
normalized resolves a available as I
they decide to download

719
00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:43,090
so I don't know probably up some Jason
removing the room something

720
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:46,430
or are I don't know month without or
something like that

721
00:49:46,430 --> 00:49:50,130
that you can download every day with the
latest analysis

722
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:53,630
and yeah we probably also thinking and
caring the batteries that are being

723
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:54,320
submitted

724
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:57,610
depending if the user agrees with it or
not but

725
00:49:57,610 --> 00:50:04,610
I'm still working on it so much I'm as
the most banks

726
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:13,170
I am just wanted to ask if you could the

727
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:16,720
if you examples I'll the no bettered

728
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:21,010
I'll what was it the best friend for
analysis framework

729
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:24,130
about to integrate we've because you
mention the

730
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:27,370
you can be integrated with larger for
analysis

731
00:50:27,370 --> 00:50:30,710
frameworks um yes so there is some

732
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:33,880
will for my

733
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:38,740
experience %uh losing my only job in a
home integrated with private stuff so we

734
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:39,380
have our own

735
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:43,360
systems and things like that but a.m.

736
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:46,990
we are working right now to integrate
with school a which is basically a

737
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:48,700
generator for a week he

738
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:52,190
pageviews out of the did you know these
results

739
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:55,260
this year the collective in Belgian
framework

740
00:50:55,260 --> 00:51:00,150
i think is also going to game who had a
margin for supporting no I think

741
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:04,010
that's what upward much sure but it's
very easy I mean as

742
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:07,620
any kind of infrastructure over
framework that he might have

743
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:11,460
in your company or your organization
that's very easy to

744
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:13,640
implemented just in a module

745
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:18,079
using your own API API functions that's
me the results to do what everyone with

746
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:18,440
that

747
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:21,619
it's very easy i cant reading then you
up real

748
00:51:21,619 --> 00:51:24,809
complete pretty intelligent framework
the be used for this kind of stuff

749
00:51:24,809 --> 00:51:28,609
because I'm just seem customized things
so things that have been milled

750
00:51:28,609 --> 00:51:32,660
knows I only know about your cancer
things that you can use

751
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:35,990
interesting

752
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:39,900
well good

753
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:43,289
okay so thank you very much claudio yeah
collects
