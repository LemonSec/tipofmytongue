00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,760
hi I am are from dev team leader

2
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,640
the other the team members in the
audience but I I'm on point them out

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,029
on 3i we operate that belong there

4
00:00:22,029 --> 00:00:25,270
we've had it for about 60 from 2007

5
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:29,020
rule written last four years 133

6
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,160
million busy too far arm

7
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,510
I initially with Liana different Kean
coffee

8
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:39,170
I from you week mom when he came back
and it came out

9
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,129
warned him peace plan Tom Osborne Rd to
do some jailbreak stuff too

10
00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:46,580
I was fortunate to be taken dinner

11
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,280
for this I was hacker's handbook which
account YouTube from the office proper

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,269
here this week arm I'm gonna die right
into it

13
00:00:56,269 --> 00:00:59,769
arm I'm gonna I am your own a bit but

14
00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:04,970
fun individuals who through a power bud
the

15
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:09,020
down from bro basic stuff to be expanded
family flees

16
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,049
mister and then Cebu's responsible for

17
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:15,890
cellular partner from are you talk to me

18
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:18,910
arm to talk to a tour that must be

19
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:22,900
you aren't or hi-speed USB for pursuing

20
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:27,210
network homages kind of tough to if I
catch you

21
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,090
artwork internet points draw manga

22
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,990
through did there in front of you but
you don't have to keep using

23
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:39,600
you don't have the screen menus you know
you talking to begin crashing time in

24
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,470
issues across

25
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,780
you need to use P surgery very touchy
feely

26
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:47,270
touched it now will be more difficult
for me CPU

27
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:50,750
to to work with crashes I'm but likely
does

28
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:55,510
happens saving feature where I wanted us
crash even if you use communication with

29
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,480
a 9-3 down

30
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,680
we'll see the reason for the crash Union

31
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,710
you can pull that have the next time
combo

32
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:07,100
to lobby not very detailed compared to
the IRS

33
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,590
kind of thing you don't thompson-boling

34
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,659
his a basic a system stock down
registers

35
00:02:14,659 --> 00:02:17,659
now he's well this is the 3G crash log

36
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:20,739
the beef that up a little with the with
the iPhone 4

37
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:23,959
arm lot more information on around them

38
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:28,079
ironically like this information I'm
doesn't relate to the crash

39
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:32,920
ruined to the crash handler complete
redundant and not very useful

40
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,549
but there are some bits and pieces you
can use to

41
00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:39,989
cup sugar working my pics crash

42
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:43,709
arm on treatment can be interesting
because it

43
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:47,319
a large hard actually actually cute in
place

44
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:50,709
from flash memory space arm

45
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:54,779
so they don't need and much memory and
they would otherwise

46
00:02:54,779 --> 00:02:58,950
but I think I think I feel that there's
some security reasons for keeping things

47
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:02,510
running are fashion it's not everything
flash freeze

48
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:07,349
by Tom the management around five
preceded the dark matter protection

49
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:10,689
you know for sure that it was going to
be patching your your code

50
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:17,090
who's using in Flash because YouTube
beating the compression after the no

51
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:17,689
need for

52
00:03:17,689 --> 00:03:21,739
from the future wrong you assigned a
thing so our

53
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:28,739
right execute the wrong with the
computer fashion are random of its

54
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:30,849
typically for

55
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:34,409
for things related to talk and model
problem contrition

56
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:39,329
arm there is one part 1 I've been spent
for sort of it does actually often

57
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:42,499
poem trunks been championed a black gown

58
00:03:42,499 --> 00:03:45,829
pursuant to fix a location not
constitute

59
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:50,659
learning typical embedded thing to do
are pretty good

60
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:54,239
you get informed for you to come not
meet you Apple compile

61
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,189
just and fun arm

62
00:03:58,189 --> 00:04:01,799
I'm me to read too much into things but
I

63
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:04,489
again I think there's some security
reasons for keeping things in Flash I've

64
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:05,349
actually seen

65
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:09,749
uploaded a partial to BDT parties
humongous routines

66
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:14,590
largest between you've ever seen Dustin
flash I think that more for species

67
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,199
when I'm gonna talk in the second about

68
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:24,630
market for a actually seeing from

69
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:30,520
ramp before so when I was preparing to
start guide

70
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,030
started to realize in London anecdotal
nothing on interesting thing that

71
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:34,520
happened

72
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,130
history unlocked apartment and we're
going to be paranoid about

73
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:42,910
telling you stories because in the sense
you know Appleton

74
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:47,630
known you you you found stopping you
would hope that you can come back and

75
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:50,720
I'm but here's our you something I'm

76
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,060
petitioner in first iPhone 2g

77
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,230
we found for trauma or 13 basement
updated

78
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:01,790
then actually I the were in batting
enough

79
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:05,240
in images baseman there in reading a
pretty detail

80
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,910
chain block the reasons for the basement
update and we're just human

81
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,920
read and comment and I ride

82
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,990
in their company they were

83
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:21,000
there were comments because they were
next in line McCown never used to pull

84
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,420
that compiled together but

85
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,470
still the should probably not commenting
deflect

86
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:28,830
filing so we're even

87
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:32,500
green on inside into them early mid span

88
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,530
comment left in there and who the

89
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,630
preaching at those comments themselves
in the in the exit form

90
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:42,080
rushing flash into into flash along with
russian businessmen

91
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,250
just must be some weird are in fact this
clear case

92
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:51,000
compiles further here's an example

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,410
this is why I picked a random

94
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:57,950
monomer it turned out a lot more related
to anything mixing

95
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:01,520
signal fidelity being adapted second
pretty interesting

96
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,040
to discuss often point to you that PDP

97
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,940
you know part McCown my primary to crash
in beef & Casino

98
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:15,770
their looking at themselves have proven
wrong

99
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,449
arm slanted about

100
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:21,610
there's a lot of my death for reasons to
do with

101
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:25,949
you want to test review due to the
end-user

102
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:30,610
lot owner lottery teams in the reef and
that you and I don't ever use

103
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:34,120
they're all calibration leader diagnosis
in

104
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,979
if you have a specially provisioned
advice I'm presuming you can use of

105
00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:40,750
pretty graphic like this information
from

106
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,949
congressman for your interview did in
fact

107
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:47,210
for normal phone call it stuff is
disable

108
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:50,270
missus able to tutor SIM card for some

109
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:55,100
mechanism I'll but in the end they
really just come down to flag where

110
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,110
they're not your lap to

111
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:59,870
users command yourself many and so if
you can

112
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,979
I actually helps a lot if you can just
gonna a very simple act point in their

113
00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:04,430
careers

114
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:08,180
for that one bit you don't have to do a
whole lot because once you open up that

115
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,150
whole interface

116
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:12,300
also a net increase is very rich in in
features

117
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,460
diagnosis and what you picking pumpkin
tote

118
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:19,100
into memory and all through stuff no it
really helped it doesn't

119
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:23,650
it's not very useful it wasn't for you
fall

120
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:27,510
for natural on lock career month want
them to know that we were

121
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:31,580
changing this bit we don't want that and
if it's a go away to use it for

122
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,900
development of the unlock just to make
the process a lot smoother

123
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,960
but in the end we ended up for every
like that we did

124
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,639
we were down you know distill a final
solution from an industry this interface

125
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:44,090
be

126
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:48,680
not know the reason purpose arm

127
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,090
this is one of those things that
Barnhart slide I

128
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:55,360
in actually one very nice because not
only

129
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,760
was that bad allowing you to use the
command for

130
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:03,110
the county will themselves as opposed to
being flashed there are people sitting

131
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:03,720
around

132
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,690
she could users factors to you

133
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:11,449
at ways to run your own 3-wood

134
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:15,250
you know we treat me like 45 different
core routine

135
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:19,190
that we within the factories read co-op
these command people's

136
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:22,320
use them for our own custom again for

137
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:28,800
unlocked apartment not for the final
product arm

138
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,900
this is an example of the time in vision
is very at is a very complex

139
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:38,140
entries for me its really user from the
slot more user-friendly ironically in

140
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:42,539
normally Pastrana you in Iraq ra I guess
it's because

141
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:45,990
engineer to something more work
interacting with this

142
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:50,290
entries in the field so there is no very
complex competition

143
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:54,459
because young final structure that you
could declaring it was almost like a

144
00:08:54,459 --> 00:08:58,620
on for you useful

145
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:02,459
languish in itself other might be
cumbersome to use an example

146
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,560
are are

147
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,370
I think your YouTube you're creating a
secret I guess a sequencer issues could

148
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:09,950
you want to

149
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:13,459
she goes through a bunch around to con
some

150
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:17,640
network behavior here's an example just
crooner overturn sequence

151
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,959
and I just doing silly things and then
at the end there you you do that kind

152
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:22,520
rhyme

153
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,420
you know our second was just aloof or in
person print Siemens

154
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:30,120
there's obviously much more technical

155
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,920
reason to use sequencer arm

156

165
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:14,579
ET commanders are there are 100 200
community command

166
00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:18,400
after during the baseband I'll many of
them are actually stole

167
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,650
more normal as you know in uses command

168
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:26,240
for unlocks the text arm but there are
at least %ah

169
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,690
3490 that are there and is the
prosecutor there

170
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:35,740
either disable with a simple it now an
act with they're doing is they're

00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:40,459

meant that they're using

173
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:48,709
fender they're all thrown something to
read I think that newt Apple's trying to

174
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:52,260
not want to worry about stuff from
render so they're turning off

175
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,089
are you for his command to the don't
want to have to worry about that anymore

176
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:59,190
so these are you doing and I think I am

177
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:02,230
example

178
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:06,300
if something like 540 its have a bitmask

179

181
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:19,310

these

00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:22,910
only ones are command center in the
basement picking up speed

183
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:26,420
but didn't want to have to worry about
from disablement is one

184
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,579
been for their you can use them but

185
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:33,819
ironically I can go in Giovanni men's
pants monarchs point

186
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:36,819
and clear this there is mass completely
how's your

187
00:11:36,819 --> 00:11:40,860
now augmenting their psyche tough the
command a are disabled

188
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:44,750
are would still be useful if only we
were unable

189
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:48,300
track up want

190
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:53,010
arm I'm gonna skip to the stuff because

191
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:56,900
it's been talked about before I and
another talk to mine

talking about damn

00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:59,040
fending messages in the short or long

messages to each other and interactive
map its

210
00:13:02,829 --> 00:13:05,890
it's mindboggling when you think about
gonna

to adult the snow on lockdown

213
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,829
is it to intercepts one is messages from
the critical message is we we did you

214
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:17,660
sat there

215
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:20,810
we do you know what ash were involved
with the unlocking re

216
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:24,089
we just started watching one issue we're
going to and from that %ah

217
00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:27,600
by up basically taking over the the
semaphore

218
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,600
control this message in and to stop
seeing who's calling at one point

219
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,689
so on in blue issued a security

220
00:13:36,689 --> 00:13:40,430
task in this impasse sim is just
basically the hardware

221
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:44,430
tasking interacting with with the
adoption reader

222
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:48,770
and she she is under siege so what we
have germs

223
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:52,240
is reconsidering washes message passing
and you see all these

224
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,290
now you know very obvious most being
passed from the same

225
00:13:56,290 --> 00:14:02,439
to the Security tab and when it really
matters shares as compare locked in

226
00:14:02,439 --> 00:14:05,550
and that has that header 30

227
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:08,709
30 to read it is basically we week

228
00:14:08,709 --> 00:14:12,490
when we saw that message go from the
sham

229
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:15,689
to the Street Apt we knew that the
unlock

230
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:19,579
where he was in progress answer what we
did is we must

231
00:14:19,579 --> 00:14:23,319
can't promise you this: the tiny tach
but we r

232
00:14:23,319 --> 00:14:26,980
we basically we stole that message we
sat there

233
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:31,280
which had a higher priority than
security task in re we robbed at message

234
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,910
were at the higher priority and when we
saw uses

235
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:38,079
your XD message we muted

236
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,100
and Richard both and thinking that my

237
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,880
we short term is basically the decision
340

238
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,450
summer I record is forging the results
up

239
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:52,220
would've happened if a normal unlock

240
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,800
even taken place are we will use the
exact same

241
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,839
pass through concept for the iPhone 4

242
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,360
and very first baseman for that on but
that point we started not

243
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:08,610
movement but the iPhone 4 is not always
national message in their own right

244
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:12,230
they were barely in the error messages

245
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:15,970
the new baseband we had no idea up until
that point really want to function to

246
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,660
reduce really blame them

247
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:21,680
BBC but once in a while the im view on

248
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,399
information internet to the nursery
tourist I'm

249
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:30,480
or we offer so they went through 32 at
that point the 32 attributed messages

250
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,070
which of course would never happen

251
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:35,139
and in a real medicine you never have to
worry about

252
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:38,690
somebody coming in beauty message on the
fly

253
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:41,829
but the one of em actually

254
00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:45,019
look for in the you could hear the
sending a message

255
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:48,040
ready for the response and response from
back to checking that

256
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,500
the original message is the one that
this act which will be overcome

257
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,990
for non credit system and we have
reduced by half in any way

258
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:59,000
monitor she even know any

259
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,380
called the wrong from a tamarin temper
many times X 16 different times

00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:09,240
arm ISO

261
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,600
are new topic pursuant to clause in her
are should be clearly

262
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,680
tax the monthly fees is very early on
and they were Sam

263
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,829
interposer in writing into programming

264
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:23,350
a little hardware carrier

265
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:28,139
used to coerce them into and use a
combination international simpler

266
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:31,209
from arm and what they can do is they
can

267
00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:34,380
they can sit there because you're in
between physically in the article path

268
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,620
between the sim card in a

269
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:39,579
and bitter the complete works with the
messages that are being passed their

270
00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:43,389
so obviously the baseband months ago I
think we're either

271
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:46,459
the flash on the center did saddam keys

272
00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:50,230
pingback: that mean various activities
will happen when you doing all

273
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:54,899
actor Cary network what they can do they
can for games there

274
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:57,990
and I'm so that when the very first
successful

275
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:01,620
financially successful and approach was
the term awesome

276
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,860
and I'd start around a lot line

277
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:08,750
very at that time it for few

278
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,970
for surprisingly few number of up this
the Mets fan

279
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:16,209
they did not actually fix this problem
but I'm

280
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:19,839
what happens when the scene was first
inserted to be three different queries

281
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,669
to the

282
00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:24,030
the to your SIM card for time as I

283
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:28,010
the first two weren't completely related
to churning whether or not even popular

284
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:32,510
concurring first wife which is
essentially wanna mark come down to

285
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,800
and then only the third one was actually
used to

286
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,320
negotiate with the power to you on to
the network

287
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,740
through this image from Jersey redo is
picking up the kids

288
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,850
check the new white carroll et phone was

289
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:49,889
meant to work right and they just
pretended to be that carrier for 23

290
00:17:49,889 --> 00:17:51,100
messages

291
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,120
and then when the third one was crude

292
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,120
listen to rely on a and I was reversible

293
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,240
marking after a while

294
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,360
%ah it's a very different you know a lot
companies

295
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,409
you want to profit from people wanting
to prove come out and you don't have

296
00:18:08,409 --> 00:18:09,669
enough people to snow

297
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:12,139
but they're dealing with the
fundamentally different and everything

298
00:18:12,139 --> 00:18:12,919
we r

299
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:16,020
they're doing with the same interface
which is not

300
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:19,060
iniki weary kinda small

301
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:23,520
some respected com they have a very
limited set of things that they're

302
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,990
allowed to do obviously

303
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:29,480
with the baseband out like a controlled
and the allowed to interact with it

304
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,940
we for a long time up until how 2.28

305
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:37,000
I was going to be released we are
working on a sim interposer

306
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,580
that consider playing tricks with the

307
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,620
network we're actually housing

308
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,360
be spent to crash you the next point
that we could delivered through the SIM

309
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:47,970
card

310
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:51,830
as opposed to the EP entered om

311
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:55,290
and maricon for wong within a day
Trinity

312
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:58,530
Dexter and

313
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:01,750
we sought after using a hear the message
is a man mothers

314
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:06,330
and chain partner in the basement we saw
in our hearts strongest

315
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:09,330
a big amount because they're they're
their naming checkpoint

316
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:12,570
parents whose something

317
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:16,120
the the the crash the fix for crash
before a realtor

318
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:20,030
to deploy arm

319
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:24,490
and around that time is when we stopped
in the change box to

320
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:27,980
I'll if you read the IRS hacker's
handbook

321
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:31,560
on very last chapter Israel

322
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,649
Ralph chapter on the rich man you can
pretty good

323
00:19:34,649 --> 00:19:37,840
example are going even further notice

324
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,380
from around the SIM card going offering
being the network in

325
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:45,060
in being a malicious network causing the
basement to crash

326
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,370
and then in this case you give you some

327
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:52,090
standard AT commands turn on a
microphone do remember

328
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:55,540
you shopping somebody all initiative
through

329
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:59,040
a network you doing it was hostile you
walk into

330
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:03,960
this network joined attacker from

331
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,780
arm max thriller

332
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,929
the remainder in Pakistan are related to
take not search

333
00:20:10,929 --> 00:20:15,240
to consider written Apple's

334
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,429
I'm for Connecticut is this activation
ticket

335
00:20:19,429 --> 00:20:26,429
which at the end of the day usually for
the longest time

336
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:31,830
August were

337
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:35,540
trucker hats and figure out how long as
Pinckard how long this normal

338
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:39,780
unlock code 13 we have a myspace and we
all knew that

339
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,679
every time you had a bf n you can I
don't like about this if you're given a

340
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:43,440
crack

341
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,639
Nick code from from the entire you could
into this one command in

342
00:20:47,639 --> 00:20:51,050
you go often verify that in fact knew
the secret

343
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:54,730
only time you should now ensure you can
often set this flag

344
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:58,040
so you can connect any SIM card mister
mock your permanent

345
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:02,419
mock which happened and Pierce up to
dear

346
00:21:02,419 --> 00:21:06,230
meter hard are so there is all this
coming

347
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:10,360
300 on for a lil bit of code is there
the peace man

348
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,520
and you know we could see her fishing on

349
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,800
show the compound going on but at the
end of the day

350
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,570
turned up all the time no matter 3G

351
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:24,620
on they were completely ignoring the
result

352
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,649
even if we brute force to the new

353
00:21:27,649 --> 00:21:32,020
Hamaki wouldn't have done any good
because speedy

354
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:35,080
didn't simply accept a be found from

355
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,780
Infini in the modified in this case the
modified it to ignore

356
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:42,800
any successful one of the experts will
be

357
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,040
ignore it but the effectively ignore

358
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:50,090
but they don't want to do instead is
something very different activation code

359
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:53,690
and very tree unlike a permanent unlock
because

360
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:57,320
arm if for some reason you're suffering
to your isolated from the earth

361
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,570
from Apple when you power up your phone
arm

362
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:05,010
and you're just you're just restarted
are even if you

363
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:09,870
on a time before that had been on lock
or even talking here on lock carrier

364
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:14,300
you have an activation to do you know
all our communications kind of you don't

365
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,780
get to talk to anybody 20 Activision too
good

366
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:21,460
exists and all I found oMG and they're
just

367
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:24,610
basically the only differ is up

368
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:28,300
the table that are not to get and you
can just added

369
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:32,060
it is a tax file in the anchors
everything can be reduced to

370
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,580
populist without if you can often

371
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,820
and a text file which is in fact editing
a binary

372
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:43,389
but you can't change in orbit early
because scientists using standard

373
00:22:43,389 --> 00:22:46,690
I'm am public key encryption stuff to
make sure that

374
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:52,560
to be stranded people to tactic tampered
with the ticket

375
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,919
and so you know up onto something the
day there

376
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,100
activation servers in our from the cloud
big of an issue the ticket

377
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:03,220
request coming from your phone contain
Jer

378
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:06,570
your personal information your IMEI be
friendship

379
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:09,770
through transfer stuff they would not be
due to be firmly

380
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:13,260
352 in and back to you after signing

381
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:16,830
in sure an example on this last point

382
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:20,080
it turned out not only on a former

383
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,909
nearly from sioux you couldn't simply
just

384
00:23:23,909 --> 00:23:26,710
it's pretty when you look at that
Activision to get a frisky cryptids

385
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,260
pretty obvious that its

386
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:32,140
there she was america's lot of mmm on
locker Andrew P

387
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:36,320
she can trigger the foreigner with the
ticket but for the longest time

388
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,200
we couldn't reading How insight into the
content to the ticket

389
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,350
introducing information that normally

390
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:47,500
going to be found about furnace

391
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:51,620
ID's honored here's the

392
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:55,400
in this case is no fun for activation 22
and Justin are returned for

393
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,570
I'm of I think it's wrong and I returned
home and it didn't work

394
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:02,929
I don't recognize it Mueller standard

395
00:24:02,929 --> 00:24:06,740
but if he was going to be some to forget
stuff from Tim interest after

396
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:10,460
for I'll for talented men blue

397
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:14,169
100 actually option are not 100 are to
have on the field

398
00:24:14,169 --> 00:24:18,330
but aren't usually figures do have it be
I see CAD users

399
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:22,159
your SIM card number IMEI user iPhone

400
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,900
to remember in fact thumbprint is that

401
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:30,280
informational talking about this unique
here be found on the news

402
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:34,510
but the real real promoting the ticket
that stuff is checked

403
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:37,600
which part 2 match your information at
their

404
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,600
really would not come down to is all
these I am a time

405
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,039
that are at variable mind feel that the
in the ticket

406
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:50,100
and here in the bar motion you national
dump of mine

407
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:53,559
the computer and you can see if you
could to

408
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:56,840
now I and I'm a scientist arm

409
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,280
compounds the first six digits are how
these

410
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,730
no out more acronyms MTCN and an anti

411
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:07,330
and so the user either are the tires
that

412
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:10,659
and AT&T from tribute to talk to on

413
00:25:10,659 --> 00:25:14,990
networks and he can't leave our country
doctor and confusion and friend Dan

414
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:19,340
arm I'm allowed to talk to the 695
networks

415
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:23,230
in be do while carding speaking to the E
in this case

416
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:27,120
mister flag for any digit n it %ah

417
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,900
attacks encoded

418
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:34,580
gone time which defeated BCD

419
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:38,960
forgives is clearly see the 310 Roger
and he in this case

420
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,850
ambitious and flag for any digit so you
can see a matching

421
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:45,960
and I miss I'm jus really a blank I am

422
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,230
six-plus post busby

423
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:52,740
per Burton exams

424
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:56,039
during a wild card match up into that
house

425
00:25:56,039 --> 00:26:00,309
and I i do I'm not very much lighter

426
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:04,280
I'm I'm not showing that simplistic it
you can have is

427
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,559
everything you see prime and in fact
that is what

428
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:11,789
and unlocked Activision to get look like
you don't you can go through

429
00:26:11,789 --> 00:26:16,000
shorter and then a lot Activision to you
because you just wild-card all

430
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,260
all I am time

431
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:24,110
arm the nice thing about the iPhone 4s
it if you have one you can go off and

432
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:27,570
Darren accusation to yourself could you
not interested anymore

433
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:30,610
I'm not sure why and now an apathy use

434
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:33,760
SN got one which is standard

435
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,220
we've saying the controlling do you know
that commuter returning

436
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:41,610
are returning field Soto very standard

437
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:44,610
thing intra-party producer soon

438
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:48,529
but everything now it is and I

439
00:26:48,529 --> 00:26:51,950
that's without third comment is now
disease even if you know your permission

440
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:54,669
so far the PTQ something that goes on
anywhere

441
00:26:54,669 --> 00:26:57,730
you get anything signed by Apple I was
coming back in this is

442
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:00,880
on has been interesting you could see
all these

443
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,020
sign passion acupuncture on 2nd

444
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:08,020
arm so this is our fam unlock

445
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:11,659
I meet around recently whose it was I am
using

446
00:27:11,659 --> 00:27:14,490
the soccer club sandwich has actually
been around for a long time has to do

447
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:15,419
with

448
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:18,919
I'm freaking the phone into letting you
%um to the home screen

449
00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:22,440
but somebody found out that if you
played enough games with the server

450
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,750
using them you could apparently for the
server

451
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:30,250
are confuses Activision sir what's
happening as you would

452
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:34,330
and they found out that if you sent a
request

453
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:37,799
using with your strong should be on mark
to

454
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:41,039
mark scheerer but for the IMSI venue

455
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,659
put your I TCID included you should have
a mishmash

456
00:27:44,659 --> 00:27:48,640
real include information through and we
liked her awesome

457
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,770
tourism arm

458
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:55,710
I won't happen for some unknown reason
the server was hitting some unexpected

459
00:27:55,710 --> 00:28:00,059
arm problem on on around and you could
find it if you now

460
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:04,159
question a real ticket using your real I
am a sign you realize you to do that you

461
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:05,850
just have me just give it to you

462
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:10,450
into something from Stevens in Capen
sermonette

463
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:14,539
helping you micro there's also offer be
from your point of view

464
00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:18,529
a servicer the the only problem with
that

465
00:28:18,529 --> 00:28:22,080
Barack and be closed within for five
days

466
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,240
love people had been stocked with a lot
wrong for counsel

467
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,779
I think a lot people jump on that shit
the only problem with it

468
00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:32,029
is begun for fun in age from the park
you

469
00:28:32,029 --> 00:28:35,850
you're actually tied to that once in
part to you got you on lock but you'll

470
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:38,159
now mark to that particular SIM card

471
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,830
to chew into your turned provider in
switch SIM cards

472
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:45,600
it wouldn't work in your from

473
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:50,480
I'm three years because he this is our

474
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,770
isn't my normal again this is the SM not
one format

475
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:56,850
mine my normal lock you keep you from

476
00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:00,890
you can of course a good few times I
listed there

477
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:06,279
and him to reform arm and then here's a
result from a sham activation treated if

478
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:06,900
you

479
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:10,340
rocking and decoded using it from now on

480
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:14,100
you see the issue and I've changed from
numbers

481
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:17,620
you can see that unlike roots I'm like

482
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:20,840
unknown ticket its have no

483
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:25,159
none of the I am hi numbers are wild
card is very specific to that

484
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:29,650
to that one SIM card and also the ICC ID

485
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:32,720
which is even President honor on an ARM

486
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,820
battered is now present in the sample
get up

487
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:39,130
you picked out you could obvious issue
that families

488
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:42,700
really confusing server review do
suffered nerve root do but then I think

489
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,419
about this

490
00:29:43,419 --> 00:29:46,669
ticket is good it's flying by Apple and
its and

491
00:29:46,669 --> 00:29:50,169
and basement Russian and it's good until
certificate

492
00:29:50,169 --> 00:29:55,059
became with it expires which is three
years

493
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:58,750
arm are sOooo switching topics

494
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:02,080
II miss you and I'm gonna skip

495
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,580
to arm

496
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:10,260
city for the last time for Harley models
were from you're allowed to downgrade

497
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,360
your baseband

498
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,730
the movie because you didn't want to
didn't want you to

499
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:19,669
the blue Cooper Noozhawk from aquifer
this man had been fixed

500
00:30:19,669 --> 00:30:22,990
are this is not enforced are super hard
words is to

501
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:26,140
a policy that the implement every time
you

502
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:29,309
you some 100 merged humor to talk to
them I'm

503
00:30:29,309 --> 00:30:32,340
the bass man it knows enough about

504
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:35,630
who you are you sign you sign your
request you sign your

505
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:38,710
your program that you're asking you to
run it knows after

506
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:41,890
to the view there in Cebu you stand up
is that

507
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:45,520
is the agent in charge Assange I'm not
allowed

508
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,970
so what happens during normal operating
the baseband

509
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:52,840
ya the beef and assertive sheep users
stopped

510
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:58,059
very early in the process it sounds moon
shadows reports being fed a

511
00:30:58,059 --> 00:31:02,820
a binary I can come from Apple at any
point picking through the finer in sin

512
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:06,020
because on begin typing

513
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:10,039
armpit in execute unlikely to be span
which is operating

514
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:13,340
partly from flash program memory that
merge router

515
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:16,679
just it's in RAM safely in RAM does the

516
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:19,990
funny hardware thing that needs to do to
arista flashin

517
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:23,380
reprogram flash so

518
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:27,539
and the one who's signing whether or not
to allow fashion first

519
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:32,789
in early on you could begin me did not
realize that it was a bad

520
00:31:32,789 --> 00:31:36,700
aversion to win the game too early to
get a recent you can in tandem

521
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:40,750
flashing in comanche threesome

522
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:44,100
arm 0 and the 3G the merger

523
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:47,770
first version of the 3G had a bootloader

524
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:50,850
bug which Tom

525
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:55,039
which was basically allowed you to the
fact that decision you could just

526
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:59,520
patch the BR century and and not make it
currently version

527
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:03,809
your to flash fuzzy band is that ap is
the Cydia Store after

528
00:32:03,809 --> 00:32:08,909
implement the checkpoint the fix it and
5.9 in fact

529
00:32:08,909 --> 00:32:12,470
if I recall correctly it wasn't until we
saw

530
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:15,730
the Brewers suck up we're coming the new
5.9 found

531
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:20,039
we do to compare against the fact when
I'm learning for company

532
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:23,960
and two strikeouts Thursdays only though
you know you like 10 by for change

533
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,309
between the two Brewers

534
00:32:25,309 --> 00:32:28,559
pointing right to the I to the park and
this is

535
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:32,350
this is the park ice hockey now one
church could

536
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:35,610
compiled a conscious a grounder

537
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:39,260
up top is checking that the existing
insurance on location

538
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:42,919
and who wouldn't want to do and Bonham
trackers

539
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:46,529
verify sanity check the address in the
length murder

540
00:32:46,529 --> 00:32:50,169
Prince completely botched and a pic
capping any link

541
00:32:50,169 --> 00:32:53,260
ruler arm in

542
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:57,429
our any address you can write to you in
any way and pick up for the expected

543
00:32:57,429 --> 00:32:59,090
length

544
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:03,080
was a really weird Barack Armstrong the
only took about this

545
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:07,429
act but you that you needed to have
around signature out the location

546
00:33:07,429 --> 00:33:11,330
internet you could just atticus you can
rob senator from another party

547
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:14,950
and found a stupid in the face with your
fingers first

548
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:18,169
now is a national sounds from atop track
and then

549
00:33:18,169 --> 00:33:21,590
with the bottom track dude around this
thing

550
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:26,140
and you can see this is fixed version
this is the original code in this is

551
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:29,330
would happen in the new iPhone 3G and
Justina

552
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:32,809
penetrated by two difference

553
00:33:32,809 --> 00:33:36,610
thank heaven for little care so much
about running down group

554
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:40,370
on the camera personalizing your
restores that you can't

555
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:43,409
replay you can't replace restores

556
00:33:43,409 --> 00:33:46,909
the Hirshhorn happened on the piece I
have things her be taken

557
00:33:46,909 --> 00:33:52,950
began to consider is so much BP tickets
application processor

558
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:56,950
I'm not gonna do some stuff because time

559
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:00,510
I don't have Camera I am

560
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:04,059
room how much 100

561
00:34:04,059 --> 00:34:09,450
fine

562
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:11,050
with that

563
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:14,500
ok arm the

564
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:18,179
us to be together this this we decided
the rising altered

565
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:21,610
like it had before last for two tickets
now on to Activision ticket is very

566
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:23,250
different thing from this basement a
good

567
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:27,730
activation fee did what to talk to your
hours around you in the basement ticket

568
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:30,040
is what allows you to flash a certain
version

569
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:33,110
but these are using century thing now it
is all

570
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:37,170
I don't be true but are using in it and
not one

571
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:43,150
now container that fine now framework
version to think researcher

572
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:46,240
on

573
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:50,170
das a marathon every boo home one
difference between movies been taken in

574
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:51,010
the repeated

575
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:54,910
that for whatever reason they don't
bother to some randomness it added to

576
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:55,630
the request

577
00:34:55,630 --> 00:35:00,250
the server a good sign but Apple for
some reason they don't bother to check

578
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:04,430
that that value the randomizer the print
ticket is on

579
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:08,540
matches what you originally asked for

580
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:12,520
there's one place where they do check on
the piece I but then at that point it up

581
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:16,720
this upturn better ended up not like
that to be a fan has some

582
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,890
way of storing the original random
standard put in a request

583
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:24,770
and the checks it every time verified is
not only that the ticket is signed

584
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:29,810
correctly and integrity is matched but
it verify to the field that contains the

585
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:30,440
nonce

586
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:34,640
matches the nonce that was used at one
time during their store

587
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:40,260
arm iPhone 4 cylinder CIII in an unused
250

588
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:44,680
them going to psych a iPhone 4s is
really interesting from a

589
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:48,090
from I am from attackers point of view

590
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:51,120
because autonomy don't have fashioned
more

591
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:55,170
now how far should be spent I am known
only

592
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:58,870
were in on the ground up till now you
could through certain section where the

593
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:01,100
cooler months rent a car this man was

594
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:04,279
position you know activity that happen
during the boom

595
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:10,260
had one verifying the next season turn
over the iPhone 4s in a flash

596
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:14,190
it so you just wake up from reset and
she's not fat it doesn't work to do to

597
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:15,240
discern this room

598
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:19,340
emergency surgery waiting for something
to do so the BP

599
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:22,970
sign up the phone has to this point come
and spoon feed

600
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:26,460
the image that it would normally be
taking from Thanh flash

601
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:30,850
and the other earlier devices was
convincing and is very useful from

602
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:36,720
to grip on you because you can you don't
have to worry anymore ugh if you wanted

603
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,550
to experiment

604

retract my dinner known before you know
it at a

606
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:47,130
get through the whole flashing staff
which itself is a home intro

issues with signing bypassing signing
Trinidad from for a sitting there in

washing process that because there is no
flash

you need to keep feeding BB ticket to a
true for every single boo

632

reflash on what version should be

634
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:31,440
being used when I need to spoon feed
ticket on every single move before you

635
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,830
can give it some the leader

636
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:37,650

00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:50,130
turn

641
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:54,530
flash the

642
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:57,780
out what we're seeing with the car
companies and is

643
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:01,710
you know they have their own fitted
debug features in

644
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:04,870
aborn Haddin use the same stupid

645
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:08,440
bitmask disable all those debug

646
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:15,210
commander known by any other I'm there
is there is a bug that week on early on

647
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:19,160
in Apple's implementation you

648
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:22,960
our weekend I'm Dan Akerson ROM

649
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,380
bypassing from tracks at work down

650
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:29,560
new Mac Pro arm 0

651
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:33,080
how IAC phone actually a on the flashy
point

652
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:36,130
this is a really good reason to start
for an with the beef and

653
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:39,390
your I'm sure to talk to these points
already

654
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:43,550
but it's a really nifty waiter

655
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:47,420
tamper with the price is very early on
in the group stage to the Delano

656
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:51,220
are you know you can often you know I
want welcome you to the different park

657
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,740
on Bruce's but

658
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:57,060
you can become because there is no fire
shooting often much more quickly

659
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:00,880
no don't worry much bricking your
baseband you king of an experiment

660
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,830
so I encourage you sure all into
suitable for boxing

661
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:08,160
and I can be spent buy an iPhone 4s

662
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:13,390
I am the downside is that with honors
choir concert the Tea Party turns me on

663
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:17,230
on humongous while I parse

664
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:21,240
code onto after now you have to start
learning how to haha com

665
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:24,820
content you should be talking to the
beach whole different thing you know

666
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:28,160
not support earlier freezing out beauty
command

667
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,250
you dance and protocol but since it's
pretty

668
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:34,800
and Ford environment I think

669
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,950
dumb arm

670
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:43,130
0 everybody is an emergency territory
from

671
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:46,280
I we are seeing that with the iPad 3
baseband

672
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:51,030
for those iPad 3's have shown we are
seeing that decor Concord

673
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:54,140
seeking a drastic turn and his temper
your

674
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:58,000
or what the differing views are actually
gone

675
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,350
modesty Architektur and taking over love
the beef ban

676
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:06,490
Richard core code that would normally be
down my arm

677
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:10,520
musing with actual so again this is
another reason to start

678
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:14,310
anchoring with the iPhone 4 be tracking
on staff i think is about

679
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:17,970
to change into anytime he found a

680
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:21,880
absentee time this occasion in time hope
to changing issue hope that there's

681
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:26,550
homes for Barca that pop up in knowing
that not only is it okay

682
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:29,790
who chain changing but the whole
architecture the whole

683
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:33,040
the structure to doctors so again knows

684
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,290
sir I missed by the staff

685
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:39,570
this just a the Sony Online news--the

686
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:43,970
different ways that you can bring iPhone
on an iPhone 4s

687
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:47,420
these are the reasons for that

688
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:54,420
and you

689
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:01,779
