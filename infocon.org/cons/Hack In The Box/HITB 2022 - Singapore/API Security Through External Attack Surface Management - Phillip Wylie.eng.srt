1
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:07,859
thanks everyone for for enjoying the

2
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:09,540
talk this morning

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,059
hope your your conference is starting

4
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:13,139
off well

5
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:14,820
so for those of you that don't know me

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,440
know of me I'm Philip Wiley I have my

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,660
cissp oscp and Sans GW apt certs uh just

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,640
got a recent recently a new title at

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,500
psycognito I'm now the hacker in

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,400
Residence and evangelist so before I was

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,180
doing

12
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,098
more the Evangelist stuff like speaking

13
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:34,200
at conferences and now instead of the

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,239
product marketing stuff on my day-to-day

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,920
I'm doing pen testing pen testing their

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,200
platform so excited to be getting my

17
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,000
hands back into some pen testing after a

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,440
seven month break

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,079
so uh I've been in offensive security

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,860
for a little over 10 years and and

21
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,079
cyber security overall 18 plus years

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,620
I've also taught uh pen testing and web

23
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,420
app pin testing at Dallas College taught

24
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,800
there for almost four years I still

25
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,980
teach workshops at conferences one of

26
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,180
the things I've really kind of switched

27
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,280
from that at the the college you got a

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,200
lot of students that wanted the degree

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,619
weren't too concerned about learning how

30
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,900
to pen test and I'd rather teach people

31
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,520
that are wanting to learn so that's kind

32
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,560
of why I've continued with the the

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,080
workshops exclusively so I'm also the

34
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,180
concept Creator and the co-author of the

35
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,799
pen tester blueprint starting a career

36
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,020
as an ethical hacker this book started

37
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,000
out as a class lecturer that turned into

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,880
a conference talk and uh I was in the

39
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,580
tribal hackers red team book and Wiley

40
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,900
publishing approached me about doing a

41
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,040
book and I thought this would be a great

42
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,680
topic there's lots of books out there on

43
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,240
pen testing they're excellent books but

44
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,159
a lot of people don't need know what

45
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,259
they need to know to get started in pen

46
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,020
testing and so this book does that

47
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,540
and as Dylan mentioned I'm the the host

48
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,460
of the hacker Factory podcast so if you

49
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,600
know anyone that's wanting to get into

50
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,640
cyber security this is a really good

51
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,340
podcast to encourage them as my my

52
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,500
guests share their tips on how they got

53
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,360
into the industry and how they and their

54
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,439
recommendations for others

55
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,880
so the agenda we're going to be defining

56
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,740
attack service management

57
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,979
and why prioritizing the external piece

58
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,720
of a tax service management

59
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,300
discovering attack surfaces

60
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,300
API pen testing and tools addressing

61
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,739
gaps of easm as well as some different

62
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:24,840
resources and references where I got

63
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,620
some of this information from

64
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,060
so to start off with you know most of

65
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,440
you've probably heard of the the term

66
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,300
but for those that haven't uh Tax

67
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,920
Service management is to understand the

68
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,680
attack surface we must first Define the

69
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,800
attack surface so the set of points on a

70
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,200
boundary of a system

71
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,599
a element or a system environment where

72
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,060
attacker can try to enter cause and

73
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,360
effect on extract data from that system

74
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,000
element or environment according to nist

75
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,700
and ASM can be simplified as the attack

76
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,340
vectors that you're discovering

77
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,180
foreign

78
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,000
so why is ASM important

79
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,459
so it's hard to to assess or secure

80
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:07,319
something that you don't know about so

81
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:10,140
you know internally with companies it's

82
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,540
it's a problem to try to be able to find

83
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,280
all the internal assets that can be more

84
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,140
difficult but internally you've got

85
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,700
tools like Rumble different

86
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,140
vulnerability scanners you can do

87
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,019
Discovery scans with to discover all

88
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:24,120
those endpoints on the external it gets

89
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,379
a little more difficult than that and

90
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:27,239
it's a serious problem you know years

91
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:30,239
ago when before the cloud our external

92
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,060
attack surface didn't you know expand

93
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,319
and contract the way it does so

94
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,420
dynamically things are constantly being

95
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,640
updated things being added to

96
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,200
environments removed environments you

97
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,840
have Shadow I.T where maybe different

98
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,519
business groups are spinning up

99
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:46,099
different assets in the cloud

100
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:48,420
microservices running marketing servers

101
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,519
and sometimes they don't go through the

102
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:52,980
proper channels to get those uh

103
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,379
put into the environment and so

104
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:57,480
sometimes the security team doesn't know

105
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,340
about those so they don't know to

106
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,340
Monitor and test those items

107
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,739
and so penetration testing once or twice

108
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:06,360
a year is not enough that's usually how

109
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,519
people are addressing that recurring

110
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:09,959
vulnerability scans

111
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,060
is just not quite enough to be able to

112
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,819
to take care of your needs there and one

113
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:16,858
of the terms that one of the stats they

114
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:20,040
heard recently from sisa.gov in the U.S

115
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,959
that they said 50 percent of the

116
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,520
exploited vulnerabilities are exploited

117
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,880
within 48 Hours of a zero day exploit

118
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,100
being released and just to kind of give

119
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,660
a little context to that I've performed

120
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,419
pen tests before where the we the

121
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:36,180
customer had a a retest so 90 days later

122
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,460
we go back and retest to see if they've

123
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,139
remediate remediated items or if there's

124
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:42,060
anything new and this one particular

125
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,460
client I found a vulnerability that was

126
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,160
a low level

127
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,840
vulnerability 90 days later when I'm

128
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,240
back to to test someone figured out how

129
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,860
to exploit that vulnerability so now it

130
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,500
was a high level vulnerability if they

131
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,540
hadn't had the retest done it would have

132
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,160
set there until their next annual pen

133
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,080
test and it could have been exploited so

134
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,820
this really goes to show the need to be

135
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,919
constantly monitoring your tax service

136
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:07,259
as well as assessing it

137
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:10,139
and so this also assesses security from

138
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:12,060
a threat actor perspective so you really

139
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,979
want to go in make sure you're detecting

140
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:16,680
this in the same ways because uh you

141
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,720
know threat actors are looking for the

142
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,240
easy path in and selling be able to have

143
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,919
that threat actor perspective is very

144
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:24,120
important when you're managing your

145
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,840
attack surface

146
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,100
so Tax Service management addresses both

147
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,440
internal and external facing both are

148
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,940
important but the focus of this is

149
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,400
external attack surface management

150
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,500
and we're going to be discussing apis

151
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,000
and how that's a risk and not only are

152
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,979
apis there's all sorts of other data

153
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:44,100
that can be leaked with our product and

154
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,840
our platform we've seen companies that

155
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,800
have

156
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,620
OT and ICS environments that plcs are

157
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,180
being leaked to the Internet so anyone

158
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,400
who was able to browse to that web page

159
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,280
and access that PLC they can start or

160
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,800
stop whatever systems that PLC is

161
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,280
controlling

162
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,800
so traditional ASM vulnerability

163
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,240
scanning vulnerability assessments and

164
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,380
Pen testing

165
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,300
red teaming also known as adversary

166
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,979
emulation purple teaming and Bug

167
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:12,479
bounties although purple teaming and Bug

168
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,880
bounties are a little more uh current

169
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,380
Technologies being used in this space

170
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,139
but with by worth noting and application

171
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:20,880
security testing integrated into the

172
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,699
software development life cycles this is

173
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:26,600
something that's important

174
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:30,419
and so traditional Gap so pen testing

175
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:32,699
based on compliance have brought about a

176
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:34,620
lot of gaps in the industry and what

177
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,240
happens there is there's narrow scope

178
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,819
they're only testing what's in in scope

179
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:41,220
for PCI and there's some other items

180
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,259
that are being missed that maybe a

181
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:44,940
threat actor could exploit and gain

182
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,340
access to data that's important it may

183
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,780
not be credit card data or maybe they

184
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,400
can gain a foothold and pivot into the

185
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,680
environment to gain access to the card

186
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,919
holder environment and you know even pii

187
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,319
credit card information different types

188
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,880
of information is very important to

189
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,919
protect because you know nowadays with

190
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,199
ransomware and they've really figured

191
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:07,440
out how to monetize attacks years ago it

192
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,120
was a little more difficult but now it's

193
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,979
so easy to sell information on the dark

194
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:13,740
web that it gives threat actors a place

195
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,600
to monetize this and ransomware is

196
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,080
another another way so performing proper

197
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,000
attack surface management to try to

198
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,259
eliminate some of these gaps can help

199
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:24,479
reduce some of those risks so time and

200
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,220
resources with this because a lot of

201
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,099
times you're so limited time incomplete

202
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:31,440
inaccurate asset inventories not knowing

203
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,380
what you have from an asset

204
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,199
inventory just like I mentioned internal

205
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,759
is a big enough problem but external can

206
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,919
be a little more difficult to test and

207
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,360
one of the gaps that you see in pen

208
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,560
testing

209
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,080
is that uh there's not proper

210
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,539
reconnaissance performed performed pen

211
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:50,819
tests before where it was like a black

212
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:52,620
box pen test we went in and test the

213
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,020
organization they didn't give us IPS or

214
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,000
domain names it was up to us to go out

215
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,180
and find those IPS in domain names and I

216
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,800
was performing a pen test for a large

217
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,380
Global chemical company headquartered

218
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,479
out of the U.S but during the test I

219
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,000
went through all the network blocks all

220
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,460
the domain names sub donating

221
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,919
enumeration and found all what I thought

222
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,780
to be all the assets but running in a

223
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,940
showdown scan performing some oset I was

224
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,440
able to find out that they had an FTP

225
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,780
server in Indonesia running clear text

226
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,060
authentication which is a risk and if I

227
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,220
would have done like most typical pen

228
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,680
testers I would have performed the oset

229
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,419
and I would have missed out on that risk

230
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:32,880
so be able to really understand and have

231
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,039
an accurate asset inventory have an

232
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,458
accurate uh definition of your external

233
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,020
attack surface is going to be very very

234
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,500
important

235
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,080
so why prioritize the external so

236
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,519
internet exposed highly accessible

237
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,040
threat actors penetration testing once a

238
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,060
year is not enough recurring

239
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,920
vulnerability scans are not enough so

240
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,899
things are externally exposed you know

241
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:58,019
threat actors or uh on site sometimes

242
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:00,000
different nation states will implant

243
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,580
people within the company to to get

244
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,680
Insider information intellectual

245
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,940
property and then sometimes you have

246
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,500
disgruntled employees that will try to

247
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,160
expel data sometimes nation states will

248
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,680
pay employees for their credentials so

249
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,240
they can get access to that environment

250
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,980
this is something something that happens

251
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,200
and this is a risk but the external

252
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,779
piece is more accessible globally if

253
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:22,860
you're going to hack into someone's

254
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,320
Wi-Fi you have to be you know within a

255
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,380
mile or so of that environment from you

256
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,459
know the internet you can attack

257
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:31,200
anywhere you want to and it's a little

258
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,360
easier for attackers to to hide their

259
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,000
their footprints

260
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,980
so addressing the gaps of external

261
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,140
attack surface management so doing

262
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,240
Discovery and so this is including

263
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,220
reconnaissance including open source

264
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,500
intelligence you know a lot of times pen

265
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,880
testers over the years because the

266
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,800
narrow scope of pen testing have been

267
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,140
limited to you know doing some nmap

268
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,700
scans and vulnerability scans a lot of

269
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,959
times they're not running some of the

270
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,360
reconnaissance tools to discover the

271
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,860
different assets and I think because the

272
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,040
narrow scope you see kind of a lack of

273
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,420
skill there's some pen testers that are

274
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,680
highly skilled in that area but it's

275
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,839
been kind of a weakness and one of those

276
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,399
weaknesses that I see is starting to be

277
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,839
addressed people are starting to focus

278
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,420
more on open source intelligence so be

279
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,920
able to use open source intelligence

280
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,260
Define information and sometimes you can

281
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,839
find information from different business

282
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:21,480
sources like mergers and Acquisitions

283
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,399
data Maybe your company has acquired

284
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,920
some other companies and they haven't

285
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,720
been fully integrated you're on you may

286
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,519
be unaware of some of those targets that

287
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,040
are externally focused so by doing oset

288
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,660
you're able to do that using the mergers

289
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,700
and Acquisitions data that you can get

290
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,600
from resources like crunchbase and one

291
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,920
of the things too about external attack

292
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,320
surface management that you see some of

293
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,820
the bug bounty hunters that are finding

294
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,680
some of these vulnerabilities

295
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,600
that often get overlooked because of

296
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,399
oscent and they're really working hard

297
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,100
to to do their oset and a good example

298
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,959
is some of the work Chase and Haddix has

299
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:55,980
done and when we get to some of the

300
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,680
resources we'll list those resources but

301
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,200
one of the things he did was really go

302
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,940
deep looking deep into the environment

303
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,620
to see what all they can find not just

304
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,740
looking at the the narrow surface you

305
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,779
know you can go really wide looking at

306
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:11,040
different things or you can dig deeper

307
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,959
to find more information the Digger the

308
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,540
further you dig the deeper you go the

309
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,940
more uh vulnerabilities you can find

310
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,680
that are possibly exploitable any kind

311
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,519
of data exposure

312
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,140
and so basically when you start this

313
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,120
process you collect the known IP

314
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,480
addresses and the domain names and you

315
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,800
perform your reconnaissance so you're

316
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,240
going through scanning those looking

317
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,060
through the different network blocks uh

318
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,100
different domain hosting services to

319
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,420
find that information perform a

320
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,060
reconnaissance

321
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,740
and so some of the some of the resources

322
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,160
you'll use for I for IP Discovery is the

323
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,079
autonomous system numbers they have like

324
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:51,839
blocks of IP addresses you can find the

325
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,339
addresses they're owned by the different

326
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:55,320
companies and be able to find all those

327
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,420
because sometimes uh you know even if

328
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,920
you're doing a pen test

329
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,480
it's a good idea to do the

330
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,740
reconnaissance because maybe you can

331
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,180
find some things that they didn't list

332
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,540
in the uh in the scope and Aaron and

333
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,220
ripe are Regional registrars that are

334
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,720
widely used for collecting that

335
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,740
information

336
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,019
and then sub subdomain enumeration tools

337
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:16,260
like SubFinder and amass the OS Project

338
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,540
are really great tools for finding these

339
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,180
different subdomains so uh during this

340
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,800
you can look for find vulnerabilities

341
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,560
like subdomain takeover uh during your

342
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,000
testing so finding those different

343
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,100
subdomains and IP addresses that are

344
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,720
exposed are important

345
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,399
have been the open source intelligence

346
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,440
as I mentioned several times here that

347
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,660
you can't really emphasize enough using

348
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,000
tools like showdan uh Spider foot

349
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,820
maltego and crunch base and crunchbase

350
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,260
is more of the Acquisitions and mergers

351
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,060
data more the business data but

352
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,279
sometimes this is overlooked and then

353
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,959
just some of the ocean information that

354
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,600
you can collect from LinkedIn and

355
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,300
different resources for instance uh if

356
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,440
you're wanting to figure out what kind

357
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,700
of databases are used in this

358
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,459
environment you may find a LinkedIn

359
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:02,880
profile of a DBA and typically dbas

360
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,579
they're got their LinkedIn profile all

361
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:07,320
up to date if they decide to look for

362
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,260
other positions people are able to see

363
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,240
their skills and so you're able to

364
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,120
discern some of the the Technologies

365
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,680
being used by some of the information

366
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,240
you collect there

367
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,040
and so this is one of the references to

368
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,079
Jason haddock's Bug Hunter methodology

369
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,480
so the blood counter methodology really

370
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,940
covered all of bug hunting but the the

371
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,639
oset piece the reconnaissance piece was

372
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,860
just so huge that the presentation

373
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,360
pretty much is like one or two hour

374
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,480
presentation on just doing open source

375
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,220
and intelligence and reconnaissance so

376
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,500
that's a good reference and you can find

377
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,440
videos of that as well as the the slides

378
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,600
if you if you do a Google search YouTube

379
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,940
there's several versions on it out there

380
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,279
because Jason was a former bug crowd

381
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:52,019
employee so they've got recordings of

382
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:54,600
that as well as uh some different

383
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,700
conferences he's presented at and I

384
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,519
think he's got a more current version of

385
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,500
that which is probably within the past

386
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,779
year or so so I highly recommend that so

387
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:06,000
uh whenever I joined the company where

388
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,740
I'm at this is one of the things that

389
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,019
inspired me to to go with them because

390
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:11,459
the product seeing some of the things

391
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:13,500
that the bug Hunters were doing things

392
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,620
that Jason Haddix was Finding by doing

393
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,180
adequate reconnaissance from performing

394
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,339
contest and the pen test we did were so

395
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:22,320
narrow in scope sometimes we really

396
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,660
didn't leverage these these items due to

397
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,380
the limited time

398
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,579
so reconnaissance scanning so scan the

399
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:31,680
IEP addresses and domain names including

400
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,100
subdomains using nmap scans to discover

401
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,040
live hosts and map scans for ports

402
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,260
service service scans to identify the

403
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,180
web resources this way you're able to

404
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,560
use some of the different nmap scripting

405
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,480
engine scripts to look for different

406
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,339
services not only doing a service scan

407
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:50,040
but also going through there using NSC

408
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,839
scripts like the volun script which runs

409
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:52,920
is basically like a vulnerability

410
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,420
scanner that gives you more information

411
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,000
so you're able to get the different

412
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,279
ports and services the different

413
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:00,240
applications that are running on those

414
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,000
ports and and using a variety of tools

415
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,560
actually to validate that because

416
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,420
sometimes you may get false information

417
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,699
because maybe the administrators put

418
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,320
different headers in to try to throw off

419
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,459
attackers but using other tools to to to

420
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:16,680
validate that is very important

421
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,899
and through that you're also looking for

422
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:21,060
since we're doing apis our main focus

423
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,040
here you're really focusing on the web

424
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,320
web services so you're wanting to make

425
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,180
sure we find any web services they're

426
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:30,060
not not always running on Port 80 or 443

427
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,000
some of your application servers are

428
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
using Port 80 or 8083 or some different

429
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,800
uh ports related to that so you want to

430
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,959
find all those different ports and

431
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:43,019
services that are that are exposed so we

432
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:46,459
can start looking for those apis

433
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:49,260
and so that on the API endpoint

434
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,000
Discovery we're using different

435
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,160
enumeration tools like Kite Runner which

436
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,980
is a restful API Discovery tool and

437
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,440
f-foof is a word based API Discovery

438
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,120
tool but there's some other tools out

439
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,220
there you can use like go Buster uh

440
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,360
dirtbuster and some of those other

441
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,060
different content Discovery tools but

442
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,399
this was a reference from KD Paxton fear

443
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,240
also known as Insider PhD she's a really

444
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,000
well-known Bug Hunter and uh also

445
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,920
working at a university in the UK and

446
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,920
very knowledgeable on API security as

447
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,680
well as bug bounties and so these are

448
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,360
some of the resources that she uses to

449
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,459
discover apis and there's some other

450
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:27,959
great resources out there that you can

451
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:30,560
find from Alyssa Knight has done

452
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,839
extensive studies on API security so

453
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,160
we're wanting to go through and discover

454
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,079
all those API endpoints we've went out

455
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,000
and discovered the different IP

456
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,040
addresses and domain names and now we've

457
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,019
got to find the the apis and so this is

458
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:44,880
where we're doing our discovery

459
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,800
with these tools to find those apis

460
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:51,720
and so vulnerability testing for apis so

461
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,880
the different tools authorize for for

462
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,740
burps weed extensions for detecting idor

463
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,540
log logger plus plus multi-pre

464
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,639
multi-threaded logging extension for

465
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,059
burp Suite SQL map is a SQL injection

466
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:09,299
testing tool and there's also nosql map

467
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:13,380
for your no SQL databases and jw2 tool

468
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,839
for Java web token testing and then burp

469
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,819
Suite interception proxy and

470
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:19,740
vulnerability scanning tool and this is

471
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:23,699
another reference from Katie on her API

472
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:26,040
testing automated toolbox which you can

473
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,220
find the video there on her YouTube

474
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,600
channel which is some really good

475
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,799
information

476
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:34,140
out of some of the the bug Bounty

477
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,820
creators out there she's got some of the

478
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,160
more uh in-depth information while

479
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,660
there's a lot of good content creators

480
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,440
hers is some of the content that I felt

481
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,919
especially helpful

482
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,299
and so API vulnerability testing so to

483
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:52,740
test for the vulnerabilities you know

484
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,220
we've discovered our apis and so you can

485
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,860
use tools like oh wasps zap uh the open

486
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,700
API add-on uh graphql add-on and soap

487
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,100
add-on and so you can import files

488
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,679
containing URL add-ons and so you're

489
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,559
able to import these different apis into

490
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,179
the endpoint as well as you can do some

491
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:15,660
further Discovery with with OAS zap uh

492
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,179
Postman is another

493
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,620
widely used tool for API security and

494
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,600
also soap UI I think maybe they recently

495
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,480
renamed they have a free version but

496
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,039
there's a little more work to it you can

497
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:29,520
set it up as well as like uh Postman and

498
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,080
proxy it through burp Suite so as you're

499
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,280
running those tests to those different

500
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,720
tools you can also run that through oasm

501
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,059
zap or burp Suite to collect information

502
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:40,820
and vulnerabilities on those endpoints

503
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:45,600
and uh the the tool the the soap UI tool

504
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,919
is really nice because it does some

505
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:49,440
vulnerabilities scanning there too you

506
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,720
can also use burp sweet and awesome zap

507
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,520
with it but it offers some some pretty

508
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,960
good information with the paid version

509
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,520
of that tool

510
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,679
so it's really it's really expanded past

511
00:18:58,679 --> 00:18:59,880
then because you know we're looking at

512
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,340
API security now that is where Cloud

513
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,200
security probably was about three to

514
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,120
five years ago not a lot of people

515
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,700
really understood Cloud security or even

516
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,320
administrating cloud

517
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,700
and you know they saw these

518
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,780
vulnerabilities and their you know

519
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,460
things are evolving and people are more

520
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,080
knowledgeable and apis of kind of in

521
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,880
that space they've been out there I mean

522
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,940
one of the first API pen tests that I've

523
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,620
done that I can recall was back in like

524
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,080
2014 and there wasn't a lot of good

525
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,940
resources out there basically you had to

526
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,120
have the API uh Swagger files and

527
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,799
different config files from the

528
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:34,440
developers to be able to test this but

529
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,600
we're also wanting to do a black box

530
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,980
type of testing and be able to see

531
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,840
what's discovered because security

532
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,640
through obscurity sometimes helps to an

533
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,500
extent but when you have really skilled

534
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,179
threat actors out there they're able to

535
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:46,740
find some of this stuff

536
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,740
and so the the technology and resources

537
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,120
out there to test this is a really

538
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,520
really evolved and during

539
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,460
uh black hat Defcon this year Corey ball

540
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,980
that wrote the book on hacking apis he

541
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,440
released his training for free so uh

542
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,240
he's got like a list of the slides out

543
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,520
there and videos so the trainings is

544
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,140
completely free and it's kind of uh

545
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,660
influenced by inspired by his book on

546
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,500
hacking apis

547
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,080
so API vulnerability testing so a wasp

548
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,380
has their their top 10 for API security

549
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:22,020
and also their API security projects so

550
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,120
using the WASP testing guides have

551
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,919
proven very helpful with web app pin

552
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,860
testing and same as apis to have you

553
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,520
know be able to know what

554
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,740
vulnerabilities the test for as well as

555
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,020
the top ten and one of the things too as

556
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,700
far as the WASP top 10 goes don't always

557
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,500
just rely on that that's showing the

558
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,020
more popular current vulnerabilities you

559
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,820
want to use something like the one of

560
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,440
their testing guides to thoroughly test

561
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,600
all the different vulnerabilities and

562
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,480
also uh ports wigger the people that

563
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,740
create a burp Suite they have some good

564
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,660
testing methodologies you can also use

565
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,820
as well as like the Oasis testing guide

566
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,440
to make sure that you're you're

567
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,059
thoroughly testing everything all the

568
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:59,039
vulnerabilities

569
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,000
foreign

570
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,299
so addressing gaps with easms so we kind

571
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:04,620
of discussed some of the gaps from pen

572
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,840
testing the lack of coverage the lack of

573
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,679
frequency uh limited oscent and so some

574
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:11,940
of the ways that you can address these

575
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,700
is through continuous discovery

576
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,039
so uh

577
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,020
achieve and maintain a more accurate

578
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,700
asset inventory so you want to

579
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,440
constantly keep this up

580
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,120
you know because things change so

581
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,580
rapidly in our environment we've seen

582
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,159
people's environments change drastically

583
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:30,419
in just two weeks so you need to

584
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:32,220
constantly monitor that constant testing

585
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,380
vulnerability scanning and Pen testing

586
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,600
as well as different easm platforms so

587
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,980
there's some other platforms out there

588
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,620
that make this easier and it helps with

589
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,299
the automation piece automation is

590
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:44,640
something that that I've really learned

591
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,980
from the bug Bounty Community their

592
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,360
researchers have really relied on

593
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,100
automation you know they figured out how

594
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,419
to find certain vulnerabilities they

595
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:52,919
specialize in they have their automation

596
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:55,559
running and add domains and subdomains

597
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:56,940
as they join different blood bounding

598
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,980
programs and overnight they'll just

599
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,360
stick to these vulnerabilities and so

600
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,640
they go through and do their testing

601
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,200
against that and some of them even have

602
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,640
figured out how to automate the testing

603
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,980
piece so automation really helps improve

604
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,500
the scalability and helps with resource

605
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,539
limitations because you know in this day

606
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,280
and age we're so short-handed the the

607
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,860
skills Gap and one of the things I

608
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,299
really wish the industry would do is

609
00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:20,520
help some of the new people by giving

610
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,539
them a chance you know you see

611
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:23,340
entry-level jobs that they want you out

612
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,720
three to five years for entry level and

613
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,700
that's not entry level so this kind of

614
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,440
helps the automation

615
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,620
helps with uh with that and and helps

616
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,240
your pen testers and Security

617
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,100
Professionals spend more time on what's

618
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,500
important due to the Automation and

619
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,179
improves the consistency so you have

620
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:40,799
your methodologies and your run books

621
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,780
but you may miss something but if you

622
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:45,120
automate that process then you're less

623
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,400
likely to miss those things unless one

624
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,620
of the scripts or the AI or machine

625
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,140
learning you're using errors out and so

626
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,520
remediation you want to make sure that

627
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,840
you're remediating

628
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,360
timely and complete just as I mentioned

629
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,640
that example earlier

630
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,159
where the vulnerability was only a low

631
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,539
level threat

632
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:05,940
and 90 days later someone had figured

633
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,559
out how to exploit it and it was laying

634
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:10,679
out there and if we hadn't retested they

635
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:11,640
wouldn't have known about the

636
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,799
vulnerability being exploitable so you

637
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:15,179
have to really stay on top of those type

638
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:16,980
of things and so remediation is

639
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,500
important you know sometimes companies

640
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,780
will file risk acceptance but we need to

641
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,980
make sure we're only using risk

642
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,860
acceptances as needed and not just a way

643
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,320
to get out of remediating items as

644
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,539
Security Professionals we have to have a

645
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:32,220
lot of problems that I've had to deal

646
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,659
with that a lot in some of the companies

647
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:36,419
that I've worked for that one time I was

648
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:37,799
performing a pen test in my Consulting

649
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:39,059
years that through a SQL injection

650
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:41,100
vulnerability I was able to get command

651
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,740
line access to their Microsoft database

652
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,600
Microsoft SQL Server they were running

653
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,020
the XP command Shell service and I was

654
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,179
able to get command line access it was a

655
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:53,159
development server so they followed a

656
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:55,620
risk acceptance internally someone could

657
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,900
exploit that externally and pivot into

658
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,880
one of the production environments since

659
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,640
the scope was for web app only then you

660
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,320
know I did not attempt to try to get to

661
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,880
other systems because you don't want to

662
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,380
go out of the scope out rules

663
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,240
engagements because if something crashes

664
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,980
you know they could cause you problems

665
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,419
with the customer so we have to adhere

666
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:15,000
to the to the scope

667
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,280
and so some of the resources from this

668
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,679
uh that are that's kind of helpful I

669
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,919
wrote a article for U.S cyber security

670
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,320
uh magazine that's based on this talk I

671
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,020
first gave this talk at uh API secure

672
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,600
back in April as the first API security

673
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,120
conference it was uh hosted by Alyssa

674
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:33,960
Knight

675
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,000
and so I first gave that talk here and I

676
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,500
actually wrote an article for it so you

677
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,179
can actually find this on their website

678
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:40,980
it goes into little more detail as well

679
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,080
sharing the resources and so the

680
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,760
reconnaissance reference from Jason

681
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,159
haddock's bug Bounty our bug Hunters

682
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:49,260
methodology can be found on YouTube

683
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:52,799
and at API Discovery uh

684
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,020
Katie Paxton fear and you can find that

685
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,240
on her YouTube channel as well as a lot

686
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,220
of other helpful information and a

687
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:02,039
recent uh resource that came out back

688
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:03,900
around April or May or so it was Corey

689
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,380
Ball's book called hacking apis breaking

690
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:09,179
application uh programming interfaces so

691
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:11,159
this is a really great book and as I

692
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:13,919
mentioned during Defcon and black hat he

693
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:16,860
he was doing workshops at Defcon and he

694
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,360
released that training so you can go out

695
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,400
there and find those slides online and

696
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,020
it's based on his book but he goes

697
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,700
through the workshop showing you how to

698
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,860
use the different tools and like I said

699
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,779
I the book I highly recommend as well as

700
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:30,120
anything by him and Alyssa Knight if you

701
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,340
look up any of her resources on YouTube

702
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,620
she does a lot of good stuff with API

703
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,320
security and one of her uh tests

704
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,760
research she had done at one time she

705
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:42,000
was able to get into 55 different banks

706
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,900
through

707
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,240
apis these certain apis that were used

708
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,820
by several banks for common tools be

709
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,500
able to exploit those vulnerabilities

710
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,539
she was able to gain access to 55

711
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:54,240
different banks

712
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,460
so that concludes my presentation and

713
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,140
there is my contact information feel

714
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,700
free to reach out to me on social media

715
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,559
if you ever have any questions want to

716
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,240
share resources I'd be happy to do so

717
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,039
and always love connecting with people

718
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,360
that's one of my favorite things about

719
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,100
coming to these conferences

720
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,320
and we've got a little bit of time if

721
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,659
anyone has any questions

722
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:16,860
Thank You Phillip Wally Okay so

723
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,799
or not uh the questions that we have

724
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:21,779
here on slido they are sort of around

725
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:23,760
the same theme

726
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,860
um so let's start with the top one how

727
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,080
do we prevent our service from being

728
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,179
listed on The Showdown

729
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:31,500
well that's going to get into kind of

730
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,080
the security by obscurity so using less

731
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,220
common uh types of

732
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,980
direct restructures URL structures to

733
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,120
get those

734
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,400
but more importantly what you want to do

735
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,020
is make sure you're securing those apis

736
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,700
that they're secured so if they are

737
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,200
going to be found because it's kind of

738
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,960
hard to stay undetected so the main

739
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,279
thing you want to focus on is make sure

740
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,720
you're using authentication where needed

741
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,419
and thoroughly securing those those apis

742
00:26:59,419 --> 00:27:03,240
okay moving on what tools do you use to

743
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,039
track Asm

744
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,860
so different tools out there to

745
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,260
track ASM there's some different ASM

746
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,940
platforms out there in the company I

747
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,679
work for cycognito we have an external

748
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,200
attack surface Management program so

749
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,419
finding things that automate a lot of

750
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:20,039
the people in the attack surface

751
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:22,260
management space focus a lot on

752
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,620
Discovery some will do vulnerability uh

753
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,419
scanning as well as some remediation

754
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:30,360
planning but uh and there's some I've

755
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,980
seen some different open source tools

756
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:34,140
out there but I can't recall

757
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,240
but yeah those there's there's some ways

758
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,340
to do it automated and using the

759
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,559
different platforms but it's becoming a

760
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,120
more popular space there's been a lot

761
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,039
more companies getting in into the area

762
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:45,720
than a tax service management can be

763
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,600
internal or external

764
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,919
okay

765
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,020
um I'm gonna a bunch of Lexi together

766
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,640
because they're basically the same

767
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,260
question uh one is how do you protect

768
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,159
service from being scanned by

769
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,419
reconnaissance tools and the others are

770
00:27:57,419 --> 00:27:58,679
are there ways to protect yourself from

771
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:00,419
being scanned by

772
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:02,820
somebody who is so a lot of that's going

773
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,799
to be your WAFF and your firewalls

774
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,320
you're wanting to make sure you limit

775
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,960
the the number of uh

776
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,000
your ports they're being exposed you

777
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,960
want to make sure you're limiting that

778
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,840
no uh ports they're exposed using things

779
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,600
like wefts and load balanced networks

780
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,880
setting you know like timeouts on scans

781
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,159
rate limiting so that way if someone's

782
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,620
scanning it that'll time out so yeah

783
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,320
that's you know basically uh people can

784
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,460
scan it but you want to make sure you

785
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,960
secure it because you're constantly

786
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,179
going to be scanned so make sure that no

787
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:35,940
unnecessary open ports

788
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,760
okay thank you very much Phil really um

789
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,559
we have no more questions and also we're

790
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,240
out of time so this is perfect timing

791
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,559
please give a round of applause to

792
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:46,879
Philip Wiley thank you
