1
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,360
[Applause]

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,420
yeah you know uh

3
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:14,400
Dylan's a really special friend it's uh

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,859
us old school hackers actually have a

5
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:19,680
really lifelong Bond and I'd call him a

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,020
brother from another mother because

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,300
um we have stayed close

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,980
um and Dylan's one of those friends

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,680
where you really learn a lesson that

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,580
that

11
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,560
um you want to invest and stay close to

12
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,940
your friends that are good for a long

13
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,460
time and so I've enjoyed his conferences

14
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,380
throughout my career

15
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,899
and I really think as

16
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:42,540
the cyber security industry Dylan and I

17
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,040
have really been around for the birth of

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,040
that when I started in I.T there was no

19
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,260
cyber security business

20
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,440
um you know hack in the box has really

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,879
remained true

22
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:56,760
um and really not sold out to Big

23
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,980
corporate sponsors

24
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,079
um to commercialize it and so I really

25
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,359
find the content here refreshing the

26
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,220
speakers are refreshing and the the

27
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,200
attendees refreshing

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,180
um you know the um and it's really

29
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,400
important for the industry to have have

30
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,260
hack in the box and have events like

31
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,700
this

32
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,240
um my background I am an old school 80s

33
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,979
hacker pre-date pound hack qsd and

34
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:27,659
um was um very fortunate in my life to

35
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,400
develop a hobby

36
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,200
that I could actually build a career out

37
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,840
of and not only career actually

38
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,060
um build companies

39
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,240
um I haven't had a regular job since I

40
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,560
guess we sold IBM ISS to IBM 2006.

41
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,700
um and

42
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,740
um it's just when you can find something

43
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,900
you're passionate about you're going to

44
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,720
be good at it and

45
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,840
um this this this this industry in this

46
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,820
career does allow you to be creative

47
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,540
and I think uh curiosity is one of the

48
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,500
number one traits that defines good I.T

49
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,180
Security Professionals and certainly

50
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,119
good hackers and curiosity is what led

51
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,700
me to to begin to explore the world of

52
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,020
iot

53
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,000
I was looking

54
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,280
if any of you all remember U.S cert the

55
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,340
computer Emergency Response Team

56
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,160
my first cert advisory that was

57
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,239
published was in 1991. it was a remote

58
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:29,180
root exploit in artist

59
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,920
I'd actually had a couple before that in

60
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,800
88 and 89 but the first kind of legit

61
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,020
one was artist 91 and um I loved it and

62
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,080
I'm I'm just hooked on it I love finding

63
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,760
vulnerabilities I love securing

64
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,700
computers and I love exploring them and

65
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,040
I still do and

66
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,760
um that in my career led me to join a

67
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,379
company called internet security systems

68
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:57,720
and they asked me to build a team called

69
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:03,000
the X-Force back in uh 98 and

70
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,780
um

71
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,420
I'm pretty sure on the numbers we still

72
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,860
hold the records for number of

73
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,360
vulnerabilities number of zero days

74
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,920
discovered

75
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,280
um I helped co-author the cve and CVSs

76
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,220
scoring systems so I've really lived

77
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,060
this journey and I enjoy sharing I enjoy

78
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,080
meeting new hackers I enjoy developing

79
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,819
curious kids

80
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:28,620
um one of my favorite things to do is

81
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,920
give students a Raspberry Pi and tell

82
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,800
them to impress me and especially high

83
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,720
school kids and if you know a high

84
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,239
school kid or even Junior High

85
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:41,900
you know we can't go get a shell anymore

86
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,220
on the internet those days are over

87
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,959
right it used to be pretty easy I'll

88
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,879
just go get a shell uh and start

89
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,799
learning and those days are over so the

90
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:51,180
ability to have a powerful Linux

91
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,640
computer in your pocket

92
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,500
um is important I left mine in the room

93
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,959
but I always travel with one uh it's

94
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:00,239
funny one of my customers is um in

95
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,980
hospitality and I was showing the CSO

96
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,900
recently that I uh carry around this

97
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,519
Raspberry Pi and always plug it into

98
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,519
hotels and one of my favorite things to

99
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,340
do is unplug the VoIP phone change the

100
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,319
MAC address of my Raspberry Pi and just

101
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,299
see what's out there and I love to see

102
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:17,699
and understand that and that Curiosity

103
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:19,560
that I still have

104
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,100
really led me to investigate the

105
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,759
internet of things and I can remember

106
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,680
the first time I heard the term Internet

107
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,400
of Things it was from uh one of my

108
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,620
investors at my first company I started

109
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,840
called endgame or the first cyber

110
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,220
warfare company

111
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,639
uh and my chairman was uh with inkyuto

112
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,259
which is the Venture Capital arm of the

113
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:46,860
CIA and I remember where I was standing

114
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,900
one he told me about the internet of

115
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,660
things and it just made my head explode

116
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,960
it was such a great term

117
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,900
and uh really that was probably 15 years

118
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,199
ago that I heard that and um I had I

119
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,720
never stopped thinking about it

120
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,780
um and um I've done a couple startups

121
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,880
the the first one was end game it was a

122
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,380
it was a great success we sold it to

123
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,820
elastic

124
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,440
um the the second one is coming called

125
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,960
Bastille another one of my hobbies is

126
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,780
amateur radio and software to find radio

127
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,220
so I formed the first commercial

128
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,860
software to find radio company Bastille

129
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,940
and my thesis there was to

130
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:27,539
um

131
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:30,900
turn a software to find radio into a

132
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,160
packet sniffer

133
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,740
to sniff the entire Spectrum

134
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,880
from 50 kilohertz to 5 gigahertz and

135
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,080
people thought I was crazy and it was uh

136
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,060
it's been very well received by the

137
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,460
security Elite and I'm not pitching that

138
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,199
company but um

139
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,620
just to understand I think as we think

140
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,080
about radio waves as the New Media

141
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,680
versus uh Hardware media

142
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,460
um

143
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:03,840
when I look at a device my cro uh Obi

144
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,060
canoop is here he loves it anywhere I

145
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,340
walk I'm always looking always looking

146
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,560
up thinking about

147
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,320
how is that device communicating what

148
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,660
cves are on it

149
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,759
um what's the password it's just how

150
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,919
we're wired uh and and that led me into

151
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,120
uh phosphorus

152
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,060
so I was recently a company's grown a

153
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,940
lot and um I had about a year ago at

154
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,479
about 10 people we have 50 today and

155
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:39,840
um uh you know the um uh it was Earl

156
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,699
I've been doing this about five years at

157
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:44,759
almost six and and in early days

158
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:46,979
I can remember people saying we don't

159
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:50,400
have any iot there's no iot here and

160
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,840
actually reminded me in uh in the 90s uh

161
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,060
my co-founder and I

162
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:57,900
um

163
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,340
funny story I was looking for a

164
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,319
screenshot of this but when the movie

165
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:05,460
hackers was released in 1995 and they

166
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,520
put their web page up the same day that

167
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,639
movie hackers was hacked and they took

168
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,500
down a picture of the actors and they

169
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,080
put up a picture of me and my co-founder

170
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,940
from the hackers on planet Earth

171
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,979
conference on the web page

172
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:22,199
and I was working for a big bank and it

173
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:25,620
caused me problems and uh and because it

174
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,300
wasn't quite as socially acceptable as

175
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,360
it is today and uh so we had them put

176
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,340
little bars over our eyes but it's still

177
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,740
out there and you can vaguely you can

178
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,080
vaguely recognize me

179
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,280
um so anyway uh December 20th I looked

180
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,599
in the nick uh uh the and I um to see

181
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,080
when I had the idea for this company and

182
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,400
um it was December 20th 2016 at about 5

183
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,440
P.M

184
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:59,220
and the the origin was I was reading a

185
00:07:59,220 --> 00:07:59,819
um

186
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:01,979
it was a white paper from the University

187
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:03,539
of Wisconsin

188
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:06,840
and the white paper was a study of a a

189
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,380
botnet and it was mostly affecting

190
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,380
um Netgear routers embedded routers

191
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:17,039
and um they studied it for a long time I

192
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,199
think almost 10 years

193
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,000
and what they were able to figure out

194
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,800
and it was literally a drop the mic

195
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,160
moment was that the hypothetical

196
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,960
Half-Life decay of the vulnerability

197
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,419
were in less syllables the half-life of

198
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:32,760
patching of embedded devices was seven

199
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,659
years

200
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:36,240
I immediately stopped reading and

201
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,760
started working on a company that day

202
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,760
because I knew with the proliferation of

203
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,080
these devices

204
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,020
if the patch cycle on them was over

205
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,120
seven years to remediate a single

206
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,399
vulnerability that this would be a huge

207
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,019
exposure point

208
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:54,120
but it would also be a serious technical

209
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,220
challenge actually my biggest technical

210
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,600
challenge in my life

211
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,339
and um the the big challenge is the

212
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:06,000
entire industry that we work with

213
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,399
build software for computers with

214
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,800
keyboards it builds software for general

215
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,360
purpose computers

216
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,279
and if you think about it's kind of

217
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:15,660
easier to write software on a computer

218
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,700
with a keyboard than it is well that

219
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,040
doesn't have a keyboard and so the

220
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,420
computers without keyboards were the

221
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,339
ones I was interested in

222
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:25,800
and I experimented with um different

223
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,180
different Technologies in different

224
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,160
markets initially I thought well

225
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,839
we built a consumer product was the

226
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:32,220
first thing I did we built it for iPhone

227
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,200
and Android so oh everyone's going to

228
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,580
want a patch this is five years ago

229
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,959
everyone's got to want to buy this in

230
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,160
the App Store and Patch their home

231
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,860
routers well it worked it was really

232
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,220
cool but no one wants to pay for that uh

233
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,140
I I still want to do that and I still

234
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,140
will do that but my co-founder said hey

235
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,000
um I think Enterprises would like to

236
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,980
solve this problem and I was a little

237
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,320
unsure actually and

238
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,360
um just the history of my co-founder

239
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,839
Earl he and I met on his bulletin board

240
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,000
in 1985 and we've been starting

241
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,860
companies ever since so another one of

242
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,839
those lifelong hacker relationships

243
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,700
where we bonded so well because there's

244
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,399
just not that many of us back then

245
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:15,000
um and so so we got these all these

246
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,440
devices out there that are not getting

247
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,600
patched and the reason for that is

248
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,120
somewhat logical because there's no

249
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,760
simple way to to apply patches well the

250
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,140
patches were really just the tip of the

251
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,839
iceberg right there's there's so much

252
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,200
more opportunity to both exploit and

253
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,080
remediate these devices that it's it's

254
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,440
been a really amazing journey

255
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,860
um really almost as fun as the X-Force

256
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,080
difference being when you're finding

257
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,760
vulnerabilities

258
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,700
and writing signatures for IDs is you

259
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,560
really don't own the problem right you

260
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,940
work with the vendor to put the patch

261
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,060
out but you're not solving a problem and

262
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,519
I love vulnerability research I love it

263
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:59,700
I would do it all day long if if I could

264
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,920
maybe someday I will

265
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,019
um but the market

266
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:07,440
is is somewhat noisy with new

267
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,180
vulnerabilities and I'm not distant

268
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,320
vulnerability research so I talk about

269
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,700
corporations doing vulnerability

270
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,000
research is a primary topic and we'll do

271
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,440
research everyone will do research but

272
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,360
what I really realized was there's so

273
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,640
many vulnerabilities out there I didn't

274
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,560
Chris didn't need to really add more to

275
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,079
the pile right I really wanted to solve

276
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:27,600
a harder problem which was fixing them

277
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,500
and these devices are frankly so fragile

278
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,079
vulnerability research is is pretty easy

279
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,060
like um I said there were some

280
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,620
vulnerabilities recently discovered in

281
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,560
the APC UPS systems so everybody knows

282
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,779
what an APC UPS is right it's a battery

283
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:45,839
backup system everyone has them and this

284
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,660
became really clear to me so this was a

285
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,000
couple months ago there's a lot of hype

286
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,140
it was a remote exploit maybe a Dos I

287
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,480
think it was an exploit too uh on these

288
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,540
battery back EPS systems

289
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:04,440
and press release is webex's you know oh

290
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,820
the world's gonna end everyone's going

291
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:09,240
to hack the UPS's well I've got a

292
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,680
product deployed that you know our

293
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,540
technology kind of manages embedded

294
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,860
devices and I'm not going to picture a

295
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,940
product here I don't believe in that but

296
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,019
we're going to do it out there if you

297
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:17,279
want to see it

298
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,579
um and um the um

299
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:22,500
I queried our system talk to our

300
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,640
customers

301
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,240
I could not find a single Enterprise

302
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,100
whose password on their battery backup

303
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,440
system was not APC

304
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,500
so my point being is while vulnerability

305
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,700
research

306
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,380
is cool and easy to pick on these

307
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,360
devices the passwords aren't even

308
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,360
changed no one changes the passwords no

309
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,100
one's patching these things and no one's

310
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,139
changing the passwords it is truly

311
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:47,940
remarkable

312
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,100
um and I was thinking last night because

313
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,560
um I was uh I was using Ben walk and

314
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,000
doing some squash effects for more

315
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,459
extractions on some OT devices to pull

316
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:58,079
look for back doors because vendors

317
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,839
leave them in there all the time uh one

318
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:02,279
product I was looking at was the

319
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,139
verifone credit card readers you know

320
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:07,019
where you swipe your credit card

321
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,300
there are six users and passwords on

322
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,040
every one of those credit card machines

323
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,540
six

324
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,639
why do you need six user IDs and

325
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,740
passwords to swipe your credit card it's

326
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,620
it's crazy and so

327
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,519
um

328
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:23,040
uh the password problem actually turned

329
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,740
out to be bigger than the patching

330
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,079
problem so we have this Universal

331
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,540
devices where the credentials aren't

332
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,880
managed the patches aren't managed and

333
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,660
really

334
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,720
the last thing I figured out was that no

335
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,940
one even knows what's on their Network

336
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,180
and I had really thought you know in

337
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,120
2017 2018 geez I've been doing this I

338
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,680
was building internet scanners I've been

339
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,019
scanning the internet since it existed I

340
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:51,480
figured by 2020 people would know what's

341
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,579
on their network but they still don't

342
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:56,040
and a lot of these devices

343
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,339
don't respond well to traditional

344
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,139
scanning and vulnerability management

345
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:03,600
they crash they roll over you can't even

346
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,220
talk to anybody about sending a single

347
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,079
packet to a PLC anymore because there's

348
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:09,360
so much fear that something bad will

349
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,300
happen and so you know the last piece of

350
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,040
the puzzle to figure out how to solve

351
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,480
this stuff is is you got to find them

352
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,980
first

353
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,060
so

354
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,700
to save a lot of syllables

355
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,399
we're using a new industry term xiot

356
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:26,519
extended iot so when I say x iot to you

357
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:28,139
guys I'm talking about any embedded

358
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:29,880
device anything that can't run an agent

359
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,680
anything that's not running Windows or a

360
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,680
server any computer without a keyboard

361
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,839
and this encompasses

362
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:39,779
otics scada you name it if it's got an

363
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:42,300
IP address on an embedded device

364
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,220
um it's probably got security

365
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:47,339
vulnerabilities it Pro almost certainly

366
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:51,720
unmanaged and you know I I really think

367
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,579
we're just at the tip of the iceberg

368
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:54,540
here

369
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,779
and the numbers of the market are of

370
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:00,420
devices in the market are totally

371
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,100
mind-blowing when you start counting

372
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:02,820
them

373
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,680
so just to give you some kind of comps

374
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:09,300
on how we look at the world of iot I'm

375
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,519
going to show you what we found but

376
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,320
um everyone's familiar with the cloud

377
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,639
security Market

378
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,459
and I woke up we just raised a 38

379
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,320
million dollar series a which is kind of

380
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,300
on the upper high end

381
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,920
um in February

382
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,279
and once that was complete I I really

383
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:27,660
kind of wanted to get some perspective

384
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,339
right because as a Founder you're just

385
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:32,040
like your nose is on the floor like you

386
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,139
just you don't have it's really hard to

387
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:35,579
have Vision when you're trying to build

388
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:39,240
and sell and raise capital and I woke up

389
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,860
I can remember the morning I woke up

390
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,199
because I woke I get up early I woke up

391
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,420
you know 5 a.m and I just had this

392
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,399
question in my head how many servers are

393
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:48,779
in the cloud

394
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:51,300
and then I realized like I even know who

395
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,300
to ask that without sounding kind of

396
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,300
silly and even my co-founder my buddy I

397
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,800
was like man if I ask him he's gonna

398
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,540
think there's something wrong with me so

399
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,699
I said man well how am I going to count

400
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:04,920
the servers in the cloud

401
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,600
I can't do it the way I would have done

402
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,019
it in the 80s so let's look at the cloud

403
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:12,720
leaders so Amazon has about 60 percent

404
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,699
of the cloud market and they have six

405
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:16,980
million servers the point of this is

406
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,920
that 10 million servers is really not a

407
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,860
big number but we talk about clouds so

408
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,380
much it's important to us our data is

409
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,839
there but the numbers are small I just

410
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,120
don't see it as a as big of a problem as

411
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,920
some of these other markets

412
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,660
yesterday on I was flying here from

413
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,180
Dubai and I had this idea because I'm

414
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,220
trying to find relatability into these

415
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,079
numbers

416
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,079
um and so I looked at the populations of

417
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:44,459
animals

418
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:48,180
right how many animals what what animal

419
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,180
are there 10 million of just 10 million

420
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:54,000
turns out there are they estimate there

421
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,519
are 10 million mules in the world which

422
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:58,019
is somewhat of a good metaphor because

423
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:01,079
the cloud is a Workhorse

424
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:03,720
so endpoint security

425
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,179
um there are about 8 billion

426
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:09,599
Souls on this planet with about 0.57

427
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,660
computers per person so 5 billion

428
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,760
desktops in the world

429
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,179
um that number when we talk about iot is

430
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:21,660
still small and what's interesting about

431
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,439
um

432
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:24,540
computers with keyboards and I

433
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,699
fundamentally fundamentally believe that

434
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:28,260
your grandchildren will not use

435
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,419
computers with keyboards when I type on

436
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:32,100
a keyboard I'm typing it you know

437
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,380
measuring it in bits per second and our

438
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,640
internet connections are measured in

439
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,799
gigabits per second this is a big

440
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:39,660
disconnect there's some big brains

441
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,059
working on solving that problem but

442
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:43,860
fundamentally

443
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,799
um we've got a a desktop environment in

444
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:47,960
the world

445
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,559
and

446
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:50,280
um

447
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,080
the number of desktops is actually

448
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,740
starting to decline so there were 275

449
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:59,940
million less laptops made this year than

450
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,440
last year

451
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,240
it's simply the direction we're going on

452
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,140
and you can opine on y on on tablets and

453
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,020
and phones and we do more things without

454
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,520
a computer than we could have thought of

455
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,980
10 years ago so anyway obviously the

456
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,020
endpoint is a hugely important Market

457
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,360
but the numbers

458
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:23,840
in my world are small only 5 billion

459
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:28,320
so this is the world I live in xiot the

460
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,720
middle of the road number and I looked

461
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,640
at all the numbers some people are crazy

462
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,860
high some people are in the 30s the

463
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,140
middle of the road number is there are

464
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:40,620
50 billion x iot devices in the world

465
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,200
so rough a little you know close to

466
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,140
seven per person but what's crazy about

467
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,400
this Market

468
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,220
is it's growing at 15 a year

469
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,140
so next year

470
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,080
though there will be

471
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,440
another 7.5 billion iot deployed that's

472
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,020
more in one year than the entire

473
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,840
population of computers in the world

474
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,299
and next year it will grow after that I

475
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:09,960
can see a road in 20 years to a trillion

476
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,480
computers in the world

477
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,539
sensors operating in all kinds of

478
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:17,100
industries that we haven't even thought

479
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,020
of if you think of where we were 20

480
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,660
years ago where we will be in 20 years

481
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,039
yet

482
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,960
no one is seriously thinking about

483
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,660
security nobody is

484
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,240
and part of that reason is it's hard to

485
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,460
get your head around how do you secure a

486
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,500
computer that you can't run software on

487
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,720
because we've been using this model for

488
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,059
20 years

489
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:43,140
so this is what I found and remarkably

490
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,140
the numbers are exactly in line with

491
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,780
that paper I read on December 20th 2016.

492
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,960
they're almost perfect we just did a POV

493
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,799
last week and they were on the money it

494
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:57,840
was crazy and it's rare in your life

495
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,760
that you could actually guess that right

496
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,039
but in this case I did

497
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:06,179
so the the the the the numbers are

498
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:08,880
um really staggering as to what we see

499
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,220
when we're out there uh looking at

500
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,559
networks and large Enterprises I don't

501
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:15,240
talk to any smaller no one with less

502
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,580
than ten thousand employees the numbers

503
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,340
are remarkable over half the devices

504
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:24,419
have a cve of eight or above

505
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:27,240
you guys are professionals you know if

506
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,059
your windows environment had 50 of its

507
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:32,100
devices computers had a cv8 or above

508
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,320
you'd be having problems almost another

509
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,919
20 percent have a critical cve

510
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,720
and now when you match that up with this

511
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,299
data let's say on the higher end I

512
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:44,760
certainly think in in APAC in the Middle

513
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,039
East the density of iot per employee is

514
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,960
higher I I just know it everything's

515
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,600
newer there's more adoption technology

516
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,679
and sensors and so if they're five

517
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,380
devices for every person

518
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,840
and twenty percent of those devices have

519
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,940
a critical cve that means there's a

520
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,679
remote root exploit sitting on the

521
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:07,020
network for every employee and it's just

522
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,780
been ignored for decades

523
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:13,380
additionally on the password side half

524
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,080
of the devices we see out there and this

525
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,440
is Quantified like I I have the data to

526
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,900
back up my data that half these devices

527
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,000
are still in default credentials the

528
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,640
other half maybe got rotated once at

529
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,980
deployment and then what's funny and

530
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,200
this with my hacker head on I love this

531
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,340
part

532
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,580
we have customers who lose passwords to

533
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,200
thousands of things

534
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,600
so of course my response to that is

535
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,059
okay let's write an exploit let's do a

536
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:44,100
password reset for you and I actually

537
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,419
think that will probably be a thing

538
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:47,700
right if you're losing passwords on iot

539
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,440
advices they're only they're only

540
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,720
there's only one other way to do it and

541
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,100
this is probably my favorite attack

542
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,559
Vector for iot is the paper clip attack

543
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:58,440
vector and this is an attack Vector that

544
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,659
no one could do anything about right

545
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:03,059
Nothing Stops anyone from plugging a

546
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:06,000
paper clip into the back of a

547
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,220
um into the back of a device takes about

548
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,440
30 seconds tops and now you got a

549
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,780
default password and you got uh you

550
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,000
probably reverted to original firmware

551
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,860
so one of the things we ended up doing

552
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,539
because we're concerned about Insider

553
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:21,659
threat here is okay well there is a way

554
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:23,700
to detect that because if you're

555
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,340
maintaining State on a device firmware

556
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:30,360
revision and credentials when uh when

557
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,000
when a when a when someone an Insider

558
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,799
performs factory reset

559
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,000
um you're going to go back to those so

560
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,280
it is determinable but it's not really

561
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,559
preventable you know we solved a problem

562
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,480
like this in the 90s and early 2000s

563
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,039
with USB drives and PCs and the um you

564
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,360
know I can remember people were putting

565
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,460
glue in their USB ports because they

566
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,140
didn't want people to put USB drives in

567
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,659
that's pretty much a solved problem uh

568
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:57,299
with the the endpoint agents today but

569
00:22:57,299 --> 00:22:59,220
um in in the world iot you're never

570
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,960
going to be able to stop that factory

571
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,760
reset

572
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,740
um and um it's always going to be an

573
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,260
interesting attack vector

574
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,720
so the the passwords I mentioned that

575
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,600
half of these are defaults but also we

576
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,620
find

577
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,360
really interesting different password

578
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,240
rules and when I say interesting I mean

579
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,500
lame

580
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,360
you guys have all probably seen products

581
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,059
from hid badge readers badge printers

582
00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:26,340
door access control systems

583
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,380
the password strength

584
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,140
on an HID badge printer or reader really

585
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,000
any hid

586
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,380
OT technology

587
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:37,260
is a four digit numeric password and

588
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,820
these are new products being shipped

589
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,400
today and the maximum strength you can

590
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,840
Implement on these is a four digit

591
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,820
password and this is the thing that

592
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,500
controls your access to the building

593
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,860
that's how disconnected the world of iot

594
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,860
is uh from The Real World there are also

595
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,600
other really interesting things you run

596
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,120
into because if you want to actually

597
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,700
help people secure passwords on embedded

598
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,919
devices you've got to understand the

599
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,679
password strength rules on those devices

600
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,000
and password strength rules have to do

601
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,320
with the implementation of how they

602
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,539
implemented

603
00:24:08,539 --> 00:24:12,360
p-a-s-swd and um one of my favorites

604
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,220
that I ran into

605
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,419
is

606
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:16,320
um

607
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,980
polycons uh polycoms if you put a colon

608
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,919
in a polycom password you will be locked

609
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:26,340
out forever right it's a bug but it's um

610
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,460
it's kind of interesting and unique and

611
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,840
so

612
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,520
um you know I didn't put any pictures in

613
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,320
here but one of the things I did

614
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,179
honestly one of the reasons I love my

615
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:39,360
job is that I had to buy

616
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,059
a device from every single vendor and

617
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:43,799
you can probably imagine from a founder

618
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:45,480
and CEO that travels with a Raspberry Pi

619
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:49,799
I love gadgets and so we own every

620
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:51,900
single vendor's technology I've got over

621
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:55,380
250 vendors embedded devices sitting in

622
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:58,260
racks behind my desk it's the coolest

623
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,900
job ever but you have to do that because

624
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,880
you have to own it you have to be able

625
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,080
to talk to it you have to be able to

626
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,360
pull a firmware and then if you want to

627
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,220
you do reverse engineering and analysis

628
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,620
on the firmware but fundamentally I've

629
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,419
not really run into anybody who's been

630
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:15,179
willing to put the resources in to build

631
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:17,940
the team to buy the gear and really

632
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,919
deterministically analyze all these

633
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,159
devices and so there are

634
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:26,460
probably dozens of PhD papers in that

635
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,400
pool of devices we're at 250 vendors

636
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,260
today I think we'll be at 500 in a year

637
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:34,380
a thousand two years I think eventually

638
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,940
um I think eventually it levels off as

639
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,220
to as to what you see out there

640
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,919
um another really interesting piece of

641
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:42,179
data we found out of the millions of

642
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:44,400
devices we've talked to so far

643
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,960
is uh is EOL this was one I did not

644
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,779
expect

645
00:25:50,779 --> 00:25:52,320
so

646
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,059
um

647
00:25:53,059 --> 00:25:55,559
generally it's frowned upon Iran end of

648
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:57,419
the life operating systems there are

649
00:25:57,419 --> 00:25:59,520
lots of stories about big companies and

650
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,559
organizations paying Microsoft to keep

651
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,480
making patches for end-to-life operating

652
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,240
systems but we all know that that's not

653
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,340
a scalable solution it's not a good

654
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,620
solution

655
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:14,039
26 of the devices we see so one and a

656
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,919
quarter per employee are end of life

657
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:19,020
and this is something people also

658
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,940
haven't expected and when a device is

659
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,080
into life you're not getting more

660
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,700
security patches you're not getting much

661
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,340
more support and the devices need to be

662
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:29,460
replaced so now we got this world where

663
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,980
half everything's got an eight

664
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,299
twenty percent of everything's got a

665
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:35,760
nine half of them don't have passwords

666
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,159
and over a quarter of them

667
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,440
you know need need to be replaced

668
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,220
um

669
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,580
Shodan matterly fantastic tool fantastic

670
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,500
product I'm so glad the guys stayed

671
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,779
independent because it is such a good

672
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:54,299
ground Truth for us and I'm sure you

673
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:56,460
guys use it everybody loves to go on

674
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:59,100
there and search for iot and OT and it's

675
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,900
just always

676
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,299
um shocking and remarkable but you can

677
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:05,340
see here just some simple queries if you

678
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,020
haven't used it before

679
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,120
you just type in camera that's not even

680
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,580
a serious query five million cameras

681
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,679
Exposed on Showdown just piping camera

682
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,059
if you've looked at specific vendors

683
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:17,520
you'd probably find more UPS as I was

684
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,080
talking about you know your battery

685
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,520
backup system really doesn't belong on

686
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,919
the internet VoIP systems and here

687
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:25,860
printers and so these are really common

688
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,500
devices and I'll tell you

689
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,240
I guess

690
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,000
I don't like printing I don't like paper

691
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,880
I don't like printing stuff but printers

692
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,740
are important printers are important to

693
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,659
big businesses and there are lots of

694
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:42,539
them and this they are a serious

695
00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:44,400
security problem and we've I'll get to

696
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,679
it but we've seen now malware leveraging

697
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:49,559
printers for x-fill like I always

698
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:51,960
thought I always felt embarrassed to say

699
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,279
I'm going to help you secure your

700
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,419
printer I'm really worried about your

701
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:56,820
printer but it's a thing

702
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:00,360
and they have to be secured

703
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:04,020
so kind of as a throwback 90s throwback

704
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:07,440
really all of these devices look like

705
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,679
1990s technology I honestly I kind of

706
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:11,880
think that even some of them go back to

707
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,640
the 80s that is what we're living in is

708
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,679
a world that's controlled by machines

709
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:20,340
with a security level from the 90s in a

710
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,740
contested internet environment with

711
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:26,120
malicious actors and this is going to be

712
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:29,520
the new Hot Spot from malware and we

713
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,500
just saw it yesterday

714
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,880
twice

715
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,460
I was um I was actually just pitching

716
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:41,159
to secure a company's cameras and um

717
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:42,360
they had a lot of things but this

718
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,460
company has a lot of cameras over a

719
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:47,100
hundred thousand and I just walked out

720
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,679
of the pitch and my buddy leapdog Dylan

721
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,440
over there posts on LinkedIn that 8 000

722
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,419
hick vision cameras got compromised

723
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:56,039
right after I walked out of the meeting

724
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:57,960
and that was the camera they were using

725
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,520
and

726
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,220
um it is it is it is simply remarkable

727
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,779
that

728
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:06,120
um how fast hackers are catching up and

729
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,880
then again yesterday Google announced

730
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,919
they'd stop the largest DDOS against

731
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:13,440
them in history and it was run from the

732
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,380
Maris botnet which is another iot botnet

733
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,500
so just yesterday we had two serious iot

734
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,760
hacks

735
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:24,299
and I I suspect because these devices

736
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:27,000
are small innocuous I mean I told you I

737
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,460
don't like printers but these things

738
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,679
they're easy targets and the reason's

739
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:32,460
simple

740
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,799
if you were a hacker do you really want

741
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:35,880
to go against a machine running

742
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,039
crowdstrike or would you rather go

743
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:39,360
against the one that has no password and

744
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,980
has never been patched maybe it's end of

745
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,140
life you can pivot off each you can move

746
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,240
laterally off each so take the easy

747
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,539
targets and um that is what we're seeing

748
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:51,179
today and as our traditional compute

749
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:52,440
environments the computers with

750
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,200
keyboards are secured the ones without

751
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,659
are left in the cold and the reason is

752
00:29:57,659 --> 00:29:59,940
it's it's a bit of a hard problem

753
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,919
oh here's some yeah

754
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,440
here's some here's some uh here's some

755
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,000
tools uh

756
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,700
one of my favorites I still miss Sun OS

757
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,120
honestly

758
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,960
so

759
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,120
um this is a U.S thing but I think it's

760
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,659
relevant in that um many of these

761
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:20,039
devices

762
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:22,860
especially Chinese devices are coming

763
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:26,760
out of the factory malicious

764
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,200
um it was interesting so we I was double

765
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,760
clicking on the hickvision stuff because

766
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,620
of the stick Vision botnet hit fish and

767
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,720
malware hickvision exploits hick Vision

768
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,480
defaults and um

769
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,399
there's um

770
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:42,059
there's a single packet hickvision

771
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:43,919
credential bypass

772
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,179
some people would call that a

773
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:47,460
vulnerability to me who's been loose my

774
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,320
whole life it smells more like a back

775
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,720
door it smells much more like a back

776
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,679
door

777
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:57,659
and um I think the bar has been higher

778
00:30:57,659 --> 00:30:59,399
to research these vulnerabilities

779
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,559
because of what I was mentioning earlier

780
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:03,779
right you can't just load this stuff up

781
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:06,840
in Idaho Pro and start looking for for

782
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,539
bugs you actually have to get the thing

783
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:12,360
put your hands on it take a screwdriver

784
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,500
to it

785
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,620
and um pull the firmware off sometimes

786
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,659
and that um

787
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:20,820
that's just a little more work

788
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,279
um and um but people are finding it's

789
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,020
very fruitful and many of these other

790
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,580
devices

791
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:29,220
um are are coming malicious one of my

792
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,840
favorite examples when I started the

793
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,860
company

794
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,899
accompanying a kawaiis that makes

795
00:31:33,899 --> 00:31:35,279
cameras they make Enterprises and

796
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,559
consumer cameras and this one happened

797
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:39,899
to be I'm always looking for stuff I'm

798
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:42,840
always buying stuff it Obi just cracks

799
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,279
up whenever I see something looks

800
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:46,500
interesting I take a picture of it and I

801
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,760
send it to our product management I tell

802
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,340
them to go buy one elevator controllers

803
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:53,220
alarm panels cameras You Name It We just

804
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,779
if I see it looks interesting I think

805
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:56,279
it's important we're gonna we're gonna

806
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:58,880
hack on it

807
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,600
Bring it on Bring it on I got my lawyers

808
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,279
number memorized

809
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:09,419
um the um anyway the wise camera

810
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:11,640
um the Amazon Choice wise kind of

811
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,320
consumer grade camera

812
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,179
uh had these interesting features and

813
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:16,620
they were just malicious at the factory

814
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:19,620
when I came from the factory you set it

815
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:22,020
up and it's got audio and video

816
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,480
obviously for camera when you click the

817
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,299
mute button on the web interface that's

818
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:29,340
when the audio stream started back to

819
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,559
China so it started recording and

820
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:33,320
streaming straight back to China

821
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,480
additionally it did it did Port scans on

822
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,340
your entire network this little camera

823
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:41,220
was a great and somehow it made it to

824
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,980
Amazon's number one camera so all these

825
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,360
people are buying this inexpensive

826
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,220
little camera and backdooring their

827
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:50,460
Networks this is kind of the world we're

828
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,840
living in

829
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,820
so there's great opportunity great

830
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,559
research and I would love to talk to you

831
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:58,140
guys about it afterwards

832
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:01,980
so this one front on this is a I put

833
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,500
this in the high drama category

834
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,340
so front on this was about two years ago

835
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:13,620
Fronton is the fsb's global iot exploit

836
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:16,620
platform this product and it's written

837
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,240
in react native it looks like Facebook

838
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,419
it is easy to use it is powerful it is

839
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:23,000
slick

840
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,799
it is designed to hack into every iot

841
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:28,080
device on the planet

842
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,080
now what's funny about it is somebody

843
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,059
hacked the FSB

844
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:36,299
and put it on BitTorrent so now the

845
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:39,659
Russian fsp's Global iot hacking tool is

846
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:42,480
available to download on BitTorrent

847
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,360
this is the world we live in

848
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,399
um I don't mean to beat up on the

849
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:49,500
Russian hackers too much but we do see a

850
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,600
lot of malware coming out of there we do

851
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,360
see a lot of linkages to to GRU out of

852
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,460
the malware and we do see them being

853
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,200
sophisticated it's probably the most

854
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,419
sophisticated nation state

855
00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:04,200
um in in compromising embedded devices

856
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,580
um obviously they've got the front on

857
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,140
tools do that they probably invested

858
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:10,320
tens of millions into that to do it

859
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,899
um the the the routers which were really

860
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:16,139
the Genesis of um my initial thesis the

861
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:18,359
embedded the Netgear devices these are

862
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:20,699
Big Time targets we constantly see these

863
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:24,119
guys getting owned and the um merist

864
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:26,219
botnet the attack Google this week or

865
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:27,719
last week

866
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:29,280
um was run a Meeker tick which is

867
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,440
actually a Latvian device but it's just

868
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,300
one of the most hacked routers in the

869
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,119
world if you're running a micro tick and

870
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:37,619
I've been finding vulnerabilities and me

871
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:39,659
critics for over a decade

872
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:42,300
you just need to replace it it's just

873
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,739
there's just no hope at all for those

874
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:46,098
devices

875
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,119
um the network devices as well including

876
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:50,280
Cisco's and others are being targeted

877
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,280
again remote login I love seeing that

878
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,159
anybody here remember our login

879
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,320
our login right that was that was the

880
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,900
way man that was the easy way to get in

881
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,240
oh dot our host well it hasn't really

882
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,760
improved too much when it comes to

883
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,740
network infrastructure and a lot of

884
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,240
these devices when they get deployed

885
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,000
that simply they're not being set up and

886
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,099
and devices are being changed

887
00:35:16,099 --> 00:35:18,380
Mariah is um

888
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,940
Mariah's kind of the uh steak and

889
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:25,859
potatoes for uh iot malware today and

890
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:28,079
um the Mirai botnet uh came out I guess

891
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,540
about four years ago

892
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,920
um it was pretty relevant to me right

893
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,119
because I'm out there trying to convince

894
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:34,320
people they need to solve an iot

895
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,060
security problem they're telling me they

896
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,640
don't have any iot and

897
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,420
um uh and and then and then Mariah comes

898
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:45,660
out and um Mariah was actually the the

899
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,940
attack vectors initially weren't too too

900
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,280
sophisticated right not not a lot of big

901
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,440
payloads but it was pretty easy right it

902
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,000
was it was default credentials and

903
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,820
logins into these devices in a pivot

904
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,579
um that code base is has matured and

905
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:01,140
it's kind of the common code base now

906
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:05,040
for for iot malware and is

907
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,800
um it'll probably live on forever

908
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,180
um as as the command and control

909
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,400
mechanism so when I look at tools like

910
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,460
front-on and tools like Mirai these are

911
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:17,040
the most widely deployed iot Security

912
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,079
Management tools in the world they just

913
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:20,700
happen to be malicious

914
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,380
so if you're not managing your iot

915
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,760
someone else might be

916
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,740
um my buddy Kevin mandia he just sold to

917
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,060
Google

918
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,859
um they just did a takedown with our

919
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:35,160
socks our socks was another Russian iot

920
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:39,119
botnet and um and mandating law

921
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,520
enforcement you know worked on on

922
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,180
um worked on taking that one down

923
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:49,980
Now Quiet exit is probably

924
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,020
I think I really think white eggs it's

925
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:54,240
probably the most sophisticated embedded

926
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,880
device malware we've seen so far so

927
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,700
until now or until this slide iot

928
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:04,680
malware was really designed for uh uh

929
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,900
exploitation and pivot

930
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,280
um

931
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,040
quad exits really the first apt for

932
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,960
embedded devices and it's an apt that

933
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,880
affects NASA's it's an apt that affects

934
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,560
cameras it's an apt that affects

935
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,780
printers

936
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:21,119
and what's really slick about it is

937
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,240
as an apt it's doing data X fill through

938
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,940
iot so we got lots of people looking at

939
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,099
all every single thing you send out of a

940
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:30,420
computer

941
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,980
but not many people are looking what's

942
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,020
coming out of the printer right people

943
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,119
are kind of blind to that and I I've

944
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:37,500
noticed that

945
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,800
the entire industry has been educated

946
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,099
that this problem can't be solved and

947
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:46,020
that the answer is

948
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,180
just put them on a VLAN

949
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,800
put them behind a firewall and just

950
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,420
forget about it be like locking a

951
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,859
thousand cats in your basement and just

952
00:37:52,859 --> 00:37:55,500
hoping it all works out and

953
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,119
um it's because there's no other

954
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,339
solution and the VLAN solution is

955
00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:01,079
honestly pretty technically easy one oh

956
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:02,640
look at the MAC address throw it on a

957
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,560
VLAN well the Mac addresses in this

958
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,000
world too are all flexible remember I

959
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,320
talked about my Raspberry Pi that likes

960
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,359
to be a Cisco phone all these devices

961
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,700
too can be can can flip their their Mac

962
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:14,280
address to become something else

963
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,940
and I think quite exit this is pretty

964
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,520
recent I think it came out this year

965
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,680
um that um we'll start to see more

966
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,460
sophisticated malware with this

967
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:30,320
one of the things I like to talk about

968
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,000
I get really excited about our serial

969
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,960
ports

970
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,180
it was interesting I was um of course

971
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,820
when I travel if I travel a lot or you

972
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:41,940
know uh I want to want to hijack the TV

973
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,680
and plug my Roku or something into it so

974
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,540
I can stream something when I'm going to

975
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,400
sleep and

976
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,020
um it's interesting my wife was when I

977
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:51,119
was crawled up on the table behind the

978
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,980
TV to unplug the serial connection of

979
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:55,500
the infrared Port my wife said what what

980
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,420
why do you have to do that

981
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,579
and I was explaining to her that in a

982
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:01,020
smart TV

983
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:04,380
the serial Port is like the brain stem

984
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,000
and if you think about computers

985
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
historically in iot today most of them

986
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,940
have some kind of an rs-232 serial

987
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:14,339
interface that is the lowest common

988
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:17,400
denominator of communications to an

989
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,200
embedded device is serial Communications

990
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,280
and it's old guys who had set up modems

991
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:27,060
had to fabricate cables and uh my

992
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,980
co-founder Earl

993
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,619
was employee number eight at unet which

994
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:34,140
was the first big ISP he actually

995
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:36,960
fabricated the cable to connect AOL to

996
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,540
the internet he made it himself

997
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:42,359
so serial Communications

998
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:44,460
and honestly for us gen xers they're a

999
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,800
bit of a superpower because a lot of

1000
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,720
people younger people have never had to

1001
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,400
make a Serial cable there's been no need

1002
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,119
to

1003
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:52,740
so the serial cable is the brain stem

1004
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,540
the serial cable allows you to really

1005
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:57,180
bypass everything on boot but what's

1006
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,800
also interesting about the serial cables

1007
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,260
serial Communications is you can measure

1008
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,440
the brains of a device

1009
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,599
based on what the cable is

1010
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:10,680
so a DB9 you don't see many db25s a DB9

1011
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:13,140
a little d-shaped connector

1012
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:15,660
has a bandwidth of about 115 kilobits

1013
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:18,359
per second right

1014
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:21,300
fast forward to USBC which is also a

1015
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,579
Serial cable which has gigabits of

1016
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:25,140
communication

1017
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,720
when I look at a device I look at the

1018
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,579
serial port and the reason I look at the

1019
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:31,200
serial Port I can look at the serial

1020
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,700
port and I can size up the brains of

1021
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,520
that device because the serial port

1022
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,859
defines how much firmware you can get on

1023
00:40:37,859 --> 00:40:39,240
that device

1024
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,300
with a diva a low speed serial connector

1025
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:45,000
you can be assured that the firmware or

1026
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,440
operating system on that device is

1027
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,599
measured probably less than 10 megabytes

1028
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:52,200
and as we move up to USB a minute micro

1029
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:56,820
USB mini USB USBC the bandwidth

1030
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:59,820
increased and as the bandwidth increased

1031
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:02,160
the brain the CPU on that system on the

1032
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,839
chip also had to increase to keep up

1033
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,880
with the speeds of that port and with

1034
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,460
that came more software and with more

1035
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,579
software comes more vulnerabilities

1036
00:41:10,579 --> 00:41:14,339
across the board Miko hyponen just put a

1037
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:15,300
book out

1038
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,880
and I I love his tagline I'm gonna

1039
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,339
plagiarize it all day long if it's smart

1040
00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:22,440
it's vulnerable really it's probably

1041
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,960
gonna be a subject for my next time but

1042
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,240
the smarter something is the more

1043
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,579
vulnerable it is across the board so as

1044
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:31,020
these devices get more and more

1045
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,820
sophisticated when you see a device with

1046
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,800
a gigabyte of firmware

1047
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,200
I'm a car guy and I just got a new radar

1048
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,599
detector and I'd upgraded the firmware

1049
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,280
on my radar detector my radar detector

1050
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,380
connects to Wi-Fi it's so cool

1051
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,900
the firmware on my radar detector is a

1052
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:46,680
gig

1053
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,980
a gig that's more than every Windows

1054
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:52,260
operating system put together and it's

1055
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,540
running on a tiny little box

1056
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,579
now all that software is on there

1057
00:41:56,579 --> 00:41:58,200
because it's easier to write software

1058
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,119
when you have those tools

1059
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:02,880
but no one is going behind and patching

1060
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,040
all those shared libraries they had

1061
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,400
so plc's so the plcs these guys are all

1062
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,760
running zero ports old serial ports

1063
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,839
um and there's a reason for it when

1064
00:42:12,839 --> 00:42:15,000
these devices are purchased they have a

1065
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,119
40-year lifespan so think about that in

1066
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:21,839
the world of OT every computer and I see

1067
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:23,579
these as all as computers they just look

1068
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:27,000
different than computers every computer

1069
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,500
um

1070
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,680
um is is running some type of firmware

1071
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,000
and the

1072
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,380
um

1073
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,119
it's designed for run for 40 years

1074
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:38,880
imagine if you were expected to use your

1075
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,880
iPhone for four years or your laptop for

1076
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,920
40 years really what's under the hood is

1077
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,140
pretty much the same

1078
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:48,900
but this industry is set up so

1079
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,599
differently than everything else in it

1080
00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:54,240
they use proprietary protocols

1081
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,300
their response to Guys Like Us to find a

1082
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,160
vulnerability is to have their lawyer

1083
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,140
send you a letter right these guys are

1084
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,819
hard to deal with they don't like being

1085
00:43:02,819 --> 00:43:04,319
they don't like vulnerabilities being

1086
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,240
found and

1087
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,700
um uh I think there's a lot of room for

1088
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,260
Innovation here

1089
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,540
but a lot of challenges because these

1090
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,520
devices these are you know 20 30 year

1091
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,440
old computers that run the most

1092
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:19,079
important things in our world

1093
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:22,140
um and

1094
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:24,780
people have really tried to isolate them

1095
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:28,619
and so when when I look at security of

1096
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:30,420
embedded devices that are hidden behind

1097
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:33,240
firewalls and hidden on vlans

1098
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,800
but they don't change the passwords and

1099
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,440
they don't patch the firmware it you

1100
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,060
just know the entropy is going to occur

1101
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:41,400
and those devices will become exposed

1102
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,680
and so I think it's going to be a long

1103
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,780
haul in this industry but I really think

1104
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:47,940
it's important to get these devices

1105
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:50,040
secured before someone else causes

1106
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,720
Mayhem

1107
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:52,800
okay

1108
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,319
this is more the fun stuff these are

1109
00:43:55,319 --> 00:43:57,660
some of my favorite hacks from iot that

1110
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:59,819
I've found over the last five years and

1111
00:43:59,819 --> 00:44:02,700
these are not what you look at as a

1112
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:05,099
typical iot device

1113
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:07,619
KVM switches everybody knows what KVM

1114
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:09,839
switch is right if you think about it a

1115
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:13,079
KVM switch is fundamentally important to

1116
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:15,720
it the KVM switch allows us to Multiplex

1117
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:18,540
One keyboard mouse and monitor across 64

1118
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:21,240
128 servers

1119
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,339
one of my favorites is

1120
00:44:23,339 --> 00:44:25,380
um the absent kvms

1121
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:27,540
I pulled apart an avacyn KVM because we

1122
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,460
run into them all the time they are

1123
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:34,319
running Ubuntu version 10. 10. now why a

1124
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:36,060
keyboard switch needs to run a full

1125
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:37,920
Linux operating system is somewhat

1126
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,260
beyond me but it was probably easier to

1127
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,079
develop software that way and

1128
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:45,300
um really across the board we find that

1129
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:48,060
the KVM switches are not patched the

1130
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,800
credentials aren't managed and think

1131
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,880
about this

1132
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,060
the device that puts your keyboard on

1133
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:56,339
your most valuable servers is one of the

1134
00:44:56,339 --> 00:44:59,280
least secure things out there it's truly

1135
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,740
remarkable why even bother securing the

1136
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,839
servers if you can't secure the keyboard

1137
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:04,980
and mouse because once you've got the

1138
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:07,200
keyboard it's game over

1139
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,819
another one on the servers

1140
00:45:11,339 --> 00:45:13,260
um and this is one of my favorite

1141
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:18,300
default password pairs the HP ILO

1142
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,339
so I have three three manufacturers that

1143
00:45:20,339 --> 00:45:21,839
make lights out management controllers

1144
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:23,040
if you're not familiar with lights out

1145
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,720
management controller so this is a

1146
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,859
computer

1147
00:45:25,859 --> 00:45:27,780
and this is a computer inside the

1148
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,460
computer and the computer inside the

1149
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,920
computer is an embedded iot device and

1150
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,420
the purpose of that computer is solely

1151
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:35,520
to access the big computer when it stops

1152
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,560
working however these things are really

1153
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,540
friendly they're very easy to use

1154
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:42,180
they'll pop up you load up a hole if you

1155
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:43,980
don't even have an SSH client it'll give

1156
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:46,560
you one via Java no one changes the

1157
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,480
passwords on these things

1158
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,420
root Calvin on the I lows the super

1159
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:53,460
micros and Dells also have similar

1160
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,619
issues and there's actually live malware

1161
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:58,260
out there on these there was recently a

1162
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:01,500
case in the IBM Cloud where some Bad

1163
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,599
actors rented a couple hundred servers

1164
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:06,060
put malware on the out of that imagine

1165
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,579
controllers terminate the contract the

1166
00:46:08,579 --> 00:46:10,500
next customers they got they got the

1167
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,420
malware right no one's thinking about

1168
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:14,339
zapping these things when they reset

1169
00:46:14,339 --> 00:46:16,079
them

1170
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:17,760
it's funny when people come to visit our

1171
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,560
office we've got a lot of these servers

1172
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,420
and recs pretty much every one of them

1173
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:24,359
and the the way my business works is if

1174
00:46:24,359 --> 00:46:25,980
I'm going to support a vendor I have to

1175
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:28,260
own every product they make or at least

1176
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:30,660
every product buy firmware for that

1177
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:32,280
vendor

1178
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:35,640
a typical smart APC rack has four or

1179
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,079
five network interfaces in it there's

1180
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:40,500
one for the fans one for one for uh one

1181
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,200
or two for the smart power strips and

1182
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,060
again these devices once they're

1183
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:46,440
deployed

1184
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,180
as Obi likes to say they're usually

1185
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,099
deployed by an engineer not a security

1186
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:52,619
guy they're just there to get it working

1187
00:46:52,619 --> 00:46:54,720
and I fundamentally believe in this

1188
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,720
world iot that's the underlying problem

1189
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,880
in the world of I.T we really deal with

1190
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,260
four or five core operating system

1191
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:03,060
vendors right and they're good Bill

1192
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:04,680
Gates really changed the world 20 years

1193
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:07,440
ago when he trained 10 000 developers on

1194
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,119
how to write secure code

1195
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:13,020
he had an existential crisis if in 2003

1196
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:14,880
if Microsoft kept getting hacked they

1197
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,740
were going to get replaced so he solved

1198
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,060
the problem he really set the standard

1199
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:19,740
for the industry Microsoft went from

1200
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:22,980
being a joke to Serious insecurity we

1201
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:25,260
have thousands of vendors there's simply

1202
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:26,760
no way that prioritization and

1203
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,440
investment resource is going to happen

1204
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,780
and so I believe because I watched the

1205
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:33,480
iterations of firmware come out that the

1206
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:34,680
vendors are really just trying to get

1207
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,540
the thing to work they're trying to get

1208
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:38,099
the thing to work they're trying to get

1209
00:47:38,099 --> 00:47:39,720
it out on time before Christmas if it's

1210
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,339
consumer get it out on time for the next

1211
00:47:41,339 --> 00:47:42,900
buying cycle

1212
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:44,339
think about this if you're the product

1213
00:47:44,339 --> 00:47:46,859
manager for a let's say a doorbell

1214
00:47:46,859 --> 00:47:47,940
company

1215
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:49,859
do you really want to go do a code audit

1216
00:47:49,859 --> 00:47:51,119
for three months or do you want to get

1217
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,339
that product out so it's out on Amazon

1218
00:47:53,339 --> 00:47:55,079
pressures on the competitive pressure's

1219
00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:57,180
on and um

1220
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:58,800
uh

1221
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,319
um it is uh

1222
00:48:01,319 --> 00:48:03,420
it creates opportunity to to build

1223
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:05,819
remediation I will give a funny anecdote

1224
00:48:05,819 --> 00:48:09,780
so one of one of my favorite investors

1225
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:12,720
um the Bessemer David Cowan I was taking

1226
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,819
I won't name the vendor but anyway there

1227
00:48:14,819 --> 00:48:17,520
was a Smart Lock that I decided I want

1228
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,319
to go after he'd invested in it so I

1229
00:48:19,319 --> 00:48:20,880
said ah David I'm going to take a look

1230
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,160
at this thing for you so I sent him a

1231
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,140
picture of this Smart Lock This is the

1232
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:27,720
venture capitalist on the board of this

1233
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:30,359
Smart Lock taken apart on my desk you

1234
00:48:30,359 --> 00:48:34,160
know on on the lab bench and um

1235
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,500
two weeks later there was a massive

1236
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,660
firmware update for this company they

1237
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:41,760
knew because I was looking at it that we

1238
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,140
were going to find vulnerabilities and

1239
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:44,940
they pushed an update but it's

1240
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,680
representative in that they didn't do

1241
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,960
something until they knew someone was

1242
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,700
coming for him and I was polite about it

1243
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:52,140
right I told him I was hey I'm going to

1244
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:53,160
look at this I think it's interesting

1245
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:56,339
and so the door controllers are really

1246
00:48:56,339 --> 00:48:58,260
one of my favorites we talk about

1247
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:00,119
doorbells in the consumer the door

1248
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:03,020
controllers and the Enterprise

1249
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:05,160
I've closed several deals based on door

1250
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:08,520
controllers so the door controllers I

1251
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:09,900
think are representative as to how you

1252
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:13,099
look at your cyber security posture

1253
00:49:13,099 --> 00:49:17,220
I've I I've maybe seen

1254
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,500
out of a maybe a thousand door

1255
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:20,880
controllers and these door controllers

1256
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,280
control 6 400 doors at a pop right not

1257
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,619
one they control the whole system I

1258
00:49:25,619 --> 00:49:27,180
haven't seen a Tyco product with a

1259
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:28,859
password or no I have maybe four or five

1260
00:49:28,859 --> 00:49:31,980
times someone changed the password 95 of

1261
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,900
the time the door controller password is

1262
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:36,300
Taiko Taiko no one is about to change it

1263
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:38,339
because the Tyco installation guy is not

1264
00:49:38,339 --> 00:49:40,859
a cyber security guy the CSO guy isn't

1265
00:49:40,859 --> 00:49:43,680
the door guy there's this big gap and

1266
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,339
that's the opportunity to fix

1267
00:49:46,339 --> 00:49:48,780
printers love and hate them

1268
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:51,540
I had an existential challenge

1269
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:54,060
I remember exactly what it was black hat

1270
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:56,220
2019 checkpoint announced

1271
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:58,440
vulnerabilities in 18 000 unique

1272
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:01,020
printers right if I'm the guy who has to

1273
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:02,160
secure the printers and I don't really

1274
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,900
like the printers

1275
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,300
I said man this is it like if we can't

1276
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,160
solve this problem we should just close

1277
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,260
our doors how are we gonna how are we

1278
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:12,060
going to secure eighteen thousand

1279
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:13,020
printers

1280
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:15,180
and what we found was

1281
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:18,960
that while the diversity in iot

1282
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,720
um leads for opportunity in securing a

1283
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,819
large various devices

1284
00:50:23,819 --> 00:50:26,339
there is commonality across multiple

1285
00:50:26,339 --> 00:50:28,680
devices in that they use common firmware

1286
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:31,319
operating systems there's still a lot of

1287
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:33,900
firmware operating systems out there but

1288
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,660
what I found was out of these 18 000

1289
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:40,740
printers from HP brother Lexmark Rico

1290
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:42,720
that they they were using less than 10

1291
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,119
different firmware operating system so

1292
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,940
the lever I used was I only need 10

1293
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:50,160
printers and I can figure out the

1294
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,619
problems in all eighteen thousand and

1295
00:50:52,619 --> 00:50:55,619
that was our that was a big aha moment

1296
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:58,380
for us to be able to say

1297
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:01,440
the diversity of iot does not prevent us

1298
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,200
from securing it it's challenging but

1299
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:07,079
the lever is the commonality in the

1300
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:09,960
firmware operating systems

1301
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:13,020
the VoIP phones are also interesting the

1302
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:14,760
um you know we do see a big move away

1303
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:17,099
from VoIP phones to soft phones I think

1304
00:51:17,099 --> 00:51:18,599
you know eventually the phones are going

1305
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:21,240
to go away with the keyboards too uh but

1306
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:22,680
they're going to be around for a long

1307
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:25,500
time and this is these devices are

1308
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:28,380
almost always put on vlans

1309
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:30,420
and um

1310
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:36,300
the um but what we see in um uh in uh

1311
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,880
the entropy of these devices it reminds

1312
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,559
me of the entropy they talked about in

1313
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:42,839
the first Jurassic Park about how these

1314
00:51:42,839 --> 00:51:44,880
dinosaurs are gonna Escape they're gonna

1315
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,200
breed

1316
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:50,640
the phone's drift all devices drift all

1317
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,020
devices that are put on a VLAN

1318
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:54,839
eventually over time some powers from

1319
00:51:54,839 --> 00:51:57,720
that population escapes the VLAN it just

1320
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:00,119
happens it does typically about 10

1321
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:01,140
percent

1322
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:03,480
and a lot of these devices right they

1323
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:05,099
put them on a VLAN not going to worry

1324
00:52:05,099 --> 00:52:06,180
about patching I'm not going to worry

1325
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:08,520
about passwords and

1326
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,680
um yeah this is a great example so we

1327
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:13,740
had a customer at had 31 000 phones 28

1328
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:15,599
000 won a VLAN 3 000 worth not so we

1329
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:17,940
found 3 000 more than they wanted they

1330
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:20,940
only had 700 critical cves right

1331
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:22,859
generally when I talk to people they

1332
00:52:22,859 --> 00:52:25,559
don't want one critical cve

1333
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:27,599
um let alone let alone

1334
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:28,859
um seven

1335
00:52:28,859 --> 00:52:30,900
700.

1336
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:34,020
um this was another one that actually I

1337
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:35,819
think this one's pretty cool

1338
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,680
um in financial services trade

1339
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,859
synchronization is a serious business

1340
00:52:39,859 --> 00:52:43,500
and um we've been finding atomic clocks

1341
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:46,079
on Enterprise networks that are used to

1342
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:48,240
synchronize all the trades billions of

1343
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:51,119
dollars of exposure all tied to a single

1344
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:54,839
iot device that's a clock

1345
00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:57,240
no one thought about the clock no one

1346
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,800
thought about the clock do you secure

1347
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,839
the clock how important is the clock I

1348
00:53:00,839 --> 00:53:01,980
actually haven't torn one of these down

1349
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:04,200
yet now that I'm looking at right now I

1350
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,640
think I should

1351
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,079
um

1352
00:53:07,079 --> 00:53:09,119
all the devices I've showed you probably

1353
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:11,300
are not what you expected to see for iot

1354
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:13,859
this is how we think about what the real

1355
00:53:13,859 --> 00:53:15,780
iot exposures are in the Enterprise

1356
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:19,020
there's one I haven't shown yet but I

1357
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:21,839
was talking about earlier this is just

1358
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:24,780
the the big gorilla out there and it's

1359
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:27,540
not going away people love surveillance

1360
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:30,359
people love their cameras

1361
00:53:30,359 --> 00:53:33,599
um we're in Dubai and um I started the

1362
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:35,220
last minute switch my hotel and stay at

1363
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:37,619
the at the Burge just because I wanted

1364
00:53:37,619 --> 00:53:40,079
to I just wanted the experience so I'm

1365
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:42,000
walking around down there and this is a

1366
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,339
number one terrorist Target in Dubai the

1367
00:53:44,339 --> 00:53:47,420
Burj and I'm walking around and I'm lost

1368
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:51,420
like this thing is huge

1369
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:54,420
some dude gets on speaker the elevator

1370
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:57,180
tells me where to start going there's so

1371
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:58,619
many cameras there they're watching them

1372
00:53:58,619 --> 00:53:59,460
all

1373
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:02,819
and um when I look at these devices I

1374
00:54:02,819 --> 00:54:05,520
don't see a camera I see a Linux server

1375
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,920
I see a Linux server wrapped in plastic

1376
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,579
with a bubble on it that is really that

1377
00:54:11,579 --> 00:54:13,680
is full of vulnerabilities that is

1378
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,960
unpatched in the most sophisticated

1379
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:19,500
environments and um they're probably

1380
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:22,859
15 or so cameras that vendors that

1381
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:25,440
dominate Enterprise

1382
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,859
all of them have serious issues right

1383
00:54:28,859 --> 00:54:31,260
they took a busy box they took a Linux

1384
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:32,819
they threw it on here and they're

1385
00:54:32,819 --> 00:54:35,339
focused on getting 4K working they're

1386
00:54:35,339 --> 00:54:38,099
focused on PTZ they're focused on cool

1387
00:54:38,099 --> 00:54:39,599
features so the security guard can

1388
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:41,640
holler at me in the elevator they're not

1389
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,680
worried about backdoor passwords they're

1390
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,800
definitely not don't know what a cve is

1391
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:49,140
and we even had one axis in February

1392
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:51,119
this year and I think access is a good

1393
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:53,400
company access gets beat up a lot and

1394
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,960
but I think access is a good company to

1395
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,880
make good products and I like them

1396
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:57,960
because even though they have a lot of

1397
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:59,400
vulnerabilities they always patch

1398
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,400
quickly but this time February was a bad

1399
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,800
month for them because someone hacked

1400
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,740
their firmware CDN right so now you got

1401
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:09,780
the other side of that not only you got

1402
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:11,579
vulnerabilities in all these devices you

1403
00:55:11,579 --> 00:55:14,099
got a firmware issue but now old school

1404
00:55:14,099 --> 00:55:16,500
let's go after the CDN and start messing

1405
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:18,240
around with the firmware so we have to

1406
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:21,140
kind of worry about that

1407
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:25,200
and as we go beyond Enterprise iot

1408
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,000
um you know there are a lot of

1409
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,859
interesting verticals here

1410
00:55:28,859 --> 00:55:31,200
uh smart buildings and cities a lot of

1411
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,460
the a lot of the kind of off-shelf

1412
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:33,960
technology that I showed you live here

1413
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,640
but the deployment is different

1414
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:39,000
medical devices comes up consistently we

1415
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,520
we just did a medical deployment

1416
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:45,240
the found these x-ray machines it's

1417
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:47,940
as a hacker you kind of feel embarrassed

1418
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:49,980
for whoever put the software on that

1419
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:51,420
thing because the numbers of

1420
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:53,339
vulnerabilities are are really absurd

1421
00:55:53,339 --> 00:55:55,020
and

1422
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:57,000
um I think we'll see this across the

1423
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:57,960
board

1424
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,819
and I fundamentally believe there's a

1425
00:55:59,819 --> 00:56:02,579
common theme in why firmware

1426
00:56:02,579 --> 00:56:04,440
is built in secure

1427
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,119
it's because you're developing software

1428
00:56:06,119 --> 00:56:09,960
quickly the easiest route to get the

1429
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:12,119
software out is to use other people's

1430
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:14,160
open source software everybody does it

1431
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,780
it's you know the building blocks of how

1432
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:16,980
we build the internet

1433
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:19,079
however

1434
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:20,460
if you don't have a whole security team

1435
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,260
looking at that stuff you don't have a

1436
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:23,819
whole security team patching every

1437
00:56:23,819 --> 00:56:25,319
vulnerability that comes up in your

1438
00:56:25,319 --> 00:56:27,780
inherited tree of Open Source software

1439
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:30,240
you inherit those vulnerabilities

1440
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,099
and so these vendors don't have the

1441
00:56:32,099 --> 00:56:34,800
ability to maintain State on every open

1442
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:38,460
source Library they're using uh to to

1443
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:40,619
build their products and therefore they

1444
00:56:40,619 --> 00:56:43,920
end up with a lot of end days a lot of

1445
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,140
end days in there now a lot of them

1446
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:47,819
aren't necessarily Network exposed but

1447
00:56:47,819 --> 00:56:50,819
anything that is can be game over and

1448
00:56:50,819 --> 00:56:52,680
I'm seeing more and more I mean there's

1449
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:56,040
a reason I'm an old guy still uh still

1450
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:58,740
using squash fesk and Bin walk because I

1451
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:00,119
know there's probably a one in four

1452
00:57:00,119 --> 00:57:02,460
chance if I dig in deep into firmware

1453
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:04,920
I'm going to find a hard-coded default

1454
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:07,500
password that's weekly encrypted and

1455
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:09,140
sometimes even a back door

1456
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:11,819
and you know it what we would call a

1457
00:57:11,819 --> 00:57:14,160
back door these vendors sometimes call a

1458
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,140
feature once you sign up for support

1459
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:18,480
they say oh this is favorite of mine I

1460
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,740
found last week

1461
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:22,380
printer manufacturer Rico oh no problem

1462
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:24,839
you lost your admin password

1463
00:57:24,839 --> 00:57:27,000
use the supervisor account it doesn't

1464
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,240
have a password that's how you fix it

1465
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:33,780
this is 2022 and this is that is some

1466
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:35,640
1982

1467
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:38,839
security thinking

1468
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:42,540
so big picture nobody knows what's on

1469
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:44,099
their Network

1470
00:57:44,099 --> 00:57:45,839
people haven't paid attention to this

1471
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:47,760
there's a reason for it the traditional

1472
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,500
vulnerability management tools we built

1473
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:52,380
in the 90s rapid seven tenable qualis

1474
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:54,420
all great tools for assessing computer

1475
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:57,180
vulnerabilities are not good for these

1476
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:58,500
little computers

1477
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,839
those all Technologies were built before

1478
00:58:00,839 --> 00:58:03,780
the term iot even existed

1479
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,339
there's going to be a lot of room for

1480
00:58:05,339 --> 00:58:07,200
Innovation there's going to be a lot of

1481
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,059
room for more companies a lot of other

1482
00:58:09,059 --> 00:58:11,400
great companies in this space here

1483
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:14,160
and I think we'll see more and I hope to

1484
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,020
see a lot of vulnerability research at

1485
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:18,540
Future hack in the boxes this is an

1486
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:20,640
important conference an event to me you

1487
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,980
know I want to sponsor Dylan as long as

1488
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:25,800
he's around doing this until we both get

1489
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:26,520
old

1490
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:29,760
and it's funny as a Founder um every now

1491
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,440
and then actually pretty often people

1492
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,059
say what's your exit strategy what's

1493
00:58:33,059 --> 00:58:36,240
your exit strategy man I just got I've

1494
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,859
had a lab of these things in my house

1495
00:58:37,859 --> 00:58:39,960
for decades now I have an office to put

1496
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:41,160
them in and I get to go to work and do

1497
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:44,460
it all day I love this job I love fun of

1498
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:46,440
vulnerabilities and things I love fixing

1499
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,119
them and I think there's going to be a

1500
00:58:48,119 --> 00:58:50,700
big industry here and I would love to

1501
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:52,260
talk to anybody about this afterwards

1502
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:54,059
talk about what we were doing talk about

1503
00:58:54,059 --> 00:58:56,280
ideas for what you want to do talk about

1504
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:58,980
vulnerability research and um thank you

1505
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:01,380
guys for accepting my talk that means a

1506
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:03,900
lot to me this is a competitive event to

1507
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:05,760
be accepted to

1508
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,440
um and not everybody gets accepted not

1509
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:10,440
many people do and um I appreciate it

1510
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:12,359
and thank you very much

1511
00:59:12,359 --> 00:59:15,359
foreign

1512
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,260
[Applause]

1513
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:20,940
thank you Chris I think I speak for

1514
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:22,740
everyone and we asked how do we get into

1515
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:24,599
our Visa test all of this different

1516
00:59:24,599 --> 00:59:27,180
equipment we you have how do we how do

1517
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:31,020
we get into our lab yeah so you know uh

1518
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:33,240
during coven uh

1519
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,700
uh I decided I was gonna put my office

1520
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:37,799
where I wanted it so we had an office in

1521
00:59:37,799 --> 00:59:40,260
Georgia with norfolks California

1522
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:42,000
we decided we wanted to move to

1523
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,980
Nashville Tennessee which is a very cool

1524
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:46,020
City and my lab is there and I'm happy

1525
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:48,839
to have any of you come visit and I've

1526
00:59:48,839 --> 00:59:50,099
thought about putting our lab on the

1527
00:59:50,099 --> 00:59:51,660
Internet or a lab on the internet

1528
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:54,420
because it is a hard thing to just

1529
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:56,819
acquire these Technologies get them

1530
00:59:56,819 --> 00:59:58,559
working you basically have to buy them

1531
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:01,140
all on eBay right all these devices come

1532
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:03,720
from somewhere I can't afford to go buy

1533
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:06,240
a 20 000 plc

1534
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,579
but those plc's go someplace and they go

1535
01:00:08,579 --> 01:00:11,160
to eBay it's a great source of used

1536
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:12,660
devices they all came from somewhere

1537
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:14,940
they're interesting and you just got to

1538
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:16,920
do it but it is hard work I'll tell you

1539
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:18,720
you better you better figure out how to

1540
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:19,799
make serial cables because a lot of

1541
01:00:19,799 --> 01:00:21,079
these devices when they come to you

1542
01:00:21,079 --> 01:00:23,640
they're not in a good shape and you got

1543
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:25,980
to start from the ground up so I'm

1544
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:27,540
teaching kids how to make fabricate

1545
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:28,920
serial cables these days just to talk

1546
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:31,380
these devices but it is a it is a really

1547
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:33,960
fun space I really encourage anybody to

1548
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:36,119
dig into it there you go guys Pro tip

1549
01:00:36,119 --> 01:00:37,920
we've got a few questions from the

1550
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:39,240
audience yes

1551
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:41,940
um let's see the first one is

1552
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:43,920
it seems that the industry needs a

1553
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,960
really simple way to install an AV or

1554
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:48,059
EDR Solution that's compatible and free

1555
01:00:48,059 --> 01:00:50,940
for iot the basic cyber security hygiene

1556
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:53,640
seems to be missing on these devices is

1557
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:55,619
there a fundamental shift that is needed

1558
01:00:55,619 --> 01:00:58,440
before this problem gets worse yes there

1559
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:01,619
needs to be xdr for iot absolutely but

1560
01:01:01,619 --> 01:01:03,420
the thing is you will never run an agent

1561
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:06,000
on these devices period Google even gave

1562
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,339
up Google recently shut down the iot

1563
01:01:08,339 --> 01:01:10,799
core project the Google ilt core project

1564
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:13,380
was to pull data from iot devices it

1565
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:15,240
required vendors to put a stub code in

1566
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:17,520
on their firmware no one did it if

1567
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:19,200
Google can't do it if Google cannot get

1568
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,359
people to modify their firmware who can

1569
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:23,760
so no we're on our own none of these

1570
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,319
vendors are going to install agents you

1571
01:01:25,319 --> 01:01:27,299
got to do it agentless to do it agent

1572
01:01:27,299 --> 01:01:28,980
list

1573
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:31,200
if I think of myself as a superpower I

1574
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,599
want to be C-3PO I am a protocol Droid

1575
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:35,280
and I talk to millions of different

1576
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:38,220
machines that's how I see what we do you

1577
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:39,359
got to be able to talk to them in their

1578
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:40,799
native language because if you don't

1579
01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:44,040
they'll crash and the um there will

1580
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:45,480
never be an agent on these devices so

1581
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:48,180
there will be an iot xdr Market it'll

1582
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:50,819
probably happen soon I want to be in it

1583
01:01:50,819 --> 01:01:52,619
awesome I think that touches on the

1584
01:01:52,619 --> 01:01:54,119
second question as well um Google

1585
01:01:54,119 --> 01:01:55,319
recently announced that they were

1586
01:01:55,319 --> 01:01:57,660
shutting down the iot car services do

1587
01:01:57,660 --> 01:01:59,160
you foresee this having a notable

1588
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:02,520
implication for the iot community wow so

1589
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:04,200
someone just asked a question I gave as

1590
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:07,020
an answer I mean for me for two one way

1591
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:09,540
the two ways I looked at that one was

1592
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:12,839
okay I understand right No One's Gonna

1593
01:02:12,839 --> 01:02:15,059
Take a third party firmware right how

1594
01:02:15,059 --> 01:02:17,640
many companies OEM their security

1595
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:20,040
software to Microsoft or Dell nobody

1596
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,420
really does they do their own thing

1597
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:22,980
there is not going to be a market to

1598
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:24,540
license third-party software to Firmware

1599
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:26,579
it's just not going to happen and and

1600
01:02:26,579 --> 01:02:30,480
Google failed at it and uh so I so one

1601
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,220
way it concerns me a little bit because

1602
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:33,599
I think

1603
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:34,859
um investors might say well Google

1604
01:02:34,859 --> 01:02:36,540
couldn't solve this problem nobody can

1605
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:39,059
but we're obsessed with solving this

1606
01:02:39,059 --> 01:02:40,619
problem but the thing is you got to talk

1607
01:02:40,619 --> 01:02:42,720
to them so it's got to be agentless

1608
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,579
Google failed with an agent list an

1609
01:02:44,579 --> 01:02:46,740
agent it's got to be agentless

1610
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:48,900
all right thank you and the third

1611
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:51,059
question we have on thread actors

1612
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:53,579
exploiting iot devices have you observed

1613
01:02:53,579 --> 01:02:55,319
any notable differences in the targeting

1614
01:02:55,319 --> 01:02:56,819
patterns between Hands-On keyboard

1615
01:02:56,819 --> 01:02:59,339
actors who said versus automated attacks

1616
01:02:59,339 --> 01:03:02,220
from botnet such as Mirai

1617
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:05,700
yeah I mean the um the uh the thing is

1618
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:07,200
the population of these targets is so

1619
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,640
much bigger than the desktops out there

1620
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,680
you can pretty much drop one of these on

1621
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:12,480
the internet and let it rip you don't

1622
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,460
really need to be targeted if you have a

1623
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:15,839
decent exploit in a decent population

1624
01:03:15,839 --> 01:03:17,700
with a couple million devices it's going

1625
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:19,680
to get a foothold it's you know it

1626
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,240
reminds me of the good old days of SQL

1627
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:22,740
Slammer where you could send a single

1628
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:23,940
packet out to the internet and take it

1629
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:26,280
down and that's really the word we're

1630
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:28,619
dealing with in iot today

1631
01:03:28,619 --> 01:03:30,960
all right thanks and the last one for

1632
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,880
for today how do you see certification

1633
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:36,359
of devices as an obstacle to security uh

1634
01:03:36,359 --> 01:03:38,579
such as x-ray machines

1635
01:03:38,579 --> 01:03:41,819
I'll tell you as a lifelong hacker I'm

1636
01:03:41,819 --> 01:03:43,859
not a big fan of certifications because

1637
01:03:43,859 --> 01:03:45,540
the certification is only as strong as

1638
01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:46,980
you know the certifying body I

1639
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:49,319
understand it sets the bar of things I

1640
01:03:49,319 --> 01:03:52,319
was just telling obey this morning we we

1641
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:56,099
just uh are working in healthcare with a

1642
01:03:56,099 --> 01:03:58,079
customer and we found their x-ray

1643
01:03:58,079 --> 01:03:59,099
machines

1644
01:03:59,099 --> 01:04:02,540
their x-ray machine had 33 critical cves

1645
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:06,359
it had a default password and this one

1646
01:04:06,359 --> 01:04:08,640
just made my head explode

1647
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:12,980
it had two different SSH servers on it

1648
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:15,540
like and you can just look at that and

1649
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:17,880
say what were they thinking that they

1650
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:19,319
were not thinking about this at all to

1651
01:04:19,319 --> 01:04:23,099
have two different code bases for SSH

1652
01:04:23,099 --> 01:04:24,720
and most of these guys have talented

1653
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:27,780
anyway and FTP is still running so I

1654
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:29,400
think x-ray machines are going to be

1655
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,140
awful

1656
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:33,660
um and um because they fundamentally

1657
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:34,980
weren't designed to be exposed to a

1658
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:37,559
hostile environment and that's what they

1659
01:04:37,559 --> 01:04:39,480
are they're in now

1660
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:42,420
all right thank you

1661
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:44,960
okay

1662
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:55,380
yes

1663
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:59,280
in order

1664
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:01,980
in order to change uh to install new

1665
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:03,720
software on it

1666
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:06,119
um you actually need to go through that

1667
01:05:06,119 --> 01:05:09,000
certification process again and that's

1668
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,920
the aspect that I was

1669
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:13,020
um trying to get so okay that's I I

1670
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:15,180
thank you for clarifying so we do run to

1671
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:16,680
this we're running this OT as well we

1672
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:18,540
were all in some medical I'm personally

1673
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:20,640
actually my company we're taking

1674
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:23,220
Healthcare slow because

1675
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:25,559
there are a lot of life safety issues

1676
01:05:25,559 --> 01:05:28,319
and that Market's really not ready for

1677
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:30,420
automated firmware Management in my

1678
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:31,980
opinion

1679
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:33,839
um but just as you said the firmware has

1680
01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:36,000
got to be validated to make sure that

1681
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,339
the radiation dose is not high what if a

1682
01:05:38,339 --> 01:05:40,740
hacker modifies the firmware to increase

1683
01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:42,119
the radiation dose I haven't even

1684
01:05:42,119 --> 01:05:43,920
thought about that

1685
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:44,880
um so

1686
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,799
um the FDA has done some work here in

1687
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:50,099
the states to require uh the the

1688
01:05:50,099 --> 01:05:52,200
reasonable management of firmware on

1689
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,660
those devices but there's they're not

1690
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:56,220
really any teeth to it I think you bring

1691
01:05:56,220 --> 01:05:57,900
up a great problem and we see the same

1692
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:01,200
thing in the OT Market which is hey we

1693
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:01,920
have

1694
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,900
all of a sudden these computers these

1695
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:04,980
are just computers and they're

1696
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:06,359
vulnerable and they don't have passwords

1697
01:06:06,359 --> 01:06:07,680
on them but they're controlling Health

1698
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:10,020
life and safety issues how do we even

1699
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:12,180
get our heads around that

1700
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:14,819
um and um so the certification of

1701
01:06:14,819 --> 01:06:17,339
firmware on those devices by the vendors

1702
01:06:17,339 --> 01:06:19,200
in a qualifying body I think is very

1703
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:20,760
important

1704
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:23,819
um I think the though those those

1705
01:06:23,819 --> 01:06:26,160
certifications so someone who is looking

1706
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:28,400
for a lethal dose of radiation

1707
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:33,660
might not be looking for a uh a private

1708
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:35,520
SSH key that's somewhere buried on the

1709
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:37,880
firmware

1710
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:42,180
he satisfied with that perfect I think a

1711
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:43,920
question just came in in the last two

1712
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,119
seconds

1713
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,260
um any chance you're aware of

1714
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:48,960
Singapore's CLS cyber labeling scheme

1715
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:51,240
for iot devices do you think it makes

1716
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,760
any appreciable differences to the iot

1717
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:57,720
industry I'm not um and you know it's

1718
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:59,220
it's hard to even talk about this stuff

1719
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:01,200
without a classification

1720
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:02,640
um you know I'm talking about when I

1721
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:03,960
describe an RT device I basically

1722
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:05,339
describing what the thing actually looks

1723
01:07:05,339 --> 01:07:06,480
like

1724
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:07,920
um and I think classification and

1725
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:10,200
taxonomy for for iot is going to be very

1726
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:11,640
important and I would love to talk about

1727
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:13,020
it

1728
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:14,520
is the person who asked the question

1729
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:16,980
here here by any chance who wants to

1730
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:19,520
clarify it

1731
01:07:19,559 --> 01:07:21,660
okay I would love to get briefed on it

1732
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:23,280
offline in our booth so thank you very

1733
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,799
much all right thanks um before we end

1734
01:07:25,799 --> 01:07:27,299
the person who asked the first question

1735
01:07:27,299 --> 01:07:29,520
do you want to identify yourself for a

1736
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:31,200
free gift

1737
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:33,720
it's a really slanky um hitb passport

1738
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:35,240
holder

1739
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:36,839
nope

1740
01:07:36,839 --> 01:07:39,359
all right I'll give you one shortly

1741
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:41,099
um thanks again Chris um thanks for the

1742
01:07:41,099 --> 01:07:42,000
talk

1743
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,559
um coming up we have the coffee break

1744
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:45,620
until about 10 30.

1745
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:48,960
