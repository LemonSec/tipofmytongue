1
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:07,919
so

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,040
I'm really excited to present this topic

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,620
today in Singapore and

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,400
it's really an honor to be in person at

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,859
hack in the Box again so really liked it

6
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,220
last time was in Amsterdam I'm really

7
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,760
happy to enjoy the conference

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,180
um who am I so I'm Thomas

9
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,000
picture of me here

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,940
um I'm focusing on embedded iot security

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,059
related Technologies so hacking iot

12
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:41,760
stuff reverse engineering embedded

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,420
devices and I was speaker on various

14
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,239
conferences um like in the box of course

15
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,200
and idcx which is a local conference in

16
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,199
Austria and I've also published several

17
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,020
security advisories regarding embedded

18
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,480
devices regarding iot devices Also

19
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,359
regarding printers and if you remember

20
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,400
the keynote talk

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,640
um all of the devices which you Heards

22
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,979
their plcs and so on

23
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:15,060
I like them because they are insecure

24
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,439
so

25
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:19,020
the outline of my talk is

26
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,100
um just foundations so Baseline so what

27
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,100
you have to know about internet of

28
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,340
things security stuff and also digital

29
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,140
twins so

30
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,600
a lot of stuff like that

31
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,380
um

32
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,420
OT

33
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:39,479
infrastructure and typical OT security

34
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:42,259
assessment I'm trying to combine now

35
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:44,939
digital twins operate operating

36
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,460
technology and security vulnerability

37
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,540
research

38
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,939
all together in this talk and that's a

39
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:53,220
bit challenging of course the

40
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,740
construction of digital twins

41
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,979
a bit security testing uh

42
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,320
one thing the security vulnerabilities

43
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,360
are not published yet because the

44
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,780
vendors take a bit more time to fix them

45
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,580
but

46
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,979
those are really really easy

47
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:12,000
vulnerabilities and if you are

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,340
interested you can find them too that's

49
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,440
not a problem and of course a short

50
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,980
conclusion regarding all those topics

51
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,340
so what is OT some of you might know

52
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,400
it's operational technology like it

53
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,760
which is informational technology and

54
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,720
um you have a lot of devices on a lot of

55
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,920
levels in the OT environment that are

56
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,500
rtus plcs hmis engineering stage the

57
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,200
scada service historians and so on so a

58
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,420
lot of devices

59
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:49,200
and some of those are iot devices you

60
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,540
call them industrial internet of things

61
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,700
if they are placed in such an

62
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,580
operational technology network of course

63
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,280
can the IP cameras print those routers

64
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,580
and so on you also have them in operate

65
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:07,860
operating technology environments but if

66
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,200
those are industrial routers sensors

67
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,780
actuators industrial environments or

68
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,519
maybe cameras which are observing a

69
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:20,280
process like melting metal or whatever

70
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,879
it may be then it's of course called

71
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:26,220
industrial internet of things so the the

72
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,640
border between those two things is yeah

73
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,280
not not really not really hard

74
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,280
and you have digital twins

75
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,739
and during this session because there

76
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:39,599
are a lot of types of digital twins

77
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,120
during this session digital twins are

78
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,879
meant to be um

79
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,500
real

80
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,379
um it's like a copy from a operating

81
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:51,659
system from a real device because all of

82
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:54,840
those things are computers of course

83
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,840
um which is

84
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,959
running like a real system so you can

85
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:01,920
start it

86
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,379
but you don't need the hardware

87
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:08,280
sometimes digital twins are

88
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,959
um are just

89
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:13,439
um simulations of processes so that's

90
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,019
the difference so there are a lot of

91
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,600
different definitions of digital twins I

92
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,579
also call them firmware digital twins

93
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,079
because you're just copying the

94
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,139
operating system of the device from the

95
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:27,240
started or modified started and then it

96
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,000
runs like a real firmware of course you

97
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,960
have about

98
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,259
some implications but I will come to

99
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:36,060
this later

100
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,600
so in the early days

101
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,780
OT was just a field plus technology a

102
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,800
bit modbus a bit profit pass a bit can

103
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,800
bus systems which were cables just lying

104
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,259
around in the in the Fab and you

105
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,840
connected those devices together and

106
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,759
then you have just sent out your

107
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:59,880
messages via this bus technology you had

108
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,180
plcs with one programming interface a

109
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,940
com Port like

110
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,660
cables like this you know that the dsop

111
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,720
and a few kilobits of memory sometimes

112
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,720
so it was really a small computer really

113
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,280
basic

114
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,660
and

115
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,660
um supervision was implemented via

116
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,060
analog technology so maybe you know

117
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,180
those big rooms where you had lamps

118
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,580
where you had some kind of networks

119
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,759
everything really analog and the light

120
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:35,280
was just blinking if the process was

121
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,620
failing or whatever so supervision was

122
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,100
really done in an analog way

123
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,960
um in early days you had all those

124
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,960
things but nowadays

125
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,120
it gets more complicated you have

126
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,080
ethernet all around your Fab which is

127
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,600
sometimes doing supervision of uh

128
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,380
whatever power memory sensors actuators

129
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,539
and so on uh you have manageable

130
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:02,820
ethernet switches all around the

131
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,680
infrastructure so on all all those

132
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,979
levels so from Level zero to level uh

133
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:09,479
four and level five

134
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:12,440
in the aperture model of the OT system

135
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,600
and you have also because it's not

136
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,419
complicated enough you have also to add

137
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:21,000
routers firewalls to connect the IT

138
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
world with the OT so that it can export

139
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,699
data that you can access from the it to

140
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:28,800
the OT which is sometimes not a good

141
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,919
idea but it's

142
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:33,960
constantly done by a lot of companies

143
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,300
and you have a lot of peripheral devices

144
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,740
the iiot or the iot

145
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,479
so far as the goods what are the

146
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:49,020
differences between it and OT

147
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,020
from also from a Panthers Panthers

148
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,620
perspective you have a lot of network

149
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,720
bandwidth you have a lot of business

150
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,539
related information software time and so

151
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:03,800
on in it so that's the traditional it

152
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,759
system if I as a pen tester walk into a

153
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:11,220
company and do a penetration test some

154
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,039
of you might know in it systems you can

155
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:16,919
have a lot of fun it's really a lot a

156
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:20,400
lot of fun to do penetration tests and

157
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,880
yeah usually

158
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,220
no processes no physical processes are

159
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,340
dependent on those I.T systems so if the

160
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,280
server just reboots then okay some data

161
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,220
is lost but it reboots and it will work

162
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,020
next time

163
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,740
if some clients will just

164
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,500
um yeah be be stuck have denial of

165
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,840
service because you are doing a scanning

166
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,840
of the of a part scanning of the device

167
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,900
then yeah it's okay just stuck and

168
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,259
that's it you can reboot it no problem

169
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:58,620
in the OT world you have not that much

170
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,500
Network traffic you have a low bandwidth

171
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,319
you just need some signals to indicate

172
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,180
whether process is running whether

173
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,880
sensors or actuators are running are

174
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,699
just communicate some some signals in

175
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,699
between or to the scada server or from

176
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:16,560
scada server to the historian and so on

177
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,080
but it's it's not that much you have

178
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,120
also

179
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,740
industrial related information so it's

180
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,860
not really like okay in the next few

181
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,379
seconds I want to trade what about this

182
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,720
stock it's like

183
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,379
um

184
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:34,620
the sensor or the actuator says one or

185
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,419
zero so

186
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:38,580
um the motors or the engine is running

187
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,099
or is not running or the pump is doing

188
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:44,159
its work or not and you have also hard

189
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,740
real time so if you are not getting the

190
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,560
information of the current temperature

191
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,100
it may be too late in the next second

192
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,019
and

193
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:58,320
other things of course so if if a short

194
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,040
system failure is proceeding then maybe

195
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,459
it's it it's too late because

196
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:06,240
um

197
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,019
yeah the process already uh

198
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:12,959
turns down your whole Factory and you

199
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,080
can do you can spend the next

200
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,779
um two weeks or more just to build up

201
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:21,779
the process again to clean all the the

202
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:24,420
yeah all the whatever it may be so it

203
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,300
can be a manufacturing of

204
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,360
um I don't know some some parts for for

205
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,540
washing machines or it can be a bottling

206
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,300
company or whatever

207
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,740
you can spend a lot of time to to bring

208
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,839
it up again and sometimes even months if

209
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,360
it's a chemical Factory because yeah

210
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,820
then you have to clean a lot

211
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,660
and

212
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,839
the thing is upgrades are only are only

213
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,660
coming during maintenance windows and

214
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,810
maintenance Windows

215
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,120
[Music]

216
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,000
um are not not really often in OT

217
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,080
systems sometimes once a year sometimes

218
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,120
just one time in two years or in three

219
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,240
years or whatever because the factor is

220
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,060
is really really important and for

221
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,240
typical OT security assessments you have

222
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,399
to be careful you can have to lock all

223
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,080
your network traffic what you are doing

224
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,779
because otherwise it may be

225
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:24,720
um yeah the the

226
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,440
OT

227
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,120
um

228
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,300
the the the guy who's uh who is doing

229
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,180
the management of the whole OT network

230
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,540
uh is saying to you okay you have um

231
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,120
broken that process and now we have to

232
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,240
pay a lot of a lot of money a few

233
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,360
thousands of dollars or whatever and if

234
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,220
you can say no I have to lock my network

235
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,860
traffic and it's not my fault then of

236
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,160
course that's fine because otherwise you

237
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,399
yeah you have to pay all the money if

238
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,579
you have no good insurance and

239
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:02,820
um do not use automated security

240
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,880
scanners for it because those security

241
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,940
scanners may just break everything so I

242
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,200
I had

243
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,620
OT security assessments where I just did

244
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,140
support scan of course during a

245
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,180
maintenance window so it was not the big

246
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,940
problem but about

247
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:24,779
200 plcs were just rebooting that moment

248
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:28,680
that's bad if it's during the during the

249
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,079
daily work because then

250
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:34,079
yeah it may break a lot

251
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,880
uh

252
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,860
I have talked about the departure model

253
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:42,240
so you can see um some some kind of

254
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,180
purchase model in this figure so that's

255
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,680
also why

256
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,860
why I'm I'm telling you about faking at

257
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,800
level one because level one is this

258
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,760
section here so plcs rdu's and whatever

259
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,220
and you can see Enterprise I.T

260
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,200
infrastructure which is

261
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,480
the it World

262
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,019
um is connected here at level four so

263
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:10,860
really a high level after the whole

264
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,140
OT environment which you can see here

265
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,000
and usually it's also separated by

266
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,399
firewall and

267
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:21,180
um all the the stuff which is here below

268
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,180
is the whole OT Network infrastructure

269
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,459
which is composed by level three level

270
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:28,800
two level one level zero and sometimes

271
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,040
there is some kind of level 3.5 which is

272
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,820
the gateway to the it and you can see

273
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,140
there are a lot of devices here

274
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,899
engineering station

275
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:41,459
historian application station and so on

276
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:44,700
and here you have also your engineering

277
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,620
station where you can program the plcs

278
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,860
which is going down here to level one so

279
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,600
there are links in between of course

280
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,940
because otherwise you wouldn't be able

281
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,220
to connect those devices and you

282
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,200
wouldn't be able to to program them and

283
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,639
do supervision

284
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:01,380
and

285
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,779
the problem is sometimes our customers

286
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:05,160
just

287
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,000
um

288
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,459
don't do this kind of

289
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:09,560
um of

290
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,420
separation between the levels on the

291
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:16,320
horizontal or on vertical or anyway and

292
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,060
then you have all those devices in one

293
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,399
big Network which is sometimes a real

294
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,300
really big problem one of our customers

295
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:28,079
had just one one problem with one of his

296
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,320
switches which were broadcasting all

297
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,500
information all all packets through the

298
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,060
the whole switch because

299
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,980
we don't know maybe that the switch

300
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,519
table was flooded or or not we don't

301
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,459
know and then the whole OT network was

302
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:47,040
uh stuck was just in out of service of

303
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,320
the whole network so it's not even a

304
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,079
malicious attack it was just failure

305
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,380
that's it and for that cases it's it's

306
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,300
really wise to do this kind of

307
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:01,500
separation between those levels so how

308
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,940
do we do

309
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,100
um OT security assessments

310
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,680
pretty straightforward so it's like in

311
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,639
an I.T system but you have to to be a

312
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:13,680
bit carefully because it's like heart

313
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,079
surgery and not like knocking on all

314
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:20,040
doors in an apartment's house and yeah

315
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,980
it's a bit different but

316
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,079
the steps are the same so information

317
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:28,019
gathering then active testing and

318
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:30,420
afterwards reporting so for information

319
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,700
gathering you can also use the the

320
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,660
blueprints so reviews of the network

321
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,339
blueprints you can collect information

322
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:40,740
about all the system about the firmware

323
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,260
Doing Network sniffing but you have to

324
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:47,339
be careful and for active testing that's

325
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:50,639
yeah that you have to be really careful

326
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,500
um I would I would suggest to effort to

327
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,740
to to do step-by-step tests so just

328
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,899
trying to access the web interfaces then

329
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:02,240
trying to access

330
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,240
some some ports but not trying all in an

331
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,519
automated way

332
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,579
and it's also possible to use tenable OT

333
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:14,760
they have created some kind of

334
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,160
special scanning systems or like Nestles

335
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,639
but just for OT systems but

336
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,019
um in the end if something fails then

337
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:28,680
you know of service destroyed devices

338
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,279
um

339
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,980
yeah power supply and

340
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,760
even home in life can be can be put at

341
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,260
risk

342
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,880
so

343
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,880
if there are issues also in OT scanning

344
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,880
software like tenable

345
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,540
yeah if some some issue arrive arises

346
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,519
then you will have the problem as

347
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:53,220
penetration tester and your customer

348
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,860
will have the problem that the process

349
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,639
is just shut down and yeah can be a real

350
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:01,800
problem

351
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,399
so

352
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,699
so a possible solution for all those

353
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:11,760
problems because you can see it's it it

354
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,720
can have a lot of implications is to

355
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,120
make a digital copy of the whole OT

356
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,920
Network

357
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,779
of course not of all

358
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:25,139
um 100 of the devices but at least of

359
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:29,279
let's say 70 or 60 or 80 percent of the

360
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,380
devices because if you have a digital

361
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,380
copy with digital twins

362
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,860
um then you have the advantage that you

363
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,160
can put they can do a real pen test on

364
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,740
the digital copy and not on the OT

365
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:47,100
system of your customer so if that

366
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,399
device will be shut down or just will be

367
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,579
crash whatever for whatever reason

368
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,380
um that you are doing on the on the

369
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:58,199
network interface then yeah

370
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:00,000
it's not a problem because it's the

371
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,740
digital copy it's not the the real OT

372
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,439
Network and

373
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:07,020
such technique would be some kind of

374
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,540
virtual pen testing so there are also

375
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,660
vendors in the OT environments which are

376
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:17,220
using this as marketing passwords but

377
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,540
um

378
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:21,720
I asked them and it's it's not really

379
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,000
virtual pen testing it's just

380
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
um collecting uh from the from the

381
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,760
versions and collecting the the CVS

382
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,660
which

383
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,900
have been published of this firmware

384
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,860
versions

385
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,900
and

386
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,960
you know if you are using virtualization

387
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,260
so the digital twins a digital copy of

388
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,799
those um of those devices of those

389
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:49,440
infrastructure then it always has a

390
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,539
certain Gap so you will have a gap

391
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:53,880
between the digital twin and the

392
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,000
physical device because you cannot you

393
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,500
cannot really copy all the the iOS so if

394
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,660
you have some relays or if you have some

395
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,179
some signals going out and going in to

396
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:08,520
the device of course it's digital it's

397
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,400
it's just a copy it cannot simulate all

398
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,820
all stuff like this but you can emulate

399
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,860
the firmware and that's the the big

400
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,100
Advantage advantage and you can also

401
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:23,280
access via this Ethernet or Wi-Fi

402
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,580
interface to the digital copy which is

403
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,100
really great and

404
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,320
of course it's

405
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,539
um it's really difficult to do a digital

406
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:35,700
copy of all those different devices I

407
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,580
mean that's that's really really

408
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,100
a problem sometimes but it still pays

409
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,200
off if you are doing this because then

410
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,580
you have

411
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,340
the digital twin of the device and you

412
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,960
don't have to break the whole OT Network

413
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,799
and you don't have to pay a few Yeah

414
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:58,080
okay or more for just putting down the

415
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,559
operation of your vendors Fab

416
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:02,820
so

417
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,539
how is it possible to create some

418
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:11,160
digital twin to construct all of this so

419
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,500
of course we have heard that today you

420
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,240
can extract the firmware but you can

421
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,000
also download the firmware from the

422
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,679
Internet or from from the vendors

423
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,740
website you have to analyze the firmware

424
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,539
and prepare it for virtualization

425
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:27,059
because sometimes it's not working out

426
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:29,340
of the box and

427
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:33,120
then you have to to start at the desired

428
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,580
virtual way in in virtualization

429
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,280
environment to create the digital twin

430
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,559
there are open source tools and you have

431
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,799
to run the digital twin

432
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:46,440
um you can see a lot of tools here there

433
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,559
are more there's also uh there are also

434
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:52,140
derivations of those tools but all in

435
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:52,919
all

436
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:54,539
um maybe you know some of those logos

437
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:58,140
you have emox or Amex and Medusa

438
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,380
chilling and fermentine where there's

439
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,419
also a new version of this one or an

440
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:06,419
extended version which is called firm AE

441
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:09,960
I think it's from a Korean University

442
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,620
and you can see all of them or most of

443
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,679
them are specialized to creating digital

444
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:19,380
Twins or doing re-hosting because it's

445
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,500
always called in a different way

446
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,020
from Linux based firmware so

447
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:28,200
if you if you look for

448
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,840
emulation of some kind of real-time

449
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,360
operating systems of course there are

450
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,260
some tools out there but they are not

451
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,380
really easy to handle and if you are not

452
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,419
um if you are not an expert or if you

453
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:46,160
don't have any expertise regarding

454
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,020
regarding this topic then it's it's

455
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:52,080
really it's really hard to dig in there

456
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,880
and it's it's really hard to do

457
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,539
emulation of real-time operating system

458
00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:00,840
but all in all those tools are some of

459
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,299
those which you can use for creating

460
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:05,820
digital twins

461
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,760
there's also a gap also in in those

462
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,440
tools of course as I have mentioned

463
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,840
before on the physical device you have

464
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,059
the chipset you have vulnerabilities

465
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:18,600
sometimes in in implementations of

466
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,200
drivers and and so on but you cannot

467
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,419
always emulate all of those chips and

468
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:26,760
sometimes you will not find some

469
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,860
vulnerabilities which may be present on

470
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,940
the real device

471
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,340
you have IOS

472
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,460
sometimes you cannot access access to

473
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,500
those iOS because they are not present

474
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,980
on the emulated device and you have the

475
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,020
emulated firmware

476
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,280
so

477
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,780
all in all

478
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,179
um virtualization of devices helps a lot

479
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:52,559
together the idea the big picture of the

480
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,100
whole device and how it works and that's

481
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,980
really valuable even though sometimes

482
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,960
you can you cannot emulate everything

483
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,260
but some but really often you get an

484
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,840
idea how it works how the processes are

485
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,720
connected to it to each other and

486
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,320
sometimes if you start the emulation you

487
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,840
will immediately see some strange Port

488
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,760
listening

489
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,760
on on the network interface and

490
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,520
sometimes it connects back to some kind

491
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,500
of telnet listener and then you know

492
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,539
okay there is a backdoor

493
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:32,400
and it happens really often

494
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,840
so

495
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,400
I've mentioned it

496
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,700
Pro you can do parallel tests live

497
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,440
debugging and so on

498
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:45,840
but Khan you have a lot of work and you

499
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,480
you can put a lot of time into cloning

500
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,559
the device

501
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:52,260
and it's not always possible for all OT

502
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,780
devices and it's also not really

503
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,780
possible for 100

504
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:59,220
but it's

505
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,179
um

506
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:03,720
it's it's really nice if you are able to

507
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,539
put a digital twin of your whole OT

508
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:10,260
Network and if you do pen testing just

509
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,000
on this digital twin instead of the

510
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,840
whole

511
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,520
OT environment

512
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,260
so

513
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,419
if you are doing security testing and if

514
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:21,000
you are doing security testing on Linux

515
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,580
based machines I guess you will know how

516
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:26,039
to do a white box test you you will also

517
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:28,320
know how to do queer box test because

518
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,000
sometimes you don't have the source code

519
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,740
of all the applications

520
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,659
and

521
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:37,320
I have brought some examples

522
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,640
so

523
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,820
um yeah because of the time I will not I

524
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,820
will not show everything but

525
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,620
that's not a problem

526
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,620
um you can see here two pictures on the

527
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,780
right hand side it's the

528
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,880
it's the web interface of a running

529
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,460
digital twin and on the left hand side

530
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,980
you can see all the open ports you can

531
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,360
see the listeners you can see the

532
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,059
processes you can see also

533
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:06,059
um the CPU info of the of the running

534
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:07,020
machine

535
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,120
and

536
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,539
I can show you also a live

537
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:14,400
emulation

538
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,320
so

539
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,960
here is I've used Medusa because it has

540
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,760
a web interface and

541
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,100
yeah it's really nice you have two

542
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,559
running firmers so from two different

543
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:26,820
vendors

544
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:30,120
and ports are also set for the serial

545
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,140
port

546
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:34,500
not for any any SSH telnet or whatever

547
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,020
listener it's really for a Serial Port

548
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,679
of the device of the digital twin

549
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,659
and I connected

550
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:45,600
um to the it's a bit slow because it's

551
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,640
via the mobile phone

552
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,400
um but I connected to the to the serial

553
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,760
Port of those devices and for me it's

554
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,580
now possible to type those commands like

555
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,580
ifconfig like

556
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,460
um net stats

557
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:06,120
and yeah just just look

558
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,880
um which ports are open which processes

559
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,460
are running while using PS for example

560
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,679
and

561
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,539
um I can also access to the web

562
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:17,520
interface of those devices

563
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,900
so

564
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:23,039
I'm connected via wirecard so that's a

565
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,480
nice thing

566
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,480
okay I'm not that good in Chinese to be

567
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,720
honest

568
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:33,600
but that's for example a device from

569
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,580
Delta Electronics

570
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,559
and

571
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:40,919
if it loads in time then you will be

572
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:44,100
able to see the web interface of this

573
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,100
OT device and that's

574
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:51,179
one part of a full digital twin from a

575
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:52,500
full OT Network

576
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,620
if you have multiple of those

577
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,419
controllers

578
00:25:56,419 --> 00:25:59,400
managed switches routers and so on which

579
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,140
are part of the industrial internet of

580
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,260
things which is part of the OT Network

581
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:07,080
you can create a full

582
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,799
um a full or not a 100 but for example

583
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,980
70 percent duplicate of your customers

584
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,799
Network and then you can

585
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,419
um you can pen test those devices

586
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:20,520
instead of pan testing the real devices

587
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,039
and of course you can do it with Medusa

588
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,659
you can do it with thermodyne you can do

589
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:27,900
it with rmx all of them are based on

590
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,440
some kind of qimo on some kind of build

591
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,400
system and all of them can be used to to

592
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,140
create such

593
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:40,140
emulations such virtualizations of

594
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,900
embedded devices and with those

595
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,900
technique you're able to really to

596
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,539
create a snapshot of the of the network

597
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:51,840
and Pen test it and you can also see it

598
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,360
works for a broad range of devices

599
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,360
because a lot of devices are based on

600
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,960
Linux and that's the reason why it gets

601
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,500
more and more easy to just use this

602
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,320
technique so I guess it's yeah it's

603
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,380
really slow so it's it's one of the the

604
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:13,860
mobile phone while the hotspot and yeah

605
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,539
but

606
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:18,240
using this way you can also do port scan

607
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,820
you can also use nessus you can use just

608
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:24,059
any tool and you don't have to to lock

609
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,919
all your network traffic I mean I would

610
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,620
recommend to do it but you don't have to

611
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:32,100
do it for reasons like being sued from

612
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,440
the customer and paying a lot of money

613
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,679
because your breaking processes and yeah

614
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,140
that's that's really nice

615
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:44,220
so I had some some other devices from

616
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,690
Red Lion from

617
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:47,100
[Music]

618
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,419
um

619
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:52,320
prosoft from moxa so that's that's the

620
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,520
switch which

621
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,679
um also were emulators for 70

622
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,919
and that device was around ten thousand

623
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:05,039
dollars I guess and I just downloaded

624
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,320
the firmware and did a pen test on the

625
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,360
running firmware found vulnerabilities

626
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,720
and so yeah just told them that they

627
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,159
have vulnerabilities in their devices

628
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,640
and they also fixed those

629
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,740
vulnerabilities in I guess six other

630
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,500
device series because they are using the

631
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,080
same firmware base and yeah

632
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:28,559
that's that's really nice if you catch a

633
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,140
lot of them because then you have you

634
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,039
have

635
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:35,340
um helped to increase the security of a

636
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:38,039
lot of OT networks but uh

637
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:40,559
backside of this is the maintenance

638
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,740
windows are just once a year so

639
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,500
they will install it maybe next year

640
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:50,340
let's see so a lot of devices were

641
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,400
tested via this technique so by me and

642
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,279
by my colleagues and currently pending

643
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:58,620
out those two examples which I have

644
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:02,279
shown to you right now and sometimes you

645
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:05,460
have the well-known reactions if you

646
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,200
communicate those vulnerabilities to the

647
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,440
vendors which can be no it's not there

648
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,460
or just no reaction or an endless ping

649
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,240
pong process which goes to Nowhere

650
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,799
sometimes and that's the special case

651
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,559
for digital twins they say no it's your

652
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,080
controlled environment so the best thing

653
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,799
is just to not say that you have tested

654
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,200
those vulnerabilities on digital twins

655
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,779
because then the vendor will just say no

656
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:36,059
that's not possible

657
00:29:36,059 --> 00:29:37,500
so

658
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:43,020
to sum it up if you want to do complete

659
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,299
OT security assessments it's always

660
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:47,760
challenging it's it's really hard to not

661
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,279
break anything

662
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:52,260
if you're using digital twins

663
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:56,820
you can build a full clone and you can

664
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,880
use this technique

665
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,760
to test iiot iot or printers or whatever

666
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,360
you want to test and you would not harm

667
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,580
any OT networks because you're just

668
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,740
testing a clone you're testing a

669
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,679
virtualization

670
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:16,020
and you can also find really easy new

671
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,899
vulnerabilities and communicate to the

672
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:20,760
them to the vendor without having the

673
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:24,059
