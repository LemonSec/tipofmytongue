1
00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:08,760
all right good evening everybody hope

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,120
you all had a good short break so today

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,860
I'm going to talk about managing pen

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,640
test the pen tests in action uh agenda

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,220
would be I'll be introducing myself uh

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,140
we'll go a little bit around what is

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,000
fantastic what are the challenges

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,400
running pen tests uh what are the

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,560
problems that will be solved that is the

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,740
solution uh which I'll be proposing why

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,719
we should use the solution obviously I

12
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,059
am open to all the new ideas that you

13
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:38,280
guys bring on and then we will do one

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,500
tool demo life which I'll be releasing

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,620
just today here at HTTP 2022 Singapore

16
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,120
uh myself Jyoti raval I work as a staff

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,120
product security engineer at harness I

18
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,940
am basically responsible for researching

19
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,940
on all the aspects of product security

20
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,800
life cycle

21
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,880
um uh reading on new security Trends how

22
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,880
product security Works end to end

23
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,439
uh I am application security Enthusiast

24
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:16,500
I presented at blackhead Defcon milcon

25
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,860
and infoset girls before I authored a

26
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,659
tool called phishing simulation

27
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,020
assessment along with the one which I

28
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,420
I'll be presenting today

29
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,439
I also had the OS Pune chapter uh supani

30
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,560
is a city in India and Jenny Ravel is my

31
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,280
guitar panel

32
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,259
so let's start with little bit of Basics

33
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,840
uh what is pen testing so it is nothing

34
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,140
but basically ethically testing your all

35
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,320
systems uh by yourself or by a third

36
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,899
party pen tester in order to identify

37
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,720
problems before it only so penetration

38
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,939
testing is nothing but uh ethical

39
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:58,979
hacking it is an authorized simulated

40
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:00,840
Cyber attack which we perform on

41
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,939
computer systems so computer systems

42
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:04,380
could be anything it could be your

43
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,840
network it could be your application it

44
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,500
could be a people it could be your thick

45
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,840
lines it could be your web apps mobile

46
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,920
apps anything okay so uh the idea of

47
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,560
doing penetration testing is we want to

48
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,140
know what are the problems in our system

49
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,119
before hacker knows

50
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,720
now uh before we go to challenges let's

51
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,400
imagine a scenario for a particular

52
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,739
organization let's assume that you have

53
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:36,900
so many functions in the organization

54
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,239
all of them wants to run penetration

55
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:42,360
testing for their applications and let's

56
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,340
assume that you have like 10 Plantation

57
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,860
tester three security consultant and

58
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,319
then bug Bounty programs which is also

59
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:52,080
being run now you have to manage all of

60
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,239
this and all of the business on owners

61
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,340
from engineering tells you that test

62
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,500
test my system first because I want to

63
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,080
go live first now as a manager you have

64
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,200
to manage all the uh this testing which

65
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,019
is happening across your organization

66
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:08,940
and which is happening parallely right

67
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,920
so one tester is testing something

68
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,019
another tester is testing something and

69
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:14,819
then there are third party testers which

70
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,500
which you have hired to manage the

71
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,840
workload and then there is bug Bounty

72
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,840
programs running so how do you get a

73
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,000
view of all these testings which are

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,400
being run parallely and how do you

75
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,800
manage the them efficiently in order to

76
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,260
understand that how how is the risk

77
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,599
posture how is it going where what are

78
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,940
your resources doing and how you can

79
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,000
better manage this problem so what are

80
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,640
the what are the challenges currently

81
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,760
lack of holistic view so like I said

82
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,920
there are 10 pen testing running and you

83
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,799
you are not aware right at which at this

84
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:51,840
point in time which testing is in which

85
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,440
phase how is it going how much issues it

86
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,099
flagged lack of analytics so today if I

87
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:02,519
want to see how many issues those 10 pen

88
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,680
testings got reported I have to really

89
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,159
take all those 10 Excel sheets 10 or 10

90
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,739
word dogs go to bug Bounty platform take

91
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:13,080
out all of that export it do it some

92
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,299
some all of these issues and then create

93
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:17,399
analytics out of it which which looks

94
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,738
like a lot to do right lack of

95
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:22,860
visibility I really have to go to each

96
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,320
of the pen tested to understand uh hey

97
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,120
what is the issue or what is the status

98
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,880
of this pen testing are we done when are

99
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,979
we going to be done when can we go live

100
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:34,380
this type of question right and if all

101
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,780
of this takes a lot of time

102
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,060
uh lack of tracking and measuring

103
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,040
capabilities like I just now mentioned

104
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,780
like I I don't know when it is going to

105
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,419
end or have we covered at least business

106
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,759
critical functions or have we just

107
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,340
started or where are we

108
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,580
foreign

109
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:58,560
system this time now next time that

110
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,419
mentester is not available you want to

111
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:02,699
give that pen testing to next pen tester

112
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:04,860
how do you give it you really have to

113
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,900
transfer all the knowledge from one

114
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,120
first pen testing give a retesting to

115
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,340
next pen tester which is going to cause

116
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,580
lot of time resources and hindrances in

117
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,259
the testing right

118
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:18,740
no automation there is no automation

119
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,900
right now at least open source which is

120
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,759
in place which can do all of these jobs

121
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:24,780
for us

122
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,660
ad hoc processes so somebody would some

123
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,280
pen tester will come to your other pen

124
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,380
tester and say hey you know what I

125
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,139
tested this this is some of the testing

126
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:36,060
which would slip from his mind or he

127
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,160
would maintain an axle which really

128
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,680
which is really hard to automate which

129
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,780
is really hard to test and understand

130
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,639
right

131
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,680
collaboration in efficiency because

132
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,960
everything is manual watch what is being

133
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,120
tested is manual everything is in Excel

134
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,100
or word or in different formats all

135
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,560
together it is very hard if I want to

136
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,419
put two pen tester in same activity

137
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,039
different dashboards like I mentioned if

138
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:04,500
some of the testing is being done by my

139
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,539
internal pen tester some of the testing

140
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:08,100
is being done by let's say third party

141
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,560
pen tester or both of them reported

142
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,660
differently both of them has different

143
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,880
writing style for everything one might

144
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,680
one might create word one might create

145
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,199
excellent and there is no way to uh

146
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,300
collaborate and there is no way to make

147
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,340
a one report which I can just go ahead

148
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,560
and see

149
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,020
and historical data analytics let's say

150
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,660
tomorrow I want to go and see okay this

151
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,580
is HRM system which is which we are

152
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,440
testing for third time what are the

153
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,000
issues that we are seeing concurrently

154
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,740
what are the issues that we've really

155
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,840
fixed what are the issues that developer

156
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,759
is not working on and what are the

157
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,740
issues that spent tester have missed

158
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,139
from one testing to another there is no

159
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:50,000
data point which we can look at

160
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,819
so how do we solve this problem one idea

161
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:57,780
is uh to create a open source tool which

162
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,180
solves this problem for us and obviously

163
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,340
I'm open to ideas and we can add more

164
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,520
there uh one is uh

165
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,340
aside database to know all organization

166
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,039
assets that are in pen test process so

167
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,319
we need one asset database because I

168
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:15,000
cannot secure which I'm not aware of

169
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,180
right now I know there is a HRM system

170
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,580
in the organization after five years we

171
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,139
might just forget about it right because

172
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:23,759
there is no one requesting for a pen

173
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,580
test for it so we need a asset database

174
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:30,780
which we can regularly Monitor and test

175
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,360
tracking in each pen test and activities

176
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,819
in real time so we want to know like I

177
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:38,460
said in real time how the pen test is

178
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,860
progressing over a period of time

179
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,840
when testing activity knowledge which

180
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,699
comprises of particular let's say

181
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:46,139
application does or the purpose of

182
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:48,720
Hardware that we are testing so today I

183
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,120
give one APK to our pen tester and say

184
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,639
Hey you test it he tests it he gets

185
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,500
report out of it and we are good about

186
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,039
it but next time if I give same APK or

187
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,039
iOS to next pen tester what we have to

188
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:04,259
do is we have to really again explain

189
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:06,840
him what this APK does what were the

190
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,699
critical business functions what we

191
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:10,919
found last time here you know what this

192
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:12,840
is how xss mentioned is being applied

193
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,300
which can be bypassed so all this

194
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,000
knowledge needs to be passed manually

195
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,940
some may pass some don't some right so

196
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,340
we might miss information which is very

197
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:27,020
important information in the process

198
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,560
so uh what MPT will do is when next pen

199
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,779
tester takes over testing all they have

200
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,839
to do is view the asses just click on

201
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:38,458
the asset view all the associated

202
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,140
information what are the critical

203
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,179
functions how how they get credential

204
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:44,459
whether they get credential it has to be

205
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:46,440
a white processing or it has to be Black

206
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,820
Box testing what were the issue

207
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,640
identified so on and so forth time taken

208
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,980
for each pen test because everything is

209
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,920
in system we know each mentistic took

210
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,320
how much time how how much your pen

211
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,360
tester are busy it helps boosting

212
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,040
productivities right

213
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,800
issued status so there is a developer

214
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,899
Corner as well in which you can track

215
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:10,019
how issues are being progressed a

216
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:12,959
developer and how it is being fixed how

217
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,700
how which issues are taking so much

218
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,740
amount of time which we are not going to

219
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,180
fix

220
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,860
Trend analysis of vulnerabilities

221
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,440
observed during multiple pen tests like

222
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,480
right I said

223
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,339
for example you have seen that you see

224
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:29,459
your HRM is consistently vulnerable to

225
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:31,980
exercise and it's not being fixed so you

226
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,660
know the trend of vulnerabilities that

227
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,120
are being observed in a particular asset

228
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,200
over and over again

229
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,940
so why why we need this solution

230
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:49,019
so uh uh apart from the problems that I

231
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:50,880
said right now it also has a security

232
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,100
pen test analytics which is very

233
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,779
important which helps us to not only

234
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:56,459
track and view everything in single play

235
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:59,339
pane of glass but also finding

236
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:01,440
Improvement areas to boost pen tester

237
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,260
productivity because I know my I have 10

238
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,480
pen tester those are working like two

239
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,480
days a week maybe sometimes uh and then

240
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,820
three days we have nothing and another

241
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,940
week we have lot a lot of work so we

242
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,399
could manage the productivity in such a

243
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,440
way that we know that we distribute work

244
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,120
accordingly

245
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,580
understand the current risk posture so

246
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,980
when I look at the dashboard I know how

247
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,779
many vulnerabilities are open for my

248
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:29,820
organization how many high risk medium

249
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,100
and low risk I have and how how many

250
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,420
vulnerabilities are there which I need

251
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,399
to deal with

252
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:38,399
understand recurring issue like just now

253
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,680
I explained right how her issues are

254
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,019
coming over and over again

255
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:45,120
average amount of time taken for each

256
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,320
pen test versus versus a set scope so uh

257
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,079
we understand that when there is when

258
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,120
there is a asset which is huge number of

259
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,620
application Pages functionalities or or

260
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,740
the end points we know that how our Dev

261
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,140
how our pen tests are performing against

262
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,180
those type of assets

263
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,300
average high medium low fixing time

264
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,899
how fast developer is in fixing high

265
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:15,660
medium and low vulnerabilities

266
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,940
most number of reliability is fixed in a

267
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,160
year so tomorrow your CSO might want to

268
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,620
see that okay past year we saw so many

269
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,380
vulnerabilities so many CVS how we fixed

270
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,540
it how many we fixed it how was the

271
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,680
developer trained whether our

272
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,360
engineering is really serious about the

273
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,440
vulnerabilities or no

274
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,940
is reported so if we go back in time

275
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,060
hence 10 years back some issues really

276
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,339
made sense but if you look OS top 10

277
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:46,079
today there are so many vulnerabilities

278
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,000
that that you will not even see in OS

279
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,519
top 10 that is a fundamental reason of

280
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:52,380
os top 10 coming every year right

281
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,060
because the class of vulnerability

282
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,700
impact of vulnerability changes over

283
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,000
period of time

284
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,279
developer trains how my developers are

285
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:04,260
fixing the problems are they struck

286
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,180
somewhere or they need help somewhere

287
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,540
open findings so this is also

288
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,000
essentially related to my risk posture

289
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,620
how uh my organization in general is

290
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,540
performing in terms of high medium and

291
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,600
lower liabilities critical assessment so

292
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,700
some let's say spine management right

293
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,800
that is very critical application for

294
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,320
your business because it directly deals

295
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,980
with dollars so uh in in terms of

296
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,540
critical assessments how we are

297
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,480
performing how it how is it going asset

298
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,019
health because it has as a DB it has

299
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:43,260
capability to calculate how a particular

300
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,019
asset health is

301
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:48,660
top 10 tester reported finding so we we

302
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,700
might have an internal pen tester we

303
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,519
have bug bounty hunters or we might have

304
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,500
a third party pen tester and then we

305
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,980
want to see who is who is reporting most

306
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,200
number of findings how they're doing in

307
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,279
general

308
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,440
average busy time for each Manchester

309
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,860
like I said how how how many requests do

310
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,600
I get for each of the pen testing from

311
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,540
engineering how busy they are and how

312
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:16,519
each of the pen testing is taking time

313
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:19,760
foreign

314
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,279
before that I would like to say this is

315
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,399
a open source tool simple installation I

316
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,800
I would provide a Docker file as well

317
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,540
which you can just run in your

318
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,420
environment and make the tool up uh and

319
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:37,019
uh feel free to open any uh git issues

320
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:39,720
that you feel or any new ideas that you

321
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,600
know or any better way to solve the

322
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,959
problem and I would be happy to take up

323
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:47,880
uh we go to

324
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,139
tool demo

325
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,540
[Music]

326
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:57,980
I like is it visible

327
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:03,959
okay now first is the asset section if

328
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:07,920
you go here at create a set first you

329
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,920
have to give this a set name uh it could

330
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,579
be anything by which your organization

331
00:14:13,579 --> 00:14:17,519
is recognizing the asset a set type

332
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,800
there are various asset types right it

333
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,500
could be web it could be API it could be

334
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,139
Network it could be web and API both it

335
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:26,579
could be mobile app config review

336
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:28,680
phishing web mobile it could be anything

337
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,920
that you are pen testing

338
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,860
as a description what you would like to

339
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,500
enter here is what is that particular

340
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,860
asset is for so this helps us

341
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:45,480
understanding what this asset is for and

342
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,920
how much important it is for

343
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,579
organization asset size this helps us

344
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:52,920
calculating

345
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,279
how much time and also pentister knows

346
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:58,620
that okay this is a small size medium

347
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,199
size or large aside that he's he or she

348
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,339
is going to test and

349
00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:07,680
and a set coverage now

350
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,019
um should it be default default is

351
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:13,199
default meaning uh within us some

352
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,420
reasonable time it should cover a

353
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,940
popular methodology such as OS top 10

354
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,540
cents CWS and like that uh or it should

355
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,940
be time bound so you know that your

356
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,920
engineering is going to go live with

357
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,320
this application in next seven days so

358
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,060
it should be time bound only critical

359
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,040
and high should be

360
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,639
um uh should be kept attention to and

361
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:38,820
then uh next is extensive no matter how

362
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,440
much amount it takes how much amount of

363
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,240
time it takes but it has to be a

364
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,199
comprehensive testing

365
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:49,380
so once you create a asset you will see

366
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,380
that all the asset would be listed here

367
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:54,240
so uh I've created some assets here

368
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,019
already so for example finops uh that is

369
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:01,199
the web plus API type of set scope was

370
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,839
time bound we did one round of pen test

371
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,839
for this asset and risk score is 18. we

372
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,579
will come back again to this risk score

373
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:12,060
after we finish pen test

374
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,120
so here uh basically uh you have a set

375
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,459
DB where you know uh which kind of

376
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:19,500
assets you have and how much round of

377
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,519
pen test you performed

378
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,800
now let's go back to pen test

379
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,620
now when you are creating pen test

380
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,959
you have to select an asset because you

381
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,480
cannot so when when you enforce this

382
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,579
when when we enforce this selection of

383
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,860
asset that means that a set needs to be

384
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,959
there in a set DB so we don't miss

385
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:41,699
anything there

386
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:44,940
once you select an asset uh you should

387
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,500
provide a targets it could be list of

388
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,720
ips if you are doing vapt it could be

389
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,399
your apks if you're doing mobile

390
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,560
application or it could be a list of

391
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,959
users if you're doing phishing or it

392
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,639
could be a simply URLs if you're doing

393
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,500
web testing

394
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,320
methodology again this is something

395
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,779
which you would tell that okay hey this

396
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:06,240
is the URL which which I've given but

397
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,319
you also concentrate on apis

398
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,980
next is testing Focus which methodology

399
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,799
you want developer to pay attention to

400
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,459
uh it could be like OS sense or if it is

401
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:24,540
a configuration review you want to do uh

402
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,959
by missed guidelines and so on

403
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,720
credentials uh uh whether you are okay

404
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,000
to sign up and create or you have to

405
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,620
connect with your spark for credential

406
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,500
or no credential needed

407
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,900
now include user roles and privilege

408
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,880
information whatever application or

409
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,860
asset that you are testing which all

410
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:47,039
user roles are there admin analyst bu

411
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,620
there's so many roles right so here you

412
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,539
list that hey these many roles are there

413
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:53,700
for this application

414
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,860
instruction notes knowledge transfer

415
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,380
here you might want to transfer

416
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,299
something to your next pen tester which

417
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:02,400
which is something you don't have to

418
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,679
tell but it says in Davi so for example

419
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:07,320
let's say the application for which

420
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,480
you're creating pen test you know that

421
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,120
there is a payment Gateway which needs

422
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,799
to be tested thoroughly because this is

423
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:15,660
business critical so you mentioned that

424
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,360
here technology stack this is mainly

425
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,660
needed in order to concentrate on some

426
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,460
attacks for example if they are using

427
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,280
nosql DBS your next fantasy would know

428
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,440
that no SQL DB kind of attacks needs to

429
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,480
be tried if it is MySQL so while he's

430
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,340
trying SQL injection he would focus on

431
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,980
my skilled payloads

432
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,340
Target environment if it is production

433
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,700
pre-production or QA uh this is this is

434
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,020
because if they are running any

435
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,299
automated tools they would know uh how

436
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:48,059
much fragile it is white listing needed

437
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:49,980
in order to access whether there is a

438
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,799
web snack kind of a scenario in between

439
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,860
sensitive business business function uh

440
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,140
like I mentioned is it fine to dos and

441
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,720
work first uh you see even if it is

442
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,700
production you really want to test uh

443
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,160
whether it goes down by any doors or no

444
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,980
any test data whether it can create or

445
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,799
it cannot estimated start date and end

446
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,780
date by which application should be

447
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,660
tested now scope Default Time bound

448
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,360
extensive and asset size so once you

449
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,299
create a pen test so let's assume I've

450
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:23,340
created one

451
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,860
so this is a pen test now if I click on

452
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,900
this pen test I know that these are the

453
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,360
targets which are being tested this was

454
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,160
the pen test type this was the

455
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,080
methodology that was being focused

456
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,360
credential you can create these are the

457
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,559
user roles these are the knowledge

458
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:39,919
transfer this is the Technologies Tech

459
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,600
whitelisting need a no sensitive modules

460
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,120
this was the start date this was the end

461
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,940
date and how many issues were identified

462
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,000
till the time for this pen test so you

463
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,919
see high medium low count that means

464
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:55,380
these were the issues which were

465
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,900
identified for respective and tests so

466
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,059
you can go on clicking next pen test and

467
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:01,559
you would see all the information here

468
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:03,780
so I'm selling right next time another

469
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,940
pen tester picks up you just click on

470
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,280
this and they would know now let's go

471
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,220
back to issue tracker so uh here if you

472
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,799
go and add issues you will have option

473
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:17,580
to upload files now here you can upload

474
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:21,360
your Excel your any automated tool

475
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,940
reports it all it would do is read any

476
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:27,840
issues from those Excel and parse it in

477
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,419
a in a in a data format which tool

478
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:33,480
understands and store it in the Deep

479
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,780
now let's assume that you have added

480
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,460
issues for some of the Assets Now for

481
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,520
example for travel X I have added these

482
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,940
many issues okay so I know until this

483
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,520
when I create a when I select a pen test

484
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,440
I know that there were six issues which

485
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,480
were being identified these was the

486
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,000
issue description severity this is how

487
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,039
we remediate and these was the issue

488
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:58,280
status

489
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:01,080
for each of and you can create as many

490
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,880
you can select as many pen tests you

491
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,340
want now next is developer corner so for

492
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,020
developer Corner developer really have

493
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,059
to come here and check all the issues

494
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,799
that are being reported over a period of

495
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,820
time here and he can also change the

496
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,620
status of issue now let's say he picks

497
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,600
up this course misconfiguration issue

498
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,539
for finops and it's a spending fix it

499
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:25,140
can really go and say closed because

500
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:28,740
he fixed it so he could change the

501
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,740
um change the status of the issue uh

502
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,900
depending on which all issue that he is

503
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,659
fixing so some of that he he say see

504
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:38,460
this one he would say is discharging

505
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,039
rest is spending fix he would say closed

506
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,840
or risk accepted it could be anything

507
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,020
uh now next is Analytics now this

508
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,179
analytics is created based on whatever

509
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:53,940
data that we have passed on to the Tool

510
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,460
uh first one is current risk Kosher for

511
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,679
all the asset for a given point of time

512
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:00,780
given all the Panthers that are being

513
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,720
performed on that asset uh this is the

514
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,780
current risk kosher we have so many high

515
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:10,080
uh low and medium uh being opened till

516
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,559
date uh next is recurring issue visual

517
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:15,900
issues are there which we are we're

518
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,640
finding it again again over a period of

519
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,360
time so if you look here

520
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:24,299
uh 15.4 percentage of time we have seen

521
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:26,700
uh when we are using known components

522
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,799
we're seeing the CV is associated

523
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,020
average amount of time taken for each

524
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:34,020
pen test was it uh versus asset size so

525
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:37,620
uh x axis represents the time and y-axis

526
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:40,140
represents the scope so when asset size

527
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,940
is medium this is the time which

528
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,980
generally takes when asset size becomes

529
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,620
smaller time becomes slow and when asset

530
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:50,840
size is large time is very high

531
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,020
so this will help you understand this

532
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,820
graph will help you understand that when

533
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,220
you are when you are this graph has to

534
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,919
lie in conjunction with your asset size

535
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,960
right if if it is small it time has to

536
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,240
be less medium and large respectively so

537
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,400
if it goes another way you know that

538
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,460
your pen tester are going

539
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:13,679
somewhere around

540
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,260
class of new vulnerabilities discovered

541
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,240
these are the vulnerabilities which are

542
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,679
uh being discovered newly in your

543
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,200
organization ecosystem uh open findings

544
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,020
so you saw a developer corner right uh

545
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:31,320
some risks for some of them risk is

546
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,059
accepted for some of them it is closed

547
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:35,340
for some it is Trials but right now

548
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,620
there are so many open findings which is

549
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,699
there in your organization

550
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:45,299
asset health so uh I show I showed you

551
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:47,580
four assets that are there so how is the

552
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:51,120
asset health so you see a phenopsis very

553
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,100
very unhealthy because none of the issue

554
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,980
are being fixed for that asset HRM going

555
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,260
low low low and most number of issues

556
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:02,520
are being fixed for those two assets

557
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,400
average busy time for each Manchester so

558
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,220
now you know that uh your pen tester is

559
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:11,340
generally busy when there is uh this

560
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,100
amount of time uh so this one represents

561
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:18,120
day study so uh your pen test busy time

562
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,159
is this much in the meantime if you want

563
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,140
to use the resources for some other

564
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,539
tasks you can

565
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:28,440
uh next is developer Trends how your

566
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,500
developer is fixing each vulnerabilities

567
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,780
in your organization so you see

568
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,640
sometimes they just don't sometimes they

569
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,940
do so this represents how your developer

570
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:42,200
is fixing the vulnerability

571
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:48,120
yeah so that's uh I guess it from my

572
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,059
side uh if you have some question we can

573
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:53,720
take it up

574
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:58,140
all right thank you

575
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:01,559
um we do have one question on slido so

576
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:04,200
how does MPT integrate with existing

577
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,480
platforms that companies may already

578
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,539
leverage for example a company might

579
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:11,520
already have monday.com for task

580
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,799
tracking and separate timesheets for for

581
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:15,720
time tracking yeah

582
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,140
so right now what you could do is I

583
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,820
showed one functionality where you could

584
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,700
upload things right so uh it could you

585
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,100
could just create export CSV from that

586
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,679
particular tool or any your existing

587
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:31,200
platform and then import it here it

588
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,760
would it would just normalize it

589
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,380
according to the database which it

590
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,600
understands and then you could you could

591
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,840
just correlate those data

592
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,419
all right uh the next question uh is the

593
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:45,779
mp2 mpt2 currently available and if so

594
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:48,299
how long does it take how long does the

595
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:50,220
default scan take for one IP address

596
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:53,760
MPT tool is available it is on GitHub it

597
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,779
is open source uh it doesn't do scans it

598
00:25:57,779 --> 00:26:00,779
manages pen test so uh it would depend

599
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:02,960
how your pen testing

600
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,980
scanners are taking time that much

601
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,140
amount of time uh it would take to scan

602
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:10,740
one IP all it does is just ingest the

603
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,559
reports that you have you have taken out

604
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:16,399
from your tool

605
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,299
all right and I guess if there's no

606
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:20,840
further questions

607
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,299
thank you

608
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:26,400
but thank you very much so I guess

609
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,620
that's the end of the Contact track for

610
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,260
today so I guess for those who didn't

611
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,940
get your beard first time around I hope

612
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,980
the queue is shorter so I can go and get

613
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,720
your beer if not thank you very much for

614
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,860
coming we look forward to seeing you
