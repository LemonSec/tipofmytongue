1
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,760
hi everybody my name is galdiskin and

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,679
I'm the CTO and co-founder of awesome

3
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:13,080
startup company that specializes in

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,960
identity and access security I've been

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,820
cyber security researcher for many years

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,520
I was for internal Palo Alto networks

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,160
and many other places

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,199
and today I'm going to talk about the

9
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,779
recent research we did about extracting

10
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,060
clear text passwords and depressionating

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,380
multiple users in a octa specifically

12
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,940
which is one of the largest identity

13
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,399
providers there are

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,079
um let's get started

15
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,960
so what am I going to talk about today I

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,239
am going to talk about the background

17
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:48,059
password the set of a security

18
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:52,320
weaknesses that we found in Octa IDP

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,079
um the orange book and some background

20
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,420
about the plastic Computing base for

21
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,699
those of you that remember this type of

22
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:02,699
stuff if not it's worth searching

23
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:04,799
um I'm going to talk about graphs and

24
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,020
knowledge graphs and security and how we

25
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,000
use them as part of our research

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
methodology to methodically find logical

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,040
vulnerabilities

28
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,760
um in on certain types obviously and I'm

29
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,700
going to discuss the research process

30
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,100
that led to discovery of the past lead

31
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,140
issues

32
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,479
which include two main issues one is the

33
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,820
ability to bleed clear text passwords

34
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,360
via skin protocol and the second one is

35
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,700
to impersonate anyone in the main

36
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,479
company have some members of the spoke

37
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,880
of the top so lower security domains

38
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,500
getting to impose an entire security

39
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,840
domains

40
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,299
and lastly I'm going to provide summary

41
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,159
that will include not to write your own

42
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,680
logic vulnerability detection suits very

43
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,079
easily

44
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,520
discuss a little bit about the poverty

45
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,799
reaction to this set of security

46
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,040
weaknesses and what we found and finally

47
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,420
talk about what we've learned and where

48
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,580
to go from here

49
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,480
so without further Ado let's get started

50
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,879
um so as I mentioned we found several

51
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,420
Securities

52
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,500
those will not recognize the

53
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,140
vulnerabilities the OCTA believes that

54
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,200
this is part of the the valid function

55
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,040
of the platform and they are the CNAs so

56
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,080
they get to decide

57
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,080
um it's important to note that while not

58
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,500
vulnerabilities these issues allow less

59
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,959
privileged attackers to enacted to gain

60
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,660
access to the super admin privileges or

61
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,340
extract or the passive clear text

62
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,940
passwords which might be intentional and

63
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,860
in this stuff I worked through the

64
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,319
research process women as well

65
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,300
um and I will touch on a systematic

66
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,459
approach to discovering these certain

67
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:00,000
classes of logic bugs such as book and

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,560
access control so Way Way Back uh when

69
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,840
hacking and the security was just

70
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,720
starting and honestly I was two years

71
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,560
old there was a great book called the

72
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,099
Orange book colloquially of The Trusted

73
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:20,760
computer system evaluation criteria by

74
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,680
the department of U.S Department of

75
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,760
Defense and this evaluation criteria was

76
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,280
about defining what is secure and how to

77
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,860
secure computer systems it was one of

78
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,200
the most famous books for any hacker or

79
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,260
a spelling hacker at the time and it

80
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,480
defined a concept called the Computing

81
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,400
base or TCB in short and TCB means old

82
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,760
system elements

83
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,400
that are excluded from it should not be

84
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,379
needed to be trusted to maintain the

85
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:53,760
protection this is the best definition

86
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,879
for The Trusted Computing base and this

87
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,519
basically means that the TCB are the

88
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,560
things you have to press for your

89
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,319
platform to work securely so I'll get

90
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,200
back to this to the PCB in a moment I

91
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,940
want to talk a little bit about that

92
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,000
networks in security

93
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,500
so what are the knowledge graphs or

94
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,978
known as kgs shortly knowledge graphs

95
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:19,798
are basically networks well you have

96
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:22,680
nodes representing certain entities and

97
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,020
the edges representing certain

98
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,620
relationships between those entities

99
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,540
and when the knowledge graph allows

100
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,660
generally any type of relationship with

101
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,040
any side between any type of entities

102
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,840
and a lot of applications of knowledge

103
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,940
graphs or net graph networks in general

104
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,699
to cyber security usually with very

105
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:48,300
limited set of relations so for example

106
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,820
multigo is a very classical tool that

107
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,280
uses social and even a text it is used

108
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,320
for social and even a text service

109
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,000
mapping

110
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,780
um a technical things in graphs a

111
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,220
bloodhound which is very famously

112
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,860
related to an entire category of

113
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,900
products called Cloud infrastructure

114
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,199
entitlements management which protects

115
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:12,620
cloud service provider identity systems

116
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,180
and

117
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,800
Valence attack simulation tools and the

118
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,840
list can go on and on and on but well

119
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,500
not able to talk about that today so

120
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,500
what do I want to talk about

121
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,919
um how we use graphs to map trust and

122
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:32,580
discover vulnerabilities so uh knowledge

123
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,919
graphs can basically use to be to

124
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:36,600
systematically find these logical

125
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,840
vulnerabilities and how we do this is by

126
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,020
defining nodes and assets privileges or

127
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,060
laptops it's important to include the

128
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,400
actuals and the Privileges as well it's

129
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,800
a well it's applicable and this is the

130
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,100
trust relations between these entities

131
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,780
defining who can do what or who is

132
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,419
allowed to do what and do trusts Which

133
00:05:57,419 --> 00:05:59,220
element would the system trust to each

134
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,919
other element of the system or not of

135
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,919
the system to perform to perform an

136
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:07,440
action or achieve a certain level of

137
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,580
their trust and what we innovated in a

138
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,460
sense is that we add mistrust edges

139
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,820
which represent lack of trust or who

140
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,340
shouldn't get towards in a certain sense

141
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,039
what this creates is basically that

142
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,259
anywhere that you can find the chain of

143
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:28,380
thrust that ends with a one with a

144
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,960
mistress Edge you found the

145
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,539
vulnerability and

146
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:36,360
while we're doing this one it enables

147
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,580
collaboration in teams well different

148
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,620
team members can research different

149
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,259
elements and don't have to know every

150
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:46,440
finding of the other team member second

151
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,080
knowledge preservation by putting this

152
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,240
data on a graph if we come back to this

153
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,819
application a year or several months

154
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:55,800
later and we don't remember anything all

155
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,699
the knowledge is preserved say

156
00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:00,979
visualization for manual work and

157
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:03,900
prioritization visualization allows us

158
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,840
to do manual work in guests places where

159
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,720
we might want to invest their clothing

160
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,600
research and prioritize

161
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,539
um and lastly automation sometimes the

162
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:16,860
vulnerabilities and the connection

163
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,139
change the connections to find The

164
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,780
Logical ability of a very complex you

165
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,759
can't necessarily hold them in your head

166
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,160
by Translating that to a graph and

167
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,860
analyzing the graph so graph analysis

168
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,039
algorithms uh even the simple ones like

169
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:34,699
cycle finding we can literally

170
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:36,319
cut

171
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,720
a reducer Banks

172
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,479
so without further Ado let's go to an

173
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:43,860
example

174
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,900
um let's say I have a super admin

175
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,240
privileges in bathtub which is my

176
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,300
example for today and then I'm defining

177
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,160
the first press relationship being

178
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,620
usable by someone is a type of a trust

179
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,780
relationship I'm saying super admin

180
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,060
people are just unusable by subod means

181
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,220
that makes sense now I'm saying super

182
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,440
admins are identified by a successful

183
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,440
login which depends on which is another

184
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,560
and identified by is a type of trust

185
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,199
relationship depends on is another type

186
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,880
type of fast relationship right

187
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,759
successful again depends on password

188
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:23,120
verification and all MFA as well

189
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,020
and at this point I think we're sort of

190
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:31,039
agreed on the basic principle now

191
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,779
before I continue I want to give you a

192
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,299
short explanation about the the

193
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,640
connection between access relationship

194
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,700
and Trust relationship in general

195
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,700
access relationship for example if I can

196
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,399
access something it means that that

197
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:50,220
something needs to trust me or this the

198
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,720
component in the system that is

199
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,600
accessing it by definition unless there

200
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,380
is certain filter or control around that

201
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,320
um and this is how we got that at this

202
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,540
point let's start talking about the

203
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,120
security weaknesses that we found in

204
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,019
Austin

205
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:10,200
so first one is about the ability to

206
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,860
bleed out clear text passwords via the

207
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,300
skin protocol

208
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,980
so let's start with the first question

209
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,019
for those of you that don't know what is

210
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:22,260
a scheme scheme is an identity

211
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,959
provisioning protocol that is used to

212
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,000
automate the synchronization of User

213
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,720
Group data from centralized sources like

214
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,200
idps as a cell providers directories to

215
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,860
Downstream applications and

216
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,080
interestingly enough this diagram comes

217
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,839
from the Microsoft documentation OCTA

218
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:45,600
have extended scheme to support password

219
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,240
synchronization and they are doing that

220
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,779
by sending passwords in clear text

221
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:54,240
um now going back to the story that we

222
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,660
just started earlier or the graph of the

223
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,459
Privileges let's go ahead with this

224
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:02,160
analysis as we've been researching it so

225
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,320
we started by mapping the application

226
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,420
which is the standard action that we do

227
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,339
every time we start with an application

228
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:11,880
at which point we sort of realize that

229
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,720
in order for them to be

230
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,860
synchronization of passwords that has to

231
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,320
be a descriptive or task a pattern still

232
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,500
so we added it to our Maps

233
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,000
um and

234
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,820
the we added to the map the trust to the

235
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,399
skin password SYNC feature itself which

236
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:31,800
trust the skin several operators which

237
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,339
who gets these uh passwords in clear

238
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:38,640
text and I'll assume to protect them

239
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,459
securely now this might be actually

240
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:44,880
valid Enterprise applications at which

241
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,760
point we sort of are okay with that

242
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,680
although we are trusting that the

243
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,260
Enterprise application vendor third

244
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,660
party company

245
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:56,459
employs with the relevant access to see

246
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:58,980
for example the network logs or firewall

247
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,920
logs for read the submitted passwords

248
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,100
are not making any use of it

249
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,620
um and the other thing webcasting is

250
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,680
that other skin cellular owners are not

251
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,320
the target of this

252
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,260
um provisioning and which could actually

253
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,019
also be the balance now

254
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:21,720
who's choosing this the effort means uh

255
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,620
this either became server operators of

256
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,779
valid Enterprise application targets

257
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:30,600
that are acting as Skin servers are

258
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,360
chosen by the apple means in Octa but

259
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,940
effort means are clearly not allowed

260
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,700
super admin privileges because they are

261
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,920
a different level of privilege which is

262
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,120
much lower

263
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,060
so we got to this map and obviously I'm

264
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,860
showing you only the interesting Parts

265
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,500
the map is huge and it's covering a lot

266
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,079
of other elements of the aux application

267
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,600
which we didn't yes

268
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,700
um we did I didn't include in this

269
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,320
diagram because that would be a little

270
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,519
confusing

271
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,459
and but we actually as bonus found the

272
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:05,399
cycle that goes to one mistrust Edge and

273
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:07,800
the set of thrust edges and now

274
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,839
basically when we find this type of

275
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,240
cycle with back trace and when we find

276
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,700
it in research so I'm going to start

277
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,440
from the app that means and I'm saying

278
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,620
instead of chosen biasing can choose

279
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:24,300
other skin cells owners who will be the

280
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,220
skin server operators

281
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:31,279
who will get the skin password sync data

282
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,959
from the decryptable puzzles though

283
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:35,459
which will include the clear text

284
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:38,180
passwords which allows successful login

285
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,620
and super admin

286
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,079
because identified by there is reversed

287
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:44,040
to as

288
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,940
which is the makes them be able to use

289
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:51,180
super admin privileges so actually by

290
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:54,000
that pricing I've not I now know the set

291
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,760
of actions that they need to do to try

292
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,000
and exploit this logical vulnerability

293
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,800
now

294
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,320
as I go on

295
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,160
um as we found this we started with

296
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,980
saying I thought it was telling son or

297
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,260
who is on my team look we made a mistake

298
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,360
somewhere there's no way that an

299
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,279
apartment can access all passwords

300
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,500
including super admin passwords I'm sure

301
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,540
I'm missing something so let's test

302
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,500
again

303
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,079
and we test it again and we got the

304
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:28,440
clear text password again uh at which

305
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,120
point we'll upload the show that we

306
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,700
actually found something

307
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,740
so Clinton came up with the idea that

308
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,959
probably the effort means that either

309
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,660
very highly privileged or whatever or

310
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,579
whatever

311
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:43,139
um so we started by checking the

312
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:46,139
frequency that customer the environments

313
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:48,180
because we are connected to their

314
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,760
applications especially identity systems

315
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,579
to monitor those and we found that some

316
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:55,440
of our customers especially the larger

317
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,120
ones have tens or hundreds or in some

318
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,040
cases of apparents

319
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,000
um

320
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,700
at which point we said let's try and

321
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,000
understand why they have this and it

322
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,040
took us several days to analyze this but

323
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,899
we got to a conclusion and the

324
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:16,260
conclusion was this is de facto the

325
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,720
lowest building role that can assign

326
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,839
users the permission to use apps in Octa

327
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,000
which is why when you want to

328
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,779
democratize access or basically assign

329
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:29,940
anyone that is not one of the core

330
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:34,019
admins in IIT of of the OCTA platform

331
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:38,040
itself to give users access most

332
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,500
organizations make these people have

333
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,980
admins

334
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,639
so but let me dive into a small bit of

335
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:49,199
technicality

336
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,660
um this is the actual Json payload that

337
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,060
you see on the right hand side uh that

338
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,579
is sent by OCTA to any skin server I

339
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:58,139
actually rather than take an example

340
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:00,420
that I generated myself took an example

341
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:04,079
from the OCTA documentation

342
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,300
um and I like to say a few more with the

343
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,600
password that says very secure

344
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,820
um and this is the actual password this

345
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,459
is not obfuscated it's sent in clear

346
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:16,800
tests and the other piece that is

347
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,079
interesting here is that the other data

348
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:23,339
that is transferred is in in parts pii

349
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,980
and it's time for the also in clear text

350
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:30,180
if you are sending it over HTTP

351
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,180
um which the uh no actual controls to

352
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,940
prevents

353
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,160
[Music]

354
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,120
um

355
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,160
so let me describe a few attack

356
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,380
scenarios based on this

357
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,199
so a text scenario one

358
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,839
let's say you have an Insider lawyer who

359
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,699
is an apartment

360
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:49,440
um he is bright let's say by some

361
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,540
initial access broker which is a very

362
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,899
common activity pattern as we've seen

363
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:58,019
recently with for example the lapsus

364
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:01,320
group uh who like to use it but many

365
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:05,040
other parts of the cyber cyber crime

366
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,339
ecosystem are also using it his

367
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:11,279
exfiltrating those passwords to a server

368
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,339
that he controls and basically this

369
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:16,800
point is making money

370
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,660
um and goes back to the valid

371
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,760
configuration let's talk about

372
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,860
a different scenario let's say the

373
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,260
attacker compromises one of the tens of

374
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:28,620
apple means that an organization has

375
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,420
um they expected the super admin

376
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,279
password or an automated account

377
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:36,180
password login using that password and

378
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,699
they may need to build MFA at which

379
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:42,180
point the Privileges creation is Success

380
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:45,000
successful and they are done

381
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,680
um

382
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,300
and lastly let's talk about the

383
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,980
situation where I made that but main

384
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,800
configures came to point to some HTTP

385
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,560
and not https

386
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,240
unencrypted Target

387
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,399
um the article can Smith network graphic

388
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:01,740
at this point anyone that is sitting in

389
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,380
the middle or able to sniff traffic in

390
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,699
the middle

391
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:09,319
um and they will find passwords and pii

392
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:12,959
which they then can monetize a level

393
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,359
their points

394
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,339
um the the second security issue that we

395
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:21,059
found is about the ability of anyone in

396
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:23,579
the spoke which is a sub unit of the

397
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,740
organization to impersonate anyone in

398
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,500
the hub or the Millions

399
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,059
and to explain this let's start from

400
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:31,980
talking about how the orchestra haven't

401
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,799
spoke architecture works so that was in

402
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,020
Spoke architecture is basically

403
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,360
um an architecture that allows dividing

404
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,260
multiple tenants of OCTA to um for for

405
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,020
example business units acquired

406
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,080
companies Outsource companies to work

407
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,820
with a balanced company or a main

408
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,580
company who access the Hub or the

409
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,520
central unit while all of those subunits

410
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,640
are acting as folks now

411
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,340
and the diagram on the screen shows one

412
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,799
of the recommended deployment models by

413
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,500
OCTA a large organization with multiple

414
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,600
business units well the business units

415
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,179
of the spokes uh they are talking to the

416
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:15,240
hub and they have is talking to

417
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,280
um anything else that you need to access

418
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,700
so it could be on-premise resources it

419
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,340
could be Cloud applications and so on

420
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,440
and so forth

421
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,220
um and every business unit gets a Spoke

422
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,020
uh and all the spots are connected is

423
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,480
identity providers to the main company

424
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,780
which is acting as the Hub now I'll get

425
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,600
back to this but uh to give you a hint

426
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,179
identity providers are trusted by

427
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:44,580
whoever they provide identities to by

428
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,559
definition

429
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,400
um

430
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,580
second uh example of the deployment

431
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,520
model is a third party including

432
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,200
contractor and Outsourcing and again

433
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,059
this is taking taken from the

434
00:18:57,059 --> 00:18:59,940
recommended after documentation

435
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,419
um connecting to a retail company hub

436
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:06,299
and each third party provider gets spoke

437
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:09,299
all folks are connected against idps to

438
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:11,280
the main company

439
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,059
and disconnected appropriately

440
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:17,220
and among deployment scenarios like m a

441
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:22,260
a geo location based and so on

442
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:26,280
now back to our favorite diagram let's

443
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,720
continue it in a different direction

444
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,960
from the one we looked at before so as

445
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,840
successful again trust any IDP Who

446
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,660
provided the credentials and verify that

447
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,559
again

448
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:41,460
and this IDP could be any spoke there

449
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,620
are also other types of idps that won't

450
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,020
get into this now

451
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,780
um and any spoke depends on the user

452
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,780
store in the default configuration to

453
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:55,980
know who what actual user data to send

454
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:01,080
to the other to the hub and this user

455
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,720
install in Octa is controlled by any all

456
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,380
good mean or super admin roles in

457
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,000
addition

458
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,400
um anyone that can actually edit the

459
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,240
configuration of the username so sent by

460
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,160
the old to all application which is

461
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,860
basically the application with

462
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:22,020
implementing this for having spoke

463
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,919
architecture from the side of the spoke

464
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:28,520
can choose which user name anyone gets

465
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,440
so that means they can also control the

466
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,640
username sense to the app and therefore

467
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,200
identify as anyone they want

468
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,020
so and this is by the way in hand to any

469
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,120
identity provider this is not unique to

470
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,640
OCTA this is the way modern SSO and

471
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,580
identity providers work

472
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,440
so

473
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,179
um now that we know that this could

474
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:53,580
spoke Apple super admins of all

475
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,340
guidelines in different cases could

476
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,919
actually control the identity that gets

477
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:00,360
sent

478
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,520
um who are these folks at the

479
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,799
organization and in those apartments or

480
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,380
subliments they could be

481
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,679
um the arguments vocal means of the m a

482
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:13,799
acquired company spoke admins and they

483
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:15,780
could be even external company employees

484
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:19,080
in the example of the Outsource company

485
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,020
that is working with

486
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,640
your company and connecting the office

487
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,400
via the having spot configuration now

488
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,120
that actually means that they should not

489
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,860
be allowed to have this access right

490
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,960
because they are not the Super names at

491
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,080
the main company or the Hub company now

492
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,539
going backwards what would happen

493
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:42,179
same as before to analyze the attack

494
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:45,659
press itself the old unit spoke admin

495
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:48,179
who have all the external company employ

496
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:51,080
you as this access

497
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,240
might be a super admin novel an old

498
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,140
admin or an app admin in his home OCTA

499
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:01,620
tenants bespoke in this book they will

500
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,720
make sure that the right user is either

501
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,059
created or configured into all

502
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:08,640
throughout replication as the identity

503
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,919
of the super admin which allows them to

504
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:17,580
identify and login as that user which

505
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,820
allows them basically to become

506
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:24,480
they to use the user of any existing Hub

507
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,980
Subaru which makes them surveillance uh

508
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,659
it gives them against them superlative

509
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:32,760
privileges in the hub

510
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,860
now

511
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,020
I when we got there

512
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,840
10 came up and they said to me look out

513
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,580
there is no way that I've trusted to

514
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,799
this book implicitly

515
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:46,980
um and I said but this is what the this

516
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,840
is what it means to be an IDP right I

517
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,480
identity provider provider identities

518
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,000
and it's also in the white people on the

519
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,220
off the side the white people which you

520
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:59,159
saw the screenshots from earlier

521
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:01,559
um and Sam was asking like you're saying

522
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:03,659
that the admins of South units that bad

523
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:05,820
companies outsourced companies have

524
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:09,240
happened in Access and there is no way

525
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,760
they must block the duplicate usernames

526
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,620
there

527
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,020
um and then we said I said father and

528
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,539
they found the documentation and it

529
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:21,000
literally says out of the box duplicate

530
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,240
names thought is a feature and besides

531
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,460
we actually managed to

532
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,740
um create this flow and you can see the

533
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,059
video on YouTube if you're really

534
00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:31,679
interested

535
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,600
um and you know at that point can also

536
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,220
silent and I have to tell you it's

537
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:41,460
fairly well that's very silence

538
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,640
um so we we came up with the question of

539
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,100
why is it like this right because it's

540
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:51,120
not random it's not by uh it's obviously

541
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,240
by Design in certain sense

542
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,059
um and it took us several days but we

543
00:23:57,059 --> 00:23:58,860
came to the conclusion that it's the

544
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:01,200
easiest way for after to implement that

545
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,900
functionality that is similar to active

546
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,260
directory or use or trees and forests

547
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:10,440
and basically this is what after winter

548
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,960
did

549
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:16,080
and after added controls to prevent

550
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,100
administrator login from IDP spoke too

551
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:23,580
hard but it's a regular expression which

552
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,340
is nearly unmaintainable right unless

553
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,740
you have a very very sure that you can

554
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,500
match all the admins now and in the

555
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,080
future into this liberal expression you

556
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,700
are very likely to fail to implement

557
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,340
this the other thing The End by the way

558
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,140
it's not on by default you need to

559
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,900
actually figure this out and the other

560
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,539
thing is even if you do that it doesn't

561
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:48,299
prevent Downstream impersonation to

562
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:51,299
other users which could be admins in

563
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:53,159
some of the applications connected to

564
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,679
the hub tenants

565
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,260
um and there are some ways to prevent

566
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:01,320
Downstream impersonation specifically

567
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,080
there is one way that we found which is

568
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:04,940
to

569
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,559
configure your OCTA in a way that's

570
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:10,679
actually forces the user names from

571
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:14,280
every IDP to have a certain Graphics or

572
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:18,539
suffix that can't be changed now the

573
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:21,240
interesting thing about this is that

574
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,820
this is these capability is not

575
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,880
documented as a security feature and it

576
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,860
requires the customer to perform an

577
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,600
architectural change in all these

578
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,520
usernames and Downstream from their

579
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,720
father so again not actually news we

580
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,100
haven't found this in any of our

581
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,860
customers but

582
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,440
this is what it is

583
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,320
now let's talk about your text scenarios

584
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,340
based on the urban spoke architecture in

585
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,400
order to escalate beverages so one is

586
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,679
let's say there is somebody in a small

587
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,740
company that was a Acquired and added as

588
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,900
a spoke

589
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:03,539
and she's compromised you know the big

590
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:05,400
company the quality it could be a

591
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,860
Fortune 500 company the smaller Cloud

592
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:11,059
company could be a 5 or 10-man company

593
00:26:11,059 --> 00:26:14,460
with very low security standards at

594
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,559
which point the spoke admin is used to

595
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,679
impersonate super admin in the hub and

596
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,200
success for the attackers second sonar

597
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,480
that we can talk about is let's start

598
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,640
party Outsource company is connected as

599
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,799
a Spoke

600
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,380
um and the admin in bespoke which is a

601
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,740
not an employee in the company

602
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:36,539
impersonates the CEO of the company

603
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:39,960
that's hired his company uh in different

604
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,659
applications he could gain access to

605
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:45,120
confidential data you can even manage to

606
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,760
transfer money

607
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,900
um and later learn some demand arrives

608
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,279
ubiquity is a good example of what

609
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,080
happens when people want to do things

610
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,779
like that

611
00:26:56,779 --> 00:27:00,299
inside our admin creates an after

612
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:02,640
developer Talent this is another example

613
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,240
we connect to modify the spokes 2.2 is

614
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,240
spoke which creates basically

615
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:13,080
um capacity controls the accessing and

616
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,360
it continues to maintain its access both

617
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,580
these retirement or departure from the

618
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,380
company

619
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:21,299
and then God knows what he does with

620
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:23,039
that

621
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,380
so I hope that was interesting up to

622
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,380
Hill let's really talk quickly about the

623
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,480
conclusions some reactions that we've

624
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,299
gotten and the summary of This research

625
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:36,179
so first off I want to tell you build

626
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:38,840
your own graph analysis it's very easy

627
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,059
uh as you can see here the I have an

628
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:44,840
example based on the network X Library

629
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,539
uh known as NX shortly

630
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:49,980
um basically

631
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,700
you can do it in a few lines of python

632
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,679
to add nodes edges

633
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,340
um and basically

634
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:02,159
allow the access that you need

635
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,260
two

636
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:07,799
um you can then use the same methodology

637
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:11,100
that I mentioned to find cycles for a

638
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,380
specific Target or for any Target as you

639
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,820
see in the different two different lines

640
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,039
at the top sometimes when your Gap is

641
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,020
very big you want to focus on specific

642
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:22,140
targets because it becomes costly

643
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,000
um and

644
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,520
lastly you can visualize play very

645
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,000
quickly using Network apps

646
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,799
you will learn as you start using it in

647
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:34,740
a better ways obviously you also want to

648
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,659
have a good backend for this probably

649
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:39,179
not the files that Network X is

650
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:42,299
important exporting film

651
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:43,980
um but things like

652
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:44,659
um

653
00:28:44,659 --> 00:28:47,960
graph databases like

654
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:52,320
neo4jango DB or tiger graph and so on

655
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,820
um really don't forget to save your

656
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,799
graphs otherwise only work will be gone

657
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:58,679
but again the little value here is the

658
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:02,400
ability to collaborate and maintain and

659
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,740
and

660
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,480
preserve the knowledge and automatically

661
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,460
analyze it

662
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,640
um so I want to have

663
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,700
to save human like one minutes to talk

664
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,500
about the public reaction we go to This

665
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,899
research so there was a lot of battle

666
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:21,059
regarding this I have a few questions

667
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:24,480
that I recommend everyone to ask if app

668
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,340
admins can get the super admin password

669
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,919
why better having a different role at

670
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:33,179
all now I got some people saying they

671
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:35,100
still have an effect in certain cases

672
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,100
this is true but if one factor was

673
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,799
enough why did we configure MFA or add

674
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,659
second factor or multi-factor

675
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:44,580
authentication in the third place

676
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,960
and

677
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,240
if the master password should be shared

678
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,399
why is no one else in the same field

679
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:51,899
doing this

680
00:29:51,899 --> 00:29:54,720
um needle common password managers or

681
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,360
SSL and those supporting possible based

682
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,200
SSO none of those that were found

683
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:05,039
support sharing the master password now

684
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,020
um if spokes represented all security

685
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,700
domain in the case of having spot

686
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,220
architecture which could be our user

687
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,679
parties or M A what is the default

688
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,480
configuration allowing them to

689
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,880
impersonate anyone in their domain they

690
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,899
have

691
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:20,640
um and they said that and this is

692
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,640
advertised clearly as a feature

693
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,220
um and lastly I want to say that there

694
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,720
are certain losers that tried to

695
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,960
capitalize and opportunities to discard

696
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,720
it others and whoever I'm talking about

697
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,880
you know so I'm talking what I'm talking

698
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,419
about them and they are not going to get

699
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:42,059
any reaction other than this

700
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:43,559
so

701
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:44,820
to

702
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:47,399
um to finalize this I want to say the 12

703
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:49,020
volts very close in the dark and

704
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,779
security team and we really appreciate

705
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:54,179
the focus on this

706
00:30:54,179 --> 00:30:57,059
um and I I think that on one hand those

707
00:30:57,059 --> 00:30:59,279
are not considered vulnerabilities

708
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,779
um but they are part of the system

709
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:03,659
specification in Oxford science but on

710
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:04,919
the other hand they really appreciate

711
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:06,960
the intense to

712
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,539
um improve their platform and I know

713
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:12,419
that they have plans to add controls

714
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:14,899
um around these areas and

715
00:31:14,899 --> 00:31:17,880
improve the separation between worlds

716
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,039
and they will end by saying that we have

717
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:22,440
more disclosures coming soon not just

718
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,100
polakta but also also for other vendors

719
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:26,720
um

720
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,000
and finally just to summarize everything

721
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,039
I went to

722
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:35,039
um my knowledge graphs are available to

723
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:37,159
collect knowledge for attack and defense

724
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:40,799
uh and you can apply them to do trust

725
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,020
analysis at scale and systematically

726
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,360
find logic bugs

727
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,880
um and this is very cool I think I think

728
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,919
it's also very useful if you can

729
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,559
preserve the knowledge in this way uh

730
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:55,860
automate the positive and collaborate in

731
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,020
large teams without everybody needing to

732
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,419
know what others are doing

733
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:01,140
um

734
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,700
and I think there are certain

735
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,700
implications to possibly the issues One

736
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,279
Carpet means can get any ones including

737
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:10,860
the super admin passwords meaning we are

738
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,899
likely to see certain possible dams

739
00:32:12,899 --> 00:32:16,020
coming soon clear their passwords so

740
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,640
they were

741
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,320
um well if you see one that is

742
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,799
unexplained this is worth investigating

743
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,620
um spokes in the heart and spoke

744
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,779
architectural admins can impersonate

745
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,020
anyone in the hub

746
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:32,460
the downstream applications in the

747
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,799
default configuration so understand it

748
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,840
whenever you connect the spoke you're

749
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,880
putting your entire organization at risk

750
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,179
and the plan accordingly apply the

751
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:43,860
security code process see what I

752
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:47,159
discussed about the naming prefixes and

753
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:50,100
so on and lastly don't believe the

754
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,860
science I think this is 405 it's very

755
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:55,740
very sad uh I hope you enjoyed this talk

756
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,740
and if you're interested in learning

757
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,360
anymore I'm happy to answer any

758
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,820
questions now and you can find me on

Twitter and I'm happy to answer

760
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,899
questions there as well you can see our

761
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:09,000
YouTube videos and click on blogs around

762
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,500
this

763
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,460
um

764
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:14,120
thank you
