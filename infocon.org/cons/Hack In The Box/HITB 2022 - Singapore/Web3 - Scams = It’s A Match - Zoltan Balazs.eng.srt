Member at the activity conference and I

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,719
Singapore this is my first time being

13
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,899
here and I am really happy that I have

14
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:42,719
been invited to this conference and this

15
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,940
is just a really amazing place I have to

16
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,260
tell you so I I really really love it

17
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,379
um now let's talk about uh what I will

18
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:55,860
do here and why I'm doing this uh so

19
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,480
actually this is a two-hour presentation

20
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,660
compressed into 25 minutes so fasten

21
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,539
your seal Bots I'm sorry for that

22
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,880
um why I'm doing this I always love

23
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,520
playing with new technologies and I

24
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,619
really find blockchain and very

25
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:13,619
fascinating uh I really do believe that

26
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:16,619
it has a future uh but we are not there

27
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:19,740
yet as you will see very soon

28
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,259
so this presentation is not about the

29
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:25,560
whole cryptocurrency word is a scam it's

30
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,799
not for smart contract developers it is

31
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,439
not a financial advice on which or when

32
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,960
you should invest into it's not about

33
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,259
crypto exchange hacks like you have seen

34
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:40,020
some examples from yesterday from David

35
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,020
6's presentation so you should check out

36
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,640
that one and the whole scam and whole

37
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,619
presentation it's not about topics where

38
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:53,759
cryptocurrency is used as a form of

39
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,939
payment again for example ransomware

40
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:00,119
all right so how did we get here uh a

41
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:01,560
lot of people got rich from

42
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,500
cryptocurrencies that's for sure and a

43
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,719
lot of people want to get rich from

44
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,660
cryptocurrencies and the total market

45
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,360
capitalization is around 1 trillion US

46
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,580
dollars right now when I first made the

47
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,800
slides it was two three iron dollars but

48
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,239
that's it

49
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,720
uh that's written in uh

50
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,300
with all the zeros so it's a lot of

51
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,200
money

52
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,239
I don't know how much that is but it's a

53
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:27,959
lot

54
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:31,020
uh and actually turns out that it is a

55
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,080
very new complex technology and it has

56
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,959
very crappy user interface

57
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,239
so what could possibly go wrong right

58
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,900
I have created uh this animation

59
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,459
whenever scammers are trying to figure

60
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,819
out what's next what should be our next

61
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:52,860
scans what should we do

62
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,280
should it be a Walmart scam no

63
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,640
shall we send some adult content spam to

64
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,000
the users no that's boring T-Mobile has

65
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,420
come no one cares about that UPS package

66
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,980
deliveries come

67
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,000
who cares

68
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,000
oh let's invite the user on Discord to

69
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,060
meet some nfts that's hot right you can

70
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,920
get a lot of money from that

71
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,179
let's like this one

72
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,280
all right uh

73
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,560
pretty sure everyone knows Bitcoin and

74
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,940
what it is

75
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,300
but you have not heard uh Bitcoin and

76
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,420
blockchain explained uh like this lady

77
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:40,019
did and she's a free Grammy Award winner

78
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:43,260
and she knows a lot about blockchains so

79
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,180
let's hear about her opinion what

80
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,680
Bitcoin really is

81
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,080
a message from cash app and the CEO of

82
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,000
hot girl Enterprise Megan the stallion

83
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:00,959
digital currency that's been getting a

84
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,560
lot of hype

85
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,519
Bitcoin is a new kind of money while the

86
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:09,900
cash in your wallet is issued and

87
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,299
regulated by governments Bitcoin is a

88
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:14,879
cryptocurrency like a wild stallion it

89
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,519
can't be controlled by anyone that means

90
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,160
that no one person or organization gets

91
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,139
to decide how much of it is used how

92
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:24,000
much of it is in circulation or what

93
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,450
it's worth

94
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:25,919
[Music]

95
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,919
foreign

96
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,400
there's only a limited amount of Bitcoin

97
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,240
like gold silver or me it's scarcity and

98
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,800
security is what can make Bitcoin

99
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,000
valuable

100
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,400
every Bitcoin is unique and has its own

101
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,620
ID that is certified by a super secure

102
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,620
technology called the blockchain you

103
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,660
can't make a fake Bitcoin no matter how

104
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,259
hard you try

105
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,160
like gold or gas prices bitcoin's value

106
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,320
can go up and down as the demand changes

107
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,300
although there's some other nitty-gritty

108
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,380
stuff that factors in too

109
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,900
that means when people are selling the

110
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,400
price goes down

111
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,040
we want lots of people are buying it it

112
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,699
comes back up

113
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,639
Bitcoin is not hard to get you just

114
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,320
gotta know how you can get it from

115
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,479
another person or from special markets

116
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:29,759
called cryptocurrency exchanges you can

117
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,740
also easily buy it on cash app starting

118
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,240
with as low as one dollars worth

119
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,860
Bitcoin is an investment so you can lose

120
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,380
money the price can go up and down by

121
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,180
the hour but the more you educate

122
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,919
yourself on bitcoin the better equipped

123
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,620
you'll be to navigate those curves

124
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,479
that's all for now but with my knowledge

125
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,160
and your hustle you'll have your own

126
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,500
Empire in no time I'll see you at the

127
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,160
top

128
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,699
pass

129
00:05:55,699 --> 00:05:58,860
so what I really love about this video

130
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,979
is the number of lawyer hours they did

131
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:04,560
put into this video like it's not like

132
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,960
the original scans where they promise

133
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,720
you everything they did really tell you

134
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,940
that hey you can lose money on bitcoin

135
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:17,520
so at least she was not stupid to uh not

136
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,620
involve lawyers into something like this

137
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,240
anyway

138
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,319
um

139
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,740
I also want to introduce you to a new

140
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,919
measurement system I invented for this

141
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:31,080
however free word and it's called the

142
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,699
lambo meter and you can see a piece of

143
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:38,699
Lamborghinis and based on the height of

144
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:41,639
the pile I want to measure how

145
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:44,220
successful the different web free scans

146
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,759
are and how much money someone can make

147
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,580
from these scams the higher the pile the

148
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,500
better right

149
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,940
so

150
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,860
um the different talking about the

151
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,380
different type of scams in uh the web

152
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,440
free word and cryptocurrencies uh most

153
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,720
of you probably know pump and dump uh

154
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,199
it's very easy scheme uh buy a lot from

155
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,960
something which is cheap and it has a

156
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,000
very low trading volume

157
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,940
advertise this as the next big thing

158
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,800
sell it on top

159
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,759
profit easy game right if it's possible

160
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,860
you can sometimes even short when you

161
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,840
are on top and make double money

162
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,520
it's really cool

163
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,460
um if you are a celebrity you can do

164
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,860
this once or twice but after the first

165
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,080
time probably no one will believe you

166
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,139
that this is the next big thing

167
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:40,139
Rock pools Rock pools are pretty similar

168
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:42,900
to pump and dump but the difference is

169
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,940
that here you are the owner or the

170
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,460
developer of the specific cryptocurrency

171
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:51,060
or token or whatever we call this and uh

172
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,180
by being the developer you can control

173
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:58,139
more things and for example here's this

174
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:01,400
very nice chart of a typical rock pool

175
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,199
there was this series called squid game

176
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:07,560
you probably know this and when it got

177
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,080
popular there was a token called

178
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,639
squidgame.com

179
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,880
and it got pumped pretty high then it

180
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,860
was dumped very shortly and people made

181
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,560
a lot of money from it others lost a lot

182
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,819
more

183
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:25,860
um and what was really interesting that

184
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,620
uh there was this quantilex where the

185
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,740
county ransomware group was talking

186
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,559
about things and even they knew about

187
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,380
this uh rockpool scheme so that was

188
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,020
interesting in those chats

189
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:44,219
but again you need some identity to

190
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:46,380
promote something

191
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,019
um I'm I'm not really sure that uh this

192
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:51,190
is going to scale for a while

193
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,339
[Music]

194
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:56,760
giveaways comes uh Twitter accounts are

195
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,019
hacked all the time and also some people

196
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:04,140
are spamming uh popular Twitter accounts

197
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,260
with different spam messages it usually

198
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,140
goes like hey send Bitcoin to this

199
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,300
address and I will send you back twice

200
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,560
the Bitcoins

201
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,800
sounds legit right there's tons of these

202
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,279
here you can see from Elon Musk scams

203
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:22,860
actually back in the day someone did

204
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,940
like 2.8 Bitcoins from this very

205
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,040
specific scam

206
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,980
depends on when the cash-old was it can

207
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:36,420
be okay or not not that cool

208
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,880
sometimes as I mentioned the Twitter

209
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,100
accounts are hacked for example this is

210
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,279
the official Target account doing the

211
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,620
same giveaway scam

212
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,260
um yeah you cannot trust trusted

213
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,880
accounts anymore on the internet

214
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,760
Advanced fifth Road this is one of my

215
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,839
favorites uh I actually received an

216
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:02,540
email like this and

217
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:06,600
like I got it for my main email address

218
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,360
I instantly know that this is a scam so

219
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,760
I wanted to investigate

220
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,480
and this is how it looks like that hello

221
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,180
uh your Bitcoin plus has been founded

222
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,060
with some Bitcoin uh you can go to this

223
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,180
website use this username and use this

224
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,660
password and you can get your Bitcoins

225
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,160
uh

226
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,700
by registering they also asked for my

227
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,220
phone number to set up to factor

228
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,260
authentication

229
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,600
um that was I think both for the purpose

230
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,360
of making the site more legit and

231
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,060
getting my text now my phone number so

232
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:48,060
can scan me later and

233
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,420
once you log in you can see a fake

234
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,779
transaction history and fake bonds and

235
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,779
when you want to withdraw your money

236
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:00,420
they will tell you that just a very

237
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,880
small amount of Bitcoins are missing

238
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,519
before you can withdraw from this

239
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,060
website so if you fall for this Camp

240
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,180
then you send a little bit of Bitcoin to

241
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,459
the website and you believe that after

242
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:16,380
that you can withdraw all of your

243
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,200
Bitcoins and you can going to be rich

244
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,820
spoiler alert you want

245
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,940
so uh let's talk about nfts a little bit

246
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,920
I'm pretty sure most of you guys already

247
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,040
know what an nft is

248
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,620
so

249
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,839
no

250
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:39,839
yeah let's start this

251
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,760
come on okay uh so this is the first and

252
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,120
practically only an FDI boat uh I bought

253
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,779
this like more than four years ago I

254
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:54,300
bought it for one dollar I believe it

255
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,360
has the same value as of today so I did

256
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,660
not get rich from this but I really

257
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,560
don't want to sell this anyway

258
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,899
right now Twitter allows you to link

259
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:10,620
your nft to your profile image and

260
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,920
people think this is cool and so

261
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,720
whenever you visit my Twitter profile

262
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,140
you can see all the properties of this

263
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,899
very ugly Kitty uh the reason I chose

264
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:23,820
this crypto Kitty when I bought it

265
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,740
because this was the cheapest one and

266
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,820
probably the obvious one anyway

267
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,260
as you can see it has some very

268
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,500
interesting properties like

269
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,160
mouth is gerbil pattern Jaguar

270
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,600
first Himalayan

271
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,120
I don't know I don't care whatever let's

272
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,399
see what's on the blockchain right

273
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,200
so if we use etoric scan to check uh how

274
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,700
this

275
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,480
um

276
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,680
nft looks like here you can see that I

277
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,639
am the owner this is my wallet address

278
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:01,920
um you can see which smart contract kill

279
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,980
created this nft

280
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:05,639
um

281
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:09,120
and here is the token ID the token ID is

282
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,300
very important this is practically most

283
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,060
of the time what you buy as an nft from

284
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,899
a smart contract you buy a number that's

285
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:23,459
the basics of nft and you should be

286
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:25,860
really careful whenever you buy

287
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,019
something that sometimes this is only

288
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:30,420
what you buy so let's see the

289
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,180
transaction uh when I bought this what

290
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,920
happened in the background

291
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,860
so as you can see

292
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,639
um

293
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:43,079
the birth function was called for this

294
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:46,820
Kitty and then the transfer function

295
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:51,600
which transferred the nft from the

296
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,899
website from the Creator smart contract

297
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:57,839
account into my account and as you can

298
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,779
see now I'm the proud owner of this

299
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:01,740
number

300
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,200
so what's interesting uh with

301
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,560
cryptokitties that because it's a very

302
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:13,260
old nft they did not store the images on

303
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,380
the blockchain and

304
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,720
as of today no one practically stores

305
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,940
the nft images on the blockchain because

306
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,240
it's very expensive uh but what happens

307
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,100
for example in the case of cryptic

308
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,040
kitties that there is this very long

309
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,920
number which practically defines all the

310
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,560
characteristics of the cryptokitty and

311
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,760
they have a smart contract which can

312
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,820
practically decode these numbers and say

313
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:45,899
that okay if this bit is set to this

314
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:48,540
number then this means that it has the

315
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,720
Himalayan fur or whatever

316
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,480
uh unfortunately I won't have too much

317
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,380
time to discuss about ipfs but if you

318
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,260
are interested I think ipfs is a really

319
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,899
cool technology where you can store

320
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:07,940
files uh you know peer-to-peer way and

321
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:12,680
nowadays most modern nfts they store

322
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:17,699
the URL of your nft picture and this URL

323
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:22,260
points to an ipfs storage and I think

324
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,480
that's the best what we can do right now

325
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,459
but unfortunately there are still

326
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:29,040
sometimes a lot of nft projects where

327
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,760
the you where the image is only stored

328
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,680
on a Google drive or something like that

329
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,260
and on the blockchain you can only see

330
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,860
the Google Drive Link so that's not the

331
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,220
best way to do nfts

332
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:46,079
Okay so

333
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,260
let's go back to this

334
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,459
um

335
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:54,000
quick game uh what do you think who

336
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,540
bought this nft

337
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,600
who's the proud owner of this

338
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,120
say that again

339
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,100
no almost

340
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:09,360
I can help you she created this nft

341
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,579
about herself

342
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:13,820
yes

343
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:18,120
and she bought it for almost 120 Ephraim

344
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,699
last time I checked one ethereum was

345
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:25,279
like 1700 US dollars

346
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:29,540
with The Prado owner of this one

347
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,940
is Justin Bieber he bought it for 500 if

348
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,199
Rome

349
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,980
you can calculate how much money that is

350
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,019
actually I like this

351
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:48,139
art I I think it's pretty cool

352
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,100
what what do you think who is the proud

353
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,180
owner of this nft

354
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,240
it's Snoop Dogg and he pulled it for 200

355
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,699
500 E terms

356
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:05,040
so that's a lot of money

357
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,799
I mean for art it's

358
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:10,559
I don't know anyway

359
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:15,540
and who's this last one last monkey

360
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,099
say that again

361
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:19,919
yes it's aminam

362
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,319
he only

363
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:23,299
spent

364
00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:28,740
123 each verse on that all right

365
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,299
now

366
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,620
um

367
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,260
there are also Rock pools in the nft

368
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:38,179
projects and this is one of my main

369
00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:41,760
uh my favorite story about rap was in

370
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,380
nft projects

371
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,900
um there's this actress called Lana

372
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:50,460
Rhodes and she created an nft project as

373
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,100
well called cryptosis

374
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:58,380
and unfortunately uh after a while she

375
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:03,120
got aggressive comments on Discord and

376
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,140
um she practically canceled the project

377
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,320
and for example here you can see that

378
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,700
someone bought this very beautiful art

379
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:18,740
for uh four thousand dollars uh and now

380
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:22,020
what he's saying on Discord that he

381
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,000
practically spent all of his money on

382
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,799
this uh nft and he has no job and has a

383
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,559
two-year-old son yeah probably not the

384
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:33,720
best investment

385
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,740
and this is a bit another story like to

386
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,840
the same nft project but this is not the

387
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,400
same guy

388
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,140
um

389
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:45,720
and someone is begging Lana for a free

390
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,679
nft and because she just recently had a

391
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,799
new child then she tells that your

392
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,140
diapers are also expensive so I'm not

393
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,320
giving away my precious nfts so what's

394
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,440
really bad about this story that she had

395
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,220
this roadmap and she was promising a

396
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,360
hell a lot of things like

397
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,400
uh

398
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,240
some merch signed by herself and sent to

399
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,640
the top holders and stuff like that

400
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,299
and because she had this road map and

401
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:23,760
she never fulfilled this she might get

402
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,039
sued actually for this because she was

403
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,860
promising something to investors which

404
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,820
she did not deliver

405
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:33,660
okay

406
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:39,020
um and let's go to my main nft scam

407
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,940
this whole story started that I was

408
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:45,600
checking Discord and someone complaining

409
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,559
on Discord that he or she got across a

410
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:51,780
new nft scam

411
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,660
and I was able to see the link for this

412
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:58,500
Camp so I quickly started to investigate

413
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,419
this camp

414
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:03,539
if you go to the website it promises you

415
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:07,320
that you can get some free Doodles which

416
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,880
is another

417
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,000
very famous nft project

418
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,140
and once you connect your ballot to the

419
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,179
website

420
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:20,460
in the background if you analyze the

421
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:24,360
traffic you can see that the website

422
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:28,919
will check all of your nfts you store in

423
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:32,160
the same wallet and it will check the

424
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,400
prices of these nfts kind of suspicious

425
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,980
right and

426
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,580
what will happen if you click on hey I

427
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:45,299
want to get this nft for free then

428
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:49,980
metamask will prompt you with this uh

429
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,280
window where you can either confirm the

430
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,460
transaction or reject it

431
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:59,820
I myself I'm an I.T security guy I know

432
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,640
that I knew already that this is a scam

433
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,039
but it took me some minutes to figure

434
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,340
out what is going on here and what's

435
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,880
really interesting to see that

436
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,679
the source

437
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,780
of the

438
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:21,240
transaction is my wallet my nfts and the

439
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,760
destination

440
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,780
um

441
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,940
I mean the

442
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,419
when whenever you do something on web

443
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:32,760
free you are calling functions on Smart

444
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,960
contracts

445
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,039
and if you want to give your lft to

446
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:41,640
someone else you have to call the smart

447
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,340
contract and you have to call a function

448
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,260
on that smart contract which created

449
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,260
that nft right

450
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,100
um

451
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,580
so whenever someone wants to steal your

452
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:57,980
nfts they will ask you to

453
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:01,679
send a function call to a known trusted

454
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,320
smart contract and I find it a bit

455
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,080
confusing that someone is coming you but

456
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,480
still you are interacting with a known

457
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,600
legitimate smart contract this can be

458
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,280
actually pretty bad for example let's

459
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,100
say you are only into the Doodles and

460
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,360
FTS you have whitelisted

461
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:25,559
the smart contract for the Doodles nfts

462
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:28,020
and then you want to meet some new

463
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:31,200
Doodles nfts and when you click on mint

464
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,780
you will see hey I mean interacting with

465
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:37,020
this trusted smart contract right so

466
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,360
what could possibly go wrong what could

467
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,580
possibly go wrong that you are calling

468
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:45,360
the safe transfer from function and not

469
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,700
the mean function which means that you

470
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,280
are giving away all your precious nfts

471
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,940
so at the moment most of the wallet

472
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,340
software they have this pretty bad UI

473
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,340
that it is very hard to decipher what is

474
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:02,340
going on and if you are in a hurry then

475
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,200
yeah bad luck you can lose all of your

476
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,260
nfts

477
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:10,140
so I dig more and uh

478
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:15,000
I found uh that this whole scam kit was

479
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,880
available on GitHub

480
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,520
and

481
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:24,059
I was checking some of these uh very

482
00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:25,760
vaguely

483
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,840
encoded contents

484
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,620
and I found that somebody is not just

485
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:35,039
giving away this scam kit on GitHub for

486
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,820
free but he is also selling it on a uh

487
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,940
on online platform

488
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:44,220
and here you can see all the reviews he

489
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,039
got from his Camp kit for example best

490
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,460
trainer one azuki in three days

491
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,780
so

492
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:55,020
uh seems like a lot of people started to

493
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,799
use this scam kit

494
00:23:57,799 --> 00:24:03,020
these are all the features it supports

495
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,679
so

496
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:08,100
I was digging around a bit more and I

497
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:11,700
found some heavily obfuscated content as

498
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,080
well this is the decrypted version of it

499
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,539
and what's interesting to see here is

500
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:21,360
that uh on the first row you can you can

501
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,620
see price

502
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,799
then it compares the price whether it is

503
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:29,220
more than 1.1 which is ether and then

504
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:32,340
there's this address which is uh a new

505
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,200
address

506
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,600
and practically what happens here that

507
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,480
this is a backdoor code in the nft scam

508
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,380
kit and the

509
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,419
scam kit it will uh

510
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:48,360
steal all the cheap nfts and it will

511
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,000
transfer all the cheap nfts to the

512
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,400
operator of the scam kit whoever

513
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,460
downloaded it from the internet but all

514
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,880
the precious or more valuable nfts they

515
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,120
will be transferred to the guy who

516
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,179
created originally the scam kit so I

517
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:08,280
found this very interesting and amazing

518
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,919
and I have found a lot of examples on

519
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:13,440
the blockchain that this is exactly what

520
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,159
happened that some nfts were transferred

521
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:19,559
to one address and the more precious

522
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,360
ones they were transferred to another

523
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,280
one

524
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:27,140
so I contacted this guy on Telegram

525
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:30,360
and I asked him what are the differences

526
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,720
between the free version on GitHub and

527
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,700
the paid version you can buy on Salix

528
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,559
and I also asked him about this

529
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,440
obfuscated code

530
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,179
but he practically

531
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:47,159
did not bite

532
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:50,760
so he didn't tell me that yeah the

533
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,760
obfuscated version is a backdoored one

534
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,940
he just tells me that the paid version

535
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,460
has some extra features included like

536
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,940
you can still

537
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,679
efirm as well with it

538
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:07,500
so yeah

539
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,360
I think this is how you make big money

540
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,860
because these scales

541
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:17,100
now let's see it in action

542
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,100
so let's uh we are on this campsite

543
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:24,678
let's connect our metamask account

544
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,200
and now the user wants to click on mint

545
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,360
nft

546
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,880
this signature it's not really important

547
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,640
we can forget about this one

548
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:39,659
and when I clicked on claim now this is

549
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:42,659
the default view of metamask what

550
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:46,080
happens here and if you really know your

551
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,600
stuff and you'll know what you are doing

552
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,220
you should be able to see that the safe

553
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,799
transfer from function is not what you

554
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,080
want to call if you want to meet a new

555
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,640
nft

556
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,100
but if you are not very familiar with

557
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,779
this you might think hey I'm getting

558
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:04,020
free nfts so let's go ahead

559
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:08,279
so we can also check the data part

560
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:10,380
foreign

561
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:14,220
of metamask and again

562
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:17,760
here use here it tells you that

563
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,120
this is a trusted smart contract you are

564
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,640
interacting with you can also see all

565
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,460
the debug

566
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:29,640
messages stuff like that but uh

567
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,340
unfortunately I was only able to record

568
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:36,539
this with a real nft in my

569
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:37,140
um

570
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:40,140
wallet so

571
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:40,919
um

572
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:43,200
I had to click reject because otherwise

573
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,900
I would give away my precious one dollar

574
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:49,980
nft and I did not want to do that

575
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,820
okay

576
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,980
um this course cam this is pretty wide

577
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:59,279
nowadays and uh this is not just about

578
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,100
uh fake accounts

579
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,679
um contacting you and telling you to do

580
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:06,539
this or that

581
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:10,260
but nowadays Discord servers are hacked

582
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,299
uh all the time

583
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:14,419
foreign

584
00:28:14,419 --> 00:28:16,440
for example

585
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,900
this is a list

586
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:22,559
created by nft herder where he listed

587
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:26,220
the 107 Discord servers which have been

588
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:29,220
compromised mostly most of them with

589
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,980
this bookmarklet technique

590
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:35,760
and after you can compromise official

591
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,860
Discord servers you can send

592
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:43,380
announcements in the public channels and

593
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,900
people will think hey this is a trusted

594
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,240
Source this is the official Discord

595
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,700
server for the nft project so whatever I

596
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,580
do on this website that's legit right so

597
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,039
yeah Discord security is very very bad

598
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:57,779
nowadays

599
00:28:57,779 --> 00:28:59,480
foreign

600
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:04,260
I really like this one about how hacking

601
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,900
happens in movies and what really

602
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,720
happens in the nft world because yes

603
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,940
this is what's happening most of the

604
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:15,799
time when it comes to scams

605
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,640
uh I only have like one minute left so I

606
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,100
won't discuss so much about Hardware

607
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:27,120
wallets but Hardware wallets are also a

608
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,840
target for attackers sometimes they can

609
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:34,140
change for example they open the

610
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:37,080
hardware wallet set it up they know

611
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:41,520
already the recovery seed phrase then

612
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,220
write it down and send it to you that

613
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,580
hey this is your

614
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:49,860
seed phrase use this one

615
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:52,880
and here's another example where someone

616
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:57,600
modified The Ledger Hardware itself

617
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,419
and it added an extra flash drive to it

618
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:05,760
and sent it to uh already on owners who

619
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,980
already had leisure

620
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,260
so these are the best practices you can

621
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,240
do don't trust random people or

622
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,299
celebrities or media always check the

623
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:16,880
source of the application or the

624
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,279
distributed app you are using don't send

625
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:23,340
fun someone you don't trust clearly

626
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:26,640
whenever was to share logins passwords

627
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,500
private key see phrases backup phrases

628
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,419
with you or asking for you to do that

629
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:32,159
look at them

630
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,380
um be extra careful whenever you

631
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,419
interact with both known and unknown

632
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:38,700
smart contracts uh you should probably

633
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,659
use a password manager and I bought 2fa

634
00:30:41,659 --> 00:30:44,399
if you have a lot to protect really use

635
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,500
Hardware wallets because sometimes it

636
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,320
can help you sometimes it can't

637
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:53,100
surely keep your PC model free

638
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,640
um you can also use code wallets I think

639
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,679
the take time don't rush that's the most

640
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:01,380
important advice I can tell you never

641
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,659
rush whenever signing transactions on

642
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:06,840
the blockchain and nowadays there are

643
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,899
even uh some security extensions you can

644
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:12,120
use like wallet guard or Sunrise nft

645
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,580
scan protector I have never tried them

646
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:17,039
but they looks legit

647
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:21,419
so this is the conclusion uh give them a

648
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:23,039
zero day and he will access for a day

649
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,600
but teach a man to fish and he will

650
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,120
access for life this is very true for

651
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,700
the nft word

652
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:32,520
I also have a white paper uh where I

653
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,100
discuss another like 30 different scan

654
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,799
types regarding the blockchain and the

655

00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,640
but I can tell to everyone who's in the

673
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,740
nft world which is already crazy enough

674
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:25,919
I don't know like there's no easy answer

675
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,140
to this unfortunately there there's no

676
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,179
best way to reach people who are

677
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:34,380
sometimes greedy sometimes stupid

678
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,360
I don't know there's no easy answer to

679
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,080
this

680
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,260
okay next question what is the best way

681
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,179
to prevent these scams by the community

682
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:44,159
or online platforms

683
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,880
I think as of today uh the wallet

684
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,380
software developers should improve a lot

685
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:54,720
like there is this term called clear

686
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,120
signing

687
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,620
what you have seen previously is called

688
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,720
Blind signing where you don't really

689
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,880
know what's going on and the clear

690
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,600
signing design should look like that hey

691
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:10,100
do you want to transfer this doodle nft

692
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:13,500
from your wallet to this unknown someone

693
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,140
are you interested in that if yes please

694
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,779
confirm that's that's a clear signing

695
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:23,640
but uh only very few wallet software are

696
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,679
supporting it some are already

697
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:28,679
supporting it for tokens like erc20

698
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:32,399
tokens but for nfts I don't think anyone

699
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,799
is there yet where they can really know

700
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,200
that this is going to happen

701
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,940
all right I think we have a minute for

702
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,279
the last question so do you think that

703
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,600
there's a need for the government's

704
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,340
Intervention when it comes to regulating

705
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,919
rep 3. if the government steps in

706
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:49,500
wouldn't it be counter-intuitive to what

707
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,960
web3 stands for

708
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,559
no

709
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:57,380
we really want uh crypto to be

710
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,279
cryptocurrencies and blockchain and web

711
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,559
free to be mainstream yes government

712
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:04,080
should step in uh unfortunately

713
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,899
governments are not very famous for

714
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:11,580
regulating stuff uh best ways so I think

715
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,440
in the beginning there will be some

716
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,679
crazy stupid regulations but I do hope

717
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:19,619
that in time we will get there when

718
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:22,679
everything everyone can be happy

719
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:25,199
all right thank you very much let's give

720
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,918
him a round of applause
