1
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,679
okay hello everyone I'm soya aoyama

2
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:12,420
which is the system integration

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,360
laboratory Limited

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,139
um

5
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:19,199
I can speak in I I cannot speak English

6
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,660
too so

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:27,320
I I like to read script

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,180
so

9
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,760
I'm a security researcher

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,120
a global Fleet disconnected a

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,100
distinguished engineer and aside of the

12
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,000
company founder and organizer at besides

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,460
Tokyo

14
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,879
I'll be working for Fujitsu more than 20

15
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,320
years

16
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,160
as software developer of windows

17
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,399
I developed in this drivers

18
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,260
we saw publication

19
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,479
Bluetooth profiles

20
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,939
and more

21
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:12,680
I've started security research in 2018

22
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,479
uh 15.

23
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,659
and I give a presentation at many

24
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:20,340
conferences

25
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,500
but this this is my first time at hack

26
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,159
in the Box

27
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,020
okay

28
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,320
today I'll give a presentation and title

29
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,439
they learn somewhere Protection full of

30
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,860
horse

31
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,299
um made today

32
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:51,380
2017. do you remember

33
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,220
yes it's the day of this Cyber attack by

34
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,020
Wanna Cry

35
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,740
Wanna Cry causes tremendous damage all

36
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,399
over the world

37
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,220
it splitted beyond the Europe and

38
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,360
according to one Theory

39
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,020
eventually affected about

40
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:20,340
230 thousand computers worldwide

41
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,459
in over

42
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:26,099
150 countries

43
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:31,260
and the total damage is estimated at 4

44
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,080
billion dollars

45
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,920
many of the trades attendee must have

46
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,180
had awful experience with Wanna Cry

47
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,780
right

48
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,040
Microsoft

49
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,040
foreign

50
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,360
Microsoft added this feature with the

51
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,660
Windows 10 fold creators update

52
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,920
released in 2017.

53
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:18,000
the future is called control for the

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,500
access

55
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,500
apps

56
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:28,080
from accessing file in real time

57
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,260
let's talk a look at the details

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,480
the basic basis of Windows rational

59
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,238
production is control for the access

60
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:47,780
which consists of protrated

61
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:52,080
which consists of protected folders and

62
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,459
other an absolute control for the access

63
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:00,239
in addition control for the access is

64
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,940
disabled by default

65
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,819
and administrator privilege

66
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:10,739
the uh required to enable it as well as

67
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:13,200
to disable it

68
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,620
making it impossible to change setting

69
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,720
easily

70
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,120
it would be problem

71
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,660
if attackers changes it without a

72
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,560
permission light

73
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:30,800
foreign

74
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,040
protection

75
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,960
and apps that you don't do not at all

76
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,380
cannot access this folder

77
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,060
you can add

78
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,400
for that you want to protect

79
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,600
note that the whole protected products

80
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,620
such as documents and pictures are

81
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,560
already included

82
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,900
even if you don't specify them

83
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,080
although an absolute control for the

84
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,919
axis are apps that can access protected

85
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,720
products

86
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,940
you can also add apps

87
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:31,740
it says apps determined by Microsoft ad

88
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,419
friendly are always allowed

89
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:40,979
but they are not displayed by the vote

90
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:42,360
in this way

91
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,780
Microsoft has implemented last summer

92
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,220
filtration for Windows but unfortunately

93
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,639
unfortunately it's full of horse and

94
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:57,120
many researchers are starting way to

95
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,080
bypass it

96
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,600
this is a technique to bypass control

97
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,780
for the access that use Ops or Lui

98
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:16,259
exploiting the inclusion of Ops apps in

99
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:19,400
the white list

100
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,880
this technique involves

101
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,520
writing the encrypted data from memory

102
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,380
to new file

103
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:35,759
and replacing the original file using a

104
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,720
rename core

105
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,520
this technique takes advantage of the

106
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,860
fact that security features are disabled

107
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:57,259
when Windows is started in safe mode

108
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,020
foreign

109
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:06,539
injection

110
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,380
in 2018 I was researching now some

111
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,300
reproduction

112
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:23,400
of course apps that are not include in

113
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,479
an absolute control for the access

114
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,660
cannot access protected further

115
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,460
however

116
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:36,479
I have found that while Explorer can

117
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,620
access protected folders

118
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,819
this means that

119
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:46,380
if I can somehow inject a malicious dll

120
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,680
into the file explorer

121
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,080
I can bypass the ransomware protection

122
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,319
by the way

123
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,460
do you know might attack

124
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:05,340
this is a globally accessible knowledge

125
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:09,660
base of advisory tactics and techniques

126
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:14,580
based on their World reservations

127
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:16,139
in it

128
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:19,319
component object model hijacking is

129
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:21,419
described

130
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:25,759
uh the technique to insert my chest code

131
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,360
in place of legitimate software

132
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,399
it's not since come object

133
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,458
managed in the registry

134
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:43,620
it's possible to hijack them by entering

135
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:48,080
the registry to refinance myself payload

136
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:54,440
instead of the legitimate com object

137
00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:00,240
All That Remain is is to find the Target

138
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,940
com object in the registry

139
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,920
uh and the context many hundreds in the

140
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,240
registry uh the means that appear when

141
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,000
you right click in File Explorer

142
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:30,380
among them I focus on this tuid

143
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,760
if you search this guid in the registry

144
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,660
it will appear under shares ID

145
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:48,140
so this guid is the shears ID that

146
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:52,100
identifies the com object

147
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,560
and

148
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,820
the default value for MP Roc server 32

149
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,720
is shell32.tl

150
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,880
if you change this measures dll

151
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,000
you can inject into

152
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
File Explorer

153
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,300
but you cannot change this value

154
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,760
directly

155
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:26,100
because this is my magic view of hkey

156
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,420
classes root

157
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,120
as

158
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,820
described in msdn

159
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:40,320
the emerged beautiful of HK classes root

160
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,940
show the magic value of H key local

161
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:50,480
machine and hkey current user

162
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:57,079
and if both values are available

163
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:02,220
I take precedence

164
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,800
for this series IDE HQ local machine has

165
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,399
a value

166
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,540
but it's Key current user does not even

167
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,660
have a key

168
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,440
therefore

169
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,500
adding a value to each Key current user

170
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,040
we change the value of the H key pluses

171
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,519
root

172
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,820
so

173
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,740
write a batch file

174
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:42,120
with a command to add the path of the

175
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,279
message Dal

176
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:48,899
to hkey current user

177
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:50,399
and

178
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,079
a command to restart File Explorer

179
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:56,420
when

180
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:00,420
discussed files Explorer to restart

181
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,519
it loads

182
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:06,060
that matches the URL

183
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:10,019
the Marshall's dealer is executed on the

184
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:12,660
file explorer process

185
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,980
and

186
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:19,079
those can encrypt protected files

187
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:23,880
this is completed POC

188
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,339
of course

189
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:33,779
at that time I reported the result of

190
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:36,660
This research to Microsoft

191
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:40,740
but they said it was not security

192
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,839
vulnerability

193
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:47,480
for the following reasons

194
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,899
predicated on the attacker having login

195
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:57,260
access to the Target account already

196
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:02,959
since you are only able to write to hkcu

197
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,860
you will not

198
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:09,560
be able to affect other users

199
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,959
there also does not appear to be an

200
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,779
escalation of privileges

201
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:21,200
and finally

202
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,620
it would appear the attacker would not

203
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,860
gain anything from this attack

204
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,920
huh

205
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:37,339
can get Ransom from this attack right

206
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:43,639
this is my past research

207
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,839
well

208
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:55,160
I found an interesting article in the 20

209
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,860
2021 forms

210
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:03,000
it's the article Windows 10 last mail

211
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,820
protection are effective against

212
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,820
lansomware

213
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:14,880
I was skeptical skeptical of that

214
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,220
article because

215
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,700
I thought my previous po she was still

216
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,959
buried

217
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:26,579
and could easily by encrypted

218
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:28,820
just to be sure

219
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:35,839
I I learned my POC on the latest windows

220
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,859
oops sorry

221
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,779
uh here is a video of the POC

222
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:04,800
I mentioned earlier running on Windows

223
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,399
11.

224
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,899
here the image of the echina is

225
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:17,779
preserved in the pictures folder

226
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:22,019
next open the National Protection

227
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:24,800
setting screen

228
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,440
and

229
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,300
enable control holder access

230
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,220
uh land batch file that have been

231
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,860
successfully included in the past

232
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,860
the program was blocked

233
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,500
and

234
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,800
ekina is safe

235
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,279
foreign

236
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,720
history

237
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,480
so that

238
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,420
the control products plotted the picture

239
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:28,819
folder from the file explorer

240
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,899
as you can see

241
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:36,000
my previous POC is no longer buried

242
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,060
Microsoft said my report is not

243
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,500
vulnerability

244
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:46,519
but they have a secretary fix it

245
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:51,440
I was so frusted that I look for other

246
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,060
horse in NASA mere protection

247
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:13,339
until now I focused on apps

248
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:20,659
but this time I focused on for that

249
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:24,299
well you take the property of the

250
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:26,160
picture for that

251
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,319
it say you can change

252
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,559
when you try to

253
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,140
change the folder location

254
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:42,299
you ask if you want to move the files

255
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:45,240
like this

256
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:50,640
a good idea that that idea for Microsoft

257
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,120
just popped into my head

258
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,480
if

259
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,700
I change the picture for the location

260
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,740
directly

261
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,620
in the registry

262
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:10,399
I suspect that no files are moved

263
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,200
if you check the control for the access

264
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,760
registry

265
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,240
you will find

266
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,960
adult applications and protected for

267
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,280
that and died

268
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,240
there seems to correspond to other an

269
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,520
absolute control for the access and

270
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,080
protected for that

271
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,780
however

272
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:47,600
both are empty inside

273
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:52,820
here documents and pictures

274
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,380
the default project for that it's in

275
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:02,480
another registry like this

276
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,600
and since they are under each Key

277
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,000
current user

278
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,360
of course you can change them

279
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,340
with user privileges

280
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:21,960
yes

281
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,640
um overview of the new POC

282
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,320
normally

283
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,140
control for the access protect the

284
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,940
picture for the

285
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:38,100
so that maisha's apps cannot access and

286
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,439
encrypt this image file

287
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,200
however

288
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,799
if a measures apps changes the location

289
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:52,020
of the picture folder

290
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,340
if

291
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:56,280
for the protected by control for the

292
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,100
access will change

293
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:05,840
but the files are not copy or moved

294
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:09,900
and since the folder before the change

295
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,559
is no longer protected

296
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:16,679
it should be possible to encrypt the

297
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:19,760
image files light

298
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,740
sorry

299
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:40,160
I actually tried

300
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:44,600
execute a new batch file

301
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,880
this time debut to the system after

302
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,360
change the user folder

303
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,799
this is because this system needs a

304
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:59,160
little bit to disconnect the change

305
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:03,140
uh changes user folder

306
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,520
so uh

307
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:12,740
Liberty tasks a long time

308
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,559
okay

309
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:34,620
unfortunately Microsoft could not

310
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:38,178
protect the echina

311
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:45,860
check the block history as before

312
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,740
there is nothing in the block history

313
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,140
yes

314
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:09,240
yes I auto hoaxed Microsoft again

315
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,280
of course

316
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,020
I reported

317
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:18,980
the lizards of the research to Microsoft

318
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:30,419
Microsoft also said

319
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:34,380
it's not security vulnerability

320
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:38,039
and what does uh

321
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:43,020
surprise just this one this this one

322
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:46,159
phrase this time

323
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,880
because control for the axis is defense

324
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,760
in depth security features

325
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,179
what

326
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,000
in fact

327
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,520
the

328
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,940
msrcs Microsoft security servicing uh

329
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,480
create and

330
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,140
criteria for Windows page had a section

331
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,600
called defense in depth security

332
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,320
features

333
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,299
and

334
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:22,980
says that

335
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:27,120
control for the access is not covered by

336
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,520
bounty

337
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,020
as such

338
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:35,460
we can't count on Microsoft about loss

339
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,940
of air protection

340
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:45,299
so I created a POC that looks even more

341
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:47,820
dangerous are dangerous

342
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:51,960
because I think many people need to know

343
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,820
about this Danger

344
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,020
again

345
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:05,039
I used the con component object model

346
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,299
hijacking method

347
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,220
to tell the truth

348
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:14,539
component object model hijacking can

349
00:24:14,539 --> 00:24:19,080
specify a network pass

350
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,820
this means

351
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:25,919
that there is no need to send a DF file

352
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,059
into the target

353
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,140
additionally

354
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:35,039
Wireless attack are possible if some

355
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,280
vulnerability can be used to directly

356
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:42,260
write the registry

357
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,140
thank you

358
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:50,539
I used the shibui 2018

359
00:24:50,539 --> 00:24:54,299
as one three three five uh command

360
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:59,400
injection variability in this POC

361
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,940
this is the availability about Apache

362
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,039
hika Saba

363
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,100
you can download python script from the

364
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,820
from here

365
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:17,820
and here is the modified python script

366
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:22,740
the let underlined part is the command

367
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:26,820
to be execute on Windows

368
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:31,740
create a user to access carry

369
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,320
connects to carry

370
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,279
add registry entry to load the deal on

371
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:39,659
Curry

372
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:44,960
and we start File Explorer

373
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,418
okay

374
00:25:57,179 --> 00:25:59,840
foreign

375
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:10,520
now let me show you

376
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,739
the echina is safe

377
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,940
open the last protection settings screen

378
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,980
foreign

379
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,980
access

380
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:03,980
here check the IP address

381
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:17,600
and use it to execute the tikasaba

382
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,000
from here the attacker is carried to

383
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,140
attack the target

384
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:45,260
the Motions dll is on Curry

385
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:57,500
are created a Samba user using pdb edit

386
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,600
and restart

387
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,360
Samba already complete

388
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:12,320
execute execute the python script

389
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,799
shown earlier

390
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,620
so

391
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:03,779
unfortunately Microsoft could not

392
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:07,320
protect the equinox

393
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,539
yes

394
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:14,900
I brilliantly encrypted files remotely

395
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,620
in summary

396
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:32,520
the registry of Hoarders like documents

397
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,179
pictures

398
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:38,880
current user

399
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:44,120
because user users are free to change

400
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,479
their location

401
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:52,020
the problem is the Microsoft included

402
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,320
this existing

403
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,600
register Registries in a protected

404
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,779
folder by default

405
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:02,399
Microsoft

406
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:06,360
so hybrid uses adds them instead of

407
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,379
including them

408
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:15,140
so how do we address

409
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:18,380
this problem

410
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:20,100
the first

411
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:23,940
is to add for that you want to protect

412
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,399
yourself

413
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,200
however

414
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:33,120
I do not recommend I recommended this

415
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,279
because

416
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,260
many researchers

417
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,659
have found hosts in La Familia

418
00:30:39,659 --> 00:30:43,380
protection and many more minutes are

419
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:48,200
more maybe found in the future

420
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,179
second

421
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:56,520
always broke a backup your important

422
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,059
data

423
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,500
naturally

424
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:05,039
the backup and

425
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,320
destination should be

426
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,860
other than PCS

427
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:17,299
media Nas crowd and Etc

428
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:21,539
it would be even better

429
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:26,640
uh if it's possible to

430
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,380
manage Generations

431
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:36,720
please don't ask which product is better

432
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:42,080
I don't know this specific product name

433
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:47,220
finally as you can see

434
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:50,000
this time

435
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:54,840
I could encrypt the user's data in a

436
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,159
very easy

437
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:00,919
and very ridiculous way

438
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,880
it was so easy method that you

439
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,960
probably thought you can could not you

440
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,539
could do it yourself

441
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:16,919
but please never create nothing here

442
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:20,659
using this method

443
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:28,679
okay my presentation is over but uh

444
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:31,440
uh time is

445
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,760
uh okay so

446
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:42,419
I show you uh another video

447
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,880
just

448
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,860
ah

449
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,179

450
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:11,039
well I submit for the cfp the organizer

451
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:14,899
asked me one question

452
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:21,559
what versions of Windows are affected

453
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,640
I checked it

454
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:27,360
again I checked it again uh

455
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,320
week ago

456
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,659
with Windows 11.

457
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:39,179
