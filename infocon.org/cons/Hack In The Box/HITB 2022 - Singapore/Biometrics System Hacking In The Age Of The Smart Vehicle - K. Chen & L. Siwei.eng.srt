1
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,840
hi guys thanks for attending our talk we

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,700
are going to talk about biometric system

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,880
hacking in the age of smart vehicle

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,539
so Huawei I'm Kevin 2600 and this is my

5
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:19,920
teammate Wesley

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,640
say hi

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,460
and we're secure researchers from stavi

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,800
lab we have researched and found many

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,560
interesting Miracle related bugs and

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,399
presented some of them at various uh

11
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,059
conference in the past few years

12
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:41,879
and if anyone wonder what car hackers

13
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:43,620
Labs looks like and here are some

14
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,000
pictures for you

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,879
um just like any other labs we got lots

16
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:49,860
interesting equipments and most

17
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,680
importantly we got actual cars to to

18
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,059
play with

19
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:56,640
okay so here are the contents for

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,579
today's talk we're going to talk about

21
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:01,620
biometric authentication and face

22
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,140
recognition spoofing and eventually

23
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,320
speaker recognitions should be for a

24
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,479
vehicle

25
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:11,580
and sort of cave Biometrics

26
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,960
Authentication

27
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,920
and now this is a definition of

28
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,080
multi-factor authentication basically

29
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,080
you will need two or more factors like

30
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,119
something you are something you have

31
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,340
something you know to achieve

32
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,720
Authentication

33
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,640
now

34
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,580
someone something you have so usually

35
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,939
this means our key fobs for the car and

36
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:38,759
the key fob is a very common device we

37
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,460
have for the vehicle and in the recent

38
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,040
time some car companies start to replace

39
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,280
the physical key fobs with the NFC card

40
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,040
or just a mobile phone for accessing our

41
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,640
car as you can see and the iPhone now

42
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,259
have a capability to unlock the BMW uh

43
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,960
straight away

44
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,180
now for example this is a key fob system

45
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,880
for Tesla in the beginning Tesla only

46
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,179
provided the NFC card and mobile apps to

47
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,120
access the vehicle later Tesla has

48
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,760
provided the physical key fobs but it's

49
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,420
still based on the ble and NFC

50
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,480
okay and something you know

51
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,379
interestingly some car company like Ford

52
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:27,239
provided a feature that we can unlock

53
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:30,180
car door with the PIN code so this is

54
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,160
something we need to remember and know

55
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,520
right

56
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:35,940
um

57
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,920
something you are

58
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,040
oh again some model of Ford not only use

59
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,860
PIN codes to unlock the car door it has

60
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,620
also provided a fingerprint reader that

61
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,860
means we can point our finger edits and

62
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,700
unlock the car

63
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,760
and some company use face ID for Access

64
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,819
or vehicle has become a new trend too as

65
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:02,340
you can see and this one

66
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,180
um is actually implements a face ID in a

67
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,459
b parallel

68
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:12,360
so we can unlock our car door with our

69
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,659
face

70
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,360
also the car companies like BMW and

71
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,879
Hunter prefer to use our human voice

72
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,920
prints and integrate with a smart

73
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,400
speaker to control cars so we can say

74
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,099
Alexa unlock our car in the future

75
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,000
uh now let's move on how do we do a

76
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,940
speaker recognition spoofing

77
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,280
so this is a definition of speaker

78
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,739
recognition a

79
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:48,019
is the identification of a person from

80
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:51,299
characteristics for the voice and it can

81
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:54,120
be used to authenticate or verify the

82
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,819
identity of a speaker as part of a

83
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,780
security process

84
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,980
um the development history of speaker

85
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,560
recognition can be traced back all the

86
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,379
way to our 60s so the speaker

87
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:10,080
recognition algorithm has start with the

88
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,599
template matching and then move on to

89
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:17,160
probability model like gnm GMM ubm and

90
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,500
the feature classification deep vectors

91
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,400
and X Vector in the so on

92
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,180
so the speaker recognition system

93
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,460
generally consists uh two categories

94
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,860
like feature extraction and a feature

95
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,580
matching so in reality extracted

96
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,639
features are matched with the feature of

97
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,139
people who register in the database and

98
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:46,620
the identity is determined

99
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,620
based on the similarity of the two

100
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,880
features

101
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,780
so for contents to be recognized the

102
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,759
speaker recognition system is generally

103
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:59,100
divided into three categories

104
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,340
the first one is the fixed vocabulary

105
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,740
recognition it means voice print

106
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,919
recognition through fixed vocabulary

107
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,560
such as hey Siri and second

108
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,960
is a fixed Voice Plus random contents

109
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,960
our recognition it means fixed and

110
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,479
random contents combined together such

111
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:25,919
as hey Bob to 600 and then the 2600 is

112
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,120
generally by the system itself

113
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,580
and finally the random content

114
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:36,300
recognition that means an entire phrase

115
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,580
is generated randomly by the system

116
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:44,280
so as you can see the speaker

117
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,199
recognition system are already

118
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:49,500
everywhere from access control system to

119
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,300
the voice assistant in a car

120
00:05:55,979 --> 00:06:01,199
but what could possibly go around them

121
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,100
here we listed some of the most common

122
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,660
Roofing methods for speaker recognition

123
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:13,500
the used one or is coded a impersonation

124
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,940
attack

125
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,180
your title has to impersonate the

126
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,100
backdrops

127
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,979
speaking turn

128
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:26,759
to receive the target system but this

129
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:31,080
attack can be easily detected by the

130
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,880
speaker recognition system and there are

131
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,580
more effective and

132
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:42,240
otherwise the attacks called the replay

133
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,400
attack speaker sentences wise

134
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,240
conversion and other serial example

135
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,919
attack we are going to talk about those

136
00:06:54,919 --> 00:07:00,258
attacks in more detail later

137
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,160
now let's take a look at the replay tag

138
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:10,259
SS mini MD either the system of fixed

139
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:14,160
sentence verification we can use the

140
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,479
recording device to record the fixed the

141
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:24,539
sentence of the victims and replay the

142
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:27,139
recording the sentence during

143
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:31,220
verification to receive the speaker

144
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,139
vaccination system

145
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:40,319
as we can see from a male spectrogram uh

146
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,319
the same similarity

147
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:47,940
from afraid twice compared to

148
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:52,319
genuine wise and high that is what the

149
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,699
replay attack is very simple yet very

150
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:00,479
effective attack however

151
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:05,180
a simple method may not pass the speaker

152
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:08,580
authentication system with the YC

153
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,580
anti-spoofing

154
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:17,280
now let's uh now let's see some demos

155
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,020
there are already plenty of third party

156
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:26,400
apps can control Smart cars like Tesla

157
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,080
during theory that is the video demo for

158
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,399
the replay attack on Siri and because

159
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:40,380
someone asking like unlock the door

160
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,979
uh neither an acid authentication like

161
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:46,620
pin code for this act

162
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:52,220
Rica only opened the chat code with it

163
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,399
hey Siri

164
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,640
foreign

165
00:09:28,339 --> 00:09:31,820
very easily

166
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,800
hey Siri

167
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,939
hi Siri

168
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,140
yes well

169
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,160
now let's take a look either a speech

170
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,300
sentences text to speech are greater

171
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:20,700
let's take Google as way to TTS as a

172
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:26,220
example the entire speech sentences can

173
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,180

174
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:34,019

00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:36,380
responsible for

176
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,920
extracting

177
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,480
speaker features from short sentence

178
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,000
the

179
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,019
synthesizer module is responsible for

180
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:52,100
combining the speaker feature with text

181
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:57,600
to generate a male spectral graph

182
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,579
rather in a grade

183
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:08,060
speaker features into the speech

184
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:14,060
corresponding to a Smart surface text

185
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:19,380
uh the recorder major is responsible for

186
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,540
generating voice

187
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:27,120

188
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,899
is the audio data

is it

232
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:27,320
we first play a genuine recording

vitamins Power Attack is success

240
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,119
so let's

241
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,599
summarize our smoothie methods for

242
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:22,980
speaker recognition as we can see the

243
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:28,199
fixed vocabulary is the easiest one to

244
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:29,520
attack

245
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,260
a simple replay will work just fine and

246
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:39,120
for the render contents we still can't

247
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,980
use speech sentences or lower

248
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:47,480
adversarial example to attack

249
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,780
okay so

250
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,640
um so now it's time to move on the

251
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,460
facial recognition spoof

252
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,799
and the facial recognitions

253
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,440
um is a technology capable to much in a

254
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,120
human face from a digital image or with

255
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,980
your friend against the database or

256
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,039
physics usually it can be to use a

257
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,200
Syndicate user through ID or

258
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,140
verification servers

259
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,720
and the facial recognition technology is

260
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,020
constantly evolving it was based on a

261
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,299
low Dimension characterization and

262
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:27,360
nowadays it yes involved the three

263
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,799
dimension phase recognition

264
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,179
and there are already many application

265
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:36,240
implemented uh the face recognition so

266
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,640
for example the face ID for unlock our

267
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,160
mobile phone and brought in the plan in

268
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,900
airport

269
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,600
uh now recently the car company has

270
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,100
started to use face recognition

271
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,740
technology for driver monitor system

272
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,500
and also use the face ID for driver

273
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,080
profile to improve the Driving

274
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,080
Experience

275
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,080
and of course use the human face to

276
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,480
authenticate the owner of a vehicle is

277
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,600
actually become indeed a very convenient

278
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,480
way and becoming trend

279
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,600
and here are the four stages of the face

280
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,600
vacation procedure so first

281
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,360
is the face detection so the system

282
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,120
needs to know if there's a human face or

283
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,360
a cat face right and second is a life

284
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,179
needs detection AKA face anti-spoofing

285
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:29,360
at this stage

286
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,000
it actually play very important role are

287
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,820
in the face or recognition procedure

288
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,280
and third and fourth is the feature

289
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,980
extraction and feature matching at least

290
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,200
stage the system will try to match the

291
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,320
face features from the database

292
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,580
okay

293
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,980
and let's take close look at a face

294
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,720
recognition procedure but this time

295
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,720
let's result on this space on key face

296
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,200
smoothing so first the input data is the

297
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,200
image the system needs to determine

298
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,260
whether it's a human face or not right

299
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,080
once the system spot the human face it

300
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,140
will try to extract the feature of this

301
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:13,559
human face and at least final step the

302
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:16,140
system will match the phase features and

303
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:19,980
to see if it's actually in the database

304
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,340
okay now let's talk about more about a

305
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,559
face on this proofing as we just

306
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:27,299
mentioned this is a very important stage

307
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:30,000
okay uh usually we need to do some

308
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,260
action like uh like open mouse or Shake

309
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,440
our head for Satan to see whether the

310
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,840
human face present is real human being

311
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,419
or just a piece of paper

312
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:44,400
um in addition the system can also do a

313
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,460
silent face on this spoofing which no

314
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,280
human action required uh it would

315
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,960
determine based on the things like a

316
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,820
human skin texture and different

317
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,600
frequency of moving and so on right

318
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,179
so and this is sort of face recognition

319
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:03,059
structure from the diagram uh we can see

320
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:05,220
there are many

321
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:08,820
um our many uh entry point to attack so

322
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,160
for example later in the talk we are

323
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,860
going to share more real life cases such

324
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:18,720
as trash threshold value and the feature

325
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,140
value attack

326
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,960
um so what could possibly go wrong

327
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,660
so here we have listed uh six most

328
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,580
common methods to spoof the face

329
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,740
recognition system for example the photo

330
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,200
attack and the more advanced attack like

331
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,020
adverse serial example attack and we're

332
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,940
going to talk about more of this

333
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:42,659
um at least attack in the details next

334
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:46,320
so right face photo attack as we can see

335
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,320
we can actually print the victim's photo

336
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,440
on piece of paper and you see it's very

337
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,320
easy to to do and even kids can do it

338
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,880
right you can see they are very happy

339
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,120
when it was the attack is success

340
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,000
and now listen to what we call a Mr

341
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,520
orange attack basically we draw a human

342
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,679
face on an orange

343
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,419
um in order to test the target system

344
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:12,539
phase detection function

345
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,940
and as we should mentioned the human

346
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,039
face detection is the first stage of

347
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,559
every face recognition system simply

348
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:23,340
draw a human face on a on an orange will

349
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,559
easily spoof the face recognition system

350
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:28,260
at its stage so when system does not

351
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,940
have a good phase anti-spoofing

352
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,760
mechanism and you will the trick will

353
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,200
work

354
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,440
so our first Target is a Smart Lock from

355
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,500
xiaomi as we can see from the way the

356
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,320
recording let's let me just play with

357
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,700
the images okay

358
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,740
yeah as you can see

359
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:53,520
um the system not only detecting this is

360
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,520
a human but also even think this is a 24

361
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,200
years old man

362
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,280
right

363
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,620
so we also test the xiaomi lock with the

364
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:04,100
face photo attack and and also

365
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:07,020
adversarial example attack

366
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,840
or as we can see every tricks actually

367
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,780
work on the picture from the left is the

368
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:15,240
real human victim and xiaomi lock has

369
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,460
detected this correctly which is fine

370
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:20,760
but and then when we present a piece of

371
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,220
paper with a photo on it it also work

372
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:27,659
and and also the adversarial sample mask

373
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:31,080
works so yeah the xiaomi locks is now

374
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,539
very good for this

375
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:36,000
now but this type attack can be

376
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,640
prevented because

377
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,620
more advanced camera system you will

378
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,260
come with infrared camera

379
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,480
and this is what it looks like from

380
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,820
official recognition system point of

381
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,559
view as we can see if we actually

382
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:52,559
present a human face photo or video on a

383
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,679
mobile to the infrared camera you can

384
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,740
see this is um on a mobile if we play a

385
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,760
video

386
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,159
um it's actually it's nothing at all

387
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:03,960
right

388
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,240
so usually we need to do some action

389
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,140
like open our Mouse and shake head hit

390
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,840
um so for a system to determine if it's

391
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,600
a pure real human being

392
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,059
um but what we can do is to actually cut

393
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:20,700
a hole in the eyes area or a mouse area

394
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,159
to bypass that detection

395
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:25,799
and we even can buy a customizing face

396
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:27,360
sculpture

397
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,400
um from but to in order to bypass this

398
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,919
system which lacks detection for human

399
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,159
skin skin texture

400
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:39,900
so let me uh play uh uh the radio let's

401
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,200
see

402
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:46,030
um

403
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:48,360
[Music]

404
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,820
so

405
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:53,039
so yeah I would go into where uh funny

406
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,039
sculpture

407
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,299
right a little bit uh scary right oh

408
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:05,640
yeah but this this tackle actually we

409
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,820
tested on a Huawei P30 Pro

410
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,020
see

411
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,940
as you can see we actually logging

412
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:15,179
straight away very quick no problem

413
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:18,600
right okay

414
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:25,620
as we mentioned

415
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:30,059
the principle of adversarial example

416
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:35,659
attack is a attacker and intentionally

417
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:40,520
designed to Kaza Monsoon learning model

418
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,440
to make a mistake

419
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,539
as we can see

420
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:50,960
when we added a small motivation to the

421
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,159
panda picture

422
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:56,460
the machine learning model will have

423
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:59,460
99.3

424
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,760
percent confidence

425
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:08,760
to think it is a given uh inside inside

426
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,080
and

427
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,620
this is a class class

428
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:16,879
adversarial for example okay

429
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,279
and the base law

430
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:21,779
various

431
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:24,720
characteristics

432
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,640
at Rosario examples can be divided into

433
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:35,279
three different attack methods such as

434
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,700
with or without the package

435
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:44,220
what books or black box type under one

436
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,159
step or multi

437
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:50,240
slab effect

438
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,200
we mainly

439
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,400
use the black box and Rosario example

440
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,880
attack method for testing

441
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,380
the transferability of adversarial

442
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:10,440
examples is

443
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:15,179
currently either by John 20 of multiple

444
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:19,880
models the normal model training process

445
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,940
as to try the

446
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,779
parameters

447
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:31,380
of the model are a fixed data site

448
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,380
the adversarial

449
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:38,520
uh simple and training the simple under

450
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,640
the condition of fixed

451
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,039
uh

452
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,900
parameters which

453
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,360
continuously

454
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:52,500
made the output of the model close to

455
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,120
our

456
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,120
expectations

457
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:04,260
automation area selection has a big

458
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:09,600
impact on the attack result we can add

459
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,600
it Automation in different

460
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:17,279
barrier on the face but better on

461
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:22,980
research article from qingwa University

462
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:26,700
the population area within the ice

463
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:31,760
element knows as as

464
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,480
success rate

465
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:41,240
so once we meet

466
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:45,440
at present to some analysis ID of the

467
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,919
protesting one interesting fact is even

468
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,179
be your same mask because the front face

469
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:57,480
skin and shifts are different

470
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,919
one person may have more success with

471
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,200
the adults

472
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,980
as left picture choose only some history

473
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,960
person

474
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,880
similarity

475
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,880
under the picture on the right

476
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,880
percent

477
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:25,039
okay this is a video demo for the

478
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,320
adversarial example attack on Huawei P30

479
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,658
Pro face ID login system

480
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,720
so

481
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:42,380
yeah it works for a real person

482
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:48,440
and then we

483
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,659
we saw the mask we cannot log in

484
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:54,480
successfully

485
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,940
so we're now we're at your mask

486
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:03,080
ah it works

487
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:07,380
right it's very very effective

488
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:10,399
and this is a video demo for for

489
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:13,020
adversarial example attack on wema

490
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:16,080
vehicle face ID system

491
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,340
oops sorry

492
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,440
so you can see it doesn't work very

493
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,640
first time

494
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,500
but then we'll try again

495
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,820
um with mask on

496
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:40,100
let's try again

497
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:45,200
it works

498
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,320
and this is another video demo

499
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,679
the the target is a car which we cannot

500
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:55,140
disclose the name but this car actually

501
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,539
allowed us to turn on the engine and dry

502
00:30:57,539 --> 00:31:02,360
off but if we bypass the face ID system

503
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:03,960
so

504
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,940
um all we can do is the same same thing

505
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,940
we will modify the

506
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:12,539
mask and present tuner to the camera

507
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:15,899
and eventually we are able to log in

508
00:31:15,899 --> 00:31:17,820
successfully here which means we're able

509
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,279
to turn on the engine and try off the

510
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:21,480
car

511
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,080
so yeah

512
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:29,460
now uh we have a clear idea of a

513
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:32,520
principle of the adversarial attack if

514
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,740
we can add a small perturbation to cast

515
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,240
The Machine learning model to actually

516
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,760
make a mistake and during the research

517
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,860
we have found by putting the target face

518
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,200
match on attacker's face

519
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,179
um it can cover Attack Phase partially

520
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:48,539
uh we can deceive some face recognition

521
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:51,539
system with a higher successful rate and

522
00:31:51,539 --> 00:31:53,279
this this is actually a common

523
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,919
limitation for the 2D face recognition

524
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,380
system

525
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:01,020
and so this is a video demo for the

526
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,980
feature replace attack

527
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,100
as you can see we start wearing Azure

528
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,440
face mask and we're not able to log in

529
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:15,440
uh to the xiaomi note 9.

530
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:16,740
but

531
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:20,720
let me try again with the mask on

532
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:26,120
straight away

533
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,340
yeah it works

534
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:32,520
and this is uh not just for xiaomi we

535
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:36,320
also test uh um like OnePlus and other

536
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,659
uh model of the mobile phone it also

537
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:41,460
works

538
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,700
so well of course if when system said

539
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,760
Lulu very secure unlike very high

540
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,520
threshold value we won't able to bypass

541
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,820
easily and this is a face ID system for

542
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:56,340
a banking system which we were actually

543
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:59,460
fail to get in uh but I think it's good

544
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:02,059
for them right and then for us as well

545
00:33:02,059 --> 00:33:06,179
so the threshold value and this is a car

546
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:08,880
with where pen tested before but again

547
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,700
we cannot discuss the name yet but the

548
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,399
most important thing is uh this car is

549
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:17,640
like a uh a lot of other smart cars like

550
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:21,419
it has Android based uh ivi system so

551
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:23,700
which we are able to get in to the

552
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,399
engineer mode once we are into the

553
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,799
engineer mode we we're we were able to

554
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,700
enable ADB connection from there

555
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,720
so once we cut a DB cell we actually a

556
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,539
root three away so what would you do

557
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:43,519
when you get a routine ioi right maybe

558
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,760
let's see

559
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,440
yeah replace the new screen feature

560
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,419
right

561
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:54,480
so and this car also got a face ID

562
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,840
function however the anti-face Smoothie

563
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,200
is is very good so we cannot spoof it

564
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,820
with the trick we were just mentioned

565
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:05,159
above but we are root an assistant

566
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:06,539
remember

567
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:08,219
um turns out the threshold value

568
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:10,918
configure configuration file is actually

569
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:15,060
stored locally on ivi so we can actually

570
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:18,599
modify it to a very low value to bypass

571
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:20,359
it

572
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:23,820
and here is the video demo for the

573
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,659
attack

574
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:26,460
so let's see

575
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:29,639
on first we saw the model modify the

576
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,199
threshold value

577
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,239
um you can see you you won't work we're

578
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,639
not able to log in

579
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:39,619
so again and still failed right so

580
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:43,679
and let's do some magic

581
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,520
uh the magic is to actually rectangular

582
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,980
uh threshold value into very low like

583
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,780
point zero or something

584
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:54,300
right

585
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,420
so and in order for this trick work we

586
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,880
need also once we configure a file we

587
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,880
need to save it and reboot the ivi so

588
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,859
that's what we're doing right now

589
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:08,160
so once the system uh rebooted

590
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,319
um we can try again see if we can get in

591
00:35:17,339 --> 00:35:21,560
so yeah now let's try again

592
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:24,960
yeah without doubt which you're able to

593
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,500
log in on

594
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,480
you can see the season is kind of like

595
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,280
fighting fighting and then yeah we are

596
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,300
in cool

597
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,119
um similarly the license office ID

598
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,220
system we have come across before during

599
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:44,760
during another 10 test Ops now and this

600
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,520
system has two human face features uh

601
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,980
stored in the database and once we got

602
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,900
root in the system we can actually

603
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,540
replace one feature for our own and the

604
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,119
system will only verify like only one of

605
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,099
them for login in order to log into

606
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:01,140
successfully meaning where now can

607
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,720
logging as victims and victim still able

608
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,540
to login as itself so nobody even will

609
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,140
know that we will learn

610
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:13,200
so now extra function attack now this is

611
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,940
an interesting

612
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:18,060
um imagine what if we cannot get a cell

613
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,579
on a Target and the rules for office ID

614
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:23,040
is so tight and are we out of option yet

615
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,359
let's take a look

616
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:37,200
yeah see a simple RF replay attack will

617
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,800
also work because the the access control

618
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,660
system usually have multiple features

619
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:45,119
enabled and turns out this one our

620
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,880
target has also opened can be opened by

621
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,720
a fixed code radio remote controller

622
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,820
um just like people said it's not a bug

623
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:56,400
it's a feature

624
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,520
so okay so let's do a samurai for some

625
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,800
tech news has just seen so far for the

626
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,619
face detection it can Smooth by Mr

627
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:07,320
orange attack face photo attack and face

628
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,900
uh sculpture attack

629
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,960
and for the face anti-spothing on a

630
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,060
feature replace tag and the adversarial

631
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,400
example attack will work and for the

632
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,260
future matching future value attack

633
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,540
stretch coaching feature value attacks

634
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,760
threshold value attack it's a trick we

635
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,400
can always try and in the end let's not

636
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,099
forget extra function attack

637
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:32,760
okay here are some references on if any

638
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,380
for anyone who would like to know more

639
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:37,020
uh you can always use to check it out as

640
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,339
you can see we need to do a lot of

641
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:41,820
readings right research follow for this

642
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,200
area

643
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,680
okay let's see thank you

644
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,460
bye
