1
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:08,818
foreign

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,660
first of all I want to say thank you to

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,880
Dylan and the organizers and the

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,560
Fantastic Team in the back here for

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,600
helping me get everything set up this

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,820
morning turns out presenting from an

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,140
iPad is not just straightforward but

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,580
it's working

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,400
um as Dylan mentioned I have a keynoted

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,220
hack in the Box twice in Amsterdam and I

11
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,579
think both times I talked about

12
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:37,620
security for newsrooms and for recorders

13
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,780
and I am going to touch on some of that

14
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,960
today but I also wanted to take a look

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,059
at some of the security research I have

16
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:48,360
done in the past some of which you may

17
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,600
or may not know about and sort of look a

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,100
bit at

19
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,199
just the lessons that have that I've

20
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,239
learned along the way and sort of key

21
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:00,840
themes from that so

22
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,539
let's see if this works

23
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,040
um so if you don't know

24
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,820
um who I am I am originally from Oslo I

25
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,960
now live in New York and have lived

26
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,900
let's see I moved out of Norway 12 years

27
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,240
ago so it's been a while I'm very

28
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,979
passionate about journalism and security

29
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,159
I'll talk a bit more about that later

30
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,299
previously worked with the tour project

31
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:26,460
freedom of the press foundation and the

32
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,799
New York Times

33
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:31,439
currently the founder of granite also an

34
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,680
advisor to Ford foundation and cesa the

35
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,540
cyber security infrastructure Security

36
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,159
Agency in the US

37
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,720
one of the projects that I also kicked

38
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,119
out during the pandemic is journalism

39
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,180
spy on Instagram so it's an account that

40
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,840
profiles spies that used journalism as a

41
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,740
cover

42
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,380
or journalists that were also a spice so

43
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,299
it has me doing a lot of interesting

44
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:59,119
research there's a lot of like obscure

45
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,740
names that keep popping up a lot of

46
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,140
interesting books that I now have on my

47
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,180
bookshelf and in my sort of pile of

48
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,280
books I've been meaning to read that I'm

49
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,500
not sure I'll actually get to

50
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,459
um another thing that happened during

51
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,800
the pandemic is I got a very cute cat

52
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,200
named pumpkin

53
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,720
so um oh and as uh Dylan mentioned this

54
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,060
is my first time in Singapore so if you

55
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,340
have any recommendations for food

56
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,739
especially or good coffee or cafes or

57
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:27,180
anything like that I would I would love

58
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,760
to hear about it

59
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,840
so

60
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,980
with that

61
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,220
um I figured I would start with a story

62
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:38,340
uh going back to 1995

63
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,580
at the Office of Naval Research in the

64
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,200
US so

65
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,540
militaries around the world and

66
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,280
typically do have like a research lab

67
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,660
trying to come up with like different

68
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,120
ways in which to keep people safe

69
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,360
different ways in which to advance

70
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,379
either technology or weapons or anything

71
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,900
else that they have right that's not a

72
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,019
surprise so back in 95 Office of Naval

73
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:06,300
Research in the US

74
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,459
had this one goal

75
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:11,220
of building a system for internet-based

76
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,140
connections that can resist traffic

77
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,099
analysis eavesdropping and other attacks

78
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:18,780
and I think it's it's important to

79
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,340
remember that this was 1995 so before

80
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,319
end-to-end encryption became commonplace

81
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,060
before that sort of became the default

82
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,459
in a lot of different products

83
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,920
now after a lot of back and forth the

84
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,379
system that they came up with which may

85
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:37,440
look familiar to you

86
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,959
can be simplified like this

87
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,879
you have

88
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:45,659
um two individuals Alice and Bob and

89
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:48,480
between them they have three different

90
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,700
nodes to which they send their traffic

91
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,140
through

92
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,080
this is now also referred to as onion

93
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,480
routing which I'll mention in a second

94
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,879
later became known as tour so the way

95
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:03,299
that this works is

96
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:06,239
Bob over here will take whatever data he

97
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,340
wishes to transfer to Ellis and wrap it

98
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,400
in three layers and send that off to

99
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,260
three layers of encryption and send that

100
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,599
off to the first node the first known

101
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,180
will just know that here's a packet that

102
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,380
came from Bob

103
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,019
we'll peel off that first layer and see

104
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,180
that this packet needs to be routed to

105
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,759
the middle layer the metal layer will

106
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:29,280
then receive this package

107
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,720
see that it came from that first node

108
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,639
know that it needs to pass it off to the

109
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:38,639
third node but will not know that it

110
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,139
came from Bob or that it's going to

111
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:41,759
Alice

112
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,620
third node there will receive that

113
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,600
packet peel off that third and final

114
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,000
layer we'll know that it came from the

115
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,380
middle node and we'll know it as going

116
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,660
to Alice but will not know that it came

117
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,180
from Bob or exactly what it contains so

118
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,460
in the system that they then developed

119
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,300
um

120
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,240
the sort of early early prototype 4 they

121
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,759
were actually managed they then managed

122
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,600
to create the system to resist traffic

123
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,720
analysis eavesdropping and other attacks

124
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,380
so 1995 they successfully came up with

125
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,520
this model

126
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,740
um which then called onion writing what

127
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,039
they then later realized is

128
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:23,759
um

129
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,500
that

130
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,940
yes in this model in this context

131
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,759
um any outside party that can observe

132
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:34,979
the communications going between Alice

133
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:37,440
and Bob will not be able to see exactly

134
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,699
what it is that they're communicating

135
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:40,979
about because all of that information is

136
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:43,199
encrypted

137
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,139
but if they can see that Bob is using

138
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:48,180
the system and that Alice is using the

139
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,160
system and they know that this is the

140
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,919
system that is developed by

141
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:56,039
the Naval Research office and that this

142
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:57,600
is the system that is only ever used by

143
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,520
the US Military

144
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,639
you're not necessarily as secure or as

145
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,160
anonymous because granted anyone

146
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,020
observing the traffic cannot see exactly

147
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,220
what it is that they're communicating

148
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,900
about but they will know who's actually

149
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,600
using the system

150
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,000
so

151
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,220
in 2004

152
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,440
um Roger Nick and Paul then presented

153
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,840
tour the second generation onion router

154
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,960
at a conference and released sort of

155
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,440
this initial foundational paper on tour

156
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,740
and the concept of onion writing so that

157
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,660
was back when

158
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,440
um

159
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,319
the U.S naval research lab effectively

160
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,199
decided to take this system that had

161
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,880
served the goals that they set out to

162
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,400
achieve back in 1995 that was working

163
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,560
pretty well but they like I said found

164
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,800
that if you can see who's using the

165
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,539
system and you know that it's only

166
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,000
available to the U.S military you could

167
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,520
actually do a lot better for yourself

168
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,280
they then decided to open source

169
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,039
um tour open source the code make it

170
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,979
available to anyone everywhere

171
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:10,380
around the planet and it's actually

172
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,780
pretty interesting paper to go reads if

173
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,580
you haven't looked at it

174
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,860
um at any point in time I think it would

175
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,960
be a pretty interesting

176
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,199
thing to dig into so now

177
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,360
why am I telling

178
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,460
the story

179
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,080
so when I was sort of thinking about

180
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,220
like

181
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,380
the work that I do today and the

182
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,120
research that I've done over the years

183
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,620
and

184
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,479
especially thinking about what Chris

185
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,340
mentioned yesterday in his keynote about

186
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,340
curiosity and puzzles

187
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,800
um for me it really all comes back to

188
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,080
Google summer of code in 2009 and tour

189
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,880
so first I just want to say that Google

190
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,759
summer code is still a thing so if

191
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,380
you're a student you should definitely

192
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,860
apply to that next year it's a program

193
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,740
that's is set up by Google that's been

194
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,680
running for over a decade at this point

195
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,039
where Google will accept

196
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:10,740
um open source projects as part of this

197
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,680
Google summer of code program where uh

198
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,599
students will then effectively be paid

199
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,520
by Google over the summer to work on

200
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,500
projects for

201
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,539
for example tour so that's what I did

202
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:24,960
back in 2009 and when I first

203
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,080
when I first found tour or rather I

204
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,000
found Google summer of a code and I sort

205
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,560
of knew that this was a thing and I was

206
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,399
looking for a summer job and I was sort

207
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:36,899
of scrolling through the list of

208
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:38,940
projects on the Google summer code

209
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,640
website trying to figure out like what

210
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,320
are all the options what looks

211
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,540
interesting and I found this thing

212
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,860
called torque

213
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,380
and for me I became really curious right

214
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:52,320
away thinking like it is really cool

215
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,899
that you can use lines of code

216
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:58,080
and Technology to be anonymous online

217
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,360
that was sort of my starting point I did

218
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,660
not consider exactly the sort of impact

219
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,820
that tour has in the world I didn't

220
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,700
consider the many different ways in

221
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,100
which people use it I didn't consider

222
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,580
the upsides or the downsides or what it

223
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,580
what it meant to people for me initially

224
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,100
that that hook was just

225
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,800
it is really really cool that you can be

226
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,140
anonymous online using using this type

227
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,100
of tool

228
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,519
so it's been interesting then to see

229
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,500
over the years

230
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,560
how different ways of using Torah sort

231
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,700
of really

232
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,180
increased and and change going from that

233
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,240
very initial here's this thing here's

234
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,519
this browser or here's this program that

235
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,620
you can use to be anonymous online to

236
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,580
yes that is still very much a part of it

237
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,320
I think over the years we've also

238
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,480
started talking about using Tor to

239
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,680
access censored sites or to access

240
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,540
rather to bypass censorship in different

241
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,420
countries or on different networks I

242
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,860
think the bottom three points on this

243
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,000
slide is pretty interesting because

244
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,860
that's sort of how tour has developed

245
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,420
over the years

246
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,820
um there's the use cases of tour have

247
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,760
developed over the years so Michael Lee

248
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,000
who I think was yet the eff for many

249
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,060
years and is now at The Intercept

250
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,500
developed this tool called onion share

251
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,980
which allows people to securely share

252
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:30,360
files using a tour in a fairly like

253
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,540
um drag and drop kind of way and so it

254
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,459
sort of made file sharing in a quick and

255
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:38,220
secure way really really easy

256
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,440
um secure drop is now a tool that's

257
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,540
maintained and developed by freedom of

258
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,540
the press Foundation that allows media

259
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:49,560
organizations to set up the system for

260
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,320
receiving tips from the public that are

261
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,940
Anonymous and that whole system will

262
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,300
leverage the tour Network to allow

263
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,339
people to be anonymous if they if they

264
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:00,899
want to

265
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:03,540
um when I was at the New York Times

266
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,720
um starting in like 2016 towards the end

267
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,380
of 2016. we then set up the tips site

268
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,740
for the New York Times so on

269
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,200
androidtimes.com tips you can then see

270
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,000
different ways in which you can securely

271
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,700
or in some cases anonymously send tips

272
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,180
to The Newsroom and that includes

273
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:27,600
um sticker drop before that

274
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,720
time if you as a source wanted to send

275
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,700
something to the New York Times you had

276
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,760
to rather to a reporter you had to First

277
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,620
figure out

278
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,200
who you want to send it to she sort of

279
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,640
had to do some research on the reporter

280
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,860
that you wanted to reach out to

281
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,500
you had to figure out how do you how do

282
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,820
you even get in touch with that person

283
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,560
like maybe their email address is

284
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,100
available online maybe you can DM them

285
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,620
on Twitter maybe you just have to like

286
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,839
call the Main New York Times phone

287
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,180
number and ask to talk to this reporter

288
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,800
and and hope that they actually take

289
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,839
your call and even when you figure out

290
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,579
how to contact them you had to sort of

291
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:08,700
write whatever you wanted to send in

292
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,279
such a way that they were actually going

293
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,640
to to be interested in in talking to you

294
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,899
and

295
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:19,980
when that was the model not just at the

296
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,019
New York Times but it crossed

297
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:23,360
all insurance

298
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,160
and I think it's safe to say that a lot

299
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,440
of newsrooms did miss out on some really

300
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,720
good information simply because sources

301
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,459
either didn't know how to contact them

302
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:35,100
or they contacted them but people just

303
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,720
weren't that interested

304
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,360
and so by setting up this lab tips

305
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,500
Channel

306
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,320
um that includes secure drop it means

307
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,600
that there's a team of people that are

308
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,160
dedicated to them reviewing the

309
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,019
information that comes in across these

310
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:52,019
different platforms figure out is this

311
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:55,800
spam is it a cute cat photo is it a

312
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,839
legitimate news tip and then try to

313
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,579
figure out well

314
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:01,260
for anything that looks like a

315
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,060
legitimate news tip who in The Newsroom

316
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,459
should this go to and then there's a

317
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:07,560
secure workflow built around and how to

318
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,600
communicate internally in The Newsroom

319
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,899
with that information and so

320
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:15,980
back in the day

321
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:17,880
initially I want to say there was

322
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,920
probably about a dozen newsrooms using

323
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,500
secure drop and then over the years that

324
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,519
sort of become this gold standard for

325
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,820
for newsrooms like that that if if The

326
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,279
Newsroom wants to portray itself as one

327
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,620
that will protect its sources and allow

328
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,779
people to securely communicate with its

329
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:38,639
reporters it will have a secure up

330
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,100
instance in the desert and I think

331
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,120
that's been that's been really really

332
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,620
cool to see and also a good friend of

333
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,500
mine named Alec Muffet has developed the

334
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,920
Enterprise onion toolkit which allows

335
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,040
um really anyone to take a website and

336
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,100
set it up as a DOT onion site so that

337
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,899
would be a website that has um

338
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:07,320
long random address ending in dot onion

339
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,980
instead of.com or dot net that can only

340
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,079
be accessed if you're using the tour

341
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:17,160
browser and so over the years

342
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,100
um a lot of newsrooms have set up their

343
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:25,320
eotk site the CIA has set up a eotk site

344
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,740
as well and so like the number of ways

345
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,480
in which the people used for today has

346
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,160
like really really increased and really

347
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,399
changed over the years and

348
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:37,620
it's been it's been really fun for me to

349
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,360
sort of see like going from that initial

350
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,339
point of like hey like here's a tool

351
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:42,899
that just allows you to be anonymous

352
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:45,480
online and that's really cool to

353
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,420
over uh over the years you're seeing the

354
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,399
impact that tour has in the world and

355
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,139
what it allows people to do and the

356
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:53,639
types of technologies that can sort of

357
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:57,740
be built around and on top of this

358
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,839
now it's also been done interesting to

359
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:04,579
see over the years how

360
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,839
technology how encryption how tools like

361
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,940
tours sort of help change the narrative

362
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,220
around

363
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,699
security around encryption around online

364
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:18,839
anonymity especially and I'll say

365
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:22,680
especially in Europe and in the US and

366
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,000
so I think that what I've put on the

367
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,459
slide here is sort of my take on it in

368
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:29,579
my perspective I don't know a whole lot

369
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:32,279
about how the narrative

370
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:34,440
may or may not have shifted over the

371
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,740
years in this region so if anyone has

372
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,060
any thoughts on that that they want to

373
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,680
share with me later I would I would love

374
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,540
to hear about it

375
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:48,060
um in Europe and in the US the debate

376
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,839
around using tools like tour and using

377
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:52,500
um

378
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,079
any sort of online anonymity tool using

379
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,500
encryption and sort of gone from like

380
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,360
um

381
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,000
people saying well if you if if you're

382
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,040
using this tool if you want to be

383
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,260
anonymous online then like surely it's

384
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,540
because you have something that you want

385
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,440
to hide

386
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,420
I don't have anything to hide so I don't

387
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,959
need to use these tools to now it's it's

388
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:18,120
fairly common for that argument to just

389
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,360
be uh well I'm using this tool because I

390
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,519
have something to protect because I just

391
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,199
don't want you to have access to that

392
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,079
data it's not data that you need to have

393
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,680
about me

394
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,940
and similarly like the the way that we

395
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,160
talk about

396
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,680
if you have a home you typically do

397
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,899
close the windows

398
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:45,720
before you leave and you lock the door

399
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,300
so that people can't just like walk

400
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,680
right into your home and take whatever

401
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,560
they want and similarly you encrypt

402
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,079
everything that you can because it's

403
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:58,199
your data it is private there's no

404
00:16:58,199 --> 00:16:59,279
um

405
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,320
why should anyone else have access to

406
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,660
that right why should anyone else see

407
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,400
that and so just the way that people

408
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,079
think about and talk about encryption

409
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:10,799
has shifted over the years

410
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,299
um I remember

411
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:14,579
many many years ago talking to people

412
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:17,099
about using Tor and one of the first

413
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:19,020
questions that came up was like well if

414
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,000
I use Tour on this network then I'm

415
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,859
going to stand out because I am one of

416
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:26,220
the only people using Tor and I think

417
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,700
that that is that was and still is a

418
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,460
good argument but I think today using

419
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,100
Tor or using any sort of encryption tool

420
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,160
has become far more common that in some

421
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,559
cases not using that

422
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,660
is going to make you stand out on the

423
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,940
wire as opposed to standing in because

424
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,400
you're using those tools

425
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,140
um

426
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,780
end-to-end is becoming the new default

427
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,640
so

428
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,520
years ago I remember when signal first

429
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,919
came out and I installed signal on my

430
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:00,179
phone

431
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,100
and I was trying to figure out well how

432
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,500
do I how do I get my friends to use this

433
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,320
this app and

434
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,940
um

435
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,919
option one I couldn't sort of explain to

436
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:12,299
them the benefits of end-to-end

437
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,039
encryption and what signal can do for

438
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:18,360
them and how amazing the tool is

439
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,400
um I don't know if they would be too

440
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,960
interested in that so I just told them

441
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,580
well hey if you install this this app

442
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,200
and use it then you can call me for free

443
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,940
and that was sort of like a good enough

444
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,320
hook

445
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,900
but these days encrypting uh data

446
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,760
end-to-end by default is now becoming

447
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,039
display this new standard that companies

448
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:39,480
are actually moving towards you have

449
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,000
signal into an encryption by default

450
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,340
WhatsApp end-to-end encryption by

451
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:47,400
default meta recently announced that it

452
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,919
is working towards into an encryption by

453
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,640
default for Instagram messages and

454
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,600
Facebook messages as well and it's

455
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,700
to the point now especially in the US

456
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,160
whereas new technologies roll out that

457
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,840
enable Communications between two

458
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,179
parties that there's this immediate

459
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,700
question of like does it support

460
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,679
end-to-end encryption by default and if

461
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:12,240
not then why

462
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,280
so if you've been following all the news

463
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,600
around Twitter

464
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,940
um over the past especially six months

465
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,960
but

466
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,020
um also just this past week there's a

467
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,240
lot of questions then around

468
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,039
um if so many Engineers have access to

469
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,140
the production environment and so many

470
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,120
Engineers have access to personal data

471
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,500
and then potentially also direct

472
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,100
messages why hasn't Twitter done more to

473
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,080
ensure that that data is encrypted by

474
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,940
default

475
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,340
another interesting point is

476
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,760
um years ago again the argument was well

477
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,640
if you're providing people with a tool

478
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,380
like tour that allows people to be

479
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:52,140
anonymous online then bad people can do

480
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,520
bad things

481
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,799
and that is still very much

482
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:57,660
um an argument that I hear but sort of

483
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:02,880
less so or less often than back then and

484
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,740
I don't know if I still have like a good

485
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,840
answer to that argument I think back

486
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,299
then I would say

487
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:12,139
um that

488
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,559
it does enable

489
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,900
it enables people to be secure online

490
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,640
and to do whatever it is that they want

491
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,980
to do in a secure and private way and I

492
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:26,400
think that that is worth doing even if

493
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,039
some people do bad things I think just

494
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,419
because there are people in the world

495
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:33,120
that do bad things does not mean that

496
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,700
the rest of us should just give up any

497
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,660
right to privacy or online anonymity

498
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,480
to sort of maintain

499
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,340
um

500
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,500
to make it easier I guess for uh law

501
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,900
enforcement to catch the bad people I

502
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,520
think similarly like any sort of

503
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,280
Technology can at some point and will at

504
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,440
some point be misused by bad people to

505
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,260
do bad things that does not mean that

506
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,000
the rest of us should just sort of give

507
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,039
up any right to good

508
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:04,020
security

509
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,340
um and it's been sort of very

510
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,600
interesting just to see the debate

511
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,660
around that over the years

512
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,900
if you're interested in certain the

513
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,000
arguments or the history around and to

514
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,799
an encryption by default and exactly

515
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,860
what end to end really entails

516
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,400
um Alec Muffet has written a fairly long

517
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,799
paper really looking at a lot of

518
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:28,799
different arguments around end-to-end

519
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,260
encryption defining what end-to-end

520
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:34,080
encryption really is and I'd recommend

521
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,000
you go read that I think I have a link

522
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,760
to it at the end of my slides as well

523
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,380
it's also been really interesting just

524
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,840
to see how like the

525
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,080
The Narrative around hackers in the

526
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,900
world has has changed so back in the day

527
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,400
hackers with the black hoodie that's

528
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,919
still definitely a thing but we are uh

529
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:54,539
thankfully getting better stock images

530
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:58,500
now but I think the public view for

531
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,360
quite some time was that hackers were

532
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,400
just destroying the world there was no

533
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,460
Rhyme or Reason or purpose to it we

534
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,340
weren't really up to anything good and

535
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,440
we were just out here causing trouble

536
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,280
and I think now over the years we've

537
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,740
sort of demonstrated that sure yes we do

538
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,360
we do those things because we can

539
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,820
because it's fun and I'll share my

540
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:24,120
examples about that in uh in a bit but

541
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,520
there's actually a lot of good work in

542
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,919
what we do as well and

543
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:32,159
I think cyber security today equals

544
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,100
National Security as well I think that

545
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,780
there's so much now that is just

546
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,460
intertwined with the work that we're

547
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,080
doing in the space that we're in that

548
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,360
there's definitely this like framing of

549
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,919
like here's all these people that for

550
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,580
years we deserve us people that are just

551
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,440
destroying the world who are actually

552
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,260
now making a difference which I think is

553
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,700
really really cool and it says something

554
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,980
about just what we can do with the work

555
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,360
that we're doing and the way that we're

556
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,980
talking about it

557
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,500
um and how people

558
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,900
are more likely to pay attention to what

559
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,400
we're doing and what we're seeing now

560
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,679
than perhaps what they were 10 years ago

561
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,100
so

562
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,919
sort of on that note

563
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,500
the work that I do today and and have

564
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,480
done for about

565
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,419
a decade at this point is focusing

566
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:24,299
around securing reporters and at-risk

567
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:28,440
people around the world so back in

568
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,799
I think it was 2011 tour project got

569
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:34,200
some funding to train reporters and I

570
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,539
ended up leading that project and

571
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:38,280
initially the goal there was just to

572
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,020
teach reporters how to use the Tor

573
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,020
Browser

574
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,659
and we very quickly found that it's not

575
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:48,059
super helpful or super impactful to

576
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,400
teach people how to use Tor if they're

577
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,260
not also familiar with other security

578
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:55,020
best practices like good passwords and

579
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,299
two Factor authentication and software

580
00:23:57,299 --> 00:24:01,799
updates and what a network admin can and

581
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:03,960
cannot see on the wire for example so we

582
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,419
ended up building up a curriculum around

583
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:08,880
that and it was that experience that I

584
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,520
later took with me to freedom of the

585
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,159
pest Foundation Building The Newsroom

586
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,280
security program at the New York Times

587
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:20,400
and now also at Granite so the way that

588
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,220
I view securing a reporter is that being

589
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:26,159
a journalist is more than nine to five

590
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:27,919
right

591
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,880
you are

592
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,980
at the movie theater you're still a

593
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:35,340
reporter at that point you're traveling

594
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:38,220
you're still a reporter you're on your

595
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,500
way home from the office and something

596
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,260
interesting pops up on Twitter

597
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,120
if it's something that you're covering

598
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,919
you're probably going to cover that as

599
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:48,299
well then because that's just sort of

600
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:49,799
part of what you do so being a

601
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:51,240
journalist is far more than like a

602
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,320
nine-to-five job it's an identity and

603
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,780
the work that a reporter is doing then

604
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,820
requires support from others so like the

605
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,039
business side of the immediate

606
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:03,360
organization

607
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,179
take it

608
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:09,860
with the endpoint securing the end point

609
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,299
legal for any sort of legal threats that

610
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:15,240
they may be dealing with security for

611
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,280
securing any accounts and systems and

612
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,039
devices that they're using Engineers who

613
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:21,419
are developing the content Management

614
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:23,220
Systems they can actually publish their

615
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,500
articles there's a lot of work that sort

616
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,900
of goes be goes on on the business side

617
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,120
of a media organization to support the

618
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,720
work that the reporters are doing and

619
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,760
what's been sort of interesting over the

620
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,380
years is that

621
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:41,820
a business will often then take

622
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,600
um

623
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,900
will take this idea that they are there

624
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,260
to provide whatever the business needs

625
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,000
within the hours of nine to five

626
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,820
Security will focus on securing the

627
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,919
corporate systems and assets and

628
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:58,860
accounts that the individuals are using

629
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,600
but if you're a reporter and that is

630
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,640
your identity I can assure you that you

631
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,980
are going to use accounts and systems

632
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,919
that are both your personal

633
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,679
and the corporate ones another question

634
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:12,960
becomes how do you then secure the

635
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,120
how do you enable someone to do whatever

636
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,159
it is that they're trying to do in a

637
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:19,140
secure way regardless of the device that

638
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,940
they're using so that is sort of some of

639
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,460
the work that I'm looking into like how

640
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,600
would you secure someone doing

641
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,700
anti-corruption work

642
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,740
whether it's on a personal device a

643
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,980
corporate device traveling maybe they're

644
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,480
not

645
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,580
um a lot of it comes down to the

646
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,159
security sort of Basics I would say the

647
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,559
updates and two-factor and passwords and

648
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,360
knowing what kind of devices or accounts

649
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,700
to use and what not to use if I had to

650
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,260
prepare for a trip

651
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,020
but in many cases

652
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,159
um

653
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:55,080
what it also comes down to is just how

654
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,700
you think about all of those things and

655
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,960
how you can like put all of the right

656
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,600
pieces together so like going back to uh

657
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,760
Chris's keynote yesterday and thinking

658
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,200
about it as sort of being really really

659
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,360
curious about how to make this puzzle

660
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,820
work that is sort of what I really get

661
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,380
away

662
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,419
um take away from this work because

663
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:14,640
let's say uh someone will come to me and

664
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,440
say hey we're going on a reporting trip

665
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:21,240
to North Korea in two weeks

666
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,520
what do we need to know

667
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,740
and that isn't an opportunity like I

668
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,360
then viewed that as a puzzle to figure

669
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,340
out while you're traveling so like

670
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,539
you're leaving the country you're

671
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:33,000
entering a new country

672
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,400
um here's what I know about your trip

673
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,500
the type of people that you're more most

674
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,260
likely to talk to or the places you're

675
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,059
where you're gonna stay here's the type

676
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:44,039
of material you're going to gather on

677
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:45,779
your trip that we then need to keep safe

678
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:48,720
for me that becomes this like one one

679
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,720
big big puzzle we tried to figure out

680
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,880
well how do you then keep this

681
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,880
individual and their identity safe from

682
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,140
a physical digital emotional and legal

683
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,100
standpoint

684
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:05,520
and that I think is work that I find

685
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,080
really really interesting and it's sort

686
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,700
of been really fun to see how that's

687
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:12,299
evolved over the years from you know

688
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:13,919
people at the tour project teaching

689
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,520
reporters how to use the tour browser to

690
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:20,640
now uh Media or organizations

691
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,039
having dedicated security teams having

692
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,380
people dedicated to supporting the

693
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,080
newsrooms and also being able to do the

694
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,760
work that I'm doing now

695
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,340
so

696
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:35,159
like I said that is a big part of what I

697
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:36,539
do and it has like this great Mission

698
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:38,240
and big impact

699
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,580
curiosity and puzzles

700
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:45,059
but when it comes down to puzzles

701
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:46,799
for me it's sort of always like started

702
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,658
with this question of like what happens

703
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,860
as a kid I would ask like a billion

704
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,900
questions about what happens if I do

705
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,679
this what happens if I do that

706
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,440
why does this happen why is this a thing

707
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,419
um and I think that sort of drives a lot

708
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:05,340
of the type of work that that we do as

709
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,980
well it sort of all comes down to the

710
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,960
Curiosity and sort of having the ability

711
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,000
to just ask

712
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,940
what happens if and then actually trying

713
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,020
it out

714
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,340
so

715
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:21,960
back in 2015 my husband and I hacked a

716
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,480
Wireless

717
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:29,039
powered uh sniper rifold and

718
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,679
um like I said I grew up in Norway my

719
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,000
husband's in

720
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,700
um he's American I've always been very

721
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,740
very fascinated with like stereotypical

722
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,960
American things

723
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,919
so in 2014 like a year before we

724
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,919
presented the research and he just went

725
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:48,659
and said hey you've never been to a gun

726
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:51,179
show I was like no no I'm not sure how I

727
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:53,100
feel about that but

728
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,440
why not sure let's go

729
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,360
so we went to this gun show in

730
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,880
Washington DC and

731
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,100
looked at all the different vendors and

732
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,140
I came across one

733
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:06,179
um from a company called tracking point

734
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:09,419
that showed off this like rifle

735
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:11,700
that to me looked like a fairly standard

736
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,799
rifle I'm not familiar with like weapons

737
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:16,440
or guns or anything so to me that just

738
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,760
sort of looked like a fairly standard

739
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,679
rifle but they were like talking about

740
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,240
it as if it was like this really really

741
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:25,679
fancy new Innovative thing

742
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,120
um and as it was flipping through the

743
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,039
brochure in the car on the way home I

744
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,779
sort of saw that it has

745
00:30:30,779 --> 00:30:33,179
um mobile apps

746
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:38,700
the software updates it has USB ports uh

747
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,799
it has Wi-Fi

748
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,980
it has a little computer inside of it

749
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,659
um and I just turned to my husband and

750
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:47,100
said hey you know we should we should

751
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,380
buy one hack it and present it blackhead

752
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,779
and Defcon next year

753
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:55,260
and uh to my surprise he said sure

754
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:58,980
so we bought two of them

755
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,500
um and have have them sitting on a

756
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,140
kitchen counter for about eight months

757
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,240
sort of half open with like cables

758
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,159
coming out of it hooked up to the

759
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,860
battery hooked up to the laptops the way

760
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,980
that this rifle works is that's like a

761
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:14,880
stock

762
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,480
Remington rifle

763
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,940
with the scope that tracking Point has

764
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,440
then built and put a little computer

765
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,360
inside of it that's like a beaglebone

766
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,220
black

767
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,919
and then it has technology going to the

768
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:31,260
trigger where you have the red button so

769
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,659
the way that this works and you can

770
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:35,820
really call it sniping for dummies is

771
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:40,200
that you line up whatever you want your

772
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,720
target to be then you press the red

773
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,620
button to tag your targets

774
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,000
um also add that if you're standing in

775
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,320
the back and you want to sit down there

776
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,500
are seats up front as well so don't feel

777
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,940
like you have to stand for the rest of

778
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,260
the talk

779
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,659
um so you will

780
00:31:57,659 --> 00:32:00,419
tag your Target by pushing the red

781
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:01,440
button

782
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,559
at that point the trigger is locked

783
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,539
so you will be applying pressure to the

784
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:09,899
trigger and when the little computer has

785
00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:11,880
calculated that if you release the

786
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,620
trigger at that point in time you will

787
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,820
hit your target

788
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:17,340
so

789
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:21,120
me with like no experience whatsoever

790
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,539
um firing guns can hit my intended

791
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:26,520
target every single time

792
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,860
that's sort of how it's supposed to work

793
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:34,520
now what we ended up doing is

794
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,799
um we started off first looking at like

795
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:41,399
I said it has two mobile apps it has one

796
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:44,159
app that just allows

797
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,919
um one person to see

798
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:49,679
what the shooter is seeing inside the

799
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:50,880
Scopes it's just like a live feed

800
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,399
basically of the same screen that's one

801
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:56,580
app the other app then allows you to

802
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,440
change some of the settings for like

803
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,720
wind and temperature and the type of

804
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,700
bullet that you're using

805
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,620
um so that the computer can use all of

806
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:07,620
that info to set you for Success

807
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,419
essentially

808
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:10,200
um

809
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:14,640
and then it has like I said USB ports

810
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,080
um software updates and things like that

811
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,299
so we started poking at both the

812
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:21,059
hardware side and the smoke collabs

813
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:22,880
trying to just understand the

814
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,960
communication between the two parties

815
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,580
trying to figure out what might be

816
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,860
possible what kind of assumptions the

817
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:31,620
developers have sort of put into the

818
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,299
creation of

819
00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:36,240
um of these apps and this

820
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,059
technology

821
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:42,179
um and we got we got sort of Fairly far

822
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:45,539
on our own but but at some point we did

823
00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:46,200
um

824
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,700
we did

825
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:51,240
take the rifle with us to a hackerspace

826
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,940
where we met up with a bunch of friends

827
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,799
who just really helped us out by helping

828
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:59,640
us gain access to the file system which

829
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,380
um was unencrypted and at that point it

830
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,940
allowed us access to a whole lot more

831
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,460
interesting data and I think that that

832
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,099
is sort of one point that

833
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:10,199
if there's one thing that all these

834
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:12,599
years later I still think about when it

835
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:14,820
comes to this research it is the number

836
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,739
of people that you sort of jumped at the

837
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:18,960
chance to like help us out with this and

838
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,839
even as we got access to the file system

839
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,000
which was sort of our initial goal at

840
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,060
that point their response was cool well

841
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,280
we got access to the file system what

842
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,839
else can we do now to help you make your

843
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:32,399
talk even more awesome

844
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:33,839
and the fact that there are so many

845
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,339
people in this community that are just

846
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:37,440
willing to help out and

847
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,379
make someone else's talk uh really

848
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:42,599
really cool or help them find like that

849
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:44,280
one thing that is just going to make a

850
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,800
huge difference in your research I think

851
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,199
it's just fantastic and it's definitely

852
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:52,379
a project that we had a lot of fun with

853
00:34:52,379 --> 00:34:54,960
um definitely going back to the sort of

854
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,420
question of like what happens if

855
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,460
so

856
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:03,180
um I will say that over the years as I

857
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,740
sort of talked about this this research

858
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:07,080
one question that keeps coming up is uh

859
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:11,700
does it run Doom uh no it does not but

860
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,260
um one of the things that we were able

861
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,680
to do was

862
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,960
when we looked at how it does software

863
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,980
updates

864
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,079
since we had access to the file system

865
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,180
the updates themselves so the way that

866
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,040
the software update would work

867
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:30,359
is that the rifle would communicate with

868
00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:33,960
the mobile app to request an update the

869
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,820
mobile app would then connect out to

870
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,800
TrackingPoint server

871
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,960
to request the update the update would

872
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:43,500
be downloaded to your mobile device and

873
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,320
then passed to the rifle and all of that

874
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,040
that update would be encrypted so it

875
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,780
would be decrypted once it hit the file

876
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,880
system on the rifle once we had access

877
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,599
to the file system that we had access to

878
00:35:56,599 --> 00:36:00,780
the private key to decrypt the software

879
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:04,740
update and we also found that it's the

880
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:07,980
same it's the same key on older

881
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,740
rifles so if you have access to one you

882
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,599
have access to the key you can create a

883
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:14,760
custom software update for any tracking

884
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,660
point

885
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,220
firearm

886
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,260
so we created our own update that

887
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,579
instead of showing the update screen

888
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:25,280
shows the game over duck hunt screen

889
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,079
I'll also say that while we were not

890
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,339
able to fire remotely

891
00:36:32,339 --> 00:36:33,839
we could do a bunch of different things

892
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,579
like we could we could lock the trigger

893
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:37,560
so that you could not fire at all until

894
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:41,060
you had rebooted the rifle which sounds

895
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:43,440
ridiculous but you had to reboot the

896
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,380
rifle to undo that change we also

897
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,119
through the software updates could make

898
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:50,820
persistent changes so that your rifle

899
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,460
would just like by default be slightly

900
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:58,140
wonky we could change the values for

901
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,240
wind and temperature and type of bullet

902
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,099
beyond what was available in the mobile

903
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:02,940
app

904
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,520
to the point that it affected how the

905
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,520
rifle would fire so instead of thinking

906
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,680
that you're going to hit your intended

907
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,420
target you actually end up hitting two

908
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:15,300
and a half feet to the left or to the

909
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,460
right without there being any indication

910
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:20,099
that this is going to happen whatsoever

911
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:21,420
and

912
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,460
a lot of this work sort of came out of

913
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,140
that like initial question I'm like well

914
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:28,200
what happens if I do this like what is

915
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,460
actually

916
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,800
doable and

917
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:35,220
this is perhaps my like favorite vendor

918
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,660
response

919
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,640
um ever on the day that we presented Air

920
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,780
Research in 2015 the official tracking

921
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:45,780
Point website had this statement on it

922
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,359
that says it's Contin it's safe to

923
00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:51,660
continue using the Wi-Fi on your rifle

924
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,760
if you're confident there are no hackers

925
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,720
within 100 feet

926
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,400
which I will say that the company

927
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,579
shortly after I think uh

928
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:04,859
went bankrupt I don't know if they're

929
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:07,560
still around today

930
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,720
um I don't think that they did very well

931
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,520
but

932
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,119
um

933
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:12,839
yeah

934
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:14,579
definitely one of these like projects

935
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:15,960
that I

936
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,619
um

937
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:19,380
very much enjoyed doing

938
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,180
purely

939
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,460
because we could purely because it would

940
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,859
be like such a fun puzzle to deal with

941
00:38:25,859 --> 00:38:29,280
and uh also because I had always wanted

942
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,079
to speak at black hat in Defcon like

943
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:32,640
growing up in Norway that was something

944
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,339
that I just like saw from

945
00:38:35,339 --> 00:38:37,800
afar saw from a distance and that this

946
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,300
was like this really really cool space

947
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,339
really cool event and I like really

948
00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:43,680
wanted to be able to one day

949
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,619
give this amazing

950
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:49,680
talk just because at blackhead and this

951
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,119
was very much one of those projects

952
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,160
where like we were very clear from like

953
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,500
the get-go that this is more of like a

954
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,920
stunt hack type of talk it doesn't have

955
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,720
um a whole lot of lessons learned there

956
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,820
aren't necessarily a huge like societal

957
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:05,460
positive impact or benefit from this

958
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,619
research this is like purely because we

959
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:09,900
can and so we did type of work and I

960
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,000
think there's a lot of value in that as

961
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,260
well

962
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:16,980
so the next example that I have then

963
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,020
um along the sort of I wonder if I can

964
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:19,859
do

965
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:21,900
X

966
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,599
a couple of years ago Patrick Wardle

967
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:27,960
started working on this book about uh

968
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,480
Mac malware and how he can get started

969
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,859
in analyzing militia software for Mac OS

970
00:39:34,859 --> 00:39:37,680
and he initially set out to sort of

971
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:41,760
write this book as this publicly

972
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,440
available Google doc Open Source book

973
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,260
that once he finished that no starch

974
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,960
then offered to sort of print it up into

975
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,839
an actual book book but so when when

976
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:57,240
Patrick set out to do this work he at

977
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,560
one point tweeted and saying you know

978
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,200
like anyone that can help me edit edit

979
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,700
this book

980
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,460
is it sure it sounds it sounds like fun

981
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:08,280
it's not a topic that I have too much

982
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,020
experience with I think that editing the

983
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:13,140
book would be a great way for me to one

984
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:15,000
read the content but also learn a lot

985
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,920
along the way

986
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,579
um

987
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:20,420
and

988
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,800
um Patrick and I then made this deal

989
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,720
that I would edit the book and then the

990
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,880
year after at his conference objective

991
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,339
by the sea I would then get to take the

992
00:40:29,339 --> 00:40:31,500
training which is follows the book as

993
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,760
well so that was like this really

994
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:36,000
interesting uh collaboration that we set

995
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,540
up now when reading through the book

996
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,280
which like talks about like how to set

997
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,460
up a malware analysis environment the

998
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:47,280
tools that you can use a lot of them are

999
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,020
um his tools that are free and open

1000
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,760
source and great like it sort of talks

1001
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,040
you through how to set up the

1002
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,359
environment

1003
00:40:54,359 --> 00:40:57,300
how to get started where to find samples

1004
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,400
what you should be looking for in the

1005
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,740
different samples that made me think

1006
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:04,320
back to

1007
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:09,420
um this story from 2017 where

1008
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,180
um

1009
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:14,640
Wikileaks released this trobe of alleged

1010
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,640
CIA hacking documents and also hacking

1011
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:21,180
tools so this was what was known as

1012
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:24,240
Vault 7 back then

1013
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,040
um and over the years I've been very

1014
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,260
interested in stories like this and

1015
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:31,260
especially cases where tools are also

1016
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,180
being released

1017
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:36,359
and I had been sort of thinking about

1018
00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:37,880
um

1019
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:42,000
one one in particular that so shortly

1020
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,800
after like this article was published in

1021
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,839
March of

1022
00:41:44,839 --> 00:41:48,780
2717 about a month later semantic and

1023
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,760
then later Kaspersky published then

1024
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,940
their research saying like hey here's

1025
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,500
the thing that we're aware of that we

1026
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,320
call the Lamberts what we know about the

1027
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,920
land Birds tracks with what Wikileaks

1028
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,900
has now published

1029
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:04,560
um

1030
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,560
saying that this is the CIA we do

1031
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,780
believe that these are the same here's

1032
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,359
the research that we're publishing

1033
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:13,859
semantic published their work so like

1034
00:42:13,859 --> 00:42:16,740
here's here's what we have

1035
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:19,020
um and in in reading through that there

1036
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:20,880
was sort of one thing that

1037
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,740
um stood out to me

1038
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:25,680
which is uh

1039
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,460
green Lambert so uh Kaspersky had sort

1040
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:32,820
of called the collection of tools as the

1041
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:36,660
Lambert's toolkit and specific

1042
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,820
samples within the toolkit then have

1043
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,320
like a color so you will have black

1044
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,480
Lambert and I think white Lambert and

1045
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,540
then green Lambert where they noted that

1046
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,700
the green and Lambert family is the only

1047
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:51,060
one where a non-windows version has been

1048
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:52,440
found

1049
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,440
um compiled for OS X almost uploaded

1050
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,740
from Russia to a multi-scanner service

1051
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:01,079
which in this case just means virus

1052
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:04,980
total in 2014. so it had been around for

1053
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,480
a while but this is for the first time

1054
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,099
that someone was actually linking it

1055
00:43:08,099 --> 00:43:10,859
back to the land Birds by name which

1056
00:43:10,859 --> 00:43:12,060
then

1057
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:12,900
um

1058
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:16,500
we all assumed was the CIA

1059
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,359
and so I had been like seeing this story

1060
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:19,800
over the years and I thought it was

1061
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,240
really really interesting that like

1062
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:25,740
here's a sample compiled for OS X that

1063
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:29,220
has been around since 2014. this article

1064
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:30,680
came out in

1065
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:34,079
2017. I was going through like Patrick's

1066
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,980
book uh trying to sort of learn uh what

1067
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:39,900
is possible and how I can get started

1068
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,400
and so I figured well

1069
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,800
what happens if I look into the specific

1070
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,119
sample

1071
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:46,619
um I'm sure that there's people who have

1072
00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:48,420
been doing this type of work for a very

1073
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:51,180
very long time will be able to find far

1074
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:54,119
more interesting things than than I can

1075
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:57,420
but surely if no one's published if no

1076
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:59,099
one's made an attempt and published

1077
00:43:59,099 --> 00:44:00,839
their findings then

1078
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:03,900
why don't I give it a try and

1079
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:06,380
that then resulted in this talk that

1080
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:08,640
this drone talked that Patrick and I

1081
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,040
gave at objective by the Sea a year ago

1082
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:15,420
looking at U.S by agencies Mac OS

1083
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:18,060
implants so I looked at Green Lambert

1084
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:22,859
for Mac OS and Patrick looked at some of

1085
00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:25,260
the NSA tools that have come out over

1086
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:27,240
the years and this is very much this

1087
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,220
like type of project where for one

1088
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,200
Patrick was very very patient and very

1089
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,260
helpful he's been doing this this table

1090
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:37,440
work for a very long time I'm just like

1091
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,119
sort of kind of

1092
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:41,579
um getting started but also managed to

1093
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:44,640
find some what I think are pretty cool

1094
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,040
things so

1095
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,339
foreign

1096
00:44:49,819 --> 00:44:52,380
I did for the sample was sort of just

1097
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:54,720
look at the strings in the sample just

1098
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,920
to see if there's anything interesting

1099
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,920
there try to see if

1100
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,839
um if there are things that we can learn

1101
00:45:00,839 --> 00:45:03,839
about how how it works

1102
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:06,300
um and there were some like options for

1103
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:07,920
like how the sample would like gain

1104
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,200
persistence

1105
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,060
um that it would do something with proxy

1106
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:16,079
settings that you'd use xcode 2.2 which

1107
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,200
was released in 2005 and what I also

1108
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,060
thought was really interesting is that I

1109
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:23,099
found this like one of the strings says

1110
00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:25,200
error from lib event when adding events

1111
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,900
and I knew from my work with the tour

1112
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:31,319
project back in the day that that is a

1113
00:45:31,319 --> 00:45:35,099
library that is also used in Tor and has

1114
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:36,480
been created by some of the same people

1115
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,839
that created tour initially so I

1116
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:41,940
remember when talking to Patrick about

1117
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,920
this this output and he was just sort of

1118
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,780
checking to see if there was anything

1119
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:47,700
else there and he's like oh well like

1120
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:49,500
this doesn't like mean anything and this

1121
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,960
doesn't seem all that interesting and he

1122
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,540
just stepped over this part but to me

1123
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:56,220
with my tour experience and tour

1124
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,680
background that made sense to me and it

1125
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,560
was something that I felt like including

1126
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,920
in in the research so that just sort of

1127
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,079
goes to show that even if you don't have

1128
00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:09,780
any sort of experience with it with

1129
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:11,880
malware analysis that doesn't mean that

1130
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,380
there aren't things that that you can

1131
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:15,300
bring to the table

1132
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,220
um and find as well

1133
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:19,440
so in in mapping and sort of going

1134
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,140
through the strings for the sample and

1135
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:23,940
trying to figure out like what actually

1136
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:27,380
looks interesting and then looking at

1137
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:30,980
what do we know about

1138
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:35,220
when Wikileaks release the data when the

1139
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:37,760
data was taken from the CIA

1140
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,220
the different versions of libivent and

1141
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:45,720
xcode the type of version of Mac OS so

1142
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,020
this sample would most likely run on

1143
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:51,420
we then managed to create this timeline

1144
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:53,359
of a sort of

1145
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:56,220
most likely development and use timeline

1146
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:58,319
for this piece of malware so we can like

1147
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:02,520
work backwards from Wikileaks publishing

1148
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,619
the bolt 7 dump

1149
00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:07,640
um to when it was first detected by

1150
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:10,560
Kaspersky to when it was put up on

1151
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,800
buyer's total versions of Mac OS 10 7

1152
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,980
and 10 8 back to xcode and live event

1153
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:19,740
and then show that it was most likely

1154
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:22,880
developed and used sometime between 2007

1155
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,800
and 2013.

1156
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,599
and

1157
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:28,619
um

1158
00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:30,660
one interesting thing I think with like

1159
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:32,460
looking at really old samples especially

1160
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:34,859
ones that no one's really looked at is

1161
00:47:34,859 --> 00:47:36,599
one it does say something about the

1162
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:39,500
capabilities of in this case the CIA

1163
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:42,500
back in

1164
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:45,119
2017-2013 which sort of does make you

1165
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:48,359
wonder whether up to now

1166
00:47:48,359 --> 00:47:51,720
um but it also just talks about like

1167
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:55,800
what was possible back then and and the

1168
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,180
different sort of assumptions and

1169
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:59,460
techniques that malware authors would

1170
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:02,160
have to leverage and to do whatever it

1171
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,859
is that they that they wanted to do

1172
00:48:04,859 --> 00:48:06,240
um I spent

1173
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:09,240
a good amount of time trying to get a

1174
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:12,119
version of OS X up and running that

1175
00:48:12,119 --> 00:48:14,579
could actually run the sample so sure

1176
00:48:14,579 --> 00:48:16,560
there's like so there's only so much

1177
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,200
that you can do with static analysis and

1178
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,660
I also really wanted to find a way to to

1179
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:26,220
run it after Googling a bunch and

1180
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:29,579
struggling a bunch uh without like

1181
00:48:29,579 --> 00:48:32,160
getting anywhere just like I can just

1182
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,920
like spend a hundred dollars on eBay and

1183
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:38,640
buy this really old MacBook and run it

1184
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,500
on that and that actually worked out

1185
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,940
worked out

1186
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:46,440
very very well so uh in in doing that I

1187
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:49,200
was able to then both get the host name

1188
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,119
that it reaches back out to and the IP

1189
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:53,880
address and make that available which is

1190
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:56,579
information that to that day had not

1191
00:48:56,579 --> 00:48:59,220
been made public before all from just

1192
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,079
taking the sample and putting it on this

1193
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:04,740
really old laptop that I got off of eBay

1194
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:06,000
um I also

1195
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,280
about a year ago on my research blog

1196
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,160
Matt

1197
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,859
the sample to the miter attack framework

1198
00:49:13,859 --> 00:49:15,420
so if that's type of research that

1199
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:17,220
you're interested in that's available

1200
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:20,339
there as well

1201
00:49:20,339 --> 00:49:22,680
but

1202
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:25,920
and I think this is like a big big book

1203
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,560
I think in this industry there's a lot

1204
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:33,960
of talk about apts and Odes because yes

1205
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,900
it's it's sexy it's really cool it's fun

1206
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:40,200
it's really exciting it it does

1207
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,319
um

1208
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:45,420
it does draw an audience

1209
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:47,400
but I think that looking at all the work

1210
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,420
that I've done and all the different

1211
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:50,160
sort of security research I've done over

1212
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,319
the years there's yes there's definitely

1213
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:53,819
work that I've done just because I can

1214
00:49:53,819 --> 00:49:57,359
that's fine just to prove a point or

1215
00:49:57,359 --> 00:49:59,819
just to even show to myself that I can

1216
00:49:59,819 --> 00:50:01,800
figure it out and that I can learn

1217
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,720
something new and find something that

1218
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,880
other people have not either not found

1219
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:09,180
or at least not made public but I think

1220
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:11,040
that so much of the work that we do

1221
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,560
especially as as I mentioned earlier

1222
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:16,319
with cyber security also now being equal

1223
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:19,380
to National Security I think that it is

1224
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:22,260
really important to remember that the

1225
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:24,359
majority of the work that we do is not

1226
00:50:24,359 --> 00:50:26,880
all apts and OD is that there is a whole

1227
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,180
lot of value in what we do and the

1228
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:31,380
things that we're talking about and

1229
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:33,599
presenting especially at events like

1230
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:34,920
this

1231
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,520
so

1232
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:42,060
the

1233
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:43,619
the thing that I really want to leave

1234
00:50:43,619 --> 00:50:44,880
you with

1235
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,740
um and I was trying to figure out like

1236
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:47,940
if I'm talking about my security

1237
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:49,740
research over the years and sort of

1238
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:51,900
things I've learned along the way what

1239
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:53,700
is the takeaway that I want to leave you

1240
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:56,040
with and it's that I think it's really

1241
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:58,200
really important that one that you do

1242
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,599
things that you enjoy

1243
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,460
with other and sister really being in a

1244
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,260
sort of Greater purpose to it you do it

1245
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:06,359
because it's fine you do it because it's

1246
00:51:06,359 --> 00:51:07,980
exciting because you're curious about it

1247
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:11,640
because you wonder what happens in yes

1248
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,440
and I also think it's really important

1249
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,819
that you do things that you don't know

1250
00:51:14,819 --> 00:51:16,619
how to do in part because you get to

1251
00:51:16,619 --> 00:51:18,780
meet a lot of amazing people along the

1252
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:21,119
way you also get to learn something new

1253
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:24,000
and more often than not you'll find that

1254
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,619
all the experience that you have to date

1255
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:28,020
will actually at some point help you in

1256
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:30,000
this new thing that you're just now

1257
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,280
learning how to do there are so many

1258
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,680
good talks and resources and workshops

1259
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,660
out there to help you get started in

1260
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:38,940
whatever new space of cyber security

1261
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:41,579
that you want to look at it's also a

1262
00:51:41,579 --> 00:51:44,099
pervade Community to ask for help I

1263
00:51:44,099 --> 00:51:47,460
think both with the gun hacking and the

1264
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:49,920
journalism security work and the malware

1265
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,839
analysis like I wouldn't have been able

1266
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:54,780
to do half of that if I hadn't had

1267
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:57,839
access to this great community of people

1268
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:00,240
also again say that Google summer code

1269
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,339
is still a thing so if you are a student

1270
00:52:02,339 --> 00:52:04,740
keep out keep an eye out on the Google

1271
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:06,599
summer code website

1272
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:09,480
um I think they'll announce a new round

1273
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:12,359
maybe beginning of next year and then

1274
00:52:12,359 --> 00:52:14,280
the application period will probably be

1275
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:15,119
around

1276
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:19,280
March April so keep an eye out for that

1277
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:22,619
and uh check out the tour project still

1278
00:52:22,619 --> 00:52:24,240
very much around there are different

1279
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,099
ways to get involved with that project

1280
00:52:26,099 --> 00:52:28,140
and also uni which is the open

1281
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:31,200
Observatory of network interference so

1282
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,220
if you're interested in looking

1283
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:36,780
specifically at how tour and other tools

1284
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:38,760
and sites are blocked in different parts

1285
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:41,119
of the world and how different

1286
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:44,280
authorities censor these types of tools

1287
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,380
and sites and there's a lot of data

1288
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:47,760
there and a lot of different ways that

1289
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:50,400
you can contribute and get involved

1290
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,660
so

1291
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,280
with that

1292
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,960
I hope you have a great rest of your

1293
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,819
conference thank Adrian to Dylan and

1294
00:52:56,819 --> 00:53:00,059
team for having me and if anyone's got

1295
00:53:00,059 --> 00:53:02,520
any questions either now while I'm up

1296
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:06,059
here or later today I am happy to chat

1297
00:53:06,059 --> 00:53:08,660
thank you

1298
00:53:13,619 --> 00:53:15,540
thank you Aruna so we do have some

1299
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:17,579
questions cool

1300
00:53:17,579 --> 00:53:19,380
um the first one is do you see a future

1301
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:21,960
where anonymity being script perhaps by

1302
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,599
government authorities due to malicious

1303
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:26,640
attackers using this future to their

1304
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,240
advantage

1305
00:53:30,599 --> 00:53:32,839
foreign

1306
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:40,619
well not really I think that what we are

1307
00:53:40,619 --> 00:53:42,180
seeing and what sort of has been the

1308
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:44,220
case over the years and continues to be

1309
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:46,380
the cases or this like friction

1310
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:50,040
um in in that particular space is there

1311
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:52,079
are and I think we'll always will be

1312
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:55,440
people who who see that here's this type

1313
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,260
of technology that allows bad people to

1314
00:53:58,260 --> 00:53:59,700
do bad things

1315
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:03,900
we cannot allow that to continue and

1316
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:05,520
there are people that are willing to

1317
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,920
compromise on the security and privacy

1318
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,920
that everyone else gets because there

1319
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:13,559
are bad people to do bad things I don't

1320
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:16,619
think that uh that is a group that is

1321
00:54:16,619 --> 00:54:18,839
going to win I think that end-to-end

1322
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:20,940
encryption for example is going to be

1323
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:23,339
the new default but I think that that is

1324
00:54:23,339 --> 00:54:25,559
like a very consistent debate that we

1325
00:54:25,559 --> 00:54:27,480
are going to see over and over and over

1326
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,720
again

1327
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:33,540
all right and the next one by Tolkien

1328
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:35,460
the Keynotes have talked about reversing

1329
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:37,980
of propriety hardware and or firmware

1330
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:40,319
binary blobs in some countries the law

1331
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:42,480
is fake and open security researches to

1332
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,460
possible lawsuits and stuff like

1333
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:46,859
curiosity could you give any advice to

1334
00:54:46,859 --> 00:54:48,300
those that are curious but want to stay

1335
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:51,500
out of the way of the law

1336
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,300
there's definitely an aspect of that

1337
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:03,420
that also speaks to what is what is

1338
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:04,980
legal

1339
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:07,380
um because when it comes to security

1340
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:09,780
research there is strengths to some

1341
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:11,579
extent right we're taking this step out

1342
00:55:11,579 --> 00:55:13,740
like saying well what happens if I touch

1343
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:16,020
that button what happens if I do this

1344
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:18,420
thing and also legally

1345
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:20,640
can I and is that something that like

1346
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,740
I'm willing to

1347
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:25,079
um to challenge so I know that security

1348
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:28,200
researchers in the US can uh can and

1349
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,940
also often do reach out to the

1350
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:31,859
electronic for Care Foundation to get

1351
00:55:31,859 --> 00:55:32,880
some

1352
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,220
um support there around like what is

1353
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:37,140
doable what is the legal how do I

1354
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:39,480
approach this type of work

1355
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,700
um I would say that if you know of like

1356
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:44,880
an eff equivalent where you are reach

1357
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,160
out to them and sort of see if they can

1358
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:49,260
help you out with that part of your work

1359
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:51,599
initially if you don't know who to reach

1360
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:53,880
out to reach out to the eff in the US

1361
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:56,220
and I'm pretty sure that they can at the

1362
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:57,960
very least try and help find someone

1363
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:00,780
that can speak to the laws in whatever

1364
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:03,000
part of the world you are for the type

1365
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,460
of research that that you want to do

1366
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:07,859
all right thank you is talking here by

1367
00:56:07,859 --> 00:56:10,859
any chance for a gift

1368
00:56:10,859 --> 00:56:13,980
all right a positive after this

1369
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:16,020
um the next question by Gemini regarding

1370
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:19,500
hacking tracking points water gun were

1371
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:21,000
their fears concerns regarding while

1372
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,740
eating any user agreement Clauses

1373
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:25,800
restricting reverse engineering

1374
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,000
luck

1375
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,440
yeah

1376
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,180
thank you so thank you

1377
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:31,680
um

1378
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:35,640
any concerns I did I did speak to a

1379
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:39,300
friend who's a lawyer before we uh I

1380
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:41,300
think it was after we bought the rifle

1381
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:45,359
before we did a bunch of things that we

1382
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:48,420
didn't know how to do uh so probably in

1383
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:51,300
the in the wrong order but uh were there

1384
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:53,280
really concerns not really were the

1385
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,960
things that I just sort of double

1386
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,400
checked with the lawyer before we

1387
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,740
started doing yes so I had a sense of

1388
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:01,260
like what would be more or less

1389
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:05,240
contentious as part of the research

1390
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,260
um the next one how do you get the

1391
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,700
general public to care more about

1392
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:14,460
privacy moving from nothing to height to

1393
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:16,760
something to protect

1394
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:19,260
that's that's a fun one because I think

1395
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:20,880
that goes like hand in hand with like

1396
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,500
how do you get people to care more about

1397
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,420
security

1398
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:26,400
I think

1399
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,740
if you spend a lot of time on securing

1400
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:31,319
the awareness and education you'll

1401
00:57:31,319 --> 00:57:34,859
you'll find that different messaging

1402
00:57:34,859 --> 00:57:37,200
different ways of explaining things will

1403
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,480
land with different people so like

1404
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,520
through this big room there's a way that

1405
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,619
I could explain the benefit of

1406
00:57:43,619 --> 00:57:46,380
end-to-end encryption that to some may

1407
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:49,319
make total sense just um like either

1408
00:57:49,319 --> 00:57:51,980
don't get it or don't care

1409
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:54,300
and that has nothing to do with like

1410
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:57,119
people not being interested in the topic

1411
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:59,579
it's just like sometimes you just need

1412
00:57:59,579 --> 00:58:01,200
the right message with the right words

1413
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,839
with the right examples to land with the

1414
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:05,880
audience and I think when it comes to

1415
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,680
then getting more people to really care

1416
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:10,079
about privacy I think there's two parts

1417
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:13,559
to it one is to consistently deliver the

1418
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:16,020
message that you have it is it is really

1419
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:17,400
something that you just need to keep on

1420
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,920
doing again and again and again and just

1421
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:22,559
be very consistent with I think another

1422
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:26,339
part of it is also for for us to focus

1423
00:58:26,339 --> 00:58:28,260
on building and security and privacy

1424
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:29,579
defaults in the products that we're

1425
00:58:29,579 --> 00:58:31,440
shipping so that people don't have to

1426
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,520
think about

1427
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:35,839
privacy and security they don't have to

1428
00:58:35,839 --> 00:58:38,819
focus so much on it they don't have to

1429
00:58:38,819 --> 00:58:42,420
care as deeply about it as we do because

1430
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:45,359
it is just a part of their world and

1431
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:46,680
their life and the products that they're

1432
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:47,880
using

1433
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:50,299
fair enough

1434
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,500
um the next question what are your

1435
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,240
comments on e2e instant messaging

1436
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:56,760
systems which use keywords such as on

1437
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:58,920
the endpoint are there any IM systems

1438
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:01,520
using it today

1439
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:07,619
some searches on the endpoints

1440
00:59:07,619 --> 00:59:09,660
is the person who has the question here

1441
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:11,620
can they elaborate on it

1442
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:13,339
[Music]

1443
00:59:13,339 --> 00:59:16,740
for example search for bomb or I don't

1444
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:19,260
know so breaking the end-to-end

1445
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:22,440
encryption by checking the unencrypted

1446
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:25,559
messages on the endpoint

1447
00:59:25,559 --> 00:59:28,020
like that verse some talks about it that

1448
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:29,520
this might happen

1449
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:32,400
to be compliant with some compliance

1450
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:36,420
laws but still end-to-end encrypted

1451
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:39,660
yeah it's I think that sort of goes goes

1452
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:41,160
back to this like question around like

1453
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:44,220
when you're talking about e2e so you

1454
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:45,960
have end to end

1455
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:48,720
what do you define as an end

1456
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:52,319
and is end to end between two devices

1457
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:55,740
only or can an end be multiple devices

1458
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:58,079
but owned by the same individual and so

1459
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,040
I think

1460
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:00,720
um it's sort of always interesting to

1461
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:03,780
see uh like court records in which

1462
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:05,460
someone like in which law enforcement

1463
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:08,160
suddenly has access to uh WhatsApp

1464
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,200
messages between two parties because

1465
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,359
people will then ask well isn't WhatsApp

1466
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:14,460
end-to-end encrypted and the answer is

1467
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:17,339
yes it's just not going to extend to you

1468
01:00:17,339 --> 01:00:19,440
taking your WhatsApp chats and putting

1469
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:22,079
it unencrypted in Google Drive or

1470
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:23,700
something like that so I think that like

1471
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:24,839
that is

1472
01:00:24,839 --> 01:00:26,819
um it's it's an interesting topic that I

1473
01:00:26,819 --> 01:00:28,260
do think that we need to talk more about

1474
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:31,440
so that people understand like what what

1475
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:35,220
is the scope for end to end or end too

1476
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:36,900
many ends

1477
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:38,280
um and and what are things that it still

1478
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:40,680
cannot achieve but happy to talk more

1479
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:43,079
about that one okay

1480
01:00:43,079 --> 01:00:46,260
and the final question hi Runa thanks

1481
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:48,000
for the great keynote I was curious

1482
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,520
about your IG at journalist and spy

1483
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:52,020
could you tell us a little bit about it

1484
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:54,299
do journalists make good spice and vice

1485
01:00:54,299 --> 01:00:55,440
versa

1486
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,059
thank you

1487
01:00:57,059 --> 01:00:58,260
um

1488
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:00,180
so that was

1489
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:03,119
I've always been like a big fan of uh

1490
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:07,020
True Crime and Espionage and and that

1491
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:10,440
type of uh stuff and so at some point

1492
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,119
during the pandemic I sort of had this

1493
01:01:12,119 --> 01:01:15,119
idea that I was I was reading some book

1494
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:17,359
and it referred to a spy that used

1495
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:20,760
journalism as a cover and and I sort of

1496
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,920
thought that well that's not entirely

1497
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:26,099
uncommon it's it is a really really well

1498
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:28,260
cover to use for one it's the type of

1499
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:30,240
cover that like if you're an

1500
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:31,680
investigative journalist you can walk

1501
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,359
into any conference

1502
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:37,440
any space anywhere in the world and just

1503
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:40,079
automatically by default by having that

1504
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:42,720
title it can be internally normal for

1505
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,880
you to just like go around and ask a lot

1506
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,799
of questions and be very direct in your

1507
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:48,540
questions and meet people and socialize

1508
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:50,700
and gather information

1509
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:54,180
um so I think that invalid in that sense

1510
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:55,920
um journalism

1511
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,180
um

1512
01:01:57,180 --> 01:02:00,119
Aid workers human right Defenders like

1513
01:02:00,119 --> 01:02:03,119
all of those uh profession also do make

1514
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:05,280
really really good covers I do think

1515
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:09,119
that when they're used as covers by

1516
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:12,780
um intelligence service it does do a

1517
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:15,720
huge disfavor to

1518
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:16,740
um

1519
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:18,720
to those people though

1520
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:19,500
um

1521
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:21,059
but yeah so the project just sort of

1522
01:02:21,059 --> 01:02:23,579
came came disservice was the word I was

1523
01:02:23,579 --> 01:02:24,720
looking for

1524
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:25,799
um

1525
01:02:25,799 --> 01:02:27,480
the project just sort of started out

1526
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:29,040
because I was really curious about

1527
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:31,559
surely there are more individuals that

1528
01:02:31,559 --> 01:02:33,420
have been using it either as a cover or

1529
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:35,220
reporters that at some point in time

1530
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:36,480
have

1531
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,460
started working more closely with the

1532
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:40,380
intelligence service and I just wanted

1533
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:42,480
to see how many there were out there and

1534
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:45,960
I now have a pretty good list that I'm

1535
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:48,720
building out but um happy to chat more
