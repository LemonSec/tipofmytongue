00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,720
up

2
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,500
space

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,440
space

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,800
just Don Bailey

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,270
founder of capitol hill consultants
welcome

6
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:25,869
Dom with your presentation hackers the
movie a repro

7
00:00:25,869 --> 00:00:31,349
spective welcome though thank you

8
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:34,469
sup and

9
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:37,989
when I I have to say I was really
honored to get the invite

10
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:41,010
to come out here and give a talk the
10-year anniversary

11
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,350
back in the box its exceptional the work
that they've been doing for the past 10

12
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:46,260
years and I'm really proud to be a part
in this

13
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,600
team so I wasn't quite sure what to talk
about what do you do for a 10-year

14
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,140
anniversary

15
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:56,140
expressly rate so stinkin myself like
maybe we should just got to take a step

16
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:56,829
back

17
00:00:56,829 --> 00:01:01,089
from what we're used to and instead of
talking about

18
00:01:01,089 --> 00:01:04,830
on really technical things which may be

19
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,050
kinda look at the overall aggression
have security and

20
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:13,990
industry engineering is all almost on CL
things have been affected over time

21
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:17,670
so that's kinda with the stock is about
they're gonna be

22
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,530
there okay so that's not exactly true I
actually have

23
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:24,700
a package impacted is Travis gets you
say

24
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,260
for the sock but its presentation
presentation so there's actually a

25
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,140
second presentation later

26
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,400
you know when it happens they'll be a
definitive switch

27
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:39,460
anyway water we'll get to that later but
1995 is when the movie hackers really

28
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:39,920
came out

29
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,070
K how many of us were actually in high
school that

30
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:48,540
I'm just curious I was in high school
anybody else probably love you even yeah

31
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,370
I mean that right

32
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:52,860
yeah I'm hearing some laughter may be
good

33
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,120
regardless I really didn't care much

34
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,110
about computers at that time rate care
about girls

35
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:04,740
occurred on my friends with our the
coolest things in the world

36
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,360
and i cant of fashion most of all and
you can actually catch me in a bad day

37
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,550
wearing this kinda stuff

38
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:14,390
even today to never catch me when I'm
just about to go to bed because this is

39
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,050
what I look like

40
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:18,610
and I definitely wasn't thinking about
phones

41
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,700
I wasn't thinking about sailor
technology

42
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,930
I wasn't even thinking about mobility
you know

43
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,190
the laptop to me was a completely
foreign concept

44
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,270
I had no interest in laptops whatsoever

45
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:35,140
but then suddenly I got this idea

46
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,700
right from this movie that came out that
may be kinda

47
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,920
realize that there is a lot more to the
world around me the simplistic things

48
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,450
that I was doing my everyday life

49
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:50,800
the internet wasn't about a whelp and it
wasn't about you know figuring out the

50
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,590
best way that you talk to your friends
it was about where you could do

51
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,970
and there was a really cool idea it was
at

52
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,690
very catalytic idea for myself in a lot
of people

53
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:04,600
my generation including I'm sure a lot
of people in this audience and

54
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,060
if you look at the ideas that were
presented in this movie

55
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:13,690
arm it's really interesting to see that
they almost had a lot of ways predicted

56
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,120
what the future would be like an
Internet Security

57
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,920
a decade later if course spent 17 years
now ready mix 2012

58
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,819
so they've been actually able to create
a pretty good track your

59
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:28,740
record for a long period of time a

60
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:33,190
signifying like the way that we see each
other the way we see our systems

61
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:37,010
the week guard at it's really hasn't
changed at all

62
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:42,250
that's kinda what I'm gonna get into
here so when's the last time somebody

63
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:42,810
heard

64
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:47,090
about passwords being dumped anybody

65
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:52,030
couple days ago couple weeks ago how
many people actually run an Internet

66
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,780
security team for a company

67
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:58,580
right now anybody yep it's a Man's about
others in the audience

68
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,910
they're like people here that are
actually concerned about this because

69
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:06,400
for some reason we have migrated past
the concept of password

70
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,900
write a Surekha biometrics

71
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,180
some some 17 but it's kinda ridiculous
you bypass facial recognition with the

72
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,020
photograph

73
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:18,109
by metrics on your laptop might need a
fingerprint

74
00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:21,569
if the readers any good but typically

75
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:25,740
were still caught up in this idea of
password and what it means to have an

76
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,169
identity and the Internet

77
00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:31,080
typically means still having the
password a

78
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,820
a lot solutions are migrating away from
that it's great to see duck song

79
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,870
on implementing dual secure you SSH

80
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:41,280
and Google's out authentication all that
stuff is exceptional

81
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,669
but for the most part two-factor
authentication

82
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:48,870
is still foreign to most people in most
organizations

83
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:53,110
and passwords are still something that
we're gonna use today tomorrow and

84
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:53,810
probably

85
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:57,480
ten years from now because it's just
easier

86
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,270
we're just used to it the other thing
upon

87
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:04,310
really interesting about the movie
hackers is that everybody was using a

88
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:07,600
Mac

89
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,400
and we were never would have thought
that like 10 years ago right everybody

90
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,360
had a Linux laptop

91
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,530
I've got a ThinkPad right now but we
have a Mac

92
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:20,330
home and we used for work most people
that I know that are hacking

93
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:24,130
they've gotta back course unfortunately
we're not flying through cool screens

94
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,479
doing crazy stuff

95
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:28,660
but maybe minutes when we get really
really good in the next two years ago

96
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,800
finally we'll start doing that but

97
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,210
it was interesting to see that they
almost predicted this kind of change

98
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:40,210
in behavior in action scene so we can
fly through all the quills

99
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:43,250
means that we won really at the end of
the day

100
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:47,000
were hacking computer systems rate
through those laptops

101
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,780
using passwords or whatever but the
other thing that they touched on

102
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:55,270
which I found was really cool I'm was
hacking criminals

103
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:59,220
most people back when this movie came
out nice 95 not talking about hiking

104
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,540
trails hiking a colonel was a completely
foreign idea

105
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,560
right just like most the other things
that are brought up

106
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,600
in this movie what's really cool the
first

107
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,610
exploit that ever came out for a colonel
was probably a little green men

108
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:16,060
me dirty remember I think it's a little
green men

109
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,669
if I remember correctly cannot 1983 1984

110
00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:23,639
and it was for either Cisco I can review
the skill or Sun

111
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:26,840
there was one of the two but it was a
divide by zero but

112
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,389
and the divide by zero but actually
allows you to execute

113
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:33,720
up binary in the kernel

114
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,300
by taking over the interrupt vector
Arabs are the fault handler for divide

115
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,370
by 0

116
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:42,479
you can actually inject code into the
kernel that would be executed out of

117
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,930
context user land

118
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:48,090
am delighted changer authentication
constructor

119
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:52,680
authentication credential structure
internal memory for your process

120
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,699
thus becoming group or whatever user was
for that particular operating system

121
00:06:57,699 --> 00:07:01,570
which was awesome ray I mean people
never thought about that yet

122
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:05,990
you see the movie hackers and today
what's everybody's talking about

123
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,180
2012 for lacking

124
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:14,070
and primarily where I what's on your
phone

125
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:20,520
right there are a lot of other things
going on in this movie

126
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,960
that kinda have threw me for a loop
right

127
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,870
especially when I went back you to
rethink whose little bit startling

128
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:31,210
rate and I wanted over

129
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:34,770
a little bit to give myself a little
introduction on

130
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:38,479
so this is me and I have through this
picture I really apologize because

131
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,080
the picture that they put me on the
packing box website I think I look like

132
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,930
a zombie

133
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:46,940
so actually want to put a decent picture
up the UCI dollar completely terrible

134
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,740
all the time

135
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,970
so anyway you might know me from packing
cars act couple cars here and there

136
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,220
that's been in the news

137
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,789
I'm also a big on reverse engineering
GPS tracking devices

138
00:07:58,789 --> 00:08:01,819
you care about privacy and people's
ability to

139
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:05,030
by passing these new technologies are
seeing GPS

140
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:09,690
I also I give a talk at Black Hat
earlier this year by Aki roller coasters

141
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,880
which you can actually do remotely

142
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,970
interestingly enough because they're
buying them together

143
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:18,650
with this new concept a technology
called m2m machine to machine

144
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:22,360
ok getting that too into that a little
bit but I'm also very

145
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,530
well known for britain at fault on

146
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:30,660
but I'm not really can talk about that
much my new company is capital

147
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,729
consultants

148
00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:36,050
it's a think tank on security but not
just everyday security

149
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:39,449
not the security think when you put up
your laptop for your phone

150
00:08:39,449 --> 00:08:43,389
but security is of all we want a threat
model anything that may have an impact

151
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:44,209
on our

152
00:08:44,209 --> 00:08:48,370
our day-to-day business lives um and so
we focus generally on cellular

153
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,560
technology

154
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,149
because obviously that impacts a lot
more than just yourself on your computer

155
00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:58,970
it impacts everything that we do it's
not just the old brick that we used to

156
00:08:58,970 --> 00:08:59,850
see

157
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:03,270
being handed back and forth between two
people today it doesn't just mean your

158
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,580
smartphone either

159
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:07,950
there's a lot more to it

160
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:11,870
and it really means the future for all
of us and waterways

161
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:16,370
that's what I care about that's what we
care about as a company in CHD

162
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:19,830
is defining with this new thing is
what's this new thing that we're gonna

163
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,020
see

164
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,149
in technology and it's primarily gonna
be so you're

165
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:28,380
the cellular everything rate which is
what m2m is all about the Internet of

166
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,440
Things

167
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,910
okay the Internet of Things means I mean
through cellular module on whatever the

168
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:34,970
hell I want to

169
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:39,279
right whether it's going to be an ATM
machine or bird tree or whatever

170
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,970
there's going to be some way to interact
with that through some kind of a

171
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,839
long-range technology

172
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:48,029
and there's an astounding examples

173
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:51,440
%uh things they're changing today and

174
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,260
this is actually a perfect example to me
his people think I'm kidding around when

175
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,380
they say your trees gonna be sailor
enable

176
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:01,570
it's ridiculous right but not up we're
actually seeing changes in

177
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:05,339
and very interesting green friendly
ecologically friendly

178
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:09,940
technology that enables things that you
would never thought of being Wireless

179
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:14,360
to be Wireless the fallers is a very
good example that this is actually a

180
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,360
little bit longer than m2m technology

181
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:21,380
but is migrating from the old analog
technologies to cellular

182
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,490
and what it does is it allows people
that are birthing

183
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:28,529
forces to determine when a new fall

184
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:32,279
is actually coming out of the mother
ports because you can't sit around

185
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:35,959
you have no idea when this when this
baby is gonna come rain you can't stand

186
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:36,980
next to the worst holiday

187
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:40,160
is a farmer rancher you have other
things to do you want

188
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,240
you want to pay some fuel had to sit and
stare at worse inside when this worse

189
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,390
gonna give birth

190
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:49,110
if you've ever given birth to a coarser
helped with it

191
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:52,260
then you know that taking the horse out
if the mother is something that you

192
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,300
actually have to help with

193
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,640
it they can rarely do it on their own a
surprisingly you have to actually help

194
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,410
for us to get started you can kill the
mother and the child

195
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:05,430
so what they've done is they've actually
integrated wireless technology

196
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:10,880
into the horse to determine when that
four starts to breach

197
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,279
the birthing area you get a wireless
signal that signals sent

198
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,720
out to transponder which then connects
back out

199
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,510
to some receiving system now they're
enabling summer these technologies

200
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:26,860
over cellular we can actually get a
little text message in say

201
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,440
baby fall is starting to come here we go

202
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,740
that's really exciting to me because it
sees which shows

203
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:37,630
that we're actually starting to link our
physical world

204
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,730
in our technological world in ways that
we never would have thought up

205
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:44,660
you know even five years ago two years
ago and now it's not only

206
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,870
conceptualize but it's happened

207
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:51,010
naturally exciting stuff another good
example is tracking

208
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:54,230
house you would never think that you
need to track how

209
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:58,339
but they're learning a lot about the way
that animals are grazing

210
00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:02,880
by tracking them in the field and using
ZigBee dinner to $15.4 technologies

211
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,910
in the position of particular cow there
was actually written

212
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:10,950
but up the figure out the if they looked
at images

213
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:15,850
OVC house at certain times a day they
would all be aligned with magnetic north

214
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:19,320
and they had no idea why these animals
were aligned to magnetic north but they

215
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,279
all stand

216
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,470
together in the same direction it for if
you look at images from around the world

217
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:28,930
its you like way that's where the they
must all like staying in the same

218
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:29,850
direction

219
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:35,019
all the research allowed sciences to
determine that had nothing to do with

220
00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:38,329
them wanting to be cool in saying the
same way as the cool cow

221
00:12:38,329 --> 00:12:44,160
year had to do they were actually align
themselves with magnetic north

222
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,040
its year it's a real but the cool thing
is that we can see that with modern

223
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,250
technology

224
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:54,100
never would have been able to see that
five years ago ten years ago

225
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,149
now we can see that with m2m technology
so

226
00:12:57,149 --> 00:13:01,050
this is allowing us you miss that we
never would have

227
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:04,120
even Sep love for

228
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,050
years ago another excellent piece of
technology this is getting more into

229
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,529
security

230
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:13,430
is the shots other lot people when they
see this technology they think it's

231
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:18,450
it's actually what's the term i'm
looking for.

232
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:23,250
microwave it's not like with this is
actually a percussion receiver

233
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,709
so when you shoot a gun there's a
persevere

234
00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:30,170
K there's Bay percussion

235
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:36,320
what happens if you have a device that
catches that percussion occur

236
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,730
and then trying to elites the location
of the object

237
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:42,779
mid percussive sound

238
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:46,519
Paul's okay that's what shot spotter
does

239
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:50,890
so in the United States technology was
developed say we have too much crime

240
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:54,240
and Detroit for Saint Louis sir any
other given

241
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,600
big city in the United States the figure
how do we reduce crime

242
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,740
will be fun if we can enable the police

243
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,260
with another information where they
might be able to figure out where the

244
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,399
highest crime

245
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:11,050
areas are because some other people that
are affected by these

246
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:15,529
crimes in certain areas they don't
report it because they're scared

247
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:18,570
so the statistics are very misleading

248
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:21,750
in the shots water technology allows

249
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:26,310
police and investigators dispatchers to
understand not only

250
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:31,350
where is the shop occurring the
direction of where it's going

251
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:34,639
and whether the shooter is traveling so

252
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,760
with multiple shots Potter units you can
actually trying to late were a

253
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,880
particular individual

254
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:45,070
is that's making a gunshot and where
they're going as they're shooting

255
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:49,550
its exceptional technology and what's
even cooler is you can't define

256
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:52,990
what the particular device is that
meeting the percussive

257
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:57,940
polls so you know whether it's a
.45-caliber gun versus AK-forty seven

258
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:58,380
verses

259
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:03,220
and mp5 et cetera because you can't
differentiate those pulses

260
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:06,970
in factor in variables to determine
whether or not you can actually sets

261
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:10,560
yes this is a gun that I know

262
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,810
that is cool stuff in this is life
changing

263
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:17,970
world changing technology it all runs on
the cellular network

264
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:21,019
these are all wireless devices that are
naval

265
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:25,029
all over city which talk back to a
centralized servers so it's

266
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:29,100
a sensor unit connected to a cellular
model connected over a network

267
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,160
to backend system the process the
information you need

268
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,940
way great stuff

269
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,490
and of course you know when you bring up
and 20 already you always have to bring

270
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:41,000
its data

271
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,570
because they intersect so perfectly the
m2m a skater now almost becoming one

272
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:51,279
unified technology at this kid is love
you know its control

273
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,740
oil and gas systems are anything to do
with our physical energy

274
00:15:54,740 --> 00:16:00,040
based environments on m2n is the ability
to remotely control the SCADA systems

275
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:04,089
oversight lick so now it's not just some
computer sitting in

276
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:07,240
you know the quarter at a physical
location

277
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,300
oil refinery let's connect some other
network

278
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,970
that's receiving censored at now that
sensor debt is paid back to back and now

279
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,610
we're

280
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:19,279
in a completely different way over
cellular link that you can have

281
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,740
any engineer in the world if there's a
problem fan

282
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:26,930
solution because some guy that expert
you never would have a tax issue

283
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:30,610
Inc Waltham were wherever now has the
ability to

284
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:34,449
reaches your network and diagnose
whatever the problem is

285
00:16:34,449 --> 00:16:39,899
so that's very cool hackers was on Santa
way before anybody else wants

286
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:44,889
which is just mind-blowing to me it's
hilarious me to think that a movie

287
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:48,040
was doing this for everybody else but
it's true

288
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,459
the scene where he's actually I 0 cool K

289
00:16:51,459 --> 00:16:55,410
is hacking into your TV the television
network

290
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:59,029
I sure it's fantasy

291
00:16:59,029 --> 00:17:02,220
but that the reality of it is you can do
that

292
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:07,059
you can hack into and to enable
television network systems

293
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:12,000
actually surprisingly quite simply so
this is a big in technology from Harris

294
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,599
& Harris

295
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:17,110
course is defense consulting her defense
organization engineering firm

296
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:20,419
USF and other international but I think

297
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:24,139
anyway um the default is awesome piece
of equipment called

298
00:17:24,139 --> 00:17:27,459
again sell a transponder and essentially
what it is

299
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:31,389
is its tally phone technology but it's
its data

300
00:17:31,389 --> 00:17:34,669
so a lot of companies has have this
number showing their small

301
00:17:34,669 --> 00:17:37,759
because it's got the call this picture
but essentially what it does is it

302
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:41,239
IntraLinks one group of individuals
usually reporters

303
00:17:41,239 --> 00:17:44,979
for agents or even soldiers

304
00:17:44,979 --> 00:17:47,989
excuse me somewhere in in remote field

305
00:17:47,989 --> 00:17:51,269
over satellite no to an organization

306
00:17:51,269 --> 00:17:55,999
that central that can analyze the data
that's been coming from that team

307
00:17:55,999 --> 00:17:59,820
so what's actually occurring as we're
seeing increase usage in began

308
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,749
technology

309
00:18:00,749 --> 00:18:03,899
or other remote satellite enabled m2m
technology

310
00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:07,350
to broadcast reporters that are in

311
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:10,830
us Libya Syria anywhere in the Middle
East

312
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:14,559
or anywhere in Africa where the is a
decent uplink they're using pecan

313
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,129
technology to shoot

314
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:19,299
and upload their video streams to you

315
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:22,580
their home networks Fox CNN Reuters
whatever

316
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:25,619
okay now what do you think the weakest
link is

317
00:18:25,619 --> 00:18:30,009
especially for shooting life if they're
shooting live

318
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:34,029
from somalia rate in the peak and Lake

319
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:37,559
is probably like a five to 10 minutes
away

320
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:40,970
where do you think the biggest weakness
like is network that you have to

321
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:41,729
completely

322
00:18:41,729 --> 00:18:44,789
only every piece that to get some
computer systems

323
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:48,269
that run boxes broadcasting where the
big end link

324
00:18:48,269 --> 00:18:51,809
with the satellite channel that
facilitates the broadcast from the

325
00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:52,409
reporter

326
00:18:52,409 --> 00:18:55,850
uplink impact on Fox News matter

327
00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:02,019
satellite the m2m like is the weakest
piece the puzzle

328
00:19:02,019 --> 00:19:05,889
so it's entirely possible to date you
perform the same action

329
00:19:05,889 --> 00:19:09,609
also another cool thing is everybody
remembers the scene right

330
00:19:09,609 --> 00:19:12,859
because they're there you know pool on
the roof must have a leak

331
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:16,190
and certainly the sprinklers are going
up well in this movie they hacked the

332
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,350
sprinkler system

333
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:20,450
and suddenly it's pouring water on
because this guy decided

334
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:24,489
you is gonna you get revenge in some
girl detective welp

335
00:19:24,489 --> 00:19:28,570
the reality of it is yeah we can totally
do that we can do that today because

336
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:32,249
a lot of building piece of equipment for
buildings

337
00:19:32,249 --> 00:19:36,029
are designed to accept and 2 I'm so you
enable

338
00:19:36,029 --> 00:19:39,629
communication to control the entire
building from blading

339
00:19:39,629 --> 00:19:43,659
to you alarm systems to you security
functionality

340
00:19:43,659 --> 00:19:47,899
to you opening closing doors all
different kinds of pieces

341
00:19:47,899 --> 00:19:51,129
love now be you i'd

342
00:19:51,129 --> 00:19:55,419
under m2m and are over the United States
we're seeing these technologies

343
00:19:55,419 --> 00:19:59,549
enables and now these big huge panel
system that you normally see

344
00:19:59,549 --> 00:20:03,100
in a secure little box inside you know
some

345
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:07,580
office skyscraper in downtown San
Francisco they're getting quite small

346
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:11,369
all the fund

347
00:20:11,369 --> 00:20:16,049
it to a backend system were all you have
to do is hijacked the 2g

348
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:19,299
because GPRS isn't that difficult to
hack were right

349
00:20:19,299 --> 00:20:24,049
would be ac- you can easily intercepting
the communication

350
00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:28,869
because most these systems are not
capable SSL

351
00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:33,159
and the ones that are capable SSL if
you're using SSL

352
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:36,700
a small embedded system what's the
likelihood that you can always

353
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:40,669
the extra megabytes to put a route cache
on their

354
00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:44,499
so the actual SSL root certificates not
even on

355
00:20:44,499 --> 00:20:48,169
sure it's using a cell but I can't
verify any

356
00:20:48,169 --> 00:20:51,229
so the alarm systems that are writing
over the signal G

357
00:20:51,229 --> 00:20:57,109
from own so that's a reality

358
00:20:57,109 --> 00:21:01,399
obviously this is the bigger concern
right we're gonna cause a worldwide

359
00:21:01,399 --> 00:21:05,419
ecological disaster just to catch some
hacker kids

360
00:21:05,419 --> 00:21:11,059
yes because you can't do it the reality
is that this technology is

361
00:21:11,059 --> 00:21:14,820
also m2m enabled over

362
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,960
essentially long-range satellites Qaeda
links okay

363
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,989
this is another table began technology
but it uses Pro protocols

364
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:25,629
that have been authorized for maritime
use in with even more interesting about

365
00:21:25,629 --> 00:21:26,399
this

366
00:21:26,399 --> 00:21:29,739
the sadly systems that exist on the
boats

367
00:21:29,739 --> 00:21:33,009
are interconnected with ZigBee systems

368
00:21:33,009 --> 00:21:36,489
for oil refinery technology that sits on
actual boat

369
00:21:36,489 --> 00:21:41,169
as well so you have m2m technology
riding over began

370
00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:45,239
or whatever sailor for calling you have
in on the oil refinery ship

371
00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:49,440
or whatever station you actually have
back in connections to seek the air to

372
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,479
$15.4

373
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:54,429
so you can attack either over the same
network for over a year to 15 for

374
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:55,179
network

375
00:21:55,179 --> 00:21:58,989
both of which are written relatively
insecure and then

376
00:21:58,989 --> 00:22:02,029
you are able to compromise the ship's
controls

377
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:07,179
from that point NCIC database is another
great example the United States

378
00:22:07,179 --> 00:22:10,190
we use this to monitor and store data on

379
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:14,239
millions of Americans it's the criminal
database that uses

380
00:22:14,239 --> 00:22:17,840
the reality is here this is also
interlinked as well

381
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,700
great because laptops

382
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:25,409
in police cars are all back in anger
over cellular technology with

383
00:22:25,409 --> 00:22:26,259
interesting

384
00:22:26,259 --> 00:22:29,820
is that there now being connected with
sensors in the vehicle

385
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:33,059
so the sensors in the vehicle you know
like you know what's the pressure on the

386
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:33,999
brake systems

387
00:22:33,999 --> 00:22:38,499
are the I is the

388
00:22:38,499 --> 00:22:43,039
air pressure in the tires well what's
the video link say for the camera on the

389
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:43,649
dashboard

390
00:22:43,649 --> 00:22:46,799
police car all these aspects the bugle

391
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:51,029
are now back in through the site link
because they're all wirelessly enable

392
00:22:51,029 --> 00:22:55,220
again through m2m so I'm not even to get

393
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:58,489
the traffic stuff because you've got
enough examples already

394
00:22:58,489 --> 00:23:01,519
right at the end of the day

395
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:04,929
we've got tons technology here tons of
examples

396
00:23:04,929 --> 00:23:09,109
and their all completely different we
would never think that they could be

397
00:23:09,109 --> 00:23:09,720
owned

398
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,119
using one singular technology but they
are because

399
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:16,940
m2m the PRU protocols that are used for
cellular and

400
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:20,359
satellite m2m all the same

401
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:24,909
okay so if you're able to compromise one
link it's very likely will compromise

402
00:23:24,909 --> 00:23:29,979
similar links: so what is all these
different kinds of attacks Telus

403
00:23:29,979 --> 00:23:33,519
it tells us that laptops are no longer
the target

404
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:37,159
server system back in databases are no
longer the target

405
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:40,249
what this tells us that real hackers
hack

406
00:23:40,249 --> 00:23:44,929
in real hackers hack everything

407
00:23:44,929 --> 00:23:48,289
okay from the ATM to your cow

408
00:23:48,289 --> 00:23:51,859
to yeah

409
00:23:51,859 --> 00:23:57,169
to your cell phone too absolutely
everything real hackers hack

410
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:59,799
and what's interesting about real
hackers that act is that they're

411
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:01,719
extremely patient

412
00:24:01,719 --> 00:24:04,769
first yep yeah for you in here

413
00:24:04,769 --> 00:24:09,139
now I gotta give a shoutout yeah there
you are you that

414
00:24:09,139 --> 00:24:12,999
by minute

415
00:24:12,999 --> 00:24:16,749
very very good to me over the past few
years sorry to wear the shirt but I want

416
00:24:16,749 --> 00:24:18,799
to do some shots

417
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:24,119
but arm I wanted a virtual bit into real
hackers hacking

418
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:29,629
and do my little presentation
presentation talk

419
00:24:29,629 --> 00:24:34,440
so we're gonna switch mode bed

420
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:41,440
into a different presentation

421
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:53,150
and hopefully this all works alright so
this park is called Marjorie has an idea

422
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:56,990
and this is where real hackers that
comes in

423
00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:00,650
because he had a great idea the same who
else

424
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:03,950
disable your phone via Twitter anybody

425
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:07,429
I don't know that many followers so it's
probably okay couple guys back

426
00:25:07,429 --> 00:25:11,340
hey guys back do you remember me have a
conversation with Marjorie

427
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:14,480
ask weeks yeah

428
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,360
nobody's real data so I say that's a gap

429
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,690
that's a good thing a lot of the time
say less stupid stuff

430
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:27,799
anyway marcia this really interesting
point about SH

431
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:32,000
so open SSH as we all know and love

432
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,510
um has been hearted seriously over the
past six years right

433
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:39,559
I mean nobody would ever think that
somebody would come up with an openness

434
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:42,730
ish exploit let alone is your day got
rid

435
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:46,779
so March came up with this really
interesting idea

436
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:50,830
that of course

437
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:53,950
had been done but not publicly

438
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:57,120
so what he thought of was

439
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,120
what if we have it SSH server

440
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,500
what if people connect to the SSH server

441
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:07,039
but that SSH server doesn't care

442
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:10,490
and just accepts any key that what's

443
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:14,610
and what if instead of giving you a
shell

444
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:17,700
immediately props for your private key

445
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:22,159
it simulates oh this is a simulation
what it would look like if your password

446
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:27,679
requested for your private key on your
local system most people are probably

447
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:28,440
just gonna say

448
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,610
oh well life already authenticated to
the system whatever

449
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:35,390
I need to yet authenticated the system
they're not really thinking clearly at

450
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:38,350
that point to the usually just type in
the password too long about the day

451
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:41,909
well it was a really interesting point
because

452
00:26:41,909 --> 00:26:46,409
nobody had publicly said that before her
what if we do this

453
00:26:46,409 --> 00:26:50,210
that's a weird idea how about if we just
do this weird thing well

454
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:53,309
it was really cool my response to to
Marsh was

455
00:26:53,309 --> 00:26:56,720
and I apologize for I'm minutes whereas
damnit Marsh

456
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,230
because I was annoyed because this is
something that people have been

457
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:04,289
using is the trick for about 10 years
that nobody

458
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:08,669
ever talks about oddly enough so what
occurs is when you

459
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:13,799
dump in somebody's message server yes it
searches runs a program prompts you for

460
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:14,840
okay with you fred

461
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:19,110
alright thanks to private key now I'm
dropping to show up

462
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:22,539
so that seems a little bit ridiculous
rate

463
00:27:22,539 --> 00:27:25,620
because that seems like there are so
many other things that you would have to

464
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,470
go through

465
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:32,070
in order to make that valuable how would
you ever use that legitimately an actual

466
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:32,950
real-world attack

467
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:36,940
it sounds ridiculous would never work I
well

468
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:40,830
there are a lot of reasons why it's more
dangerous today than ever before

469
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:44,730
and I'm going to show you some demos
that will point out where you sleep

470
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:47,919
why this is such a whole areas funny
thing

471
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:52,090
March I wish you never would cell

472
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:56,630
the basis of this idea is that trusting
people is ridiculous

473
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:59,940
would you ever try anyone on the
Internet rate

474
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:03,510
you never do that you never trust a
person the reducing

475
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:06,740
SSH is always going to point out

476
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:10,080
your trusting the individual moxie

477
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,919
was very are well quoted recently in
saying the you can reduce

478
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,289
SSL if the client side

479
00:28:18,289 --> 00:28:22,809
implementing crypto to the client
trusting the server

480
00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:27,080
publickey because if the publicly

481
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:31,350
if the public no excuse me if the server
is shipping crypto algorithms

482
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:36,710
JavaScript for the quite XQ no web
browser its validating the public cert

483
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:40,559
up that server first saying okay well
I'm gonna use the script

484
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:46,860
now well you can reduce the entire
process too trusting the cert the server

485
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,889
we do the exact same thing SSH we don't
even realize

486
00:28:49,889 --> 00:28:53,279
but we're doing with humans

487
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:57,370
because you no longer trust the survey
which was the individual

488
00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:00,789
because the individual has to you
authenticate what

489
00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:05,669
the thirty because what occurs when
there's a mismatch

490
00:29:05,669 --> 00:29:10,630
the server key big huge here over the
stage blows up for Excel

491
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:14,710
scares everybody it says no you
shouldn't trust is key

492
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:20,530
maybe it's just a key change so it's
okay so that means that you are actually

493
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:23,899
trusting your users to do the crack
thing with their presented with the

494
00:29:23,899 --> 00:29:27,350
problem so what occurs

495
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:30,440
after that after that state well
transferred

496
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:35,950
a situation to mill which is a really a
situation to specific its NESH

497
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:40,760
in general that's used because you just
bypass whose if authentication

498
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:44,289
which is silly you should never trust
whose the server your

499
00:29:44,289 --> 00:29:48,820
a change in a husky but people do global
that's not necessarily interesting

500
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:52,399
but what we're gonna look at is why it
gets dangerous

501
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:56,030
okay so I can give you love them all

502
00:29:56,030 --> 00:30:03,030
use Linux Mint useless virginal
excitement

503
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:12,340
I'm going to you switch your hero

504
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,990
you'll have to excuse my slowness

505
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:23,760
I'm not the quickest guy when it comes
to computers

506
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:28,000
right

507
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,180
sup take a simple

508
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:36,980
a client mint is getting extremely
popular for desktops

509
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:40,180
noticing it more and more and more
andretti me

510
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:44,980
okay it's interesting because people can
deploy troops quickly

511
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:49,650
and you can actually help disperse quite
systems which makes a great if you have

512
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:51,440
a bunch developers engineers hanging out

513
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,050
so we can do is just launch up

514
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:59,130
minute sessions for everybody and give
them you know keys and do you think so

515
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:04,050
this is just a regular box nothin crazy
going on here

516
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:07,620
it's really standard but it's up to date
so what you'll notice

517
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:11,410
is that I have no identities my SAT Jan

518
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:14,940
you can see that pretty clearly
resolution kinda stinks

519
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:19,710
can people see good enough guys back say
no

520
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:26,160
move up front what's around on the front
anyway point is

521
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:31,330
we're gonna do a little SAT Jan okay
tool we all used before

522
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:35,330
we're gonna create a tape yesterday

523
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:39,700
in store that in RSH home directory
where the essays directory under

524
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:43,450
directory totally standard stuff rate
this is retarded but

525
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:49,850
looks over at so generator key

526
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:52,900
yeah we've got a key now

527
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:59,870
at this point you would do what low the
key into your aged

528
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:03,790
write a well yeah

529
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:07,300
already done I didn't do it

530
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,870
how did that happen anybody

531
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:16,740
what's occurring in the background is
will be launched a new session

532
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:20,590
meant or recent go to distributions
there's a key agents

533
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:26,900
that runs in the background without you
telling it to you and it just sits there

534
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:30,410
accepts any keys what's even more
interesting about this is that

535
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:34,180
autoload every single thing that and up
dot message

536
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:37,670
so every single key that ends up in that
directory

537
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:40,890
whether you put it there or not is auto
loaded

538
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:45,640
into the key management system so we
also note

539
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:49,310
is this is not a regular SH agent it is

540
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:52,470
but it's not it's actually managed by
something called key ring

541
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:56,360
you can see there's message
authentication socket right there

542
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,450
so it's actually being hijacked by Sir

543
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:02,960
separate application then is talking to
you message generally

544
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,350
so what I'm going to do now

545
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:10,090
is remove the files ball and siege

546
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:13,780
do anything special is in as new
identities

547
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:16,870
its auto adding or removing okay

548
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:21,980
so you're gonna do is just regenerate
the key

549
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:26,120
doesn't matter what key yeah there we go
19 a sitch

550
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:33,120
into a server would no in my production
network

551
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:49,650
so we'll do is we'll at this

552
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:05,730
so you know I don't have any other keys
this is the only key there so the key

553
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:07,149
that is generated is now

554
00:34:07,149 --> 00:34:11,389
on my server in production another
virtual machine here

555
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:15,109
okay now you'll notice

556
00:34:15,109 --> 00:34:19,099
whenever SSH into that server

557
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:24,200
yeah it's using message key there to
host which is why I saw their

558
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:28,470
just terrible get to that effect this is
a legitimate server which is debussy

559
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:31,869
and I'll show you here yeah

560
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:36,869
who dont be is required one-dot sell
that risk

561
00:34:36,869 --> 00:34:42,309
okay so this isn't is the server they
also have a second server here

562
00:34:42,309 --> 00:34:45,409
which is the transparent and the Middle
server this

563
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:49,559
years FreeBSD okay different operating
systems

564
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:53,819
I want that to be very specific will get
second so now I have

565
00:34:53,819 --> 00:34:56,849
my authentication key loaded the target
server

566
00:34:56,849 --> 00:35:01,450
okay so workers now we've got a second
lol

567
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:08,430
2nd L is that as a citizen

568
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:13,790
launches so just for clarity was good
log out

569
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:20,790
so as you can see from what I discussed
earlier

570
00:35:22,319 --> 00:35:25,339
for log back in message

571
00:35:25,339 --> 00:35:30,569
yeah there's a key fair trade as stage
back in a cluster

572
00:35:30,569 --> 00:35:34,349
thing going to the ballot server got to
go I'm there

573
00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:38,020
just like normal message stuff rate sup

574
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:45,020
what's very cool

575
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:48,790
is that message isn't forwarding is
getting more popular than ever

576
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:53,630
really important because

577
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:57,410
message forwarding is extremely
dangerous authentication forty is

578
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:58,700
probably the worst thing you can do

579
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:03,280
and we're seeing it everywhere now in
production because what people are doing

580
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,329
in order to secure

581
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:08,390
began production systems are staging is
are setting up a proxy server

582
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:12,270
they're telling other developers as this
agent proxy server

583
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:17,440
because it's secure and then from there
you can hop into any back-end system

584
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,119
that what

585
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:21,660
using authentication 40 because agents
are now picked

586
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:24,849
into all your puter desktops so book

587
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:29,040
there you go easy peasy everybody can do
it nobody's worried about

588
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,170
problems been out against the
transparent at so

589
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:36,420
all we do

590
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,530
is just sh2

591
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:44,230
what's that something that occurred

592
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:47,470
now just to make sure that we're running
one here

593
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:54,059
I'm going to remove the key for
legitimate server I'll get back into

594
00:36:54,059 --> 00:36:54,869
that later

595
00:36:54,869 --> 00:36:58,829
but for now for example sake we'll get
to that you know

596
00:36:58,829 --> 00:37:05,829
SH into the fixer

597
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:10,290
with authentication affording like I'm a
developer going it's my back in system

598
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:13,390
yeah area so now

599
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:16,850
as you can see welcome to NetBSD you
name

600
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:20,280
NetBSD into

601
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:24,250
my FreeBSD server there and there's don
t

602
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:27,680
and there's don t okay

603
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:34,680
sup

604
00:37:37,069 --> 00:37:44,069
most fun thing that you can do here is
obviously

605
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,319
when I start typing

606
00:37:46,319 --> 00:37:52,079
done transferred sir I can see it

607
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:57,559
and elsewhere write access to everything
that the individual does

608
00:37:57,559 --> 00:38:00,849
so now I cancer executing commands PS

609
00:38:00,849 --> 00:38:04,780
law you have tennis to all this other
crap

610
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:07,990
so now you essentially have access to
that server as that particular

611
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:08,770
individual

612
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:13,450
break r8 so transparent a salesman
middle

613
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:17,130
cool kinda been done before rate

614
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:24,130
so biggest part about this

615
00:38:25,589 --> 00:38:29,720
is one particular issue hasn't quite
been defeated

616
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:33,180
people bring this up all the time
because we have transparent man

617
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:37,569
middle in your forwarding people always
say well

618
00:38:37,569 --> 00:38:42,619
the only way they can get wrapped around
that are like easiest way that I can get

619
00:38:42,619 --> 00:38:43,230
around that

620
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:47,430
is if I do you SH at I force
confirmation id

621
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:50,799
so nothing firming that I just go to you

622
00:38:50,799 --> 00:38:55,480
foster

623
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:59,299
now it occurs is AC-one to

624
00:38:59,299 --> 00:39:02,339
instances for confirmation key

625
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:07,049
okay so obviously know that something
that has occurred because you're seeing

626
00:39:07,049 --> 00:39:08,569
of education occurred twice

627
00:39:08,569 --> 00:39:12,480
you should never see that occur if
you're attacking somebody

628
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,859
are you never let them see some
something like that occurring because

629
00:39:15,859 --> 00:39:16,660
it's complete

630
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:20,420
blow your cover you know that they have
requested

631
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:23,809
your of education occurred twice so you
know that more than one system is likely

632
00:39:23,809 --> 00:39:24,869
using that token

633
00:39:24,869 --> 00:39:28,040
more than once using took improperly

634
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:33,630
so there's a solution and the solution

635
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:37,020
is looking at design call SSH

636
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:40,460
so will SH

637
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:45,359
is very simple

638
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:52,359
just launches different things

639
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:05,380
and apparently was working in the room
but it's not now for obvious reasons

640
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:08,430
so script

641
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:11,520
naco sup

642
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:16,089
switching servers now if I S H in

643
00:40:16,089 --> 00:40:20,880
wants now using

644
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:26,150
special code I can trigger it it to
performing authentication affording

645
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:29,270
with out using the key multiple times

646
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:34,240
which is supposedly impossible rate work

647
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,579
because every single time that the
server requires authentication

648
00:40:37,579 --> 00:40:42,140
it offers SSH identity I'm sorry a siege
session ID

649
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:45,529
which unique because the public key
security

650
00:40:45,529 --> 00:40:49,750
I should never know with the identity is
another particular server

651
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:53,480
because I can't encode correct right

652
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:56,950
so I can pretend to be another server if
I don't have that's a risky

653
00:40:56,950 --> 00:41:00,510
so I can't just hand often do like a
passive and middle

654
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:04,490
there has to be some special sauce there
but you can't tell

655
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:07,789
where this is coming from so it's really
important to notice

656
00:41:07,789 --> 00:41:11,940
that whenever using a sick an occasion
for dick and this occurs

657
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:15,190
notice what's not being shown you

658
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:18,270
can you see which server

659
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:22,190
is requesting the authentication token

660
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:25,619
that challenge you can it's not provided

661
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:29,200
the information is completely
transparent to the user so you get that

662
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:29,910
once

663
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:33,099
and there you go

664
00:41:33,099 --> 00:41:36,180
it's the same thing watch

665
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:40,099
yes 0 now I've control

666
00:41:40,099 --> 00:41:47,039
very simple it's getting even more
dangerous on embedded systems because

667
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:48,880
we're seeing more and more embedded
systems

668
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,529
performing this kind of thing so

669
00:41:52,529 --> 00:41:58,520
everybody's going to say well

670
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:02,020
the next big issues talking

671
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:06,119
right services okay well dont I can lock
my agent

672
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:10,630
that's true you can like a region except
for one mean thing

673
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:14,579
running at a time here so I'm not gonna
start describing what its lock

674
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:19,470
doesn't quite work when you say is this
SSH locking it doesn't work for two

675
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:20,069
reasons

676
00:42:20,069 --> 00:42:23,670
number one liking your SSH agent occurs

677
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:27,170
after you've already handed off you're
talking to a server so the server

678
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:28,260
authenticates you

679
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:32,150
and fed only afterwards to you at the
chance to lock your

680
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:35,490
your actual agent okay so

681
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:39,480
there's a window of time between when of
when the server authenticates you

682
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:44,220
and you have the ability to lock if
there's a command executed by the server

683
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,569
within that window of time

684
00:42:45,569 --> 00:42:48,990
the server can then harvest other tokens
or whether they want to

685
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:52,420
attack your agent do whatever the once
within that when you have time

686
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:56,599
you have no ability to control that
because the server defines when that

687
00:42:56,599 --> 00:42:57,270
session

688
00:42:57,270 --> 00:43:02,230
starts to go from authenticated into a
shell and because

689
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:05,700
you can't do that in parallel you can't
tell your agent

690
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:09,640
I only want to accept one token only one
token

691
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:13,779
is going to be allowed to pass through
washer only one tokens gonna be a lot

692
00:43:13,779 --> 00:43:14,599
passed through

693
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:17,650
that software isn't even written in to
open a sage

694
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:20,980
write a but even if it were

695
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:24,029
you wouldn't matter because you say
morning and allow

696
00:43:24,029 --> 00:43:27,180
one talking to be authenticated I

697
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:31,230
just showing you that I can do with only
one toke just like a regular server

698
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:36,210
but doing transparent little so you
still can't lock

699
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:39,779
and if you do you actually executed
message lock

700
00:43:39,779 --> 00:43:43,869
the individual takes control

701
00:43:43,869 --> 00:43:47,920
spirit server has the ability to brute
force the lock and I wrote a message

702
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:48,849
code

703
00:43:48,849 --> 00:43:53,869
in actually I'm a negative penitentiary
this time running out of time

704
00:43:53,869 --> 00:43:59,910
but essentially years ago

705
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:03,920
it's all girl lines of code

706
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,539
its 481 lines this is basically

707
00:44:07,539 --> 00:44:10,839
agent before sir in that spirit for
Ceres and password

708
00:44:10,839 --> 00:44:14,250
forcing but also in Jax and extracts

709
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:17,410
keys in command cetera from CT

710
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:24,410
sup the entire point to this

711
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:29,980
is that software that we are using today
you still can trust

712
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:33,650
rate everybody trusts open SSH given
certain parameters

713
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:37,630
there's absolutely no reason why you
never trusted message people so yeah

714
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:39,240
yeah yeah done but

715
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:43,020
use of forgetting that you have to
authenticate the house yes that's true

716
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:46,730
but there's actually one specific
instance where their is

717
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:50,779
went you have a significant opportunity
to attack people

718
00:44:50,779 --> 00:44:55,289
that even trust their hosts servers and
and the administrators

719
00:44:55,289 --> 00:44:58,680
in that's ECDs a

720
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:02,150
in this is extremely simple trick this
is not a real active again

721
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:05,579
we're talking about hacking right the
simplest hack

722
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:09,009
that gets you in is the wind in this is
the wind

723
00:45:09,009 --> 00:45:13,339
right everybody switched over to use
EDSA which caused millions of servers

724
00:45:13,339 --> 00:45:14,270
worldwide

725
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:17,490
to suddenly generated ECDs Acer

726
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:22,130
that nobody pre authenticated said no
I'm gonna grab the actual

727
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:25,329
key that was generated on my new server

728
00:45:25,329 --> 00:45:29,759
because what happens is you see it ECDs
a is now being the one that's offer to

729
00:45:29,759 --> 00:45:30,710
the client

730
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:34,990
and individual says oh man I'm you
accept this because I know that I just

731
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:38,150
updated I just updated easy yes a code

732
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:41,859
and this can generate the new server an
offer to

733
00:45:41,859 --> 00:45:44,960
so there's a window where now a lot of
people there

734
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,779
updating or changing from idiocy EDSA

735
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:52,250
they just automatically accept oh yeah
it's an update no problem I'm just going

736
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:56,500
to accept that key because I know it
should have been changed

737
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:01,480
right and that of course is the perfect
time to implement this kind of attack

738
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:05,680
if you have the ability to you only one
key

739
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:10,910
or requested he only wants been
absolutely nobody has any clue otherwise

740
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:16,230
only way to determine whether or not
that is a problem

741
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:20,750
is whether or not you're on source IP if
the client

742
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:24,240
let's connect for is still valid

743
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,329
but their waste change that if you are
covered agency

744
00:46:27,329 --> 00:46:31,259
you have a server sitting in line
somebody's ice in Fort both the

745
00:46:31,259 --> 00:46:35,000
source this nation for the source and
the destination the process

746
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,529
the IP connectivity which allows you to
take over the entire thing transparently

747
00:46:39,529 --> 00:46:43,859
and simulate both client and server
right keys to be completely transparent

748
00:46:43,859 --> 00:46:47,520
is entirely to legitimate so is EDSA

749
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,400
is probably the best when you attack and
what's really important note:

750
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:56,160
is that the CBSA the news keys whenever
there's a new protocol or a new key here

751
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:56,700
to type

752
00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:00,359
came from in SH it's not signed by the
previous keys

753
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:04,349
so you don't get like the trusted or say
server key that you've been using

754
00:47:04,349 --> 00:47:07,390
for you know ten years it's not signing
the deal

755
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:11,680
yes a ECDs a key and saying you trust
this now

756
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:16,529
it's just offering in duties EDS icky
you accept it or you don't

757
00:47:16,529 --> 00:47:19,549
there's no further validation except the
user

758
00:47:19,549 --> 00:47:23,119
themselves is deciding to authenticate
or not

759
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:27,609
so again as a sick is to you the
individual

760
00:47:27,609 --> 00:47:32,250
sup when timing is right act is
extremely simple

761
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:35,849
when timing is right even the most
secure technologies

762
00:47:35,849 --> 00:47:39,789
become extremely weak because users
don't know what to do

763
00:47:39,789 --> 00:47:43,660
and when you tell them to expect
something

764
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:47,440
is yes he is coming if you see a cheeky
change its cool

765
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,440
that's when we see failures and this
works

766
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:55,079
unbelievably well especially in
engineering firms when you read team and

767
00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:56,480
testing

768
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,829
okay sup

769
00:47:59,829 --> 00:48:04,779
02 doesn't just mean some million
exploit that's taking you three months

770
00:48:04,779 --> 00:48:08,480
to get right okay 0 day sometimes means

771
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:13,329
the simplest dumbest thing that you can
do to get you the way it

772
00:48:13,329 --> 00:48:16,740
in these are simple Tom techniques

773
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:20,220
okay I mean people have discussed

774
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:25,049
transfer and a six-man the middle since
1988

775
00:48:25,049 --> 00:48:28,849
right but nobody talks about it today
because it's been saw

776
00:48:28,849 --> 00:48:32,930
that's not true we need to keep telling
our users over and over

777
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:36,089
that real instances security breaches

778
00:48:36,089 --> 00:48:40,739
will occur if they do not understand the
risks involved

779
00:48:40,739 --> 00:48:43,829
when you technologies deployed

780
00:48:43,829 --> 00:48:47,920
sup gonna switch back

781
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:54,920
here

782
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:06,230
to the normal presentation

783
00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:13,490
and we'll give you one last piece have
fun before we move on to the next talks

784
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:14,420
on a quick

785
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:18,730
setup crash and burn scene where
everybody's hanging out at the end been

786
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:20,970
happy because they hacked planet right

787
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:25,050
they're sitting here using what their
hacking using again

788
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:29,810
m2m technology okay so the reality this

789
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:35,470
is something called

790
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:39,660
notion this is really fun this great
although toy to play around with

791
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:43,590
in ocean is is reporting Rd its wireless
but its green

792
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:47,560
its Eagle friendly meaning that it
actually receives battery power

793
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:53,390
harvested from regular ambient light
where the singles

794
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:57,010
okay so it's really cool in ocean
actually enables

795
00:49:57,010 --> 00:50:00,290
you know environmental lighting
environmental control

796
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:03,490
just like you would see would seek be
but it's way more eco-friendly like I

797
00:50:03,490 --> 00:50:04,030
mentioned

798
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:07,030
so is becoming extremely popular
especially the EU

799
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:10,060
on its really easy interacts with in
fact the

800
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:14,000
they try to keep their the details up
there protocols pride

801
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,930
right a but you have to pay for it

802
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:21,080
and what's really funny about that is in
the United States there's

803
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:25,080
something called SEC where everybody has
to file for an SSE

804
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:29,200
FCC authentication authorization like
your RF product

805
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,920
has surpassed SEC standards and you have
to submit all this information to them

806
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:37,250
well the thousands of dollars that you
would normally have to pay

807
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:41,430
for one of these pieces documentation
you can just browse the SEC website

808
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:44,970
look notions at sea on authorizations

809
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:48,350
and see like 0 other user data is
actually filed

810
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:52,300
in here publicly for you to consume
seeking bypass spending thousands of

811
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,650
dollars on the documentation

812
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:56,700
go straight to the SEC he gives you all
the details

813
00:50:56,700 --> 00:51:01,010
about the protocol how to interact with
it so it's just ask modulation

814
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:04,820
so these details are actually in
Wikipedia to the doctor that is 315

815
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:06,470
makers need 68.3

816
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:10,630
on but the cool thing about this is that
if you have a really nice antenna

817
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:13,630
you actually point at all the winners a
building

818
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:17,510
and then just send everybody turn up

819
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:20,960
where everybody turn off or turn on only
certain lights because they actually

820
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,130
have ID's

821
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:25,880
so you can see 0 third floor five went
fifth win over

822
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:30,840
that room has ID 127 K the next room
over zaidi 128

823
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:34,740
and you figure out which ones just by
evaluating our society can determine

824
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:35,540
where

825
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:39,460
the likelihood that ship is in physical
space

826
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:42,740
and then BAM you've got the ability to
use are playing around with specific

827
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:43,280
Windows

828
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,460
dura is another company that is enabled

829
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:49,850
building technology so the integrated
ocean

830
00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:53,250
were in ocean I to you

831
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:56,420
provide wireless RF technology for
entire buildings skyscrapers

832
00:51:56,420 --> 00:52:00,810
Center which is pretty exciting stuff I
in this is the data format which is

833
00:52:00,810 --> 00:52:02,160
straight from the FCC

834
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,520
this stuff you would be able to get
without paying money so

835
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,980
it shows you the exact data format so
now

836
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:12,020
you don't even have to do a lot research
what most people do

837
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:15,120
when they look into new technologies
like this is they have to purchase the

838
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:15,940
technology

839
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:19,580
they go out and purchase the ocean ocean
our developer kits a

840
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:23,850
for like five thousand dollars I mean by
the licensing technology or whatever to

841
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:24,560
implement

842
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:29,230
the demo I and then you that will have
access to the documentation tools

843
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:30,110
reproduce this

844
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:34,870
what's awesome is that now we have the
ability to this exact same thing

845
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:38,450
from anywhere from fifteen to fifty
dollars thanks to you

846
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:42,150
one awesome hacker named helpless and
Travis Goodspeed a couple other guys

847
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:42,780
that

848
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:46,970
assisted with the excuse me rfk projects
up

849
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:51,730
RF cat is the sub gigahertz networks
with

850
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:56,040
Swiss Army Knife essentially this is
really cool stuff because for

851
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:59,580
a couple bucks you can buy a little
where the Stonewall with the whip

852
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:00,370
antenna

853
00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:04,410
you get pretty decent on ability to
transmit on it

854
00:53:04,410 --> 00:53:08,050
you transit for about you know fifty to
a hundred feet a

855
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:12,470
in distance so it allows you to you a
lot of interesting research

856
00:53:12,470 --> 00:53:15,730
for like dollars so it's cool

857
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:19,100
is there you can integrate the data that
you find online

858
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:22,750
other SEC about notions packet
technology

859
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:27,380
and you can take it around the city in
KL in start sniffing for these packets

860
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:32,430
without ever having to get a demo system
from an ocean which is incredible

861
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:36,430
Friday because used to Rick of thousands
of dollars today cost anywhere from $15

862
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:37,350
to $50 USD

863
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:40,400
and crap you know the ability

864
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,690
to interact with entire building
automation systems

865
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:47,230
the never would have been able to touch
before or because the brilliant

866
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:51,960
m2m that's exciting sup

867
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:56,600
sup overall

868
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:00,520
hacking has absolutely nothing to do
with latest most complex

869
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:04,960
most you know incredible thing that
people have done to date

870
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,960
its awesome when we see exceptional
technology deployed like

871
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:11,470
the party guys in the other I was dream
team

872
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:14,620
those guys are like ther their heroes
right because they're awesome they're

873
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:15,700
incredible

874
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:19,130
but at the same time hacking doesn't
have to mean

875
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:22,910
doing such complex time consuming things
sometimes hacking

876
00:54:22,910 --> 00:54:26,130
means understanding all the technology

877
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:30,660
well enough that you could implement the
simplest most effective attack

878
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:34,770
in the shortest amount of time that to
me is what real

879
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:38,580
packing its getting the solution and
timely fashion

880
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:43,800
okay so overall yet they're going to be
some bad guys

881
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:47,500
they're gonna be bad guys out there tell
you that cert is wrong

882
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:50,830
that we should be working on Saturday
technology and we should be doing

883
00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:54,160
anything dangerous for the information
security community

884
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:58,150
but the fact is we need your day we need
people are sitting Ron

885
00:54:58,150 --> 00:55:02,340
with lame laptops looking echoed in
finding simple things to do

886
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:07,780
because dumb old tricks like message can
scream and the Middle

887
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:11,670
are real and they will be used in the
future

888
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:15,170
as you know these attacks become more
popular again and the next time that

889
00:55:15,170 --> 00:55:15,860
there's a kind

890
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:18,950
instance where SHS a new key type

891
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:22,480
it may be used again and we need to
understand that there are scenarios

892
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:25,490
that we need to relate to our users to
ensure that there aren't

893
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:29,070
with the knowledge to make sure they're
not going to be compromised by the

894
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:31,230
stupid simple tricks

895
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:34,600
because let's face it any bombs bill in
idaho

896
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:39,620
can get hacked by a kid like this and
we're seeing all over the place today

897
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:43,210
segal inject low sec anonymous

898
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:46,370
Public Law its everywhere it's not going
away

899
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:50,220
ever and that's why we need to talk
nonstop about these issues

900
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:57,220
thanks so much for having

901
00:56:05,029 --> 00:56:06,779
this

902
00:56:06,779 --> 00:56:13,779
sleep
