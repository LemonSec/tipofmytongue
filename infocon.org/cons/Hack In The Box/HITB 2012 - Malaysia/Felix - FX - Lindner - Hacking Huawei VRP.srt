1
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:10,860
up

2
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,299
sky

3
00:00:12,299 --> 00:00:14,250
space

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:21,250
skills

5
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,180
arm yeah this is about

6
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:32,160
I'm Houari writers and what we found
when we looked at them

7
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,480
Sam throughout the slights you will

8
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,590
you have those sections lights dad
hunting strings from the actual binaries

9
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,980
from just for to show

10
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,000
how much amusement we had looking at
those devices

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,090
Sam let's start

12
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,600
essentially from why don't we look at
who are we from

13
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,040
some love you know dad I was hacking
Cisco for over a decade

14
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:02,230
I'm that good old you never learned and
so

15
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:05,350
they actually did middle from

16
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:09,570
bed nowadays through the second-largest
telecommunications vendor worldwide

17
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:14,039
is swallowing and its so much of our
Internet infrastructure now depends on

18
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:14,410
them

19
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:17,490
dead I thought well we shall back to
take a look

20
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,939
on devices in you know have a PR

21
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:24,820
so when you when you look at the company
it's pretty large company did

22
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,280
have like over 150 thousand employees
arm

23
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,189
three sections our temple networks
global services and devices did

24
00:01:33,189 --> 00:01:37,850
must if you probably know accuse be
sticks and stuff the Global Services

25
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:38,310
Group

26
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,810
arm essentially operates home many of
the networks that run along the

27
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:43,420
equipment

28
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:47,450
and we will see why the late Sarah

29
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:50,590
this is Alton this is stuff to do so you
can see them

30
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:53,670
do you have like to full product range
from

31
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,780
of should tackles you read by word

32
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:01,229
you know prevented from buying from
byrds

33
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:04,960
we're looking at is actually do you what
they called the data communication

34
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,430
equipment so the rocks

35
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:09,750
dues to major arm major branches of

36
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,019
from serious still and network engine

37
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:17,690
serious threats to taken psych stuff NDA
are serious

38
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:21,239
it's more like your home routers were
branch of its routers

39
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:26,640
um like smaller devices arm there's also
more we 3.com

40
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,430
which is another company were used to be
another company dad

41
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,500
was actually acquired by HP 70

42
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,520
from we didn't know that for a talk at
DEFCON

43
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,260
and from yeah had to have to find out
wide

44
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,230
HP people were all freaking out over us
because we're lazy we talk about what we

45
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,519
wear what's your problem

46
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,599
so they actually sheer

47
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:51,989
from some code base would worries so for
now

48
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:55,760
arm and actually already provided
testing equipment

49
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,129
an interesting joint venture from the
past them

50
00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:03,860
whose worrisome Antec what can possibly
go from

51
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,209
and I'm obviously dance this joint
venture

52
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:10,580
spot exist anymore am Sam

53
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:14,790
when it comes to practice your team arm
we

54
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:18,330
you know I'm for the deaf can talk we
went to their website and try to figure

55
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,510
out late okay so

56
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:24,150
oh here's a link product security yeah
the country and like long boner

57
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,989
dad how important this is by do was not
actually

58
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:32,560
the product security visible to the
outside by now I know that they actually

59
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,390
have one

60
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:38,129
am bed in our big day never deal dealt
with hackers before so there was some

61
00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:43,099
any from any information in following
orders come talk to publish December

62
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:44,870
security practices paper

63
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:49,159
talks about their suffering security
practice cycle arm

64
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:54,080
in solicitor not entirely sure they talk
about the same company

65
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,540
am Sep

66
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:01,030
as I said the security handling arm is
now

67
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:04,860
afternoon um are def come talk a little
bit more visible so

68
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,220
do is actually a product security
incident response team now

69
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:12,189
and there's contacts and knows BBC

70
00:04:12,189 --> 00:04:15,489
if you find what we all day you cannot
to let them know

71
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:19,739
am the product security advisory

72
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:23,479
strategy is still not what I consider

73
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:27,470
industry best practice because it
provided only for customers

74
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:31,320
I actually wonder how they know who
their customers is hard because

75
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,669
we buy drivers is some reseller

76
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:37,960
and I don't think to keep track of you
know who buys routers

77
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,430
am so we were provided with arm

78
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:45,310
preview worsens of the advisories to you
to box word

79
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:48,930
will be discussing your am in PDF format

80
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:52,040
anyone else feeling funny when you get a
Chinese PDF

81
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,970
am sec am

82
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,360
you're not dead down may be morbid
movement

83
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,150
weird from Sam didn't do you

84
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:07,500
product security patches are not really
easy

85
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,530
to to tell on this offer so it's really
hard

86
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:13,840
to know if you have a viable so far not
am

87
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,100
and there is a uk-based why we Cyber
Security Centre dad

88
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:23,570
on according to their own statements
activity on its why we called

89
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:26,789
maybe am as you can see

90
00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:30,150
by desist two days ago this is the work
in progress

91
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:34,380
so the website now how's a security
advisory sections

92
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,690
contents upcoming

93
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:41,820
Sam let's talk about European your be

94
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,850
is the first I routing platform am do

95
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:48,199
is multiple branches known and from

96
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:51,800
by now I would 'em when a clear up this
does move

97
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,139
about why we having storms is growing
less

98
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:59,600
man no body parts shipped Cisco is happy
if they can compile it for their own

99
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,949
machines

100
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:04,100
so it it was very unlikely from the
start

101
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,150
so according to Cisco's League arm

102
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:11,030
documents am the problems in school had

103
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:15,319
mostly was dad the Enhanced IGRP code
was

104
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:18,639
heartbeat but im including box

105
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,750
them and someone react to try to make
this your life

106
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,860
command line interface look the same way
as Cisco some people would not need to

107
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,400
learn new shit

108
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,440
I'm unfortunately some lame house

109
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,440
been decided 10 that no means did
documentation actually looks like

110
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,979
our documentation copycat so

111
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:43,130
dad apparently was the only good from am

112
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:47,389
in its own settle so what we deal with
today is your P three and five

113
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:50,970
Witcher VX real I am weeks work space

114
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:54,620
from respectively three in five the
ex-works

115
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:59,550
from according to from some messages I
received from where we

116
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:03,300
d DVR p5 is a large refried

117
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:08,099
am and we will see about that am I've
also seen references to have your p

118
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:11,740
aid but I have absolutely no idea what
it is

119
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:15,400
Sam when you when you find file it looks
like this

120
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,460
two sons force which so you have to
platform did you have to be RP

121
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:23,080
in this case 52 52 and then some

122
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,780
digits and numbers generally don't make
sense

123
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:31,270
in Enders also from different names that
you can find itself around so

124
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:36,210
for OEM's it's called home where and
sometimes it's called VXL as

125
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:40,479
and you know I'm him different names

126
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,330
sound thanks to you to you two brilliant

127
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:49,710
from man age 21 I actually have some
solid eight up on

128
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,750
from how diversions a distributed so you
can see Dad

129
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,349
5.5 is by far to most use worsen

130
00:07:56,349 --> 00:07:59,770
23 serious it's also still around

131
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,819
and then I grouped am today die

132
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:06,449
half which is like a hundred thirty's I
wasn't IP addresses

133
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:09,629
plus worsen information arm

134
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:13,220
into did equipment and what you will see
is

135
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,900
home did more to switchers because

136
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,740
gonna to you then it switches am what
you see then

137
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,849
is its all large-scale tackling
equipments

138
00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:27,000
thinks that filled an entire rack

139
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,270
um that is because DVD financial
difference the cost difference between

140
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:35,579
large sis Commission March worry machine

141
00:08:35,579 --> 00:08:38,770
is the greatest so shoes the incentive

142
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:43,930
buying is because d quit minted costs
you shitload of money

143
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:47,290
suddenly gets significantly cheaper
answer

144
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:52,200
%um it's good for the bottom line India
in the stock market good

145
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,370
and everything else there is so good for
mankind

146
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:01,000
am some when %um when you wanna do you
wouldn't with a writer's wave

147
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,250
what you're looking at is standard
interfaces that every router Housley

148
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:09,370
command line interface through SSH
Telnet console

149
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:12,430
web-based configuration netcom as an MP

150
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:15,740
tenders some weird stuff by d

151
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:19,870
branch intelligent management system
bins

152
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:23,510
from n if you're determined sums really
funny

153
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:26,519
am SEM and this is actually

154
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:30,540
arm laker client-side system so you can
triggered

155
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,589
by DHCP and then it goes out to you be
pimps

156
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:39,980
server I am the only 1i could find a
factory made by HP

157
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,029
in and gets additional configuration
settings

158
00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:46,040
my are different DNS server

159
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:50,589
whatever the language settings for
tissue

160
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:55,320
ard you considers to Chinese or English

161
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,880
in here comes the reason why everyone
house why would people operator

162
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,380
track because Deepak functionality if
you ever to set up a network that is

163
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,589
bigger than one writer

164
00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:08,440
you know that you need two documents you
know debug ID sex barred

165
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,570
executive reports so in order to do that
you turn on debug commands

166
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:17,779
but you don't see shit because there are
only available in Chinese

167
00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:24,640
that's pretty good strategy if you're
selling professional services acting

168
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,470
so once your im in a speaks English to
you

169
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:32,290
am you find from you find

170
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:35,730
couple levels of hidden commands the
most important is

171
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:39,440
underscore and a score back to you gets
you

172
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,269
into developer commands are quite useful
for

173
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:46,390
Export Development and then depending on
a platform

174
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:51,610
you half you know special diagnosis
commands to duty wanna password

175
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:54,870
always try to vendor name vendor name is
usually one

176
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:58,089
with passwords so in this case once more
with

177
00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:02,019
Freecom

178
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:07,200
when we look at dimensions

179
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,220
you can download em actually from from
the website do some

180
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:14,160
authorization process involved I have no
idea how that works because I don't have

181
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,110
legal account

182
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:21,040
am so essentially in order to get to the
image is the easiest way is simply by

183
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,740
runners because default configuration to
come up would

184
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:29,050
have to pee sir and you can instantly
have to be damaged

185
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:32,250
and in your you have the image Sam

186
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,450
that's what we did because it's not
illegal

187
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:39,060
am and and you look at the image format

188
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:44,450
to hackers in indeed image formats
differ greatly between platforms

189
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:48,990
its it's actually fun game it usually
takes just a couple of hours to

190
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:53,110
first formant am but it's really
interesting

191
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:56,529
from I was wondering if to maybe have an
internal competition

192
00:11:56,529 --> 00:12:00,450
on creativity in you know handling of
Fine Arts

193
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:04,100
so when you didn't you

194
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:08,350
would you have is different archive
formats all look alike

195
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:12,260
from home Chan builds grandchildren of
top

196
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:16,670
ride do ralph reed worsens hard some way
or the other

197
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,860
we haven't found any cryptographic
protections

198
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,110
which doesn't mean that there are none
from

199
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:28,910
I just haven't seen Ford for really
small devices you get one binary

200
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:33,560
out to be good advice gets the more
stuff in cinders

201
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:38,230
like to any from in forty like to be
tapping machines

202
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:41,410
the load 256 different find some
different

203
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:45,940
reports arm para pc what have you

204
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:50,000
also decompression algorithms from
greatly Mary

205
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,579
energy anyone remember AG from the 90's

206
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:56,760
really love using energy we have seen

207
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,800
7-zip deflated what's really funny

208
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,430
outside ass am because we couldn't
conference

209
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:08,730
summer after summer images in really
didn't find decompression coat

210
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:12,660
I'm to know from my coworker Greg points
other

211
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:16,410
welp disc you speaks IP sec

212
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:20,680
so it needs to do decompression so maybe
that's what they use

213
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,320
some point for well I have my key
compression implemented I could use that

214
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,620
for the images

215
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,850
come can be done fight so when you on
Pacha

216
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:35,990
some of those archives have descriptions
to the individual files

217
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:38,990
dis is like to dance

218
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:43,120
third column here it's that description
as actually in file

219
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,000
so you see that their developers are as
lazy as someone else

220
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,839
because they didn't put any description
some

221
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:54,740
and you see that you have variety of
interesting stuff

222
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:58,440
in there so

223
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,470
am in terms of hardware this is all
power PC based

224
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:06,760
said this morn boxes from you're 18

225
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,350
Aidan that type stuff am

226
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,560
a pretty similar to shared memory
routers um

227
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,839
from Cisco or anyone else right tunes

228
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:20,480
you know little and then it device add
bigger ones

229
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,930
are more mike d Biggar our platforms

230
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:27,560
modular from Saudi to carry

231
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,339
additional code for chipsets in

232
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:35,190
and yes am and what have you and and be

233
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:38,779
platforms actually really interesting
arm

234
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:42,430
an I'm gonna look into them more because
the user ID empower

235
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:47,600
NP network processors do classification
encapsulation

236
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,860
that type of stuff in hardware and get
programmed in

237
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:54,269
decal code which and whatever does

238
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:57,769
in peace then dude gets handed over to
the application Cebu

239
00:14:57,769 --> 00:15:03,649
this is how you get performances to use
isn't very smart design for their backs

240
00:15:03,649 --> 00:15:07,160
but it gets more complicated to bigger
box

241
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,470
sim what default service to wear usually

242
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:14,019
by default with the with the smaller
boxes like

243
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:17,430
with OtterBox you have as age enough to
be open

244
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:21,110
would two small boxes you also have HTTP

245
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:24,180
I'm for what management based management

246
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:27,310
you often see town it's XLT

247
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:30,449
is very common interesting some

248
00:15:30,449 --> 00:15:33,880
branches of Europe's also automatically
load

249
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:38,389
arm h323 codes and open like 10 ports

250
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:41,820
from what can possibly go from and

251
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:45,839
its age 323 is really easy to parse

252
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,730
from them fired at home am

253
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:54,240
the the functionality that you can
disable default services

254
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,570
is relatively new so even into you from

255
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:02,300
in the security advisories that we saw
am 44 older platforms

256
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,449
actually from older customers to use

257
00:16:05,449 --> 00:16:08,880
ACLs to block traffic to port 80

258
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,009
because you can turn off towards

259
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:15,040
and as I said bins -ism his client some

260
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,600
government good quality

261
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,630
am you find a shitload every
implementations front instead

262
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:27,889
we actually don't use in the century
anymore so

263
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:32,250
from everyone seems to have their own
implementation of men copy

264
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:36,930
do is variations of string copied or
really interesting

265
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:40,649
from and so for example the number of

266
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:44,380
calls to sprint half need to reassess

267
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,779
function is actually a linear function

268
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:51,279
over device price so bigger damaging

269
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,720
mourns products so 42 for small

270
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:00,040
34 European weird talking ten thousand
calls to sprint F

271
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,360
the next bigger one house 16,000

272
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,040
your pee 5.5 can be every right

273
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,280
was apparently refried done with the
same coding practices

274
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:14,110
because it has 27,000 sprint off caps

275
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:17,919
and Asda the main image am

276
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:22,809
X Server is refried so

277
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:25,870
that's really great I can it took us

278
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:29,070
decayed to get ok message right

279
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:33,010
from and we're still not sure about from

280
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:36,549
reef writing it is not really a good
idea especially

281
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:40,730
give like you SSH in this is 4v mp3

282
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:43,840
just failed to test it for five am

283
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,160
yes age in in Europe as a stage Klein
says no

284
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,480
I'm not gonna talk two distinct because
slide

285
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,630
RC models is too small so you actually
have to force it

286
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:57,789
to even connect

287
00:17:57,789 --> 00:18:01,280
and then you now am the knowledge

288
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,610
which united in our page in memory which
is fairly

289
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:08,480
important for not point to the
references and some more stuff

290
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,090
it's not just mapped its retried execute
mapped

291
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:17,059
someone was really nice to hackers

292
00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:24,059
so let's look at Dean what management
interface

293
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:32,520
so and desist this is %um 13 come as you
can see him

294
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,320
not much difference this is how it looks
like

295
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,070
home in Chinese obviously I'm and you
can't switch to English spent I wanted

296
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,050
to show how Chinese

297
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:45,870
books on this pretty nice am

298
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:50,430
and actually only works in Internet
Explorer somewhere Shinzo vereb your

299
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:54,820
actually it doesn't work at all so my
you get fragments of JavaScript

300
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:59,400
am it has a session ID cards user ID

301
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,930
that session ID is 4 bytes long one of
them is ignored

302
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:07,150
one of them is fixed

303
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:11,320
one of them counts two concurrent
session and the last one comes

304
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,470
cell am that is

305
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:18,340
pretty much as predictable as it gets am

306
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,980
so if someone is already locked into the
router

307
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,300
you can as well obviously which gives
you

308
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:29,600
director for administration control and
this is me stealing

309
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,490
the configuration from rod am

310
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:37,550
yeah but if you have what management you
also

311
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:41,710
I think of guys you referenced your said

312
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:45,340
you also have arm the web server right

313
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:49,160
Sam web server am

314
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:53,160
tries to determine right in the
beginning before logging before

315
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,090
everything else

316
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:57,540
am whether it be resource you're asking
for

317
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:00,710
is something that you need one of those
complicates matters for

318
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:04,460
so it happens all the web content

319
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:08,900
as a file so the of his way to do it
would you to take to the fine

320
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,970
from mmm dictionary

321
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:16,380
and see you know which fighter in there
if it's one of those files

322
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:20,210
a given out for free otherwise what 12
session ID no

323
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:24,480
some what they do is the serious string
compare functions

324
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,570
and if it turns out to be resource Ted

325
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:30,770
is probably not requiring any
authentication

326
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:34,130
and do you are now gets copied into a
bath

327
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:37,780
that one is on stack and it is too small

328
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:41,510
so we have a very classic State baseball
for overflow

329
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:44,510
am any of those will work

330
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:48,160
am weekend pretty much direct

331
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:53,380
from control of a shitload of registers

332
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:57,110
and double stack everything that's right
here

333
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:02,210
am so that's really nice back to play
around

334
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:05,760
same the only thing you need is a time
targets when we come to

335
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,860
from obviously we can't use my by its

336
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:12,180
this being a string copy am Anders

337
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:15,580
United image pays small bites Poisson's

338
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:19,270
we can truly Ustad am for him

339
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:23,230
for the purpose of the exercise you
reduced the image dependent

340
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:26,460
an we simply reviews a few

341
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,730
move to can reduce the branch to can
reduce their

342
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:33,240
instruction sequence that we find
somewhere in the count

343
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,400
you know return oriented program for
kids

344
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,310
said should come to only one sequence
from

345
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:43,400
and then we are many checkup right

346
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,780
Sam some

347
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:50,290
for dish codes from one was nice enough
to provide

348
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:53,800
a pair of functions dad

349
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:59,150
have no privilege tech involved and
execute whatever you give them

350
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:02,390
as an argument directly as if you were
locked in

351
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:06,630
would for administrative privileges on
the ground am

352
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:09,780
does pretty useful I mean functions are

353
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:13,650
I'm did addresses of those functions are
image to Penn am

354
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:18,520
however funnily enough I couple you
expect I Broughton

355
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:22,140
and published arm dissembling show code

356
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:27,870
for Cisco dad disassembled to code in
memory and fines two functions

357
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:31,190
by building strong references am

358
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:35,800
that works for you because they're both
you can help you see

359
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,560
and so I'm if you wanna be image
independent

360
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:46,560
am do some of my earlier mark said the
strategy essentially for exploitation

361
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:53,080
is we do some blacks were encoding to
get rid of all by tissues and spaces and

362
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,840
other things the fuck up HTTP

363
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,160
week we do code is all inline and

364
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:02,780
home you know sent a command sequence
and this is a big man sequence to

365
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:06,180
said a password for the administrator
and then

366
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:10,610
being my host use I wanna see weathered
is worked or not

367
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:14,970
right come and that's optional could you
need for

368
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:18,250
it's really not that complicated I mean
home

369
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:22,610
very almost BC from PowerPC exploitation

370
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:25,840
if you've ever done PowerPC exploitation
on all to make books

371
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,590
this is exactly the same thing Sam

372
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:32,690
you know you play some tricks with the
instruction encoding

373
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:35,950
to for example to housings to get rid of

374
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,970
home issues with the cash it's and an
you know

375
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:42,590
you iterate over to commence

376
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:46,150
just that looks like %um do

377
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:49,910
Sen Durex DB request you gonna echo
request them

378
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:53,790
sent back a reply from new talent into
the machine

379
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:57,280
you get so

380
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,020
am now stack overflows

381
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:05,010
are easy we wanted to also see how he
performs from

382
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:09,660
work where you keep corruptions am so we
started

383
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:12,810
two more for fun abilities home then our

384
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:17,750
you overflows it is very difficult
because everything you find stickers

385
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,970
perform

386
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:22,930
so after long searching we found two
spins client

387
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:26,280
and I find it interesting because
client-side exploitation grab this is

388
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,820
pretty rare thing

389
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:32,010
answer my coworker dracula an mom

390
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:36,640
how to actually exploiters so the
viability is pretty straightforward

391
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,910
been scoring is actually an HTTP client
am

392
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:43,820
so what does is it since on request

393
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:48,270
with the funny statement this is gonna
take less than 10 minutes

394
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:51,440
I don't know how fast the Internet in
China as per 10 minutes for an HTTP

395
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,370
requests

396
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:56,380
reducing am Sam

397
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:00,790
wanted to stand is it takes the header
that gets back takes the content-length

398
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,460
provided by web server

399
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:05,970
trust and advocates from

400
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:10,550
memory accordingly interestingly enough
it already has stayed in hand

401
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:14,270
namely to Hatter which used and copied
into different

402
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:17,530
so we provide the size of my cock and

403
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:22,230
we provide to dade overflows pretty
straightforward

404
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:25,290
now the only thing we need to do am

405
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:28,330
is we have to look at the allocator

406
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:31,610
am when you look at alligator and
disassembly

407
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:34,780
becomes quickly cleared disses from

408
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:38,470
discipline allocator because there's
like six numbers

409
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,500
and then our that are compared and
Anders different free lists

410
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,340
in use lists and stuff

411
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:48,940
cell arm you look at you

412
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:53,000
d allocation and see what would sanity
checks where we have in their

413
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,270
am dues some magic numbers

414
00:25:56,270 --> 00:26:00,210
from there's a pointer to allocate a
structure

415
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:03,420
and so on um in

416
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:06,780
then you look at the free and to free
actually

417
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:11,390
goes to Howard in does a straightforward
point exchange

418
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:15,910
som on this is how you the trampled look
like

419
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:19,250
do some do tank entered in the pointer
from

420
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:22,250
dan you set it up war if it's a free
block

421
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:25,740
dues additional data that manages free
blocks

422
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:30,820
very typically play out from from the
90's

423
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:35,030
so am as I said it's been telecommuters

424
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:38,380
each been has its own free list from

425
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:42,040
these this structured PG each structure

426
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,260
um house a pointer to the respective
list

427
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:48,260
an malloc essentially I'm

428
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:51,520
then if it takes I want block out after
fruitless

429
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:56,070
essentially again just takes the first
block and performs porn exchange

430
00:26:56,070 --> 00:27:00,090
are which gives you opportunity memory
right if you provided

431
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:03,570
2.6 so

432
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:06,860
its cool DMN talk arm weekend

433
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:10,270
reviews for a car to goldstein we
haven't looked had

434
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:13,390
yours from so

435
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:17,350
we simply over right am committed you
know of a free tank

436
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:21,160
in when the next ranks now locked in

437
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:25,850
everything is fine right Sam

438
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:29,090
just to illustrate this is how it would
look like would

439
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:32,480
would free box and

440
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:38,990
we take some assumptions on on the size
which we can because we can control it

441
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,820
and you know arm when a block bomb is
now locked

442
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:45,830
it is taken out of two free first and
then

443
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:49,650
am WEM in when

444
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:52,800
free am when it is free damn can be

445
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,050
knocked again in year weekends our

446
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:59,210
control because we can write some well
you into some

447
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:03,940
important piece of memory two weeks
don't have to determine

448
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:07,130
there's a couple things to take care of
obviously

449
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:10,920
Sam we have to make sure that the sanity
checks go through

450
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:14,700
but as you have seen they're not very
extensive compared to you

451
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,910
what mark explain City on

452
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:23,720
iPhone heap this is really simple this
is really predictable

453
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:28,280
cell um the the next question is like
how do we make to the heap

454
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,340
army out some more predictable

455
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:36,800
so we're looking at different bins one
been turns out to be 512 bytes

456
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,220
am and you know we can allocate

457
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:43,470
more of dole's so we can feel to you

458
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:46,850
and essentially massage away

459
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:50,130
to he play our dentist the way we want

460
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:54,100
from luckily enough every time you make
a TCP connection to

461
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:58,330
such a device that allocates 512 bytes
for control structure

462
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:02,140
so this is how you control do you
allocation remotely

463
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:06,180
am due to strict two parts

464
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:10,940
am now I'm we'd we need a couple of
mattresses

465
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:14,360
from dead you know we predict from

466
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,390
and that usually doesn't work too well
pictures

467
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:20,470
there's dues lot of variety in

468
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:25,050
images even for why we it's not as bad
as it is with Cisco

469
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:29,030
perhaps you know having a target listen
hard coded pointers

470
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:33,510
a chance stocks from Greg decided to
make it even more

471
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:37,590
and reliable as he said in actually try
to keep spraying

472
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:41,390
on the device so from

473
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:45,730
in due to the nature of that back it's
really really easy to use play

474
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:50,590
am because you know you you provide to
contemplate and you provide to date on

475
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:53,670
so using multiple connections from

476
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:57,050
you can just esprit de entirety am

477
00:29:57,050 --> 00:30:00,230
Warren dinner other strategies suppliers
well ride

478
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:04,600
if you have a memory leak or whatever

479
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,200
then you know you can you start

480
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,740
and Anders to question what would be
effort from

481
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:14,740
that would again be a much dependent so
if we weren't

482
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:19,270
try to patch the code word right into
some data structure whatever

483
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:24,620
from Baudouin from remembered that I
sent it did not pitch

484
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,750
from is mapped so

485
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:32,810
tomorrow page contains PowerPC interrupt
handler routines

486
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:36,250
I remember in MS DOS days you had to
interrupt vector table

487
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:39,800
we always have to modifying order to

488
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:44,050
right code nigga want me to find right
signatures for

489
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:47,430
am bad is similar

490
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:50,960
however on RPC you actually have to code

491
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,620
out in those places so I'm you have 256
bytes

492
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:59,270
space per interrupt to hang

493
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:02,320
am and so we can essentially just

494
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,590
right somewhere there

495
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:08,890
now we have to choose an interim we
could use something that is triggered by

496
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:09,940
timing

497
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:14,690
from however dues also do you do
interrupted gets triggered for

498
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:19,150
arm invalid memory access you have I'm

499
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:22,440
and sons were fucking around with you
you quite a lot

500
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,360
this might be you know good place to
start

501
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,630
Sam is since argued

502
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:35,040
is pretty much guaranteed to cause a
crash soon or later

503
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:40,010
we just fight or chrome from directly
into to interrupt handler

504
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:43,390
home in you know it gets triggered by
itself

505
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:47,010
some to see said once we have cut
execution

506
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:50,310
we can clean up to keep if we want to
from

507
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:54,390
do whatever we want and then you know
exit in for a tender

508
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:58,170
another good thing in a scene from 10 so
we don't get to corrupt

509
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:01,960
that is awesome and

510
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,700
this is the system d exploited Greg
fraud

511
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:10,610
it is called the visitor because wind
turbines point activates did

512
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:14,180
we'll see now visiting the BIM server am

513
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:18,770
Sam this is the visitor and is begin
gives you can execution

514
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:23,610
I'm executing after complaints

515
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:27,570
now some we come to you do you

516
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:31,180
question dead is always given around

517
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:34,510
from when to talk about what we

518
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:38,420
United first question is always actors
Sam

519
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:41,850
to speak to save you time asking

520
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:46,370
is what it is am it is very often
claimed

521
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:50,970
want me back doors every devices and
then the Chinese government can read on

522
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:51,620
your email

523
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:55,550
in which all your porn as if they don't
have their own

524
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:58,600
am in

525
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:02,190
so far nobody has actually discovered
back doors in hardware

526
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:05,320
your in the your peacoat

527
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:09,270
seriously given to supply your fine
abilities

528
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:13,120
in to you relative ease of exploitation

529
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:17,060
I don't see why you need one am

530
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:20,430
you know it's it's a question of
interpretation right so

531
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:24,940
so even Anders senior VP said what they
have been common factors are actually

532
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:27,250
box in our software

533
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:30,830
perfect deniability right Sam

534
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:33,860
from actually would so many carriers
having

535
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:37,960
operator networks I would be more
concerned about the network management

536
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,700
systems

537
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:44,320
and to you remote access to them and
everything that comes after

538
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,940
use arabs you don't need to break into
something that you have the root

539
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,200
password for

540
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,430
right which uses operations is the case

541
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:56,600
that sent

542
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,870
from when I looked at the bootloaders

543
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:03,340
I'm between two string password and
password

544
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:07,200
I found funny-looking strengths here and
say no

545
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,450
by definition of a back toward the
hidden method of bypassing on a computer

546
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:15,440
a vindication systems dat pretty much
fit the bill

547
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,320
so would you see to ride is a very very
streets

548
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:23,149
operation sir what we have here is

549
00:34:23,149 --> 00:34:26,990
am so what we talk about your is the
bootloader password

550
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:30,660
right so what we have here is a use and
provides

551
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:34,830
gans the password is stored in flash and
a string compare

552
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:38,960
if that worked if that didn't work

553
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,399
it takes the user input and extreme in
his keys

554
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:46,860
807 home BSP string compare

555
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:50,790
if worked also got

556
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:54,000
in mind that's what the victorious

557
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,120
now what does give you that back door to
the house

558
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:00,720
from bootloader password is important if
you deploy

559
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,860
machines outside of the premises begins

560
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:09,440
well Yukon selects in order to get to

561
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,680
in when %um when you have no bootloader
password you can

562
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:17,770
interrupted your you can say well
without configuration

563
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:20,930
an app gives you access to committee am

564
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:25,820
altered his passwords is also use do to
fix password is also used

565
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:29,690
when you reset the password ask for your
password

566
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:33,240
damn you can also use that fix password
for

567
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,440
am and that's really useful if you buy

568
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,880
used to our equipment there that
actually had

569
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:43,290
password set and United dissenter

570
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:47,400
fail to recognize that you know you two
passwords

571
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:52,140
am if you buy a used one week whitman

572
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:56,470
1/2 dose am

573
00:35:56,470 --> 00:36:00,630
so we're we're still collecting them
from I'm not entirely sure who

574
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:05,230
supplement his

575
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:08,460
from and yet its

576
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,620
it's interesting because they're did not
document

577
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:15,740
obviously and we're still collecting for
for other platforms but

578
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:19,550
murders ard pack differently as I
mentioned with images

579
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:23,930
sound that kinda sucks am

580
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:28,710
get some perspective on this so this the
specter only works locally or on through

581
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,350
termin summer

582
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:33,350
if you have a terminus around someone
gets to determine its summer

583
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:36,630
you're fucked so you can load to be
reviewed image

584
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:40,839
without conflagration then changed
password for example

585
00:36:40,839 --> 00:36:44,640
reboot the machine with configuration
and urine

586
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,810
Sam if you have equipment deployed

587
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:50,880
your premises not

588
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,900
it ought to be noted distractors

589
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,790
of having vendor backdoor passwords is
nothing you need for

590
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:02,740
what we PCB bias is used to have that
for a long time

591
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:05,970
other vendors to dad are famous Siemens
in Germany

592
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:09,630
ads probably more back to password
sternem regular ones

593
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:14,550
under equipment am in all their daughter
companies as well

594
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:20,040
from however begins of you know dis be
network equipment and usually

595
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:24,670
deployed all around to place there's
really good reason that Cisco at some

596
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:25,830
point introduced

597
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:29,359
no service password recovery which is
exactly dad

598
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:33,190
it to say boards the possibility to get
into drum

599
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:39,200
include a machine without countries
something to consider

600
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,080
and already brings me to print version

601
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:46,220
some so Europe ya Q suffers

602
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:49,370
from ninety Starbucks in

603
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:53,560
respective exploitation from Sam doctor

604
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:57,640
from they seem to be ramping a product
security now

605
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:03,070
but see when it counts from the current
state of our research

606
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:07,920
you know you never know it's a lot
account but the current stage

607
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,370
instead the fear of government factories
is

608
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:15,250
pretty much exactly gated from however

609
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:18,550
anything local access is on the van
right now

610
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:24,370
make everyone can read include a code
and find a string compares

611
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:27,580
in with that um I would like to two
times

612
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:31,230
and come if you now

613
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:34,859
if you're concerned about juror juror
network security now because you're

614
00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:35,359
running

615
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:38,510
recruitment don't yell at your network
people

616
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:43,740
for use your fellow that's the guy who
made a decision to buy district

617
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:50,740
okay thank you any questions

618
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,600
this

619
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:11,600
sleep
