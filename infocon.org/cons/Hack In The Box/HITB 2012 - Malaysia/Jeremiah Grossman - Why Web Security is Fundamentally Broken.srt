1
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:11,400
ok face

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,440
a

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,640
this

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,150
space

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:22,150
space

6
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,490
good morning everybody and a

7
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,550
thank you for coming us before starting
its wanted a

8
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,210
special thank you for doing the best
that I can about staffer I'm after

9
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:38,010
making me feel

10
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,930
extremely welcome this is a really fun
event for me I get opportunity

11
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:45,129
so we're gonna talk today all about up

12
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:49,260
web security bought some other web sites
I but most the browser side and why it

13
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,890
is fundamentally broken

14
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:55,659
and how conflicts of interests are
preventing certain issues from get

15
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:56,860
effects that will %ah

16
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,320
that will get to by the just a a quick
show of hands

17
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,430
a how many people here have a browser
that they use daily

18
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:08,409
this fans okay and how many of you have
a browser feature that broadcasts

19
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:11,890
who you are with every single click to
the website

20
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:15,670
at I would be the same hands actually
okay

21
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,979
to keep that in mind as they go for that
lots and lots a broken stuff on the web

22
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:19,970
that will go into

23
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:23,230
but before get you outta myself all the
live demos and things like that

24
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,680
hopefully the wireless Holden and

25
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,790
attempted why live demos in the past to
attack a conferences and I never

26
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,640
went too well so we'll see what happens
to that soho a

27
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,260
what are the rules a web secure there's
two rules the first rule is a website

28
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,640
must be able to defend itself against
the hostile client the browser

29
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,190
you know can you hack into a single
injection and so on and so forth

30
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:48,770
and with a lot of work and a lot of
effort it is difficult but it isn't

31
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,640
possible to follow you I think you can
actually make

32
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,650
secure web sites what's wrong number

33
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:59,690
number to it browser must be able to
defend itself against a hostile

34
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:02,990
website so it works both ways and

35
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:06,970
I'm of the opinion right now no matter
really what you do really a special

36
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:10,819
yard and user this is for all practical
matters impossible

37
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:14,340
can't do it I get to ask all the time
Mia by

38
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,390
reporters and analysts and enterprises
you know how to use browser stuff

39
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:22,849
and I'm really don't have a good answer
good answer for them. sauna talked a lot

40
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:23,439
about this

41
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:27,650
to the area and something to talk about
the the second half about security the

42
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:28,650
security other browser

43
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:33,069
and just to give you the lay of the land
I'll prove it to you as we go forward

44
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:36,989
right now any website you visit

45
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:41,400
the website gets Kasab access to
information about your operating system

46
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,760
you very system settings your browser
type all the installed add-ons & plugins

47
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,629
that you have

48
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:50,749
your geographic location the web sites
are currently logged into and so on and

49
00:02:50,749 --> 00:02:51,450
so forth

50
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,989
it's a very very easy to clean this
information right at the moment you

51
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:56,499
visit a website doesn't matter

52
00:02:56,499 --> 00:03:02,139
up your patch model if

53
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:05,469
you give their website just one more
click you give it access to your your

54
00:03:05,469 --> 00:03:06,109
full name

55
00:03:06,109 --> 00:03:09,719
where you live places that you've been
the town he grew up and went to school

56
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:10,950
your marital status

57
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:14,769
probably your online photos and in some
cases your browser's are a complete data

58
00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:15,559
and surfing

59
00:03:15,559 --> 00:03:21,680
history lots and lots and information
that's

60
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,309
passive stuff the stuff that trends on
where the website owner is still

61
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:27,059
probably

62
00:03:27,059 --> 00:03:30,809
doing things that are legal the browser
can then be made

63
00:03:30,809 --> 00:03:34,769
to do many many other things that bro
the website can force your browser to

64
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:35,299
makes

65
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:38,919
self-incriminating web requests they
could force you to hack other web sites

66
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,469
or download malicious content

67
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:44,309
it could force your browser to hide
internet web sites I've your enterprise

68
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:45,239
your homes for

69
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,709
internal router I'm and sort some nasty
stuff so the browser out there's

70
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:52,769
is a is a hacker's platform at the
Paradise in the browser

71
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:56,059
so let's divide this process up to the
two types of

72
00:03:56,059 --> 00:03:59,319
attack technics types of goals rather

73
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:03,219
because they start to get lost in the
shuffle I'm the first attack technique

74
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:03,719
are

75
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:07,150
the attacks that are designed to escape
the browser walls and

76
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,709
you know to escape the browser also in
fact the operative system below

77
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:14,150
the so-called drive-by downloads and
this is

78
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,630
you know whether it's when does a mac
osx it's all the same and this is where

79
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,500
you see on the board out there for the

80
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,680
upon in competition with the guys from
Pinkie Pie play

81
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,150
to exploit the other and land on top and
over the last three to five years or so

82
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,070
there's been a lot of

83
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:32,250
emphasis a lot a new security features
designed to prevent that scenario from

84
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,710
from happening give sandbox in silent
updates

85
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:39,229
increase offer security in general
anti-phishing updates and the list goes

86
00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:39,729
on

87
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:43,020
and these are all really cool has
enabled by default you get them for free

88
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,879
in the user doesn't have to do anything
new

89
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:49,229
then there's the other web attacks
there's the ones that go

90
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:52,690
outside the browser walls on this is
where I tend to play it with with the

91
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:56,930
tax such as cross-eyed scraping process
request forgery clickjacking and I'm

92
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:00,979
billion other vere where the quite
content to stay within the browser port

93
00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:01,520
Inc

94
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,960
the data that is in the cloud you know
from a baguette standpoint of the day

95
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,090
that you're after

96
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:10,610
the email addresses the

97
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:14,430
user's name their bank account details
told in the browser walls I prefer

98
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:18,340
prefer to stay there the security
features to go after these a

99
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,370
these attack techniques our secure
cuties

100
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:26,009
you know the secure file young cuties it
should be only

101
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:29,220
X Frame options strict Transport
Security

102
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,270
X content type in a whole bunch of other
security-related

103
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:36,250
headers the problem with the is is that
they are of in by the website owner

104
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,720
for the user to benefit the website must
op.10

105
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,379
and most the time they don't top 10 so
they don't really provide ways for the

106
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:44,169
users to print

107
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:48,050
the wells which is wrong number two must
be able to defend yourself

108
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:51,240
these don't help with that

109
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,699
most all the attack techniques on a sure
thing today

110
00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:59,530
share one common theme he actually left
very basic use case

111
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:02,539
a you have a web was designed from the
very beginning

112
00:06:02,539 --> 00:06:06,229
let's say you have a an image tag you
know just the basic image tag that

113
00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:07,770
points to go to a

114
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,949
some website whenever the website as he
got him its or sequels

115
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:14,659
some other website your as there will be
a Ben megawatt

116
00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:18,560
quest yet this but the image it's all
things are

117
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,789
work you'll get an image on the screen

118
00:06:22,789 --> 00:06:26,169
you can also detect if the image load
successfully or not with little bit a

119
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:29,000
javascript you have on market and %um
on-air

120
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,879
if the image but it's especially the
onload event and there were fire this

121
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:34,159
case the function success or error

122
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:37,280
if if the image for whatever reason was
broken the on

123
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,949
are about how to fire the air functional
execute thats

124
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:44,550
as the that's the technology that's the
pic

125
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:48,469
thats baked in the RC facts us back to
table used to do log in the texan the

126
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:49,129
Brock

127
00:06:49,129 --> 00:06:52,759
and the understand there's all different
ways to do login detection so I'm gonna

128
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:54,340
show you just one quick way

129
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:57,949
how to deal with them if tax let's say
there's a website out there are some

130
00:06:57,949 --> 00:06:59,379
other website imagine it's

131
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:02,699
you know like a file stamp or or
something like that and that has an

132
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:05,900
image on that website that is only view
herbal

133
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,150
only request a ball if the browser or
the user is logged in

134
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:12,539
in this scenario so you'd you go to let
some malicious website

135
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:15,870
in a point that image it had a little
bit of a shock though that points for

136
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,870
that image

137
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,300
and it does the onload on-air event
handler trick

138
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,740
if the image return successfully meaning
that you aren't logged an

139
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:27,520
the bad guy can know it and if it's not
logged and they damage will return

140
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,379
born not returned are correctly and
you'll get you know the on air about how

141
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:32,229
their fire

142
00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:35,340
very very easy all you have to do is to
find one resource

143
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:39,539
on the target website one little image
that only response

144
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:42,699
if the user is logged in there's five
different ways that you can do that

145
00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:43,780
sorta tracked with

146
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:48,659
JavaScript with cascading style sheets
with iframes and so on and so forth but

147
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:50,960
it's a very simple trick

148
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,080
I'd like to actually I show you that
method and several with that

149
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,319
live actually

150
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:02,120
I bring up my screen here

151
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:08,099
so and broke niggas log into a few
web-sites

152
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:11,219
so this is live of weed or

153
00:08:11,219 --> 00:08:15,039
right this is my facebook account my
Twitter account logged out and logged in

154
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,389
to Yahoo

155
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:19,469
I'm not logged into Google justice show
difference

156
00:08:19,469 --> 00:08:25,590
evolved in the Amazon and also like them

157
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:29,400
now this page I'm on right here just a
web server

158
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,880
on the local box here it could be any
website out there and it's called the

159
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,240
hostname packer

160
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,680
and I'm gonna hit reload on this page to
load the

161
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:43,050
upriver concepts they can see it load on
the flight

162
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:50,050
so loading right now and I should
probably

163
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,290
I'm gonna show you when I bought it one
more time but on a show you the

164
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:57,410
developer tools

165
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:02,370
right here

166
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:06,210
Sony reload again you'll see this so

167
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:09,960
my brother's been forced to make all
kinds of cross-domain web requests and

168
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,780
depending on how the

169
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:15,640
ever spock it tells the hacker web site
whether or not I'm logged in seven

170
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:20,610
we browse down here you'll see my
bracket my brother's been detected as

171
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:24,050
logged in to Yahoo Twitter Facebook
Amazon and link that

172
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:27,390
this prefer concept code supports

173
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:32,220
all these particular site seven at all
and currently supports all

174
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,670
all modern browsers all the major
browsers except one little caveat due to

175
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,320
some

176
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,370
technology limitations I wasn't able to
do a login detection

177
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:43,050
on Internet Explorer 8&9 for ya but the
rest works just fine

178
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:46,220
so it's really fast really easy for
anyone at the top

179
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,720
what other pages that you're logged into
and this is really really useful

180
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:56,090
are for follow-on attacks so

181
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:59,780
week it said a which remind ourselves
that when you go to website

182
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:02,810
don't know it you know what browser you
are using a

183
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:06,670
the technology is in use in all sorts of
things so now we know

184
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,690
if you're the bag I you know what cites
the user is logged into

185
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:13,270
but this user still generally anonymous
so we want to know what that person's

186
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,480
name is and this is why mention earlier
before

187
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,470
we're gonna do D Anton is Asian figure
out where the user is

188
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:22,720
with one click and we're gonna use us up

189
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,310
attack technical clickjacking and a
variation on call the

190
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:30,300
follow Jack in like that in so there's
many many web sites out there

191
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,290
particularly the social networks that
have these little third party websites

192
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:37,230
up facebook like button site you price
in the one third party web pages

193
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:41,920
the little you follow buttons for
Twitter & plus wine and everybody has

194
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,830
won the spotlights

195
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:46,560
every social metres of an hour passed on
so all it has to happen

196
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,970
if you have to convince the user to
click for more dancing cats

197
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:54,310
or whatever it is and if they'd
mistakenly click

198
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:58,010
on one of these buttons here that
actually will send a request

199
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:00,910
to the bag either pick in the tech to
the user is so the user's gonna

200
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,550
mistakenly click on one of these

201
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:07,000
that the bag that sets up are before we
move that is like the

202
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,209
give a quote there from our for you know

203
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:12,890
court that I really liked the matchup
with a self-inflicted cross-site

204
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:15,820
scripting attack which is effectively
what we're doing buttons

205
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,870
so let me out set this up for you here
we're gonna do it

206
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:21,910
first very simply with the butts

207
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:28,910
what Twitter now

208
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:34,030
or all rights Twitter page so my
brothers

209
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:40,600
obviously login to Twitter and see the
Follow button to notify my mouth on the

210
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,120
screen

211
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,000
the only reason that's visible as big we
make it visible so work right now we're

212
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,060
going to be

213
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:50,560
tricked into following Tomich I 67

214
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,920
so you know whenever there is a link on
the screen or whatever

215
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,920
now before I click this I'm gonna go to

216
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,120
Tomich I've account and look at his
followers

217
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,770
right CC the NOP tricks up their

218
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:09,080
on and get reload so the way Twitter
works is the most recent follower

219
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:13,600
is listed at the top okay now watch what
happens here when I click

220
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,530
I'm gonna collect I won't see this upon
the victim

221
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:22,270
okay and then fight some magic behind
the scenes but forgot to

222
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:26,060
the website with a bullet on and my name
my username on Twitter

223
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:29,950
where I'm from my everything in a
Twitter profile 1-click

224
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:34,100
you wouldn't see this a normal life
scenario the mechanism that this works

225
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:38,120
is actually once think like happens the
bag I goes and looks at the

226
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,120
the Twitter accounts profile and sees
was the most recent follower after the

227
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,200
clicks I notice that I'm on top

228
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,060
very very trivial to actually be one
click the ionization that was

229
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,089
unacceptable that works

230
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:53,700
right facebook is a little bit trickier

231
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,770
as we can do this on Facebook as well so
to show you how it works on Facebook I

232
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:00,280
have to show you a different Facebook
account different browser that'll be

233
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,230
logged in different like

234
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:04,709
so this is a a Facebook account

235
00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:08,910
I called why that doorman anna has a
whole bunch of Facebook pages here

236
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,650
although the anonymizer names

237
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:14,470
these are just very special Facebook
pages because the bag I must control the

238
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,190
page

239
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:20,100
that the user will eventually like okay
so keep that in mind

240
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:26,690
well go to

241
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:33,690
the Facebook page and will hit reload

242
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:45,980
hopefully we get a like button to pop up

243
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,839
on a popup that's just great area aka so
now

244
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:54,890
same as before we got this little like
but you know that we're gonna mistakenly

245
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:58,500
click on for the user again for the real
victims we went to see this

246
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,000
now fee notice: here the at the
anonymizer 9

247
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,260
that's a randomly selected page at the
bag Facebook page at the bag that

248
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,100
controls

249
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,149
there's no like got now so now

250
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:12,459
the user will click on it and that's
that

251
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:18,240
they have beaten the anonymous takes a
minute for the back in Co to load

252
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:25,240
so as I comes up I'll show you back in
here

253
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:31,820
whatever that the analyzer 9 I noticed
that

254
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:36,029
19 seconds ago Jeremiah Grossman log
like the anonymizer 9

255
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:39,790
bag I can check this because they on the
page since they know who like the paving

256
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,490
love you my public profile

257
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:44,839
and extract all the information that
they want with a single click and now

258
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:46,580
this is why you notice over here

259
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:51,329
it has ripped out all the up personal
pictures on my facebook profile

260
00:14:51,329 --> 00:14:55,510
I my my name my native language

261
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:59,300
my Facebook username my last name I
Facebook ID everything that they want

262
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,060
that public on it but 1-click

263
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:08,060
on a like button at all really take to
the anomalous so

264
00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:15,529
careful what you click on so let me know
a lot about the person's browser

265
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:21,430
we know where the logjam and with that
we use that we use that information

266
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:24,850
I 2d analyze the user now we know there
are real net

267
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:29,020
so this is where up

268
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,550
I come to the picture basically say
unless you've taken very particular

269
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,240
precautions

270
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,870
please assume that every single website
you know no visit knows exactly who you

271
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:36,320
are

272
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,230
where you're from and so on and so forth
so that's something something to thank

273
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,300
them enough to date

274
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:46,890
there's also other ways that make a
deuce

275
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:50,140
different forms of employees detection
or even internet

276
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:53,240
in but the time you wanna know now we
note with the person's name

277
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,890
we may or may not know where they work
but lets everyone know where they work

278
00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:00,579
this is where you something from a you
know from a several years ago that

279
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:02,500
browser Internet packing stuff

280
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,199
so as we said our corporate networks are
all your most their corporate network

281
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:06,600
site

282
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,529
your browser sets on their the local DMZ
I really dnt this the local internet

283
00:16:11,529 --> 00:16:15,089
and your browser can't connect to
internal corporate results as

284
00:16:15,089 --> 00:16:18,520
that the bag I will isn't necessarily
able to reach externally

285
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,610
so the user year goes out to visit our
web page you grab without a script

286
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:26,620
our executes here behind the firewall
and your browser can think back to all

287
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,060
these different places so

288
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:31,579
many corporations havent char portal
common names

289
00:16:31,579 --> 00:16:35,529
a bug tracking systems you know that the
bag I can know about

290
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:40,260
ahead a time I've have found BAM on gogo
let ya who had all sorts of things

291
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:43,290
so now when you come to my website I
give you an iframe

292
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:46,880
I friend he calls and some internal
resource some internal hosts and that

293
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,870
only you can get to

294
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:51,320
if that page what successfully
eye-popping on lower

295
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:55,160
know you're an employee that particular
company and if I so desire to you can

296
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,980
actually force the user's browser to
start packing those web sites with

297
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,410
impunity because now you're effectively
behind the fire

298
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:04,449
this is on fixed today it's unclear at
this or

299
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:09,059
be fixed ever so

300
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:12,809
let's start wiring some these things
together attack I'll

301
00:17:12,809 --> 00:17:16,059
more of a larger down I put this up I
don't have time to put up the live demo

302
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:17,120
see up to a

303
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:23,530
live with a a locum so

304
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:27,679
this up here are five johnnie all these
pages are not logged into all these

305
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:28,130
things

306
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:33,710
so this is an internal website here on
this box but it would make no difference

307
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:38,200
on whether or not it was Austin

308
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,640
hosted remotely on the air public
Internet or on my boxer on make this

309
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,330
call is for available so this is on the
hackers website

310
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:48,160
and again we're going to click check the
user with a quick check downs account

311
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,169
with using it how you want

312
00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:55,870
and then we're going to mistakenly click
the Follow button

313
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:59,840
I gives us a little bit information
about the user and then the button

314
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,510
disappears

315
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:05,080
and

316
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:10,560
we're gonna quit back jack the user
again on the like button and that will

317
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,120
disappear

318
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,440
to collect some we get a lot of
information about the user for now the

319
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,150
rest is just

320
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:18,169
you know a statics really

321
00:18:18,169 --> 00:18:21,679
so if you want I the find information to
show these are what you have a say a

322
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,890
larger my custom blah blah blah

323
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:27,080
this is what I know about your up know
about you I know your name

324
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:33,100
I see your profile with a single with a
single click

325
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,800
wanna know about their computer no
problem the brosser provides great

326
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,300
JavaScript APIs to tell that I'm running
on Intel Mac thoughts right here

327
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,550
operating system version 10 points 7.5

328
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:47,530
and I'm not virtualized is a very
interesting way to detect virtualization

329
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:50,179
on a public website using the screen
dimensions

330
00:18:50,179 --> 00:18:53,700
my brought my own a computer right now
is right 1680 by 10:50

331
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,900
but screen captures are fairly standard
right across all laptops and computers

332
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:02,409
if your virtualize your in like a VMware
window our VMware Fusion window and no

333
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:06,030
when does come up elongated to differ
with its non-standard

334
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:09,830
if you're if you notice that the browser
is a non-standard size you can actually

335
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:12,409
detect the virtualization state just by
this

336
00:19:12,409 --> 00:19:15,550
dimensions I I'm that the table to the

337
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:18,560
this is very easy stuff you know that's
browsers like chrome

338
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:22,650
you know 22 what site can detect all day
long from the user-agent

339
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:26,330
I my language up if ActiveX is available

340
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:30,450
some time running Chrome right it's not
but if it was idea when does it would be

341
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:33,550
24 bits of color depth and there's also
another track a

342
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:36,960
which I don't have time so we can
actually detect the default browser

343
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,630
if the user is running I E let's move
down a little bit

344
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:43,890
some other stuff

345
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:47,730
browser again so browser plug-ins are
different than add-ons browser plug-ins

346
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:50,350
are things like Flash and PDF reader

347
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:53,590
where the browser wants to display rich
content

348
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:56,809
in line stuff other than HTML and
Javascript

349
00:19:56,809 --> 00:20:00,010
and so these plugins that the proper
supports

350
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:03,220
MPC and the other super fairly common
stuff right

351
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:07,169
my my brother has thirteen different
plugins that are available everything

352
00:20:07,169 --> 00:20:09,250
from QuickTime to flash Silverlight

353
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:13,260
you know Google Talk all sorts of things
SharePoint and so on and so forth

354
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,270
so this is great for sec for second
stage exploitation

355
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:20,169
or just basic fingerprinting because a
lot of times while everybody might be

356
00:20:20,169 --> 00:20:20,600
running

357
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,780
you know a lot of people might be
running Chrome they might have a

358
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:27,870
different set up Williams

359
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:30,840
against browser add-ons are different

360
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:35,340
I Inc wrong they're called up in Cromer
call extensions in Firefox the called

361
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:35,850
add-ons

362
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:38,740
add-ons actually are different and
plugins because they extend the

363
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,090
functionality the browser

364
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:43,540
rather than just read content go improve
the user experience

365
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:47,960
as I run that actually what I'd like to
do here

366
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:52,960
show you the developer tools

367
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:59,960
so you have this work on the fly so I'm
going to classify here

368
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:06,350
and actually detected but I'm running
adblock and web developer tools

369
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:09,430
the way this works is is

370
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:13,880
0 in it doesn't up that this technique
there's a similar technique that work in

371
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,900
Firefox but

372
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,050
doesn't anymore but it works fine in
Chrome you see all these Chrome

373
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:19,270
extension your elsewhere

374
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:23,620
if you go to the chrome a add-on
repository for all the crime add-ons

375
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:28,190
are every i dont get some real its gets
a custom ID this long

376
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:32,040
me a string of letters and numbers here
and they're all different and in mind

377
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,950
the mall outside

378
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:37,220
I mind the top several thousand of them
out and then every

379
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:41,890
and it did so this your appoints locally
so you point to the idea of the

380
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:42,990
extension to track

381
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:48,700
and the manifesto Jason file which is to
all but two Jason data comes back in the

382
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,190
browser so I got scripts source

383
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:55,240
equals that your O if it fires the
onload event amor I know you have an

384
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:55,880
extension

385
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,560
so it's kind of a brute-force exhaustive
way to search for what extensions are

386
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,200
available on

387
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,880
browser so it's you know quite awful
taking you see all the

388
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,190
all the checks I do and gets few sec if
you can

389
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:13,840
dude thousands and thousands of requests
next thing we can do we can do some IP

390
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,410
geolocation stuff and I'll

391
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:21,570
like this up now everybody knows that
you know you can you

392
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:25,050
you know if much your proxy you display
your IP address I

393
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:29,470
to every website that you visit abut a
lot of people don't know is I P skin

394
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:32,590
contain lots of helpful information
depending on who register them with

395
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:35,970
it'll tell your ISP your general
geographic location

396
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:39,770
sometimes record that's all right now
the system was able to attack to

397
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:43,770
my cry I P external to the system which
is the a 211 number there

398
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:46,920
but it was actually able to detect that
I'm in Malaysia

399
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,610
and given i scary map to the user so I
can give a nice idea

400
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:57,610
but i put music that you you're looking
at now we get the sympathy even more

401
00:22:58,990 --> 00:22:59,780
scary stuff

402
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:03,280
so yet we did a quick check in attacks
earlier at so

403
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,740
all this personal information is there
so it's the classified so I write this

404
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,750
the information that I was able to glean
from both Twitter and Facebook we coulda

405
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,310
done the same thing on Lake then

406
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:17,490
Google+ and all those sorts of things
but in the US and might actually work

407
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:18,390
here I don't know

408
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:22,720
are if you have the person's name and
location you can do what's called a spot

409
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,460
your search

410
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:27,610
so hot wired that in some simple click

411
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:31,210
and you can actually fall start finding
all the Jeremi Grossman's and different

412
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,250
places out there and I'm

413
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:35,870
already revealed that I'm from Silicon
Valley right so this is one frontal

414
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:38,940
over here and you can start seeing
different places where I

415
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:45,940
might have lived the Sox sucks cuz
that's correct

416
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,590
then it's also able to get the photos
and different things I'll

417
00:23:55,590 --> 00:24:00,500
here we saw that all the photos we saw

418
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,680
so this is kinda like that the Super for
for concept page right kinda

419
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,410
brings together a whole buncha web
backing tracks all the pages that are

420
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:06,970
currently

421
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:10,480
all the sites are currently are 2 and so
on and so forth secrecy gets

422
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:15,060
now for a browser security privacy
standpoint there slow it's a little are

423
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:15,510
other

424
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:22,510
alright let's go back to fight so

425
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:29,760
now that you've seen this when we start
seen

426
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,510
headlines at re like this crime is the
most secure the top three browsers

427
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:37,600
or maybe its Internet Explorer we can
kinda see

428
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,000
what with context what how secure
brothers are

429
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,180
what they can to can't protect against
you know I think it actually looks more

430
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:46,970
like this

431
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:53,970
but that's just me so

432
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:58,360
I get asked all the time what are the
possible solutions out there for the

433
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,170
users are

434
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:02,570
but the browser vendors can do so let's
talk about that let's talk about some

435
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:05,110
other possible solutions to start taking
care of some these problems

436
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:10,100
and that there's many many ways we can
bring some around this but let's say we

437
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,610
want to fix login detection

438
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:15,750
one-way I'm not advocate for this but
one way is weekend

439
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:19,690
decide or the prosecutor side not the
same web visitors cookies

440
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:24,380
to of domain destinations different from
the host name in the URL bar

441
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:27,600
along with those web request so was I
mean I'm use if you're on hackers

442
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,080
backpacker website or the third party
website

443
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,060
at load in a facebook like button the
Facebook what you get your faith

444
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:37,750
log in facebook status on facebook what
now for you are so there would be known

445
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,610
that cross domain cokie stuff nope

446
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:42,820
main authentication you could do that

447
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:46,280
the side effect is that a quote unquote
breaks the web

448
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,790
not sending copies of the man would
break web sites using multiple host

449
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:50,890
names to deliver of the night

450
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:54,770
the content it would break single click
which it's like Twitter Follow button on

451
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:56,760
Facebook Like buttons cuz he really
liked those

452
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,440
and it also breaks Google tracking via
Google Analytics for metrics and things

453
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,170
like that

454
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:05,260
so given how the bra how browser is a
browser vendors make money

455
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:11,860
this is a complete non-starter so it's
not the only way to fix Aug a texan but

456
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,310
it just

457
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:15,400
shows to be the lot the

458
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,490
the block to process and how we look at
these things

459
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:22,570
let someone to fix the accommodation
let's to fix the economy is Asian

460
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:26,110
the way I described you get the pics
clickjacking one way could

461
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:30,580
you could do it is you combat iframes
entirely or at least band transparent

462
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,270
iframes

463
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:35,390
so I think ideally the prosecutor should
be able to see

464
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:38,770
what they are actually clicked on if the
0

465
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:43,810
it breaks the web millions of web sites
can rely on I frantically transparent

466
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,520
iframe for central functionality

467
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,140
notable examples but you don't really
notice that our Facebook Gmail and Yahoo

468
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:49,720
Mail

469
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,650
that span I plan for use throughout
these particular thing so break

470
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:56,630
functionality would break the services
and the user than the browser vendors

471
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:58,040
were not like that very much

472
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,180
so that is a complete non-starter too so
we live with that risk

473
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:05,090
a browser Internet hacking

474
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:08,950
that's also not fixed we could create a
barrier in the browser between the

475
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:10,490
public and private networks

476
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:14,030
by prohibiting the inclusion a bar scene
1918 content

477
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:17,120
on non c 1980 web sites what I mean by
that

478
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,720
that means if I'm on a public website
but say might evil blog

479
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,170
I cannot force your browser to make
passive request to internal IP address

480
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:28,490
this as defined by RFC but just break
that

481
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:31,710
I thought that was a fine idea

482
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:35,320
I've been told otherwise I've been told
by the browser vendors that some

483
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,660
organizations actually

484
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:40,210
do include Internet content on public
web sites for thereafter

485
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:44,190
for their employees and here's the
bottom line: it does not violate

486
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:48,110
RC standards this is OK from NRC
standpoint a public website

487
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:51,670
can legitimately call private content
from private IP space

488
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:55,720
so volatile

489
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:59,100
actually required by up by web standard

490
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:02,260
so these

491
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:05,660
particularly the last one are known

492
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:10,640
won't fix issues so what that means is

493
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,640
but says say the internet hacking once
our internet web sites

494
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:17,370
are unsafe our browsers can be launch
platform for Internet attacks

495
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:21,460
Anna you know before I wasn't you know
too sure about this particular tactic

496
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,860
was a a real threat

497
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:26,370
but ok in the last a week leading up to
hack in the box with such they saw

498
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:30,240
a very a business backed up Lloyd I
believe in Brazil where a few million up

499
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,940
couple million internet DSL routers were
compromise using this particular attack

500
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:38,470
so it is a a real and growing threat so

501
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:42,110
but because there is some breakage in
this these particular fixes like making

502
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:45,020
that barrier out there because somebody
has

503
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:48,190
maginnis there's a company out there
that you've never heard of

504
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:51,070
you don't know their name you really
don't know they are you stating I never

505
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,280
go to their website

506
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,690
because the browser vendors need to
support them the rest of us have to be

507
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:59,860
our internets have to beat up in secure
to really weird scenario.

508
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,900
but to appreciate you must look at it
from their perspective

509
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:07,290
okay their choice is simple you have to
be you can be less secure

510
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:10,530
and more user adopted or you can be
subject here

511
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:13,730
an obscure because think about it if
they were to break that internet

512
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:14,400
functionality

513
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,850
and it even just one percent of the user
base all those business users with them

514
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:19,200
just

515
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,850
transfer to another browser and they'd
lose one percent market share

516
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:26,470
sure the other 99 percent would be nice
but the browser vendors will lose out

517
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:29,400
yet to see it from their perspective so
it's all about market share it's all

518
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,900
about trench warfare

519
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,450
every little feature at little thing
that they do for security or against

520
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:35,330
security

521
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:39,450
must improve market share or they won't
do it that and that breakage is critical

522
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:40,480
to that

523
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,980
and I'm constantly reminded of this fact
by by Dan Kaminsky

524
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:47,840
he actually set this tweet to me a a
while back nobody's break in the web

525
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,390
dude

526
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:52,450
not map of not ever and so far he's been
right

527
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:56,419
so what happens is in the break in the
browser security space

528
00:29:56,419 --> 00:30:02,070
because we can't fix these things by
default we and step get the secure flags

529
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:05,850
is on point solutions and there's you
know dozens of them

530
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:10,010
the salt incremental problems that are
all of them so we get secure flights

531
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,460
because in the beginning

532
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:14,880
we send cookies you know you know
cookies that were

533
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,070
credit over SSL we could force the
browser to send him over Nana

534
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:21,960
cell so then we got secure flights we
got HDPE only for cross-site scripting

535
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,290
attacks so they can access the cookie
data

536
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:28,560
we got extreme options for often
security on clickjacking some certain

537
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,570
pages

538
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:33,000
could say I don't want to be I friend
and that helped to an extent

539
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,080
and tell a page like oh facebook like
button

540
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,090
needed to be I friend we have struck
Transport Security

541
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:44,240
ex-con 10 Options content security
policy we are littered

542
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,460
in these point solutions that are all of
them by website owners

543
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:51,040
they have measurably lower adoption
rates and do not allow the user to

544
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,440
protect themselves thats

545
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,600
work right at

546
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,470
so I feel pretty confident that web
browsers are not safe

547
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:04,050
they are not secure and they do not
adequately protect your privacy

548
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:10,360
so this is gonna wait to up articulate

549
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,450
does anybody want to disagree

550
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:16,570
does anybody want to run their browser
into a website that I control specially

551
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:21,100
wanted to follow

552
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:25,620
sup what we did I talked about the
vendors all the time and

553
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:29,929
usually cost them much thanks but I
guess that's part of the job

554
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:33,600
so the status quo you know one option is
the status quo we keep doing what we are

555
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,530
what we've been doing

556
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:37,330
and we coming into the bar for a little
bit but right now it's just not very

557
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,800
good out there

558
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,200
on the other one which is kind of an
interesting model but I've been

559
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,410
following closely it's called not secure

560
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:47,450
I you receive on a curve of her the dot
security of the idea or

561
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:51,880
newtie all these come out be a dot
secure its gonna be the more secure web

562
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,730
arm the check this out to be an
interesting idea were

563
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:59,020
the the Registrar the TLD is gonna have

564
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:03,950
a certain benchmark for inclusion so if
you want to register

565
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:07,260
company accent dot secure rather than
dot com

566
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:10,640
you have to meet a certain security bar
I don't know what the bar as and I don't

567
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,510
know how they're going to audit

568
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:16,200
but it's kind of a way to start over you
know so we don't have all these problems

569
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,570
on the next generation of secure web so
what happens is

570
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:23,040
we're gonna have this new arguably
secure web

571
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:28,030
but then we transfer this legacy problem
to an adoption part now we somehow

572
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:32,090
up to convince all the major
corporations and all the website owner's

573
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:35,740
to move over to the new secure system

574
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:38,960
or third we can break the web and so far
no one's been

575
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:44,290
really willing to do it

576
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:47,590
so which case we have up

577
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:50,929
another model which I've been looking at
closely cuz I get asked all the time up

578
00:32:50,929 --> 00:32:55,580
what browser do you use sought I guess
I'll take a moment to talk about that

579
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:59,450
so I'll one of the things I I do for

580
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:03,070
my friends and family and my mom and dad
and all that sort of things right

581
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:06,929
I give them to web browsers I give them
their everyday web browser and then

582
00:33:06,929 --> 00:33:07,320
they're

583
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,360
bank in social networking bro or
something like that

584
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:15,120
so I say you use this browser only to do
your promiscuous browsing you know

585
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,210
I loaded up this much security stuff as
they can tolerate

586
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:22,220
and they visit news web sites and all
sorts of things but they I asked them to

587
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:25,720
never ever ever log in using their
browser not your web bank not to face

588
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,640
but nothing

589
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,040
it just for passive looking around
clicking on stuff people send you an

590
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,760
email on things like that

591
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,560
one you want to do something important I
give them a secondary browser

592
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:39,440
you know could be an anyone out there
could be Chrome Firefox

593
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,310
whatever and that's the 1i give them
their bookmark for web banking

594
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:46,590
you know social networking or whatever
they could

595
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:50,100
go to that site so they have to bother
when is over open the gate that site do

596
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,780
their business and they logged out our
close the browser whatever

597
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:56,830
what that does is if the promiscuous
browser it's a evil blog page or

598
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:57,780
something like that

599
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:00,730
and tries to pull off one other fact
that I mention here it's not going to

600
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:04,270
work because that browser has never been
to this particular web pages so

601
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:07,470
i've a cheese isolation I've broken the
web

602
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:12,149
and terms are applique isolation the you
know you can't hack

603
00:34:12,149 --> 00:34:16,190
my parents on their banking website from
evil blog because

604
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:20,919
you know that browsers never been there
so what I do experimenting with the

605
00:34:20,919 --> 00:34:24,010
and alas I guess you know

606
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:27,310
several months is something a little bit
more involved in that I've actually it's

607
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:29,540
not something I can have a different
body else because that

608
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:33,050
the its really hard so I take a copies
of

609
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:37,149
a i download my own version of chromium
and I'm on a file the code internally to

610
00:34:37,149 --> 00:34:40,070
you break the web and do the things that
I find that are important to compile my

611
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:40,980
own version so

612
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:44,720
when people ask what browser I use I
usually either lie and say

613
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:50,350
Chrome or Firefox right same I'm and
they kinda look anywhere

614
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:54,669
but this is my move towards this
particular scenario here

615
00:34:54,669 --> 00:34:58,109
so if you notice on the mobile
applications here the things I use on a

616
00:34:58,109 --> 00:34:59,250
little phones

617
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:03,700
all these little app here most to them
are just little many web browsers

618
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:07,030
you know they look at little many web
sites I can pay Powell and

619
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:11,620
you know and discover up there's many
website is a function that little many

620
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:14,250
isolated process of you to log in

621
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:18,940
using this many browser on Pay Pal
because this down the launch the AT&T my

622
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:19,890
wireless

623
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:22,780
they don't have these clickjacking
problems they don't across its repeated

624
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:23,400
problems

625
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,760
they don't have any other cross eye
problems because there is no cross-site

626
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,910
the sessions are isolated here so if
they cannot say that's pretty

627
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:32,589
interesting we've broken the web that
way

628
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:36,690
on the on the App Store maybe we could
do the same thing on the desktop

629
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:40,359
so I've been experimenting on my local
box there so actually make %uh versions

630
00:35:40,359 --> 00:35:41,680
of browsers for

631
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,130
for Facebook I have a chromium based
browser

632
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:48,800
that is has connection controls built
them that only goes to Facebook

633
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,109
so far what do something on Facebook or
LinkedIn your Gmail whatever I lost that

634
00:35:52,109 --> 00:35:53,430
particular browser

635
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:56,720
just automatically goes arts
automatically log in and lock down

636
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,470
you know way I think it should be locked
down by the the little icons on the

637
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:01,339
desktop

638
00:36:01,339 --> 00:36:05,870
so maybe just maybe a way to get around
the the web security break it out there

639
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:09,880
is to it for the desktop model for
desktop to adopt the

640
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,650
mobile app model so you have multiple
browsers on the desktop at

641
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:16,940
are not really browsers such as many web
app that this happened after transfer

642
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,660
HTML and you do it that way

643
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:21,810
seaga still have your you know your your
Chrome browser to do pure promiscuous

644
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:22,740
surfing

645
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:26,620
but anything quite a quite important
anything you don't want to get hacked

646
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:31,220
goes to one of these desktop app see
adopt a similar of after

647
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:34,750
I don't know if that'll work I'm not in
the browser space atomic money when

648
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:35,859
browsers are sold

649
00:36:35,859 --> 00:36:39,830
but it's a a way for me to achieve
safety on my personal life but I also

650
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:42,420
get the versions of my bro of browsers

651
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:46,490
a to my friends and family to experiment
with and a mess around with

652
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:50,730
and it seems to be working pretty good

653
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:54,100
so I am way early on time as and I
priced at three for

654
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:58,120
other areas faster than I should have
any questions

655
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:05,120
Sr

656
00:37:11,059 --> 00:37:13,880
would be banks because banks around the
world

657
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:17,549
have this internet banking thing in you
could be peeling

658
00:37:17,549 --> 00:37:20,880
any other money transaction website and
a highly regulated

659
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,869
d go to all sorts of things to to claim
to secure just to make people safely

660
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:28,130
unlike the Singapore government for
example

661
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:31,789
s been dated the banks have opens at you
know so you have to deal with

662
00:37:31,789 --> 00:37:33,049
indications feed your

663
00:37:33,049 --> 00:37:36,430
you need you've done is inconvenience
the user

664
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:41,119
but I think tell me if I'm wrong banks
will take a long time to do this because

665
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:45,079
they simply don't have to know how or
this line of a few in the world

666
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:48,440
to for them to employ right up dedicated

667
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:54,259
PC screen arm kept me up saying I think
this is a good idea I do not know if

668
00:37:54,259 --> 00:37:54,890
Windows

669
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:57,890
8 with those tile thing is trying to go
in that direction

670
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:02,049
I dot its I think the banks and I think
the banks at the very least might be

671
00:38:02,049 --> 00:38:03,880
interested in this particular model here

672
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,180
I don't know for sure but I think you're
right they probably don't have the

673
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:09,719
skills to write the software to manage
it to deploy and support and all that

674
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:10,920
all that sort of thing

675
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:14,769
but when I also think it's a one of the
challenges to adoption in the banking

676
00:38:14,769 --> 00:38:15,380
model

677
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:18,690
is that I have to do more than security
have to bribe

678
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:22,630
or mints and he's abuse at the same time
because security

679
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:26,920
as I've come to understand is not enough
to do something but what I found is

680
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,359
interesting I've been again playing
around with it locally

681
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:32,609
is if you control the website and the
technology underneath all the low

682
00:38:32,609 --> 00:38:35,239
balances and things like that and you
control the client

683
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:39,209
and all that what local storage in all
the caching you can cheat on performance

684
00:38:39,209 --> 00:38:42,269
you can pre tax and free download
everything locally

685
00:38:42,269 --> 00:38:46,430
and you get performance dance that would
never fly on regular generic browser

686
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:49,459
seeking do performance gains like that
and also you know

687
00:38:49,459 --> 00:38:53,339
what else can you do are what are the
other things I was thinking about in

688
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:55,039
this modeling I'm not in this business

689
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:58,559
I don't know I just conjecture on is
that up

690
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:02,109
if you're let's say into it right into
it makes quicken

691
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:06,229
make three versions a quick and they may
quicken for Windows quicken for mac and

692
00:39:06,229 --> 00:39:08,910
they also make online quick and so they
have three different dev team's

693
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:11,880
three different the way environments to
support three different platforms for

694
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,390
effectively the same product

695
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:16,829
one way this model might solve a lot of
people's pain is that

696
00:39:16,829 --> 00:39:20,799
you decide not to develop them the
Ostend and the windows-based virgins

697
00:39:20,799 --> 00:39:22,420
anymore you just go the online ones

698
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:27,180
and what you sell as but a quick in our
example is actually a desktop browser

699
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:30,719
that automatically goes to their website
and if you or your business there so you

700
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:32,660
get one dev team itself three

701
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:36,219
building for one platform instead of
three the web

702
00:39:36,219 --> 00:39:40,999
and you dat you know so you get
cost-saving and security at the same

703
00:39:40,999 --> 00:39:41,499
time

704
00:39:41,499 --> 00:39:44,660
that doesn't happen of so

705
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:47,749
maybe just maybe but we're kinda fancier
this kind of thing

706
00:39:47,749 --> 00:39:50,849
you know web technologies are still a
little unstable so

707
00:39:50,849 --> 00:39:55,969
we'll see but maybe you know questions

708
00:39:55,969 --> 00:39:59,589
yessir up

709
00:39:59,589 --> 00:40:03,749
I a little how much this

710
00:40:03,749 --> 00:40:07,039
like Private Browsing protect us

711
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:10,890
on you know some roses have that feature
I E

712
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:14,630
for by false for to to do proposing

713
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:19,440
art so we probably could attest to that
I am but I think so private browsing

714
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:19,849
mode the

715
00:40:19,849 --> 00:40:23,440
major thing it does is when you close
the browser all the cooking

716
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,779
patched up is deleted but a lot of times
what happens as people

717
00:40:26,779 --> 00:40:30,559
but say Private Browsing is the same
thing as tor

718
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:34,890
you'll be in private browsing are used
for and then you log into Facebook

719
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:38,609
which didn't boggles the mind right so

720
00:40:38,609 --> 00:40:42,209
it probably won't defend against a whole
lot what I would defend against

721
00:40:42,209 --> 00:40:47,109
probably is sistance so one of the
things I don't talk about but I probably

722
00:40:47,109 --> 00:40:48,170
should is a

723
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:51,660
coming over her to ever cuties ever to
do so

724
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:56,219
sup for those unfamiliar that so you
know the regular cookies Rica store

725
00:40:56,219 --> 00:41:00,599
went like this: can store

726
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:04,239
client-side data you know and a cookie
file but there's actually twelve

727
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:07,329
different places the browser that I'm
aware because for a quickie bike data

728
00:41:07,329 --> 00:41:10,339
so if you try to delete your cookies is
not exactly gotta work

729
00:41:10,339 --> 00:41:16,589
so one other things is let's say you're
a private browsing mode

730
00:41:16,589 --> 00:41:20,089
any store you get all this information
any store that users party in private

731
00:41:20,089 --> 00:41:20,509
note

732
00:41:20,509 --> 00:41:24,160
once they close the brosser you'd lose
that data forever so

733
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:28,679
you have perhaps got fixed you can still
know where the user was over time

734
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:31,729
and that's what's really problematic
about these particular techniques is an

735
00:41:31,729 --> 00:41:34,979
outcome presenting anything particularly
new from a technological standpoint all

736
00:41:34,979 --> 00:41:35,929
these attacks are now

737
00:41:35,929 --> 00:41:39,269
I mean all these attacks are
well-documented miss wiring together

738
00:41:39,269 --> 00:41:39,579
that

739
00:41:39,579 --> 00:41:42,709
I think rather cleverly so let's say
somebody

740
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:46,789
already did this you know somebody or
did all these things and they could get

741
00:41:46,789 --> 00:41:50,190
everybody know everybody has an out of
the running backs out there anymore

742
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:53,339
so private browsing mode would help you
in this case because we don't know what

743
00:41:53,339 --> 00:41:54,219
the bad guys already

744
00:41:54,219 --> 00:41:57,369
did that make sense so now is

745
00:41:57,369 --> 00:42:00,979
you gotta I think that the cookies and
make bad guys you know we lose their

746
00:42:00,979 --> 00:42:02,140
data over time

747
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:05,029
so they can't track as anymore that's
why also fingerprint is kinda important

748
00:42:05,029 --> 00:42:07,660
so

749
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:10,789
so to answer your question again in
brief terms if if

750
00:42:10,789 --> 00:42:13,929
if you run your private browsing mode
browser in your log into Facebook into

751
00:42:13,929 --> 00:42:14,709
my demos

752
00:42:14,709 --> 00:42:19,989
that's not gonna help that much

753
00:42:19,989 --> 00:42:23,009
your questions

754
00:42:23,009 --> 00:42:26,130
alright so all the code up next we got
it

755
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:31,049
run at a time so all that they are us
and i dont act about guys all this lies

756
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:34,630
I if you want the I haven't got a chance
to all them anywhere but if you want the

757
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:35,499
code just

758
00:42:35,499 --> 00:42:38,699
a semi in on a happy to share with you
all but but I'm not trying to hide

759
00:42:38,699 --> 00:42:40,269
anything you can have it all

760
00:42:40,269 --> 00:42:43,650
are well documented so in the meantime

761
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:48,219
thank you very much for your time up
there was an interesting

762
00:42:48,219 --> 00:42:52,239
thank you your mind

763
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:56,410
we still a fifty minutes for questions
so if you %ah I C one question

764
00:42:56,410 --> 00:43:01,940
popping up

765
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:05,199
I think the mean problem is the best
application

766
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:08,349
the you go back to the old classic more
the way

767
00:43:08,349 --> 00:43:11,569
to application can be was and unions and
then how

768
00:43:11,569 --> 00:43:15,799
to make sure that that application have
not been tempered

769
00:43:15,799 --> 00:43:19,299
how you is very challenging for

770
00:43:19,299 --> 00:43:22,640
like bangs to actually make sure that

771
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,160
the things that bad the woody to cut the
model downloads

772
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:30,900
or do things are how do you means ensure
that do those things are secure

773
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:34,650
not temple by today we have all those
marketplace

774
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:38,549
and then we have or those alternative
market place which also can

775
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:41,929
up would the something wary

776
00:43:41,929 --> 00:43:45,170
lights UN application day if

777
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:49,009
custom Bob we went to those marketplace
and download

778
00:43:49,009 --> 00:43:52,619
you have the same problem buddy sure so
I think that the basis that the question

779
00:43:52,619 --> 00:43:53,420
as a

780
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:56,900
we're gonna be downloading malicious
absent how to prevent ensure that the

781
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:00,339
malicious app on his our site is not
tampered with and some malicious way

782
00:44:00,339 --> 00:44:03,410
and I agree with you that is very
challenging and I think we should stop

783
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:04,279
trying

784
00:44:04,279 --> 00:44:09,319
I am NOT a penny virus so rather than
banks trying to

785
00:44:09,319 --> 00:44:14,079
authenticate the person or validate the
app as

786
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:18,029
I'm tamper with but sort of indicating
the transaction instead

787
00:44:18,029 --> 00:44:21,799
you know is this user actually making a
legitimate transaction should they be

788
00:44:21,799 --> 00:44:23,959
wired a hundred thousand dollars to
latvia

789
00:44:23,959 --> 00:44:27,979
or whatever the case may be because it's
not so much the user that's better that

790
00:44:27,979 --> 00:44:29,900
matters it's the transaction

791
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:33,160
so the banking customers that we
interact within the state's

792
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:36,489
and they basically decided that they've
lost the war for control the user's

793
00:44:36,489 --> 00:44:37,309
desktop

794
00:44:37,309 --> 00:44:41,029
they assume that the user's desktop is
compromise and how how do we do business

795
00:44:41,029 --> 00:44:41,999
with the user

796
00:44:41,999 --> 00:44:45,989
anyway under this scenario and in
particular countries a

797
00:44:45,989 --> 00:44:49,729
one particular large brand tells me
everybody and I everybody in Brazil's

798
00:44:49,729 --> 00:44:52,019
affectively compromise statistically

799
00:44:52,019 --> 00:44:56,849
which is and I'm they probably see an
update is probably true

800
00:44:56,849 --> 00:45:00,449
so they just go okay the user's
compromise now what do we do

801
00:45:00,449 --> 00:45:06,829
and that's just basically how they don't
even care about the climber

802
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:11,179
your questions

803
00:45:11,179 --> 00:45:15,029
I i'll be around the conference to
answer more a good

804
00:45:15,029 --> 00:45:22,029
are thank you very much your mind

805
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:33,720
this

806
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:40,720
sleep
