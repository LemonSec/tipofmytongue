1
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:10,410
up

2
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,320
space

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,150
school

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:21,150
skills

5
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,869
thank you this like psychic

6
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:31,560
okay so a little back to be working as a
lawyer for

7
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,420
four-and-a-half years now easy mostly
focused on building security and privacy

8
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,210
features

9
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:40,510
in a big car that for me as being
developing

10
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,570
the Firefox OS security model so this is

11
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,949
probably going to be a pretty dance
presentation cuz I mean

12
00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:51,680
no West cover a lot of stuff right so
all jump right in

13
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,140
I'm something we start with we talk
about Firefox OS

14
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,699
are you know what are the principles
what are the most important things you

15
00:00:58,699 --> 00:01:00,739
wanna designed a system from the
beginning

16
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:03,780
and then how do we determine that we
actually met our goals

17
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,090
so we said I was going to protect the US
from malicious at

18
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:10,540
a compromise aP's you want to protect
caps from each other

19
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:14,430
because otherwise developers have a you
a whole lotta work

20
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,180
on we only wish you use private data
with

21
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,800
user consent so the user has to be
involved in decisions that

22
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,500
at impact their data a

23
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,930
some Creek definitions so Firefox OS

24
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:34,159
is related to Flos also if you heard BTG

25
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,930
those that are internal codename for
what became Firefox OS

26
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:41,140
so if you confuse that's all the same
thing

27
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,720
so Firefox persistent

28
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,350
consists of a stack have layers liked in
each row s

29
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:51,850
it's actually a bunch of different stuff

30
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:56,100
so underlying everything is what we call
gone

31
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,860
which is on the 8th the the basic Linux
operating system and all the hardware

32
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,640
abstraction

33
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,270
so it's it's what a scare the radio
interfaces the video the audio

34
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,729
I'm storage US P E Bluetooth

35
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,030
all the local stuff a on top of that is
gecko

36
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:18,170
which is the core runtime that that
drives Firefox Thunderbird

37
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,970
FETAC gianna is what we call our you eye
layers

38
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:25,379
it's all the visible you why it's all
CSS and JavaScript

39
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:30,680
shemale somewhat better but your app's
and abs are all once again CSS a single

40
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,459
JavaScript

41
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:34,680
so guy is

42
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,340
the user interface for Firefox OS it's
also interface

43
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,389
model its 10 laps go through they talk
to the user like dialogues are all in

44
00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:42,799
guy

45
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:48,370
for example system dollars permission
lol Center as part of a guy a have a

46
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,739
buncha perhaps these are

47
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:53,639
built exactly the same with third party
apps are built so

48
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:56,719
the system at the home screen app all
core abs

49
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:59,980
Tyler sms/email camera music it's at our

50
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,859
are all written CSS AC Milan JavaScript
the

51
00:03:04,859 --> 00:03:09,019
only way they talk to the OS is through
all the funny PI's

52
00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:14,120
its ok echo supports a Sat APR exposed
to different classes applications

53
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:19,169
as the only way any app can talk to the
US and

54
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:22,249
in this model obviously we support
third-party apps

55
00:03:22,249 --> 00:03:26,419
so developers can write absence to lapse
and they are

56
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:30,760
essentially other than the permission
bits are exactly the same as as the app

57
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,480
spun wool

58
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,790
on the phone so below guy is ghetto

59
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,849
break echo is the engine and we say

60
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:42,790
echo is exactly the same engine we are
putting into Firefox

61
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:46,180
so a lot of the stuff they were building
in Firefox OS

62
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,489
is actually in Cork echo and knows
exactly the same code

63
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:55,099
that we ship with Firefox test of their
worship with Firefox

64
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:59,260
mobile and that we ship in Thunderbird
other produce these gecko

65
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,939
so we're not branching echoing are
creating a whole new platform for

66
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:04,079
Firefox OS rush

67
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:07,379
reusing have extending its what this the
Slayer

68
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:11,040
so this includes all of the

69
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,139
the HTML CSS JavaScript engines

70
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:18,380
although I'll OS abstraction

71
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,989
stuff that I mentioned earlier like
maybe your eyes when we think about

72
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:22,889
developing Web API to expose

73
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:26,190
access to contacts for example or

74
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:29,560
to you for a geolocation or a bunch
other

75
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,080
if he has a going to we think that we
think I've how to do that across the

76
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,580
whole

77
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,729
stacked with the Great Wall if and
develop a context if your house is a

78
00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:41,250
behavior on mobile has a bf on desktop
kids behave

79
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:48,250
on Android we have Firefox rendering so
initially Kong

80
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,780
is the very lowest layer raises all the
hardware abstraction

81
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,419
so the next colonel on its most to you

82
00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:02,000
existing open source of further using
we're not inventing

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,270
we're not writing off on you colonel
already a hole in you

84
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:10,009
abstraction layer there's no need to

85
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:13,220
and so when you think I've gone in our
model

86
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,750
its the underlying OS that is

87
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,099
targeted by gecko right so you can build
gecko

88
00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:23,180
for Mac OS you can build

89
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,830
for a sec to rate you can build echo for
Windows

90
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:30,460
different versions of Windows you can
build it for Android which is what

91
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,740
sendak does on Android and you can now
build it for

92
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:40,090
conch

93
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,120
and we are going to a lot of details
about third-party apps but

94
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:50,120
as I mentioned they're all the same
they're all CSS AC Milan JavaScript

95
00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:55,220
so the type so that's in the world right
if you think a

96
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:59,150
the kinds applications that exist
there's web sites web sites really are

97
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,240
applications

98
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,150
like whether gmail or group are

99
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:07,590
or air BnB you or whatever

100
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:11,169
their complex for applications that
happen to be hosted

101
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:14,830
on a server below the code when it runs
it runs on a client

102
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:18,199
it just gets not install but it gets
delivered dynamic

103
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:21,479
every time you visit the site love it
runs on the client

104
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:24,729
lover and the server

105
00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:28,860
and so it's not a stretch to bookmark
for those things and say well

106
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,110
nyren application on my device

107
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,960
that so much of a stretch to take some
the code that would normally be

108
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,080
delivered from the server every time

109
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,310
and persistent locally on your device
see you have to go we fetch the same

110
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,270
interface over and over again

111
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:47,449
its space be cashing it just explicit
Cassie with guarantees that

112
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:51,490
icon to will be there when you come back
and then there's no reason you can use

113
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,530
all those abs new computers while in use
in

114
00:06:53,530 --> 00:07:00,349
right exactly same application the same
language the same content

115
00:07:00,349 --> 00:07:03,500
says a picture motorcycle because it
carries a cool just in case you're

116
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,840
wondering

117
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,060
no other reason but we're developing
applications

118
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,900
we one those applications to run in
Firefox OS

119
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,909
want to run in where party which is our
run time for Android

120
00:07:16,909 --> 00:07:21,189
so if you get an apt for PDGF Android
phone you can choose to run the same app

121
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:25,020
on your Android phone we have away party
installed

122
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,719
and for desktop run it's a map in
Firefox in a dust-up

123
00:07:28,719 --> 00:07:32,770
10

124
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:35,979
so for Firefox OS

125
00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:39,469
an hour apart from this basically we
think Ive

126
00:07:39,469 --> 00:07:43,289
four kinds of applications right when I
guess that is just

127
00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:47,490
web content a website running in your
browser is an application

128
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:51,389
it doesn't persist but if you take an
application

129
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:55,610
that's on a Web site and book market
your home page

130
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:59,349
as far as the user device is concerned
it's an application even there really is

131
00:07:59,349 --> 00:08:01,770
just a link to a website

132
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:05,150
I'll so the next iPad application is

133
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:08,370
a website where developer the website

134
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:11,560
as explicitly chosen to have it be

135
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,960
treated as an application right in our
case in our model it is really creating

136
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,779
a manifest manifest as a file that
points to you

137
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:24,960
something says describes a location
application

138
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,789
the next door work is over calling a
privileged happens approves after more

139
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:33,590
similar to what you use to for example
with existing

140
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:38,210
a mobile operating systems so it's an
explicit bundle of stuff

141
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:42,140
right as access more API's as code
signing

142
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,980
as certain guarantees and properties at
the web doesn't have

143
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,270
because I have in general doesn't do the
great

144
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:53,090
really the world's best Java preventing
code injection for example

145
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:57,240
by default it's pretty easy right axis
as is just code injection

146
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,260
yes have certified up so if I taps are
core parts of the operating system

147
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,900
necessary for its correct functioning

148
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:08,170
so to go deeper

149
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:12,110
when we think I've designing with API's
you think I've design each AP any way

150
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,380
they can expose

151
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,510
as much as possible to interesting
content

152
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:20,460
right so say we want to design an API
for having access to

153
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:25,820
your location or your camera whatever
your we think first

154
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:29,470
how could be safe exposes to web content

155
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,990
and then you know there's some
properties about that are interesting

156
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,770
for example for camera you might wanna

157
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:38,170
exposed web content might have to be opt
in for every use

158
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:42,250
remain on to persist ability for an
arbitrary web site have access to your

159
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,740
camera

160
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,990
every time you get slower in some iframe
because maybe that's not really a great

161
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,530
model

162
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,560
but see safer web sites maybe we'll
expose

163
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,640
camera access only through some explicit
user often every time

164
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,180
but maybe if it's going to be. a

165
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,610
different an application if you have a
different access model to the camera

166
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:05,470
going to turn the moment

167
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:10,090
so jump work on them by the folk we
don't remember decisions you make if

168
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:13,430
your website you wanna give it your
location unit

169
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:17,680
I give it access your camera or or your
contacts

170
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,460
that decision is not persisted next time
you go back to that side

171
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,830
you'll have to ask again if you was have
access to your camera your contacts your

172
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,370
location

173
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:30,990
you can override that but that's the
fault state

174
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:34,080
when we take website in turn it in to
install the application

175
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,560
we don't really wanna change the
security properties because the

176
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,270
underlying federal has really changed
right like

177
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:42,420
that that say could still have excess
bugs

178
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,790
it still be delivered over plain text
you could have

179
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:48,990
service I injection issues and other
crazy stuff

180
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:52,830
i mean the cervical just be really
poorly configured to be easy on anybody

181
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,680
owns a server obviously owns

182
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,810
the application so

183
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:01,250
when we make website an application we
don't granted

184
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:05,000
much additional privilege merely all we
do is we give it a little bit if you

185
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,960
like candy

186
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:10,200
right we can see go fullscreen about
asking because these has chosen to

187
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,650
install use an application expects you
to use a city full screen

188
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:16,910
um henry give you the ability to store a
bit more data than you normally would

189
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,720
for rent a website is there any website

190
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,980
like you just visit some website you
really want to stir up into the air

191
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,880
but if you chose to install something
you've said have imply that this

192
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,430
something you wanna keep using

193
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:32,650
in you are willing to grant a little bit
more leeway in storage

194
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:36,650
um so we can access the same thing that
regular web sites can access

195
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:39,740
can repress actions location sensor
API's K

196
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:44,470
alarm API FM radio

197
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,160
sir privilege applications are different
for this application is

198
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,470
come in a zip file nom they have their
own ski

199
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:56,820
ap Colin scheme they have a constant
security policies

200
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,760
so if given her cunt is very policy
should read up on it

201
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,680
it's something that we came up with
essentially for its core purpose

202
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,140
was to address code injection attacks

203
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:12,880
so it's a way for developer to
declaratively to define a policy

204
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,100
that controls were cooking come from

205
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:20,460
that disables inline script disable was
a or restricts

206
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:24,690
loading love script files from only
specific

207
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:28,370
locations so use this in

208
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:33,370
a rat model to essentially change the
properties approves applications

209
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:37,330
to you preventing any cogeneration

210
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:41,370
so what happens is that you can load
JavaScript

211
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:45,140
from assets they came in the zip file
basically

212
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:49,300
a few total to do a scripture siegel's
from another server it won't work

213
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,900
we try to do in a valve archery data it
won't work

214
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:58,400
no window set I'm at work a new function
won't work

215
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,430
and obviously this distrust disrupt some
parents before Houston development but

216
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,010
those aren't we have

217
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:07,880
et cetera documentation a building that
the demonstrates how to work around it

218
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,020
so these are not in

219
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:13,320
insurmountable issues but I give you
some really nice properties you can now

220
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,460
say that

221
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,140
because that is running its application
is definitely the cody came in a zip

222
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,200
file

223
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,270
those deficits aim so that you reviewed
and approved

224
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:27,230
in the App Store and so because that you
can granted some more privileged because

225
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:31,160
if you use it makes the trust decision
to trust this particular application

226
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,960
with axes this API you know next time
you run the application

227
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,380
you running exactly the same code UN
before

228
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,850
and echoed is not trivial to inject code
into so therefore there isn't some other

229
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:42,560
third-party

230
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,660
running inside you can trust so this
means

231
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:51,840
they can have access persist in access
to high risk API's like alarm API

232
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:57,220
they can do raw TCP raw sockets I have
persistent access to contacts API

233
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:02,270
device to your GP I a browser API which
are going to bed

234
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:06,690
wifi information API I'll

235
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:12,120
and is also detail about how these are
made available taps that

236
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,380
I'll go to in a few size because it's
not that every app just has access to

237
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,230
all these things

238
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:23,070
so certified apso really very small soda
maps

239
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:26,700
these are things that are essential to
the operating systems correct

240
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,590
functioning

241
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:30,780
so it's tough like a dialer it is

242
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:37,780
vs an asset it is the Settings app is
the contacts

243
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,030
these are things that need to work

244
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:45,550
and they need certain API's

245
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,560
in order for the device to work so we
don't ask the user

246
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,750
we don't prompt the user about whether
or not a surfeit applications have

247
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,340
access to the API's that it needs

248
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:59,660
because for example if you ask the user
with the Settings app should have access

249
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,370
the settings API and they say no

250
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:05,950
you have a broken device if you

251
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:09,750
ask the user with the phone app should
have access to tell if a knee

252
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,910
you now have a broken telephone if they
say no

253
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:17,840
so these are things that from don't ask
for permission

254
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,270
which is also why is a very small said
about said what we do not want this to

255
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,500
be a common use case

256
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,780
this is only for things are essential to
the device correct functioning

257
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:31,060
as a lot of them you can see that it's
tough to bility to launch and manage

258
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,110
back on services

259
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:37,140
its direct access to the SMS API to the
telephony API

260
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:44,140
Bluetooth connection settings power
management et cetera et cetera Center

261
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:51,420
so weird about how data is managed so
each application has its own data store

262
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,710
this includes cookies right so

263
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:59,050
I'll is has a nice properties one of
them is that

264
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:02,520
you we can keep track of all the data at
the apt

265
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,700
creates an rights to the device say
means

266
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,990
when you wanna either legal that a road
to the the application we can guarantee

267
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:12,200
you can delete all the corresponding
data

268
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:17,630
the app created it also means that
cookies are separate from app to app

269
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:20,910
so they do not sure the one cookie store

270
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:24,630
so an app that loads an iframe from site
a

271
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:27,820
and have a different set a cookie is in
a different app that loads and I frame

272
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,890
from site

273
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:33,110
this is you know it's it's it's a
decision

274
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:37,100
we made design decision we decided to
favor privacy over

275
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:41,640
use cases that was that would be better
for having a shake with the store

276
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,730
at than those in turn result in coming
Ling

277
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:48,580
that makes it impossible to actually
told what ap what cookies

278
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:52,480
this when you want to leave now

279
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,790
segment apso launched in this device

280
00:16:55,790 --> 00:17:00,270
so abscam me started on you 11 number
ways mister by the user directly

281
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:04,579
by clicking on a nap on they can be
launched

282
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:08,740
by the system it's one other there lived
a privileged API's

283
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:13,120
a certified API's at the system that has
access to

284
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,140
they can be launched by web activities
alarm API application API

285
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,490
so web activities which I have

286
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:24,500
almost lies on later web activities are

287
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,720
ways that app scan of into handling
certain things

288
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,490
writes an app to say I handle PDS

289
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:35,640
if you click on a PDF in some peace in
an app says

290
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,800
have this PDF but I don't do PF I want
this to open as PDF in something you

291
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,520
know fire

292
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,970
where activity say open a PDF an app's

293
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:47,300
on the device is a registered to open
pts

294
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,350
through activities can is a I'll take
your

295
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:53,990
right side so we have launched an app
with a specific PC data

296
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:57,290
but a nap has to choose to participate
in that model

297
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:01,200
and to choose to consume no specific
kinds of activities

298
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,290
alarm API is maybe a bit of a misnomer

299
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:07,370
I alarm it does not like an alarm clock
API

300
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:10,470
alarm API is away for an apt to say

301
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:14,250
wake me up in a certain time have to do
something

302
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:18,540
right so this is it away an app can do
polling inside to wake itself up every

303
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,900
hour to do something go back to sleep

304
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,050
but that is we have launched you know
write the app is choosing to be launched

305
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:29,190
at a certain time

306
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:33,290
notification API a something similar in
a sense that

307
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:36,760
you might have indication that comes in
about a

308
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:42,120
a to a push notification rate so your
app has received a message in a cousin

309
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,670
to the notification bar

310
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:47,290
and uses ogo gonna go take your this may
click on the notification

311
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:54,050
notification bar that'll launch the app
to handle the notification

312
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:58,130
to ease you can't launch an application
wanna cannot launch another

313
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:01,940
sap a canned salmon launch p directly

314
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,960
only through web activities if the if
they know that

315
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,280
at p consumes a certain activity they
want it

316
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,770
passed to it they can launch an app
directly

317
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:15,580
and even though its Web Content you
can't actually launch another

318
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:19,330
she can't buy frame yes you can say
iframe

319
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:22,420
source equals ap colon slash slash

320
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:28,820
insured here we don't support that

321
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:31,910
an app's closing them is pretty simple
you too close indirectly

322
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:35,080
using a task list or

323
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:42,080
the OS will secure laps as it sees fit
as resources become scarce

324
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:49,840
so the way to to get a deeper is the way
that we actually implement this is that

325
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,529
the system app launches abs

326
00:19:53,529 --> 00:19:56,710
inside have what we call on moesha frame
I'm

327
00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:02,360
so only a system that can create these
kinds iframes he creates a separate

328
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,880
data jar so some essentially means is
that there's

329
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,440
tradition the browser and ap

330
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:15,080
is defined by an origin I do me we've
extended that model

331
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:19,889
to save that not only can origin create
a domain but also

332
00:20:19,889 --> 00:20:23,130
an app I D can create a dummy so

333
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:26,620
when you when a system that creates this
iframe

334
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:30,590
moesha my friend is basic reading you
don't need a new context for now

335
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:33,760
an apt

336
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,740
run inside a constant process right
they're not actually privilege processes

337
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,789
and the profs the privileges as
processes have

338
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:44,309
are commensurate to the ATI have access
to

339
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:48,679
but no more your service

340
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:53,029
other kids second kind of special iframe
it's called a MAS browser

341
00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:56,250
so this is for aP's that

342
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:00,389
intend to behave like a browser right
there to navigate the content on to

343
00:21:00,389 --> 00:21:01,090
provide

344
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:04,539
you wanna probably provide were
displayed lots a different kind to

345
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:06,769
conserve the user that may not be really
design

346
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:10,519
the consummate be designed to be iraq
that app specifically

347
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:14,080
so this allow those the

348
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,779
at using most browsers have a little
more control than normally would over

349
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:22,139
overnight free and I finale of Glee you
can't see it happening it's okay

350
00:21:22,139 --> 00:21:25,980
I'm in this case there's a couple
changes one is that

351
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:29,590
child when asked which we know that I'll

352
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:33,820
gets its own window back it doesn't get
the parent window

353
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:37,059
which is normally would happen the
browser if you have any browser you have

354
00:21:37,059 --> 00:21:37,880
a window

355
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,419
they create an iframe and iframe

356
00:21:41,419 --> 00:21:45,360
wants to know what the windows out top
is will actually get the parents

357
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,200
this case as far as the child is
concerned it is the top is no idea its

358
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,029
fame by something

359
00:21:50,029 --> 00:21:53,639
and also allows that the the parent to
have a little more visibility what's

360
00:21:53,639 --> 00:21:55,320
happening so can handle events

361
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:59,010
but we're loading redirecting et cetera
us to present its duties

362
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:02,690
is use a comedic effect user certain
browsers stay

363
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:06,889
related to what the the child process a
child frame is doing

364
00:22:06,889 --> 00:22:11,909
was a pretty bad graphic attempting just

365
00:22:11,909 --> 00:22:16,139
display this is a imagine that they are
on the outer

366
00:22:16,139 --> 00:22:20,919
border here are the winner is a system
right and so it's decided to you

367
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:24,240
I launch an actual third party app

368
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,029
call casar com and that embeds

369
00:22:28,029 --> 00:22:32,289
and I framed it also suffering cats are
in this case

370
00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:35,929
they have the same cookie store workers
are in the same app in the same to me

371
00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:40,129
but if there's

372
00:22:40,129 --> 00:22:43,230
if if in return that actually uses

373
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:47,049
a must press right frame the most
browser

374
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:50,950
because it behaves like a browser will
create a separate editor for that so the

375
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:57,950
the cookies and all the data that is
stored to be treated separately sorry we

376
00:22:58,179 --> 00:22:58,769
spent

377
00:22:58,769 --> 00:23:02,220
for the book but I mean one thing that
was interesting at this process is

378
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:05,850
my ghost designers in the public domain

379
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:10,440
so if you know why we came decisions we
came to about the camera repair for

380
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,120
example

381
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,120
there is a 120 email thread you can read

382
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,139
on missile it have b2g

383
00:23:17,139 --> 00:23:21,059
about how we came decisions around the
camera Commission model

384
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:25,429
we spent a lotta time designing in
discussing how to build the Commission

385
00:23:25,429 --> 00:23:26,610
monica is really

386
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:29,720
or what manifests a secure email to most
people

387
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:34,019
so if you think about how a nap

388
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:38,450
asks for permissions arm there's a
couple

389
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:42,299
hard properties about this by are a mean
not flexible

390
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:47,139
they need to reinforce so all
permissions all

391
00:23:47,139 --> 00:23:50,610
API permissions and happen each in each
care in the manifest

392
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:53,690
if an app ask for permission it's not
declaring the manifest

393
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:58,379
you'll always be denied news on every
front at fort are the value there is

394
00:23:58,379 --> 00:23:58,889
that

395
00:23:58,889 --> 00:24:03,520
if you as a reviewer as a user wanna
stand what nafta possibly do

396
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,590
you can search just by looking the
manifest know that if

397
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:10,080
it's on the manifest the app can do it
you can ask for

398
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,700
and insider that mister commissions

399
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:18,070
in the manifest the basic be opinion
that type of application Nokia

400
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:21,899
there's two kinds of emissions is
implicit and explicit

401
00:24:21,899 --> 00:24:25,429
all that really means is whether or not
they're prompted for explosive

402
00:24:25,429 --> 00:24:28,399
conditions require explicit user consent

403
00:24:28,399 --> 00:24:32,700
before the granted implicit ones don't
send up a submission

404
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,450
if an app as an implicit permission it's
manifests and is being

405
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:40,659
concert approve appropriate approval
process for the type of application

406
00:24:40,659 --> 00:24:44,490
then it will be granted at runtime

407
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:50,100
um if its explicit type commission which
are most privacy sensitive permissions

408
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:55,639
then you'll have to be the manifests and
it has to be approved by the reviewer

409
00:24:55,639 --> 00:24:59,260
the application will be and it has to be
granted by the user

410
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:03,200
runtime: so

411
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,470
one thing that might be different from
your use to you lectures on the from the

412
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:08,379
US model is that the permissions are

413
00:25:08,379 --> 00:25:13,649
a time use so if an app needs three or
four provisions that require prompting

414
00:25:13,649 --> 00:25:14,460
for

415
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:17,740
will usually not see a three or four
Commission problems in the first

416
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,419
launched yet

417
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:21,429
because all sorry doesn't need all those
right away

418
00:25:21,429 --> 00:25:26,450
we only prompt for permissions when the
apec tries to use the car is funny

419
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:31,270
yeah rights if you're going to nap it's
like a social efforts and say this

420
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:35,039
ap points at access whatever I want want
access your camera

421
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,480
to take pictures and stuff whatever
eating for lunch right

422
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,789
he wants your location to find you on
the map

423
00:25:41,789 --> 00:25:47,159
and maybe once access your contacts you
can sure where you are with your friends

424
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:50,200
it won't do all that when it first
launches

425
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,409
right only we want to do this activity
we get a prompt and the way that the

426
00:25:53,409 --> 00:25:54,159
application

427
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,460
prompts you is doesn't actually say ask
his permission

428
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:00,529
he just simply tries to use the API

429
00:26:00,529 --> 00:26:04,139
so once in at ask relocation

430
00:26:04,139 --> 00:26:07,830
then we handled permission problems and
the in the developers have to worry

431
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:11,360
about it

432
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,760
so this is essentially a

433
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,250
not the final you excuse us a little
rough but this is the US for permission

434
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:21,049
problems what it looks like

435
00:26:21,049 --> 00:26:25,299
arm and you can see is that one
difference between privileged Epson on

436
00:26:25,299 --> 00:26:27,110
for these applications is

437
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:30,389
that remember my choice the fault is
different for privileges ap sweet

438
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:32,769
because the code can change

439
00:26:32,769 --> 00:26:35,909
without being be reviewed we're pretty
confident

440
00:26:35,909 --> 00:26:39,480
issues aside to grant an application
access

441
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,629
to something you will make it

442
00:26:42,629 --> 00:26:47,480
decision most likely again and again and
when we don't want with prompting model

443
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,519
Lisa always keep asking the user
repeatedly the same question

444
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:56,179
about them be up to basically say don't
ask me again just my decision

445
00:26:56,179 --> 00:27:00,039
you can always change this later so if
you make the wrong decision is a

446
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:03,090
grant access this thing and remember my
choice

447
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:06,200
and you say week later like that's not
what I want

448
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:11,210
you just go change but the main
difference between club was absent from

449
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:12,379
his abs is that

450
00:27:12,379 --> 00:27:16,149
was abt by the former member their
permission

451
00:27:16,149 --> 00:27:19,750
responses so once again

452
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:23,159
if you change your mind if you going to
the wrong permission to nap we just

453
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:24,419
don't have access anymore

454
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:27,639
whips then you can just go

455
00:27:27,639 --> 00:27:31,429
into the Settings app find a
corresponding ap and

456
00:27:31,429 --> 00:27:34,950
change permissions to what you want or
just simply inspector si with the

457
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:41,950
permission is granted to that
application or

458
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:45,210
we also arm

459
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:48,480
try to do you as much as we can
persistence

460
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,590
a background and get notifications on
commission usage

461
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:57,149
so if n application is using location

462
00:27:57,149 --> 00:28:01,279
it'll you get this icon and miss not
that to rate this is in the role very

463
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,149
good location

464
00:28:02,149 --> 00:28:06,029
look notification is using your location
but it's true for camera and a couple

465
00:28:06,029 --> 00:28:07,250
other API's

466
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:11,139
so you can always know if you're not
sure this reminder there

467
00:28:11,139 --> 00:28:17,720
that this app is using this API you
previously granted access to you

468
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,230
so it's a certain web activities before

469
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:24,419
this is actually a lot I've caps will
get access

470
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:27,849
when they don't have a lot of privilege

471
00:28:27,849 --> 00:28:32,020
right so if you are at this social app I
mentioned before

472
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:35,490
your it take a picture of whatever you
having for lunch right

473
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:39,480
yeah you could implement a whole camera
at inside your social API

474
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:43,599
inside your social probably a better
thing to do is just simply fire with

475
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:44,539
activity says

476
00:28:44,539 --> 00:28:49,629
these organic picture raises example how
effective is work is a you have

477
00:28:49,629 --> 00:28:53,129
the fall camera app will be registered
as net as a handler

478
00:28:53,129 --> 00:28:57,220
for the take a picture activity give me
a picture activity

479
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:01,980
and then the social app it simply go I
wanna pictured fire affectivity

480
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,520
I would start the camera app a camera
you should go take a picture with a

481
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,780
camera app

482
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:10,830
and no that picture be there and it back
to the application that made the request

483
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,760
in the first place

484
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,909
what's nice about that is that the
developer doesn't have to

485
00:29:15,909 --> 00:29:19,349
credo camera happen so the social app

486
00:29:19,349 --> 00:29:22,429
your have to grant that ap

487
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:25,629
camera access rate if

488
00:29:25,629 --> 00:29:29,429
it fires of web activity event for a
camera you know when I take a picture

489
00:29:29,429 --> 00:29:30,580
you just cancel

490
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:35,580
there in you can take a picture so it's
a very simple model enables a lot of

491
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,849
functionality for autographs about
having to

492
00:29:37,849 --> 00:29:44,599
worry about granting them direct access
to those API's

493
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:47,929
um so

494
00:29:47,929 --> 00:29:51,159
we we do think alike piracy winded
developing a small received you know

495
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:53,179
track as an option there

496
00:29:53,179 --> 00:29:57,039
but the primary things there we we
always ask you

497
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,940
for access to privacy sensitive API's
every after was a tax issue occasions

498
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,710
your contacts

499
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:06,270
to your camera to a few other API's

500
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:10,889
unless a surfeit up always has that
asked the users as no surprise

501
00:30:10,889 --> 00:30:14,750
right if an app its access your contacts
to be only because he granted access to

502
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:15,129
its

503
00:30:15,129 --> 00:30:18,230
to your contacts at some point

504
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:21,320
and as per their you can always change
your settings you can do is go

505
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:25,190
here the day different application and
you can always there is always a race

506
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,220
win you

507
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:33,039
on its all the applications while

508
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:37,599
as part of the US have to figure out how
to clean protect the OS as well

509
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:41,289
so we've done a couple ways if you look
at the boot sequence just give as a

510
00:30:41,289 --> 00:30:44,440
server high-level review

511
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,710
when it boots up have the next are
afraid

512
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:53,270
you have kiko starts we censor its shell
dubs dual

513
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:57,690
which is a container essentially for
what Lose a Guy system

514
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:01,500
which then Lowe's the home screen app
which then

515
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:06,529
registers the core system installed
absent handle stuff like with activities

516
00:31:06,529 --> 00:31:07,520
for

517
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,080
event activities for our system
activities for

518
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,679
um SMS and being telephone handling

519
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:18,590
radio state wifi too much other core
system

520
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:22,659
operations what this looks like an code
is that a basic a window which is the

521
00:31:22,659 --> 00:31:24,869
Gecko chrome shelled out sole

522
00:31:24,869 --> 00:31:27,980
inside as an iframe that is a system app
is so there's a knife a which is the

523
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:31,940
home screen app and so forth

524
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:35,090
so if you want to visually presented it
looks something like this we have

525
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:38,960
in Firefox we've actually visually

526
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,000
three diff 3d defining

527
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,849
layout right like window Leah and that
cute idea I've

528
00:31:45,849 --> 00:31:51,210
others actually built in memory

529
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:55,129
so very we look at protecting from each
other's

530
00:31:55,129 --> 00:31:59,139
is each other princes no in its own
content process right so

531
00:31:59,139 --> 00:32:04,549
is a kids each other's dater cookies
they can't Sierra process low

532
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:09,129
an app can launch a frame another app
and with the process permissions are

533
00:32:09,129 --> 00:32:12,830
equivalent to the manifest permissions
which means that

534
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:17,970
if you're at doesn't need access to a
camera

535
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:24,909
the process itself has no access the
camera anyway

536
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:28,309
so the way ap stock to the OS is over
APC

537
00:32:28,309 --> 00:32:32,659
right so each app process a little
rights process

538
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:36,270
if you don't have access to much if
anything it has to go ask echo Ford

539
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:42,320
and it doesn't through this basically a
a pipe and I PC channel

540
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:48,409
and well that's it

541
00:32:48,409 --> 00:32:53,129
there is and OS update moderate and the
update models actually different

542
00:32:53,129 --> 00:32:54,980
depending on what you're talking about
gone

543
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:59,169
for SES gecko versus applications so

544
00:32:59,169 --> 00:33:02,210
the underlying OS the the next

545
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:05,500
layer is basie up the rover

546
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,750
OT update over-the-air updates or USB

547
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:12,820
you can plug it into your computer in
Flushing

548
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:16,059
taken geyer are actually kinda the same
you can

549
00:33:16,059 --> 00:33:19,129
they're basically if our normal these
process the way

550
00:33:19,129 --> 00:33:22,460
release Firefox's re-release gecko
updates

551
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:25,510
Hurley's Firefox OS updates and

552
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:30,500
likewise neither do you the over-the-air
updates which is 702 update or you can

553
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:34,349
have an image on your device you flash
directly or you can be your flesh is a

554
00:33:34,349 --> 00:33:36,270
vice

555
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:40,339
an app at updates are handled
individually which is to say that

556
00:33:40,339 --> 00:33:44,770
because apso neck chip to come from a
certain app store

557
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:48,109
each app can be responsible for its own
up the process

558
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:52,080
the mechanisms the same but taking the
fine with the updates are posted

559
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,500
the notification mechanism

560
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:01,279
et cetera I love I wanna give lots of
times for questions and cue way

561
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:07,580
Santos is kinda crazy complex model and
I've blown through pretty quickly

562
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:14,580
okay

563
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:26,350
I got most except the very last part

564
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:38,140
okay so we so we we've taken a different
approach their

565
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:41,210
on abt can change the policy

566
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:46,600
so the policy for privileges absence or
perhaps is actually enforced by

567
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:51,730
by gecko and it's not modifiable the app
we have

568
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:56,080
we have a bugger working on which is the
ability for

569
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:01,050
an app to specify turns his piece of
policy that pose in Rome OCSP

570
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:04,690
policy intersection rules which is
actually means they can only for the

571
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:05,490
restrictive

572
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:09,690
rights right now if you have to UCSD
policy somehow

573
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:13,050
in a browser you can only well

574
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:16,310
you don't have the intersection love
their privileges

575
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:23,310
right or the Union other restrictions I
really think about it

576
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:37,280
we as a society we actually have a
minimum CSP to prevent any dynamic

577
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,770
cogeneration and restricts code loading

578
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:43,500
only from the app package and the
developer can

579
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:50,500
can't lose

580
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:02,960
you're so we have a we're the source had
a project for PDF JS for some time

581
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,140
it's actually you can it's carnival was
an extension events for you

582
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:12,400
in a building to the browser once it's
fully bakes but it's a way of rendering

583
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,720
PF entirely JavaScript and

584
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:19,790
that is this an implementation of that
in BG in Firefox OS

585
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:24,300
that is registered as a PDF and city hit
a PDF file

586
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:28,180
basic PDP if such as really registers
registered itself

587
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:35,180
for the PDF handling activity

588
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:42,880
it is possible and the user with an the
printer a choice

589
00:36:56,610 --> 00:37:03,610
Mon

590
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,670
a lot of problems with the Android app
sees

591
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:12,729
might for example the makers like
Samsung install these unseemly highly

592
00:37:12,729 --> 00:37:15,969
privileged applications that totally
defeat the entire

593
00:37:15,969 --> 00:37:18,989
permission in security model how do you
see

594
00:37:18,989 --> 00:37:23,779
Firefox OS protecting its carriers and
makers doing these types of activities

595
00:37:23,779 --> 00:37:27,029
it's an excellent question so its

596
00:37:27,029 --> 00:37:31,059
he answered it is for gonna seem a
little

597
00:37:31,059 --> 00:37:34,569
obscure but I think it's actually one is
such a question a brain

598
00:37:34,569 --> 00:37:37,839
right so for gonna ship something call
the fire for

599
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:42,660
Firefox OS device were you want to make
sure that manifests

600
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:47,940
are police radar brain everyone to
protect user

601
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:53,589
which is not one with atomic crap that
the user doesn't want to think and to

602
00:37:53,589 --> 00:37:53,960
the

603
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:59,859
so anything that we what have brain is a
Firefox OS devices users gonna be

604
00:37:59,859 --> 00:38:05,039
always basically top of the food chain
so they have ability to uninstall

605
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:08,759
eighty others think or critical
privileged a certified applications

606
00:38:08,759 --> 00:38:13,249
necessary for OS operation a buncha
stuff on that uses one thing just delete

607
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:13,609
it

608
00:38:13,609 --> 00:38:17,079
yes you don't want a ton I've random
junk on their to begin with because it's

609
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:18,229
just a great experience

610
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:23,509
that said it's an open source project
rights or something to take the code

611
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:28,249
and implement something based upon a and
not using you for bringing

612
00:38:28,249 --> 00:38:31,349
you know like that's open source right
am i do that

613
00:38:31,349 --> 00:38:38,349
but then it's not going to call Firefox

614
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,900
I have a question about permission model
so

615
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:51,140
when you say for instance yes the yup
request internet access

616
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:55,279
if I say don't though with the up just

617
00:38:55,279 --> 00:39:00,140
say no and exit or we'll believe think
know your two questions to know so

618
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:00,660
there's

619
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:03,690
the model for developing

620
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:08,170
farrell for developers is that they
should

621
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:11,780
the need to handle the case that

622
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:15,050
every explicit permission may be denied
by the user and the need to continue

623
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:15,450
running

624
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:18,800
so we do not want people to be
browbeaten into granting permission

625
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:24,110
saying where you get his permission I'm
gonna quit right we handle that is for

626
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:26,490
privilege applications you go through a
review process

627
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:31,510
and we find applications as try to bully
the user into saying yes

628
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:35,420
we will not approve and so you don't
approve them

629
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:39,380
you end up with a nap you can't do much
anyway make it to care for these

630
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,420
applications that I have access to very

631
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,420
interesting API's and therefore user
just

632
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:51,420
probably even install along that same
line so what happens if you want to

633
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:57,740
it's in applications requesting internet
access or access to a third party

634
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:01,430
it is it going to display this site that
is trying to access

635
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:04,780
that my concern here is that a lot of
these applications

636
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:08,530
have this basically adware spyware
whatever is installed

637
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:11,950
you granted permission for maybe
internet access but it's also

638
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:16,160
using that seem chain or that same
permission to send it to a third-party

639
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:16,830
for

640
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:20,440
whatever reason yes we we face some

641
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,930
a tricky choices when trying to decide
how to

642
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:27,090
implementers so that

643
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:30,630
we well

644
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:33,660
I'll take brief I was actually pretty
explicit that I wanna have

645
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:37,670
et cetera a huge their permissions now
2010 by people about

646
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:40,960
this is trying to do is very specific
thing to this particular site because

647
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,780
the sheer number positions will

648
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:46,180
just cause people to totally 29 not

649
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:49,600
really treatment decisions anymore I'm
so

650
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,790
we don't from for internet access in
jail for example does not have

651
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:54,190
permission we think is meaningful

652
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:58,820
you know where because the web is you
know it is what it is but

653
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:02,210
the nation the web is it that that
communication

654
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:05,840
patterns are essentially managed by

655
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:10,430
site opting in to communicating with
each other not the user saying I'm gonna

656
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:11,140
allow this site

657
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:16,010
talk to that site rockers like like
cognitively that's impossible for users

658
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:16,730
to manage

659
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:20,790
so we try to only ask for things that
are

660
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:25,330
really piracy impactful and for the rest
other things

661
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:29,720
we rely on the review process rate so
unprofor's applications like I said

662
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:33,170
are really just like web sites says the
same model

663
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:36,820
I don't ask for a lot but they can't do
much you

664
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:39,990
now if they wanna do more then

665
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:42,960
that you go through different model
requires an approval process review

666
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:43,620
process

667
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:47,930
and we rely on the review process to
manage their

668
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:51,610
risk from a low level security
standpoint rights of Annapolis have

669
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:53,070
access to like raw socket

670
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:56,770
in issue for those that we'll take a
look at that is like

671
00:41:56,770 --> 00:42:01,880
why are you using cross-eyed is a really
responsible for you to use this or are

672
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,550
you just

673
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:05,650
using something with the SKECHERS case
you know I can be approved

674
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:11,220
she won't have that privilege and then

675
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:14,800
when we asked to use when I only ask the
user for privacy impactful things we

676
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,430
have a chance

677
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:18,590
action is anyway it's about one thing we
do is we actually

678
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:21,760
we have the ability for the developer
matching cars

679
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,960
uses to specify recalls an intended
usage

680
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:30,140
so when I say only use I need access
your camera

681
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:33,330
I can't you see I'm gonna I want you to
access your

682
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:36,800
ever for the purposes of love taking a
picture

683
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,230
love love your avatar for the social
network for you whatever

684
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:44,710
on and thats further review process

685
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:48,910
so you say I want taxes can for purpose
I love which had actually make sure that

686
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:50,650
that is actually using it for

687
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:53,750
and then that did

688
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:57,600
communication the uses of a meaningful
because you not just askin

689
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,850
API access question we actually asking
about access to information

690
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:03,900
these is put in a better position to to
decide about

691
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:09,240
thank you know one final question

692
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:12,500
have you thought about how that review
processes

693
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:17,430
is going to scale yes

694
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:21,830
so there's a couple characteristics one
exit we don't wanna

695
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:25,090
have it on us right arm

696
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:29,210
to use it there time with use and so
it's unlikely you'll hit these over and

697
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:30,920
over again at the same time

698
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:36,450
right I would say that we have because
you the ability to persist that decision

699
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:41,290
it gives a lot more flexibility user
decides that yes this is a decision I

700
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:42,520
wanna persistent

701
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:46,500
rate like I use you know had an iPhone
for a while and as an inservice was a

702
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,380
very simple app

703
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:50,840
or the next bus app it's a web-based or
tells you

704
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:56,580
is like what causes it to be showing up
soon for your location

705
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:59,890
so easy location to do that

706
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:04,040
in every time I run it like it always
asks me if it's okay to have access to

707
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:04,700
your location

708
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:08,650
like the only reason to run this app
said access to my location data buses

709
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:09,230
are coming

710
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:12,420
like I will never say no to that so
don't ask me so like

711
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:16,270
we've built in these better flexibility
with the using make a decision

712
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:19,630
and they can say for this thing always
I'll

713
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:23,130
this thing always denied for this thing
house me

714
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:26,080
and so there'll be some maps but still
like you look at the total number

715
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,710
Commissioner Christmas absolutely

716
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:32,830
like even very complex ones you talking
about maybe like 3

717
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:37,250
over the whole like over the whole all
the could pass near

718
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:44,250
right off or at most so it's you don't
ask for lost

719
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:48,610
know what order there than there yes
ever-growing it's like okay I'll make

720
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:49,220
friends

721
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:52,880
win I'm last question I had was
specifically around the

722
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,670
iframe and the malls browser frame the
described

723
00:44:56,670 --> 00:45:00,580
say he said permissions you know it's
the weapon

724
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:03,900
everything like that say heavy thoughts
about

725
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:07,460
where sites literally in bed other sites
get these

726
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:10,740
authenticate them for example still the
cookie because at the moment seems

727
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,510
there's nothing stopping that's on life

728
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:16,390
re skinning a fake browser for example
and having access

729
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:19,640
so you don't have access the cookies for
you in either the I

730
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:23,120
in I the case they're not stored in some
addressable

731
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:27,130
local storage mechanism within the app
that's correct so we still manage all

732
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:28,900
the quirky

733
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:32,490
we so amazing he's receiving have this
from the browser right the browser

734
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:36,110
you have the window top top

735
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:40,720
right is the the witches in Europe or
naked in bed many iframe sure

736
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:45,480
and he has no access to you anything or
the cookies and I frame because

737
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:49,350
that his party the principal we look at
whether does

738
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:53,250
the code in principle a have access to
code in principle be your window be

739
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,860
with the principles compare them with
the same in tonight if they announce

740
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:56,910
that sells

741
00:45:56,910 --> 00:46:00,230
say on in the most brands a frame Snorri
do you

742
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:04,670
on a the sites for example framing
policy

743
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:08,300
so sick Africa FIGS if they get the
exact

744
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:12,610
HTTP header restricts was not like me
for extreme option yeah that's it thank

745
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:13,310
you

746
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:17,050
yes that's a good question so over to
the state the

747
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:20,760
the only purpose so most browsers
actually a privileged

748
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:24,210
UK for this reason wanna make sure to
use responsibly

749
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:27,430
in the only purpose for is to be generic

750
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:31,500
browser type application read either
because europe is a browser

751
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:35,480
or your app is some sort of feet
consuming

752
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:38,730
thing into space things in sort of a
browser

753
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:44,460
is it acceptable though from the parent

754
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:48,320
II I'm not sure if it is because the
parent doesn't have

755
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:53,230
country was truly a remmy

756
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:56,440
have to look at it but that the reason
that the short answer is it's a protege

757
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:01,070
exactly for that reason because we don't
want to change the security contract

758
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:04,720
between a parent and a child without

759
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:09,570
having oversight right and if you start
seeing it would be sketchy things we're

760
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:09,940
gonna

761
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:13,160
get to see interview process and try to
figure out why they doing that

762
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:18,510
and begin to

763
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:21,810
so when a developer some meat and naps

764
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:25,640
through the App Store whatever would be

765
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:29,730
how do you check that out how to make
sure that

766
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:33,280
that abnormal issues resulting
somebody's

767
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:38,100
files happy yeps Chur so we're still
refining the review

768
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:41,050
guidelines but this sure is actually we
do this for quite a long time for

769
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:42,780
extensions

770
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:46,030
right so even extension ecosystem

771
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:49,930
and everything that we host its
available for download

772
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:53,330
is reviewed is reviewed a couple
different ways is

773
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:56,370
there's a bunch of like tools we use we
run against them

774
00:47:56,370 --> 00:48:00,260
so we have third party actually and
servers companies ago scanner repo

775
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:03,359
it also visit the unit sketchy like
nowhere

776
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:06,580
we have a bunch of our own scanning
stuff runs mostly for

777
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:10,390
for looking for either that known bad
militias patterns

778
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:14,650
coding and it is actual physical review
people actually look at the code

779
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:20,280
limit the the downside to that expensive
are there right now is because no actual

780
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:24,660
manifest for permissions right so
everything's kinda from privilege in our

781
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:25,750
current extension

782
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:29,580
that is very risky because you have to
review all the code

783
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:34,980
now with a rat model what happens is you
for sure looking at the privileges

784
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:37,750
right if you don't see any scary
privileges I couldn't ask for anything

785
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:39,160
interesting:

786
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:43,580
then all we have to look for is have
typical fishing and just general quality

787
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:44,390
love

788
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:47,590
experience issues

789
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:50,640
if you do see specific API's

790
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:55,700
their Tenshi dangerous you can focus on
those present a good for you

791
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:58,830
so it actually it's the same ProSeries
for extensions

792
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:03,300
but way more if made way more efficient
by the fact that we can actually lively

793
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:06,630
predict application

794
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:11,810
thank you

795
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:15,220
or questions

796
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:20,220
back

797
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:25,100
just to play devil's advocate I think
that the the levels lower

798
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:28,740
I think the model you have where
basically chap is protected from each

799
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,010
other is really great

800
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:33,220
but what about the user experience that
i think is becoming more and more common

801
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:35,070
on the web where you're using

802
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:40,080
a single accounts to sign in to many
services where you can sign into

803
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:43,359
different Apple different web sites with
your Facebook account

804
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:46,740
with your Google account and where you
would have

805
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:50,320
then free the user and an application
that

806
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,500
if they were signing in through a
browser they would have a single click

807
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:57,430
but a in Firefox OS they would have to

808
00:49:57,430 --> 00:50:01,160
re authenticate with those credentials
for each individual

809
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:04,450
at what's your response to developers
who

810
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:09,870
kind of like that user experience sure
this is a good question so

811
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:13,440
that's where the trail suite had to
consider in

812
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,300
designs that the data management reset
when

813
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:20,359
the more privacy sensitive side for now
but I think

814
00:50:20,359 --> 00:50:24,510
what's pretty reasonable is in the
future having explicit API's to handle

815
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:24,980
those

816
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:30,540
cases rights having apt of into the
model with a willing to share

817
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:35,590
you know some set of tokens amongst
themselves may be in a specific

818
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:38,670
of indications store right and that
would have

819
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:42,060
functionally the same benefits without
actually just trying to just shovel the

820
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:43,520
cookies back into one huge

821
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:50,010
store

822
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:53,450
no one questions

823
00:50:53,450 --> 00:51:00,450
no more questions so that's it so a big
applause

824
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:09,620
thank you

825
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:16,520
this

826
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:23,520
sleep
