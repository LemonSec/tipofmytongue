1
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:11,400
ok face

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,440
a

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,640
this

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,130
space

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:19,060
against welcome everybody

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,860
so we got so no Shana today he's a

7
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,070
big friend of packing a box already
since the beginning and

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,410
I'm not going to talk a lot about im I
live

9
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,730
leave it to him welcome and this is
innervated

10
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:37,190
approaches to explore delivery welcome
so well thanks very

11
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:40,210
my goodness this is a

12
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:44,200
is the reason why I love back in the box
it's a great role great audience

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,840
and this is my eighth year in KL always
enjoyed being here

14
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,170
so what that now it feels like home

15
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,470
alright so what are we gonna talk about

16
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:01,650
this next hour a few quick introduction
of myself for

17
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:06,479
say the boring stuff I've been doing a
whole lot of security stuff for

18
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,180
more than 15 years and the older you
grow in this industry you tend to become

19
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,009
bitter

20
00:01:13,009 --> 00:01:16,869
so just to know show my bitterness

21
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:19,899
after the stalking your head or the
panel and start drinking

22
00:01:19,899 --> 00:01:23,030
on stage that's what everybody's doing
next door to

23
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:27,319
so the deal is you ask a question in the
panel you get a drink we get to take a

24
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:27,999
dream any

25
00:01:27,999 --> 00:01:32,990
but I've done this for a long time and I
started off with UNIX hacking

26
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:37,880
went on to web hacking sometime close to
when Jeremiah started with backing as

27
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,319
well

28
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:41,409
a Jedi Master great at it at a

29
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:45,920
tend to drift away I got bored of it but
I student to get back to with backing

30
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,990
from tenth day

31
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:53,350
um mid 2006 onwards I started playing
with exploits by in the exploits which

32
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,659
was always my passion and assembly
language

33
00:01:55,659 --> 00:01:59,759
and started building browser exploits as
a day of interest

34
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,170
and research and what the stock is gonna
be

35
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:08,390
is a I've always wondered what it would
be to combine the two forces

36
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:12,630
on one side you have all the cool stuff
about web hacking which a

37
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,470
really late and the more I dig into it
the more innovative it gets

38
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:22,580
but kinda frustrating I'll give you an
example for other demos that have to do

39
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,280
today

40
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,570
the dawn oriented programming exploits
with all the ROP chains and the

41
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:30,120
defeating yes a lot and nap on win7

42
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,850
took less than half the time it did for
me to struggle with

43
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:40,600
bloody JavaScript and HTML and making
sure the stupid images align properly

44
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,790
and you know if you do and on mouseover

45
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:45,990
things happen here and there the garden
roses don't crash

46
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:50,430
but up finally got it working on it for
the dam was work so

47
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,770
what happens when you combine web
hacking with by early exploits

48
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:57,680
you get pretty pretty daily mix

49
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,160
on one hand you get all the sneakiness

50
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,940
of web attacks but was there but I said
really sneaky

51
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:09,580
we have all the stuff going over HTTP
and all fun and fancy stuff running in

52
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,370
browsers

53
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:14,580
and I'm sure it's a this one's going to
be especially hard

54
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,980
to fall of the Jedi Master because he's
already talked a lot about

55
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:22,940
and then with the sneakiness you also
get the lethal weapons with the binary

56
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,670
exploits

57
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,280
so a lot of exploit writers read
exploits

58
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,620
their exploits and threw it up there

59
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:34,180
cool you know what you do after you jump
through all the group saying

60
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,340
who the whole escape of by long trek
from got for banged-up prisons and what

61
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:38,740
not

62
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:44,430
you launch a calculator on somebody
system yeah catechism after all as

63
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:48,490
I don't know if ESC is here but there's
this case is the hello world of Osho

64
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:49,160
core

65
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,310
a an I mean when you combine

66
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:55,760
I mean this is really playing dry
exploits its cool

67
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,570
I mean it's a cat gets a share awesome
but

68
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:03,300
you really need sexy it up and that's
what we need to do with all the web

69
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:03,840
stuff

70
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,060
so it's time weapons like these

71
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,220
get some help from people like these

72
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:14,069
you know we want to combine the good
stuff with

73
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:19,009
crazy things that happen with 302
direction especially with URL shorteners

74
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:22,079
we want to deal with attacks

75
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,669
by using images I mean I personally am
an artist at heart before I started

76
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:28,120
doing all the computer stuff

77
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,080
and realize they can make a living as an
artist or a calligrapher

78
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,639
which I'd really love to do if ever dare
but

79
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,220
yeah art with exploitation is something
you want to talk about

80
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:44,770
we also want to talk about JavaScript
and I think if its 2012 a better to

81
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:47,730
html5 for the bloody buzzword in there
in use

82
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:50,980
mean html5 process scripting yeah

83
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:55,710
ok but at the exploration does involve
some help from html5

84
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:59,889
and in fact the hole gets deeper with
html5

85
00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:05,870
so with this we got our first start
talking about

86
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:10,710
shortened URLs this a trick the report
of a few years ago I just want to show

87
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,460
you

88
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:16,310
really quickly what kind of stuff can
you are the four corners

89
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:19,880
new if coupled with buying that exploits

90
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:24,460
so stop over the joys of short URLs

91
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,470
a simple example

92
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,760
a we had an SMB you are your flow

93
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,150
in video land cleared a few years ago

94
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:37,790
quite a popular media player everybody
has it everybody watches

95
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:40,870
biotech be downloaded apps densified

96
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:44,630
for guys I hope they're not Lake release
group: somewheres

97
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,639
feel for them a

98
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,900
yet so when it's cooler typewriter

99
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,410
sore a so you watch all this sort of
media

100
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:58,620
on VOC and VOC can do anything so one of
the

101
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,580
buffer overflows was a big long
tracklisting

102
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,290
now this is not a really cool thing to
explode if you want to start grabbing a

103
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,450
lot of people

104
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,540
and owning them in your partner because
if you want to send this exploit own

105
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,980
yes or do you have to actually create an
XML file

106
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,250
which I mean I really struggle with XML
am

107
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:22,630
allergic to it a and then you have to
put the track name in there and then

108
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:25,220
create a playlist and email this
playlist

109
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,320
friends and say a critical this a list
and then Dave

110
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:33,050
then you get a share nobody's gonna do
that so we figured let's try to open

111
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,980
verdict exploit around

112
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:40,530
to a six-year format so we use the power
of the URL shorteners

113
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:44,090
plus the power of the only alphanumeric
show core

114
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:47,340
and then you have something rare

115
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,580
tiny URL is hosting an end to exploit

116
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,870
this still up there this tonight why CCT

117
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:58,010
art is it this is the URL contain a URL

118
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:01,889
which will effin work which will return
the USA like this

119
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:05,990
SMB column lover 2012

120
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:09,190
this alone can if they're replaying make
HTTP or

121
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:13,550
not you can you know send back a semi
you can send back FTP

122
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:18,110
you can send backs all movable and slash
slash you can make anything said 302

123
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:21,440
I knew it it doesn't get and with this

124
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,370
we achieve some greasy effects

125
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:28,860
we show you um

126
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,290
so that see okay

127
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:37,040
pardon my lame Windows XP demo but this
is the only Expedia that they will give

128
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,690
you a promise

129
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:42,949
mum

130
00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:46,900
preview for note tiny URL

131
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,610
dot com way CCT positive

132
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:54,120
memories but no okay so

133
00:07:54,120 --> 00:08:01,120
hood is Cardinals

134
00:08:10,609 --> 00:08:12,939
great

135
00:08:12,939 --> 00:08:19,379
the demos to work you have to allow it
yet there we are

136
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:23,050
this is a up this is the UI

137
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:27,349
now see what's gonna happen if I launch
VLC with it

138
00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:31,610
so the request

139
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:38,079
and wanna make is let me this is with
the second screen

140
00:08:38,079 --> 00:08:41,610
so what I'm going to do is

141
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:46,010
point the the browser to a web page with
saudis and in bed dad

142
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:51,089
with her tiny URL so this tiny what it
is going to be fed to VLC

143
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:54,190
and then when VLC makes a request this
one expand

144
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:57,820
and if you look at the network trace is
going to expire into this big giant

145
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,519
exploit

146
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:05,519
and let's just see the net effect
incidentally recently

147
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:10,450
the whole load tale

148
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:15,950
the USSD exploit for Android phones came
out where you can do it Dale URL

149
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:19,880
and L Collins something something where
you can wipe somebody's phone to factory

150
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,720
reset

151
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,430
a bit curious to see how many Dane you
in as a ShortyUSA Registered with the

152
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:29,449
and what are the stacks on it that would
be really really fun

153
00:09:29,449 --> 00:09:33,959
how many people are or indirectly so
anyway here's a

154
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:39,699
play movie let's lord this up now this
one is an egg hunter

155
00:09:39,699 --> 00:09:45,260
so there are a lot of people think 800
the biggest thing around exploitation

156
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:49,760
just a damn show called but in a little
bit after it finds a share

157
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,250
there we go pop scalp your browser is

158
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:57,079
own and you know welcome to the botnet

159
00:09:57,079 --> 00:10:01,470
self a numeric exploits through URL
shorteners

160
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:05,600
somebody's gonna get busted for hosting
the exploiters on me means when we can

161
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,290
you edit

162
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:10,360
cause the cords on their side not my a

163
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,360
I mean incidentally you can play a lot
of tricks with your short nurse

164
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,130
a there's there was an article I wrote
in the hack in the box

165
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:21,310
easing love a couple of years ago

166
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:25,470
talking about or tricks you can play
with shortened URLs okay on the more

167
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,480
exciting stuff

168
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:32,350
I am alright and want to just go one up
on fifty Shades of Grey I have something

169
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:35,589
called the 255 shades of grey exploit a

170
00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:39,300
we're gonna do exploits using

171
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:44,550
images you have a whole bunch of
JavaScript which gets detected which

172
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,890
gets feared which had signature

173
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:50,520
which it through all sorts of crap a
Bart

174
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,029
images and images nobody thinks images
that really bad

175
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:57,490
and do they really really evil so how we
do it

176
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,779
well we and called the inter

177
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:05,649
script we incurred think that JavaScript
character by character using that ASCII

178
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:06,250
values

179
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,610
into in value from 0 to 255

180
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:13,470
and use these as fix is in a perfect it
image

181
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:17,660
so what do get you an exploit is going
to be something like this

182
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,760
this image is your exploit

183
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,180
how does it work let's see

184
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:28,250
so

185
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:32,190
let's see how this whole thing works
basically have also written a little

186
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,100
converter

187
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:37,670
so if you up type in all your javascript
your

188
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:41,130
and then you click the Convert button
you'll get

189
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:44,170
a PNG created which you can then loading
the court

190
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:49,630
and then meet show you how it's all done
so

191
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:55,949
a a right click wheel or

192
00:11:55,949 --> 00:12:02,949
a browser

193
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:09,680
and here I have the converter so let me
just a

194
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,350
give may simple conversion thing that

195
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:16,560
simple javascript and let me show you
how it's gonna be encoded

196
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,610
simple enough

197
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:24,680
alert document not date I mean ok you
alert document application plus

198
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:28,970
date if I heard on can work you see a
little

199
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:32,890
square thingy appears over here these
women for

200
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:37,240
major detail now this is a seven by
seven square

201
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,560
with all these great pics isn't good
each pixel corresponds to one character

202
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,670
on the JavaScript was a perfectly legit

203
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:49,390
PNG image this can we will start
anywhere this can be thrown out on

204
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:53,709
on anything Flickr Facebook image but it
whatever it is

205
00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:57,269
Photobucket and then all you have to do
is

206
00:12:57,269 --> 00:13:01,649
yodel ordered on the target browser let
me show you the decoding

207
00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:05,720
test you little retarded broza

208
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,890
use an innocent JavaScript to

209
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:12,160
up to just do some image processing

210
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,779
which is you you can use a lot of want

211
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:21,940
you can use a lot of for JavaScript to

212
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,850
gets a jQuery or whatever to do the same
as well see

213
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:30,270
is see it here this thing will load up

214
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:34,190
the the little image and then you can
click be called

215
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:37,600
and hear the same string that was in
court it is because it

216
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,029
now how to exit you did

217
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:44,149
well you take this and then you either
linked Eddie

218
00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:47,910
you take the string and say JavaScript
and then you even though the whole thing

219
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:51,260
so let me show that the velvet

220
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:55,270
so here's the email

221
00:13:55,270 --> 00:14:01,930
sure the source as well so here's what
I'm doing this

222
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:05,720
the script or png data there's a script
that

223
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,170
basically takes a PNG image the cords
all the pics as my pic said

224
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:14,610
we use the canvas tag for doing this on
canvas take you can load an image in go

225
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:15,149
through

226
00:14:15,149 --> 00:14:18,990
each pixel value and get the colors and
GB and whatever

227
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:23,810
and then we assemble the whole exploit
and once you do this

228
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:28,440
weekend threw it into something like yet
take the decoder text

229
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:33,029
put it in an email and then the whole
thing we run so now you have transported

230
00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:35,079
all your dangerous part of the exploit

231
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:39,170
a over an image and all that remains is
the innocent part

232
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:43,209
and see all this works cyclic on either

233
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:46,430
showed enough you got another

234
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:49,880
alert than we do

235
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,440
nigga slightly more complicated one

236
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,760
when my again my knowledge of JavaScript
is

237
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:01,680
84 I'll confess so doesn't get more
complicated than

238
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:08,420
probably this okay it so now you get
another image

239
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,829
a.m. let's reload this day

240
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:15,670
so here we go now this is just gonna
create

241
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:19,209
so every time I click Eve Alex 10 create
the

242
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:22,329
are given my page in just run

243
00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:26,310
arbitrary JavaScript using this
technique

244
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:29,870
we can actually do

245
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:34,000
quite a lot of people stuff forced I'm
going to shoot up your version of the

246
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,569
exploit

247
00:15:34,569 --> 00:15:38,480
which is a apps

248
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,550
yeah this is not in court at this is

249
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:46,779
plain vanilla dry boarding on
interesting

250
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:50,520
gallup popping exploit so

251
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:55,060
to see that sure it is

252
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:58,199
this exploit its society or did explode
on Firefox

253
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:02,350
marked the it's too sophisticated enough
that we have to use a lot of it only

254
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,560
entered programming

255
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,560
back the show core you launch gather

256
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:11,339
and it so use after free exploit this is

257
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:16,149
as is so let me show you how it works
and then we'll use

258
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:23,149
the encoded version and and give it a
shot

259
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:38,040
so it is it row this is the one middle
school or

260
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:43,590
its gonna do the heat spray its gonna do
its it has to a pretty much like an 800

261
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:43,970
make

262
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:47,410
heaps pay for it to work and once it
does it

263
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:50,440
books continue with the script

264
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,800
once it does it up so cal

265
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,110
system own this is the or way of doing
it

266
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:02,410
that's the more sophisticated way of
doing the same thing

267
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:06,310
so don't know what to do is

268
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:09,310
take the JavaScript of the exploit which
is all this

269
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:13,820
use after free stuff with the show court
in everything copy it

270
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:18,070
we will paste it in the in court thingy

271
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:22,260
get a nice PNG out of it and then use

272
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:29,260
the PNG for exploit go

273
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,990
based at all the stuff you're

274
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:38,330
gonna work this is

275
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:42,630
the image that you get with all the
incall degree

276
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:46,120
Texas if I were to

277
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:53,120
decode this yep take this and decor

278
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,270
you get the same thing back okay

279
00:17:56,270 --> 00:18:00,050
let's use it in the that used in the
production exploit

280
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:04,930
so now although ugly stuff for of
transporting the exploit court has been

281
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,330
transferred over to the image

282
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:09,510
inside the JavaScript is nothing
reliever

283
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:14,260
but say and legitimize gonna call me on
it and say well

284
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,270
the valley's evil it is

285
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:23,620
what can we do necessary was mmm

286
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:27,010
here

287
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:30,220
so here it is then coated with Asian

288
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:33,460
that have programmed it so that it
triggers when you do a mouseover

289
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:37,740
just just for the heck of it so here we
do a mouseover

290
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,200
and then if it all works which I'm
hoping it with

291
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:47,090
kept

292
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:52,080
so the concept does

293
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:58,420
work okay

294
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:01,440
so what we did was

295
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,860
we basically use the can was stag
started reading all the Pixies

296
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:09,240
and assembling this in memory and then

297
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,910
emailing the whole thing and that of the
whole exploit straight away

298
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:16,120
there's a lot of pics you can do with
images you can pre-order

299
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:20,390
you can cash them you can you know the
Lord in through other sites

300
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:23,660
once it in the cashed in your browser
doesn't even need to make a second

301
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,410
request to load the image it all just
blows from the cash

302
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:31,010
and there's also we especially if you're
using QR codes

303
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:35,050
you can even resize the images a
stretcher more do you want to store them

304
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:35,490
a bit

305
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:40,050
in the original content won't be lost
right

306
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:43,150
so with the Act little bit

307
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:47,210
I want to then been a struggle struggle
with removing

308
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:50,520
only from the JavaScript so

309
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,820
we won't see no evil we don't want those

310
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:58,070
have any email in the JavaScript is wet

311
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:01,360
because I've been told a lot of

312
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,970
AV ok in logic does use your

313
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:11,090
the vendors that this signature devall
and they look for all sorts of the very

314
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,020
core so

315
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:16,350
they can stop more diversity chords a
100 on a little bit

316
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:19,760
a.m. had to go back to closures

317
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,770
and found out that you can do email
without using

318
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:27,170
Eve at entirely so

319
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:32,080
what used to be something like this
cannot be in one lane

320
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,780
translated to a constructor I mean to a
function constructor

321
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:40,260
see just construct a new function with
the same string

322
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:45,050
and in we'll get right in there so this
will have the same effect as Eve at

323
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:49,830
exit you the entire string is no even in
the cord is no signature eating

324
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:53,000
all their arguments just a tourist

325
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,190
and as a as a proof I assure you this

326
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:00,590
no evil the valedictory

327
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:04,230
this has been pretty successful

328
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:07,240
in the past for me ever see this

329
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:11,300
your I don't Firefox always tries to
restore

330
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:18,300
the last page

331
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:25,190
Amy

332
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:28,679
put some sample data and that and then
will do that %um

333
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:35,679
just you

334
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:45,240
okay so this is converted meet with the

335
00:21:47,629 --> 00:21:51,570
so here it is the one without that the
valve for sure who the source

336
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:56,740
source code so here

337
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,850
in the exec need a previously we used to
have if it was

338
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:03,539
even as something nursery place with if
it was new function

339
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:06,980
recorded test that is no you have except
for this

340
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:11,139
there's a string on the button there's
nothing in the JavaScript entirely

341
00:22:11,139 --> 00:22:14,429
so if I click this

342
00:22:14,429 --> 00:22:19,590
works the same way absolutely no
difference

343
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:24,090
so now we're getting steady against
India and the the loader strips looking

344
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:27,279
we more innocent in fact it's actually
more doing

345
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:31,559
any malicious or any evil or greasy
JavaScript stuff

346
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:38,230
it's just doing simple things right

347
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:41,710
one more trick to discuss

348
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:47,470
have also been wondering Lake can read
represent JavaScript itself

349
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:51,779
in a different way weekend wrap
JavaScript as

350
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:56,169
excited and then decode it back to
JavaScript but what about the law order

351
00:22:56,169 --> 00:22:57,710
JavaScript itself can we

352
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:01,539
hate can we do something really crazy
with it an hour's

353
00:23:01,539 --> 00:23:04,889
always fascinated with the idea of
chameleon fires

354
00:23:04,889 --> 00:23:08,330
you guys or defied attack you can

355
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:13,100
bug file an image and then have a zip
file it then like a Java

356
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,190
I okay because the zip headers

357
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:20,179
begin from the file Bordeaux the last
bikes at the headers

358
00:23:20,179 --> 00:23:23,779
in the gif headers at the top so you can
have a fine which is a perfectly valid

359
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:24,639
just fine

360
00:23:24,639 --> 00:23:29,299
in a perfectly valid John a fight and
you can load a GIF file and then

361
00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:34,369
instantiate a job applicant and really
did wreak havoc with Billy deals found

362
00:23:34,369 --> 00:23:35,049
this out

363
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:39,240
to few years ago and presented at black
hat and that got me thinking

364
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,639
that don't we do similar things using
the is and Alastair

365
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:47,799
so is it a mash or do this thing couple
of years ago so here it is finally out

366
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:48,610
in the public

367
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:53,070
is what I call as chameleon JavaScript
but I have a cooler name for it

368
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:56,860
images with a note that the sector GS at
the end

369
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:03,539
that see this but see this thing in
action issue a simple

370
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:07,379
page and then up its

371
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:10,590
see how it goes all

372
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:16,519
images demo

373
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:20,399
so see what happens if you

374
00:24:20,399 --> 00:24:24,129
move the wet

375
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:27,470
go to have the good admitted and

376
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:30,879
a another source for this is really
crazy

377
00:24:30,879 --> 00:24:35,070
group know it's a trap stop

378
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:38,720
this is

379
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,440
two lines yeah check out this to the
sources

380
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:50,220
a gif the image as a gif 8 and the next
agassi scripts or seek was the same

381
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,690
thing the browser to load the image once

382
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:58,350
the second time it will use the same
object in a script and there will be no

383
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:01,480
network request made if you do the cash
control right

384
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:06,419
once loaded to be removal and how does
this happen

385
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:11,149
I'm yet no rocket science here

386
00:25:11,149 --> 00:25:14,980
lemme lemme shared with you straight
away a

387
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,869
what we do show you how to give fail is
made

388
00:25:18,869 --> 00:25:22,129
see typically Jeff I is

389
00:25:22,129 --> 00:25:26,320
always begin with some jeff had a great

390
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,330
you have a you have something Lake give

391
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:33,820
89 a and then you have the high

392
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:37,799
you have the weight and then you have
all this other run linton go to go over

393
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:38,570
to go nigga

394
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:41,679
so you do is

395
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,590
replace the height with to f2a

396
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:50,119
pics which translates to Slashdot at the
end

397
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:54,389
ports to slash equals 0 and then port
any

398
00:25:54,389 --> 00:26:01,389
other shit you want this is a perfectly
valid defense is also perfectly valid

399
00:26:01,929 --> 00:26:04,399
JavaScript because you assigned 0 VA
budget

400
00:26:04,399 --> 00:26:07,600
89 equal 0 and then added your

401
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:12,899
JavaScript stuff at the end good morning
all the image stuff in between

402
00:26:12,899 --> 00:26:16,460
this looks like a dream so

403
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:20,850
its it's a neat little trick thank you

404
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:24,220
if it gets better it gets better

405
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:30,649
let's see this the let me show the GF
fight

406
00:26:30,649 --> 00:26:34,179
civil open up the Defiant here it is

407
00:26:34,179 --> 00:26:38,840
now incidently browsers another image
processors don't really care if you

408
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,840
screw up with the height or width

409
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:45,539
there was still day the exact image data
and rendered properly

410
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:49,820
so you can go for screwing around with
this as much as you lay

411
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:52,889
so here it is the gif

412
00:26:52,889 --> 00:26:56,470
all the stuff in here and here it is and
then

413
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:59,940
you you see this little bit

414
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:04,580
is

415
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:07,710
yeah that it is so it simple I mean

416
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:10,919
I have any one of you skated as
JavaScript I just

417
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:14,159
appendix sleazy Lee even with the
comments

418
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,279
and it works so does the same thing that
a

419
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,609
wrote the moment you lord this
javascript

420
00:27:20,609 --> 00:27:25,590
it does this it's attracting and goes
ahead

421
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:30,539
aid Somerton be on this say actually dug
in and talk to

422
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:35,440
that see how well this works so I did
some comparisons this

423
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,649
to start work very well with defiance
and

424
00:27:38,649 --> 00:27:42,619
so far all browsers except I E

425
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:45,750
render the defile properly I E

426
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:48,750
actually will be israel's height a dozen
schools it up

427
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:53,440
that you thanks for them he raided their
actually doing the right thing

428
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,080
but the but if they were still executive
the JavaScript

429
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,659
even this image rude render properly on
your desktop

430
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:04,619
review applications if it's sitting in
the cash in somebody clicks agencies a

431
00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:08,049
they won't see anything you will either
accept that XP

432
00:28:08,049 --> 00:28:13,480
render doesn't really work there's a
better format for all this though

433
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:17,330
a trade with PNG PNG doesn't work
because it because it has a 0-0 in the

434
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:17,809
header

435
00:28:17,809 --> 00:28:21,460
so all the things strong Kate bought

436
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:24,919
gore or BMP gore or

437
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:29,639
fact bitmap fires everything and urs
everything executes

438
00:28:29,639 --> 00:28:34,490
BMP fires are rate for this or start

439
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:38,509
so yeah this this technique has a lot of
promise

440
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:43,070
I'm sure there is more creative things
people are going to do with this

441
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:48,109
and I was thinking ok and now we have
this shades of grey exploit loader

442
00:28:48,109 --> 00:28:52,849
but we have a pure javascript why can't
we combine

443
00:28:52,849 --> 00:28:56,220
both of these techniques together so one
image

444
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:59,349
to carry the exploit another image using

445
00:28:59,349 --> 00:29:02,460
images to be courted

446
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,700
and I'm not even a step better no more
shades of grey

447
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,450
a is a not thirty-year the nation at

448
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:12,929
because our room this being the 10th
anniversary of Pac in the box

449
00:29:12,929 --> 00:29:16,820
and the nation being i'ma guy who also

450
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:21,109
well-founded disclosing this exploits
dedicated to him does the other fuck you

451
00:29:21,109 --> 00:29:22,539
exploit Nexus

452
00:29:22,539 --> 00:29:27,379
Twitter handle by the way why because
I'm using the alpha channel

453
00:29:27,379 --> 00:29:31,409
if you use if you don't use the Pixies
would use the transparency channel in

454
00:29:31,409 --> 00:29:32,299
the image

455
00:29:32,299 --> 00:29:37,769
it's even steady at the Pixies remained
there for the transparency values change

456
00:29:37,769 --> 00:29:41,460
and you can import the whole thing is an
alpha channel for example

457
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:44,700
sure is an exploit using and as such an
A

458
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:48,669
see it okay let me show you

459
00:29:48,669 --> 00:29:52,720
if you notice a very carefully at the
top

460
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,840
yeah hopes 3 have assuming things

461
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,710
so if you look at the top section see
all these little Pixies that I've gotta

462
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,789
burn up

463
00:30:01,789 --> 00:30:04,889
the top couple of pics arose have the
entire

464
00:30:04,889 --> 00:30:10,059
I define corded a exploit this is not
have fun pneumatic this is alpha channel

465
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:12,179
Inc order to exploit ended

466
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:15,679
so if you combine the two images

467
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:20,440
with a fuck you wet guess what

468
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:27,440
let's do this i Mishu the stern works

469
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:35,150
as a template you deleted me notes
because if I goof up that it was gonna

470
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,740
go bad and I look like a fool

471
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:40,230
okay so

472
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:44,460
what we do as we take the same exploit
that we did

473
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:47,680
the the Firefox

474
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,230
drop exploit that ahead accept that

475
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:56,670
and 10 compress the JavaScript and the
compression is nothing

476
00:30:56,670 --> 00:31:01,610
nothing strange I'm just using the the
Yahoo you we compress or script

477
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:05,860
so all it does is just eliminates all
the bombings and spaces and backs

478
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,950
everything nicely

479
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:10,760
so here it is the compressed

480
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:16,580
thing copy it to the clipboard

481
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:23,580
and let me paste it on and I'll find
corder

482
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:38,529
something guard make canvas Syrian since
we're talking about are great you had to

483
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:40,049
guess is gonna come up

484
00:31:40,049 --> 00:31:43,749
and me being an artist at heart ok in a

485
00:31:43,749 --> 00:31:47,809
Spears so up basis in

486
00:31:47,809 --> 00:31:50,830
embed a hoops

487
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:55,889
and here you can see the

488
00:31:55,889 --> 00:32:00,220
here you can see the pics is nicely
included but I mean come on

489
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:04,230
who's going to look at the pics is a in
that in this one now this image is going

490
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:05,340
to kati our

491
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:10,129
drop exploit over n as a as an added
bonus

492
00:32:10,129 --> 00:32:15,159
the up well let me show you how this
goes

493
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:19,049
living living not so here this is
created

494
00:32:19,049 --> 00:32:22,279
and let me bop open

495
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:29,279
exploit

496
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:38,470
that's the problem thing in that

497
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:42,730
okay okay

498
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:46,890
so now here's here's a beauty of this
was done according to script

499
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:50,750
is embedded in this Jeff fight and a

500
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:54,010
so we should as Jeff fail if a

501
00:32:54,010 --> 00:33:01,010
can so this Jeff I that is loaded

502
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:06,920
contains the decoder script

503
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,990
here it is this is the Lord image data
and

504
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:15,090
you read all that if I values and
everything DAX

505
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:22,090
over here if you look at the source of
the exploit sources very very minimal

506
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:30,190
now all you are sending a cross is
nothing but

507
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:34,630
2g fails the exploiters also loaded

508
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:39,400
but I've said the visibility two-headed
so the holding X preloaded

509
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,600
the GF is loaded that is a decoder
script because I'm

510
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,870
also noting it doesn't image and

511
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:51,550
and loading it as the and loading it as
a script

512
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:55,350
so everything sick there is nothing
strange

513
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:58,540
in this entire HTML is a safe

514
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:03,050
is innocent this can be pasted anyway on
it as a couple of

515
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:06,370
gives to all the content and I'm sure I
can do it dynamically

516
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:11,120
a javascript better which I don't and I
don't intend to get better JavaScript

517
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:11,560
either

518
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,790
okay

519
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:20,490
so net effect Lexie so if you try to
restore this fiscal

520
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:24,320
here we go and this has been on
mouseover property

521
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,370
which will be

522
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:31,409
called and pop a cap so

523
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:34,830
yet you you combine these two techniques
together

524
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:38,100
exploit delivery by images exploit

525
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:42,710
deco I mean image decoding by images as
well and you get

526
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:48,230
free d damn lethal effects mmm

527
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:53,730
yeah gonna have some questions in the
mood before I go on to the next of

528
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:58,560
anybody from on

529
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:05,560
at seven

530
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:12,350
the question is why bother with the
preloading on the images you don't need

531
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:12,620
to

532
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:16,480
I just did it for the slickness of the
day more posts which the two frescoes

533
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:21,610
on the flight up preloaded images have
one advantage in the fact that

534
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:25,510
these get cash if you do the
cache-control headers right

535
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:29,060
these are then stay on your browser in
the next ten you refer to them

536
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:33,280
there we just pulled out from disk sign
we have sent you some photographs

537
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,330
yesterday

538
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:39,610
and exploit you today but he won't know
that it came from

539
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:43,250
on this that you'd really being hired
and trained correlate with the things

540
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:43,750
together

541
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:48,260
so yeah mean once it's an image it can

542
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:51,830
be mind as a pre-loaded is what ever
learn

543
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:56,240
okay

544
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,620
so with this I have actually

545
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:02,810
any any other questions anyone yes

546
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:07,980
a

547
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:11,050
I want to talk about how to protect from
these attacks

548
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:16,800
um yeah I talk about it that doesn't
mean again

549
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,970
do much about it as as we can see

550
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:25,020
these are not the splits you're looking
for yeah

551
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:29,510
well ask him about this I did this in or
exploit great

552
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:32,840
dissident or live if exploit on Acrobat

553
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:37,020
9.3 9.4 updates later got published

554
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:40,180
a was using really weird

555
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:43,620
drop chain because when you load the
Defiant

556
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:48,290
Yukon mean you you could try and heaps
play with it

557
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:52,200
but the moment you order to find the
heaps Rios getting destroyed

558
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:56,280
like the JavaScript was getting garbage
collected anon user objects were getting

559
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:56,820
released

560
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:00,610
so the guys or the slow W some really
clever of Jeannie

561
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:03,970
until a dug down and figured out that

562
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:07,050
a typically all Acrobat

563
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:12,250
JavaScript is written in the in like a
launch object in the PDF I'd

564
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:16,630
and I started reading while back about
forms X FA de

565
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:20,490
it's a nightmare to go through those X
if your documents first of all its XML

566
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:21,490
which I really hate

567
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:25,540
and second of all its acrobat which
shows a really and

568
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:28,730
third is to get the six if they work in
PDF is

569
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:33,810
big bin but a big get very very smooth
heaps be working

570
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:37,560
in Acrobat PDF the

571
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:41,900
so the whole def exploit got converted
into a really simple explode with the

572
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:45,900
heaps three that alone was enough to
defeat all the signatures

573
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:51,050
so three-year-old exploit work then the
signatures got a good

574
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:54,170
clever so I decided to get clever

575
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:57,340
against them because on other things
that I always a

576
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:02,430
never miss a chance to exposes the whole
folly of signatures and rules and or to

577
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:03,680
update saying

578
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,350
you know the solos stupidity that has
worked out all industry folk Ben

579
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:08,190
Schachter

580
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:11,490
with all the subscription mourners its
2012

581
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:15,240
these things don't work anymore how many
times we have to prove this on stage

582
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,410
one more thing

583
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:22,810
okay a so let me show this

584
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:29,810
this live piece of work

585
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:35,800
0 man wary preempting messed up anyway

586
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,450
fielder hit that I he had the right
solution now you can

587
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:42,660
angered them is XD be as wet and

588
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:46,030
our extensive done it all up on with the
devil

589
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:53,030
the day was pretty slick so

590
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:57,190
I did this as a test a emailed myself a
copy of

591
00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:00,560
a militias PDF file

592
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,740
this morning on my yahoo mail

593
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:08,510
you know if you guys gonna make the man
sniff me I don't get this is a

594
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:15,510
junk e-mail address and name as

595
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,750
the ground

596
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:24,630
hip-hop who

597
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:28,099
while alright so

598
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:33,690
here next see what we have in the Inbox
it is for your reading pleasure

599
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:37,040
a PDF document guess what of all the
things

600
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,440
a less

601
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,490
opener oppose its gonna slip diff

602
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:47,180
gallup XDP but idyllic should see you
know

603
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:51,670
the news report from back in the box or
something I was lazy and renaming

604
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:56,680
lick it says

605
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:00,160
open made before its is open then we
should do this thing

606
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:07,160
more than anywhere else life running on
da Dr Who

607
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:11,890
alright

608
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:15,020
CS you you force

609
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:19,470
clear you do is Acrobat forms secondly
if you do is just making

610
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:24,580
XDP X VB is nothing but Bay 64 in court
and put it under 2x every day

611
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:28,530
it's simple it's it's trivial but that
alone

612
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:33,420
gets you get

613
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:36,810
so

614
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:42,950
ain't and

615
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:46,320
who knows when we can go by embedding
how to find

616
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:51,470
ordered images inside PDF the
possibility is your night tremendous

617
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:55,560
you have a number of options thrown open

618
00:40:55,560 --> 00:41:01,150
from the web were browser support a lot
of weird standards there is this

619
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:04,560
too many components that work this too
many things that are

620
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:09,130
actually influencing the dome a I've
always asserted that

621
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:13,040
browsers that really really
fundamentally need to change

622
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,440
the security mode today we're loading
everything under one

623
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:21,610
GOM all untrusted sources any law order
dog Jake as

624
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:25,000
ability to call any in big component of
the browser

625
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,290
to give have the link then boo but a
javascript and

626
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:33,340
instantiate an object on the link into
the body when if I and I want nor voter

627
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:39,210
the whole security modern lot of people
compare the browser as a next operating

628
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:39,810
system

629
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:43,460
if that is the case united's win95

630
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:46,940
but I they used to say it's boss it's
like 1

631
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:50,290
but its 185 because now we have two
processes one

632
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:54,720
better process and one child process for
all the tabs but the shareholder gongs

633
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,140
and its

634
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:58,700
cooperative multitasking anyway so

635
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:02,430
unless you really change the browser
security martyrdom or

636
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:05,470
privileged in for smarter this

637
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:08,890
is not going to improve secondly

638
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:13,480
you you talking about the you talk about

639
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:17,310
protection I have one fart on protection

640
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:21,380
boats are going to be a row X

641
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:25,290
it's a fact of life in we're sitting
here today you see this as people

642
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:27,500
popping shells that only a fresh Air's

643
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:31,760
walking over its 60 grand Pinkie Pie did
yesterday

644
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,530
big catch phrase does it mean to say
that chromium is insecure

645
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:40,790
units o/s secured or unsecured as any
other be so certain software

646
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:45,920
what I would say makes from him secure
is a fact that they had an update

647
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,740
in less than one day York toward not on
time

648
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:53,860
your reaction your ability to detect and
respond

649
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:58,690
and stop this the moment to see it
happening or as early as you can

650
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:03,620
is what's gonna make you secure
preventing an exploit yes

651
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:06,840
there are technologies that are
technologies like dept that our

652
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,450
technology is a key SLR

653
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:11,720
but as ever said in my previous talks
the

654
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:16,430
the bar keeps getting there is the
higher and higher and folks like those

655
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:17,880
sitting with you

656
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:21,660
are getting more and more creative every
day

657
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:24,760
every day is a new challenge every day
is a new platform

658
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:28,000
you make it hard enough and we will work
hard enough

659
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,920
next that's how the game is naturally
it's not like

660
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,360
everything's own the the windows
definitely shrinking

661
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:40,240
in today if you want to exploit so it
would save software

662
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:46,780
on the Acela and kept it's not an easy
task been previously used to have RPC

663
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:49,340
exploits an FTP exploits and

664
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:54,060
all sorts of tricks a nautical exploits
and all today

665
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:57,620
predictability is going on pretty low
unless you get really creative

666
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:01,460
most of the bugs you seeing our browsers
and PDF

667
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:04,560
well guess what they're both she TV's of
software to begin with

668
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:08,800
and we hope to them so for as long as
the word uses them

669
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,990
that's okay this is going to happen

670
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:15,650
so I know I haven't really

671
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:21,220
answer your question well but this is
the best I can do whatever we working on

672
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:23,180
the future or do I think

673
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:26,510
is gonna be the future in this whole
exploitation game

674
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:31,890
to get more creative hi I'm definitely
keen on exploring html5 video

675
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:36,390
SVG and all the fun stuff with a 3G that
goes on

676
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:41,170
web GN is another big one because that
can also open up a lot of

677
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:46,670
GP UN BME type of stuff there was an
exploit video cord

678
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:51,480
actually new screen grabs of Firefox
just using web GLX somebody to Morley

679
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,180
can

680
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:56,450
get pieces of your video memory thrown
back brilliant piece of work

681
00:44:56,450 --> 00:45:00,270
and the game will begin again with more
by browsers

682
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:03,410
browsers on phones browsers on tablets

683
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:06,790
here the fears it's it's sort of like
going back to

684
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:11,840
went back in the box began those the
same game the same circles or repeat

685
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:16,930
probably hack in the box 20 we talk
about you know such mitigations for

686
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:20,330
phones and then there'll be something
else to play around with

687
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:24,350
so s pretty much brings me to the end of
my

688
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:27,580
talk we have a few moments left for

689
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:31,010
questions so comments suggestions any

690
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:34,860
ideas on you know how to protect on how
to go for the breaking

691
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:38,370
solviva at this point

692
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:45,370
my demo start-up

693
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:51,380
if you've had it was just right for and
we want you would like from

694
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:54,810
your heart with sandbox be actually an

695
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:57,820
running the browsing the sandbox
environment would be

696
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:01,460
an easy exit for those kinda us to send
boxes

697
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:04,610
the so sandboxes raise the bot

698
00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:07,700
but they're not the be all and end all
because after all the browsers got to

699
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:10,460
work with operating system in some way
or another

700
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:14,730
yesterday's exploiters a fresh example
of chromium with all that sand box

701
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,170
getting busted

702
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:19,410
and local privileges be escalated

703
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:23,990
so it does raise the bar but sandboxes

704
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:28,010
at best a sandbox you play in it

705
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:33,120
well then you don't do anything isn't

706
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:36,780
I don't have much faith in sandbox they
make they make it very challenging

707
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:40,890
mark its mark a bulletproof measure

708
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:44,080
you need to exploit a sandbox itself any
noise I mean

709
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:47,930
today I mean let's let's talk about
exploration today

710
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:51,100
today's exploits actually compound
exploits

711
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:54,470
to do like to do something like a a shed
on chromium

712
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:57,650
or shell on IE you may need more than
one

713
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:01,440
defect to be chained together you
probably need a memory read

714
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:05,980
bach in back in the day couple of
decades ago used to scoff equanimity

715
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:09,110
like high reading I would remember who
gives a damn

716
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:12,460
dude im MADD bugs are worth their weight
in gold because now you

717
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:15,820
leak pointers big number of genes on the
fly

718
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:20,320
so that DEP part is taken care of later
donated programming that's a done deal

719
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:24,510
it's gonna be unless we change the whole
way of stacks and frames I know that

720
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:28,030
that's gonna stay a ASL a you defeat by

721
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:31,930
in for leaks memory leaks and pointed
influencing which is also

722
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:35,510
quite popular and there's a lot of work
being done in the area

723
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:39,630
so that gives you EA be control on the
browser

724
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:43,690
next thing you do need to do is bust a
sandbox and that you do by leveraging a

725
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:45,380
few ABA's

726
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:49,290
and that's happening so you probably
need two or three defects to be chained

727
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:50,310
together

728
00:47:50,310 --> 00:47:53,390
to achieve working exploit but as

729
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:57,980
demonstrated by a lot of these contests
it happens

730
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:01,620
with non negligible probability

731
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:04,820
sometimes you can find exploits in the
way doing this the

732
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:10,360
I E I E EXEC command use after free
phone last month floating around

733
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:13,680
that pop shows on a seven eight and nine

734
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:20,240
happens thank you

735
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,920
and fortunes

736
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:30,350
situations it's enough people for
questions

737
00:48:30,350 --> 00:48:34,840
nobody I'll come on gone than

738
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:38,140
yeah or

739
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:41,880
do I have one Justin or

740
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:46,240
we observation yes you can see

741
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:51,280
how you know with thats context
segmentation the light the truck went to

742
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,700
process like that what you're actually
doing is

743
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:56,730
just replicating sort that that that so

744
00:48:56,730 --> 00:49:00,850
compartment is a sleazy operating
systems in the Brazilian with us or like

745
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:04,380
we it's Nate eating its own tail so sort
with

746
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:09,280
situation where just piling complexity
upon complexity upon complexity

747
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:14,150
on I'm is actually is its it's like with
no way

748
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:18,960
if you look at browsers yes its looks
like complexity of the complexity of a

749
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:19,730
complexity

750
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:23,020
but if you look at operating systems
when the right

751
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:27,520
from the ground up with the comp
concepts of pain slicing and process

752
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:28,840
virtualization

753
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,920
in mind he's never would in the browser
to begin with

754
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,950
week on going through all that away we
have to live with all that crap

755
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:39,140
so we keep on board gaunt I mean one of
the things that I

756
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:42,420
one other things that's really apparent
when you look

757
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:45,710
the mindset with which

758
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:48,740
HTML was rich sex right

759
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:53,840
it was built by a few guys looking at
small part because going round and round

760
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:57,369
it was going on in Europe I mean and the
problem is is that the design paradigm

761
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:58,109
is to simply

762
00:49:58,109 --> 00:50:01,520
role indeed diesel for this for this all
things like

763
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:05,660
there's no this that like the language
itself doesn't have any context

764
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:06,440
awareness bill

765
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:10,800
into a doesn't have things like you know
like it's very very basic level doesn't

766
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:11,210
have

767
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:14,450
you know ID's it's like you know com you
know inherit

768
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:17,820
contact things like this it's is in
there yeah

769
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:23,310
you're right and in fact this you you
almost get me started again on all these

770
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:24,590
type of things but

771
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:29,490
to we've had this conversation a number
of times I've yeah

772
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:34,270
its ochem I'm not gonna pop up my my my
my doin the princess laid on you know

773
00:50:34,270 --> 00:50:34,690
how

774
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:38,450
how the the gap is still not bridged but

775
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:42,680
it's there you can google it up and see
