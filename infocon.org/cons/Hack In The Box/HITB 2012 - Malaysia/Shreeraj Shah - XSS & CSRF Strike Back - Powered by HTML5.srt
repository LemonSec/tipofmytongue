1
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:10,740
up

2
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,010
space

3
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,480
space

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:21,480
sleuth

5
00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:28,840
of so I'm going to court today are
something called

6
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,129
are html5 and it has opened up aw

7
00:00:32,129 --> 00:00:35,650
a new ways of are packing unpacking call

8
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:40,519
essentially excess and CSRF and we try
to call or some of the defense as well

9
00:00:40,519 --> 00:00:44,430
are before going into it of this brief
reduction of mine

10
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,789
I'm all for it of a company called Blue
in fee and I obscure

11
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:50,800
saw you pretty much to all

12
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,840
assessments on-demand scanning
consulting its a crop

13
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,210
in and source code audits are an
application security

14
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:01,699
in Paseo was a founder for net square
and before that

15
00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:05,880
I used to work with found stone che's
are IBM and so on

16
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,899
in my primary interest is that security
so it's all

17
00:01:08,899 --> 00:01:11,910
all a comp maybe try to do all

18
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:15,649
federal I'll come up with a new
technique of scanning or what's going on

19
00:01:15,649 --> 00:01:18,929
are a great some albee's of all

20
00:01:18,929 --> 00:01:23,729
attacking are defending and so on also
lots of tools are published on our site

21
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:24,399
which can

22
00:01:24,399 --> 00:01:27,729
are down on and play around like Don
scanned on tracer

23
00:01:27,729 --> 00:01:30,770
are to be a scanner and so on so they
are some saw them are

24
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:34,660
addressing website all our web services
and so on

25
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:38,229
are published every advisories on
darknet anjala

26
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:42,539
are presented black at how to see and so
on and he does all the books written by

27
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:43,020
me

28
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,270
all the packing hacking web services and
Web 2.0 security are

29
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:52,009
so today's agenda our camera colour
today is all

30
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:55,420
are we look at html5 our Tax Office

31
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:00,170
are the 24 section and then we'll focus
on CSRF in excess and then

32
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,840
of course some are questions also html5

33
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,310
love actors are looking at the tax
office also if you go open

34
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:12,569
reached the news articles out there
right now off on some of the predictions

35
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:14,060
out there would say is that

36
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:18,090
html5 offers all multiple way of our
hijacking

37
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,230
are your website's are there is very
interesting

38
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:24,370
I'll research was published by Enis a

39
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:28,599
where they took are I don't 13 HTML
Specifications

40
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:33,150
are and gone through it track morrow
them and takes a

41
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,900
I don't UN Security all what unity
wannabes

42
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,579
are kind of a weakness out there also
that's interesting

43
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:43,909
html5 is giving new opportunities of

44
00:02:43,909 --> 00:02:47,099
for cybercriminals as well are and
looking at the

45
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:50,549
beef history of html5 or HTML

46
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:54,120
so start in 1991 but up the major
breakthrough

47
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,879
are which is up 13 HTML standard was
2005 there

48
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:02,290
exits are a mental picture rejects and
Armin exit rockin in the picture

49
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:06,060
and then it all of a sudden started to
all

50
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,400
I'll give a more horizon or more XO face
are

51
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:15,480
who up browser also in 2009 there text
email specification spiced up in college

52
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,489
teen milf I even what we have is

53
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:20,650
on you so face new architecture in New
defense

54
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:25,370
has come into picture so the other brief
html5 specifications out there

55
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:29,609
are all the standards which are looking
at I would say sixty seventy or eighty

56
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:33,810
percent at all right now working in our
browser be to Firefox or fall

57
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:37,769
a chrome or IE and so on so now what we
have is

58
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:41,120
are several different of standards in it

59
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,219
like local store age all 5 system

60
00:03:45,219 --> 00:03:49,010
are EPIA are then you have a
drag-and-drop

61
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:53,689
are of Lexus shot and that sockets and
so on so if you close look at this

62
00:03:53,689 --> 00:03:56,700
pretty much whatever happened is our
modern browser

63
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,900
if you take a morning bro that
Architecture group like this what we

64
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,629
have is

65
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:03,779
pretty much over here you have lbs
different policies

66
00:04:03,779 --> 00:04:07,400
are which are sandbox content security
policy course all

67
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,639
and so on so this is up or policy yet

68
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,730
on top of it what you have is up a
network and access where you have

69
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,530
exit job level 1 and level 2 calls and
then that sockets

70
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:23,010
are and then plugging sockets also what
happen is now you have

71
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:27,030
with html5 you have any part all exit
out of check

72
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:30,610
that six intellectually request object
to which also be an open a socket

73
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,710
the back and connections and so on and
even

74
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,810
you can open a socket cross-domain as
well so we'll

75
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:40,690
look at that in detail up which leads to
all CSRF

76
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:44,160
are and then have a fully PCB duplex
connection

77
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,530
are which is with the WebSocket now that
you can open again

78
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:51,400
to a JavaScript in your browser so
that's very of spiced up

79
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:56,540
all network access you have on top of it
you have a process in logic

80
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,950
uses a section which is really really
really spice stop

81
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:04,020
in HTML fight what you have is a very
powerful JavaScript API

82
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,410
are bundled with these four RP altered
containers one is are that ask you all

83
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,710
our index TB

84
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:14,510
so pretty much you can Dom data like I S
Q a light database which is running on a

85
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,250
browser not on a somewhat

86
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,750
are and you can post date added: are

87
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,140
you can have a cash in your browser you
can

88
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,760
gash the PDS so it's not a similar site
cashing it so browse our site

89
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:31,180
cash in which you can do all amazing you
can create a file system

90
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:35,260
you can literally create a virtual file
system for every domain

91
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,350
in your browser so for example if you
visit my for Doc bomb

92
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:42,670
I can create a lil little filesystem and
these file system can be permanent or

93
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,660
temporary

94
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,970
so like I can dump a file for Orman all
feature

95
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,460
whenever you visit the site I have those
files available are and then you have a

96
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,480
storage

97
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,870
are local storage or session storage
which allow you to

98
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,870
all store name value pairs in your
browser

99
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:02,050
so that is are very powerful storage are
which is added

100
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:05,250
on other one is a bomb don is not on
force backs

101
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:09,340
so that's a very powerful dawn aspects
which we have it allows you to XPath an

102
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,510
XML processing and so on

103
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:14,910
well one of the interesting thing which
is added hook is called

104
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:18,870
losses and trades so now what we have
here in a browser

105
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:23,520
something Corvette workers so bad but it
does allow you to spin the traits

106
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,480
to JavaScript in your browser so we
never had a trades in a browser now we

107
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,290
have a very powerful trades in a browser
which allows

108
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:33,330
us to up 20 background processing

109
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:36,390
and on top of it you have html5 and css:

110
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:39,870
which allows you to have several
different EPA's which is like

111
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,020
a media you out geolocation and so on so

112
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,090
if you close look at the browser
architecture it is more like a

113
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:50,170
take blindly no longer a thin clients
Lake your your looping back

114
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:53,330
talk with the up to the past their be
migrated from

115
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:57,020
declined but inclined and now im going
back from 10 to take

116
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:01,300
and all it is interesting that these
particular stack which you're looking is

117
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,740
not just for the browser which run on
your desktop

118
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,150
it is applique believed cool more by
devices

119
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:11,370
Android or any other device you you take

120
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:15,860
of so that's a one piece of information
the second part is

121
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:19,600
there is a concert will change in the
application architecture

122
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,990
so for example html5 all applications

123
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:26,280
of which are running something called
single Dom

124
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,270
page applications saw these applications
are

125
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:33,380
just one page application you visit a
slash page it

126
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:37,770
sends you a bunch of JavaScript of which
gets loaded and then everything is

127
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:41,270
in the single DAW so once your
application get compromise your gonna be

128
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,630
on

129
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:45,370
that particular on the and then Dom
extraction the menu various different

130
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,470
things can happen

131
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:50,430
so what you have is a single all are
JavaScript and HTML

132
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:54,980
I'll walk through are you have a bberry
strong policy out there our sandbox

133
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:59,030
all the CV just to be followed and then
you have all these different gadgets

134
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:03,050
all ordered marge was sitting in your
browser you can use a story babe SQL

135
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,710
index TV file system cache EPA's

136
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:09,870
messaging ABA's on the POF one your
location other EPA's and then you can

137
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:10,530
use

138
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:15,110
very powerful executing that sockets to
communicate the back a

139
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:19,820
so this is how application would look
like now looking at some

140
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:23,110
samples here for example there's a
little application

141
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:27,420
are were here also what we have his art
this is obligation

142
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:31,790
if you open all already call our
development tool box for a cool

143
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:35,140
and it's a simple XD male 5 application

144
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,789
and there is a sub interesting tap the
source where you can see all these

145
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:39,860
different resources which application is
dumb

146
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,320
in your browser so what are there is
definitely a bad SQL

147
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,439
you can see all these that SQL so it's
%uh it's a bit out these bitches

148
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:50,540
not on the site or site but supply in
sight you visit the pH

149
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,920
impeached company to right in your

150
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:59,370
are in your peach also that saw thats
appliance a database that SQL

151
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:03,279
are then you have you what are the
different pages you can or see or hear

152
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,910
all you can see once you login the
application

153
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:10,410
you can see local storage you so these
are the local storage

154
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:13,910
like hash in it. these are not the
cookies there like a local store at you

155
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:14,749
distort

156
00:09:14,749 --> 00:09:18,720
in your browser our and can be used so
that is loaded here

157
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,939
all then you can go few other pages
around

158
00:09:21,939 --> 00:09:25,420
some other PGs you can see Index TV so
the dopant

159
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:28,879
is not say yet where do you go to a
particular page

160
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:31,920
where our database are it's like a
database call

161
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,689
so you get index TV all over here all

162
00:09:35,689 --> 00:09:38,889
you go or to laughin' and

163
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:42,499
orders over here just click this claim
coupon

164
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:46,769
as soon as you claim this what is going
to happen is are index TV will set

165
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:50,709
a token on your browser so it here

166
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:54,329
you can see all resource and you can
have a

167
00:09:54,329 --> 00:09:57,709
open you so this is how

168
00:09:57,709 --> 00:10:02,040
all morning application would work all
interestingly I was talking about file

169
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,189
system so so for example if you bought
your

170
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:09,649
and that is our it is a detective
filesystem so use a filesystem

171
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:14,139
and/or HTTP you're here you can see a
show me all temporary file so this is

172
00:10:14,139 --> 00:10:17,819
the actual file system a virtual file
system which is created

173
00:10:17,819 --> 00:10:21,230
on the brought their sandbox to
particular domain

174
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:25,870
would and pretty much a file system will
pop up so this particular application a

175
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:26,579
spirited

176
00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:30,029
temporary files on your browser peach
here

177
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:33,050
so you would be able to see all the
files which are created

178
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:37,019
of for these particular application saw
you can have a permanent files

179
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:40,790
as well so you can see all the store
opens files like you not Summerside

180
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:41,439
these other

181
00:10:41,439 --> 00:10:45,550
browse our site filesystems you're
seeing so the subreddit plenty of

182
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,600
different

183
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,829
all things which already know what your
are you

184
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:53,180
all traffic and everything will go over
Jason or

185
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,749
XML or so on now this is not specific

186
00:10:56,749 --> 00:11:01,569
ought to are just a bit broza so for
example if you open a scene application

187
00:11:01,569 --> 00:11:06,069
in all I would say are more by right so
you have these mobile application so

188
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:06,990
these are the more bile

189
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:10,220
seem application using video cameras and
all the pics

190
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:14,519
are using the jQuery form or by also
what we have is a list of different

191
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:15,339
application

192
00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:19,019
the same application which seamlessly
work on more by

193
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:23,850
devices so here we are working on simple
browser over here now we are working on

194
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:28,189
Android browser are the same application
will work and eventually

195
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:31,559
you can actually create a hybrid
application as well so this is up

196
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:35,209
this is a is a simple application you
are using hybrid

197
00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:38,999
so what you do is you cleared up endroit
pour in binder your

198
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:42,809
HTML fight or their using the vet you
and that will also

199
00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:48,309
all seamlessly all work in a browser so
pretty much this is how

200
00:11:48,309 --> 00:11:51,309
html5 would work and when we come to

201
00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:55,819
analyzing these applications unita
different set of tools and mindset so

202
00:11:55,819 --> 00:11:58,920
for example if you analyze these
applications we need to

203
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,149
have a strong JavaScript are analysis

204
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:05,939
also were here for example what you've
created which can download as well which

205
00:12:05,939 --> 00:12:08,149
were repeated its own accord on trees

206
00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:11,980
so dont racer essentially is like like
ER

207
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,699
JavaScript sniffer also can you lower
the pH what has been happening is

208
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:17,119
Jalisco plate

209
00:12:17,119 --> 00:12:20,639
thousands of lines of JavaScript is
going to be dumped on your browser but

210
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,149
when you

211
00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:24,550
one who actually analysis they're so
cameras clicked the spartan

212
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:27,910
which Allah steps are being executed I
will I will focus on goals

213
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:33,199
he saw only so then this particular who
is a Firefox plugin which allow you to

214
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:36,749
are trapped only does lines of
JavaScript and/or you can do is you can

215
00:12:36,749 --> 00:12:39,029
apply some regular expression rules

216
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:42,850
also for for example or here you're
looking for all the calls

217
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:47,759
which are html5 RB Scott so as soon as
you start loading the pages you can see

218
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:49,259
all these different called

219
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:54,579
filesystem all local storage call again
local storage call and so on

220
00:12:54,579 --> 00:12:57,980
also pretty much this tool allows you to
do an analysis

221
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:02,430
on your Document Object Model are this
the database transaction

222
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:06,990
who cool and so on I'll call if you
login you can see

223
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:10,949
all file system being created if you do
a new on you or you can starting

224
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:14,189
you can see these three adults with the
regular expressions matched

225
00:13:14,189 --> 00:13:17,689
are you can see Index TV calls and so on
so we're going to use these

226
00:13:17,689 --> 00:13:21,240
are tools for these kind of utilities to
perform

227
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,079
are they saw essentially what is going
to happen is are interaction would be

228
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:26,490
usable login

229
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:31,129
all it's going to get some kind of html5
pages are components like audio/video

230
00:13:31,129 --> 00:13:32,920
canvas kooky local storage

231
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,680
SQL index TV file systems and so on so
this is

232
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:41,439
all a pH what is the one-page order one
single dawn application

233
00:13:41,439 --> 00:13:44,790
all which is running so but this other
track martyr

234
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:48,300
or opportunities for tracks are being
change

235
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:52,180
also what we have is these other top 10
kinda far attack back does that you're

236
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:52,749
seeing

237
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:56,069
all under these new light all one is
CSRF

238
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:59,610
the Texas charen course our second is a
jacking

239
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:03,040
you're a click checking at checking and
so on so there is something our core

240
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,259
checking that you can

241
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:08,749
I'll Lord across do mean resources as
well so we'll core that

242
00:14:08,749 --> 00:14:12,619
are then there is a HTML fight 31
cross-site scripting and then there are

243
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:16,980
attack vectors which are attacking
storage Don variables exploiting browser

244
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,249
plug-ins and so on so we're going to
start going

245
00:14:19,249 --> 00:14:23,079
a few of these are backpackers as we go
the first back to back to

246
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:26,929
which we have is of CSR FN checking for
example

247
00:14:26,929 --> 00:14:30,730
so what we have is you're trying to a
venue to our analysis of the pros are

248
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:34,629
how they are behaving that these no new
policies car costs and

249
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:39,939
are and awe it bypassing ESOP that's
that's been a featured speaker at it

250
00:14:39,939 --> 00:14:41,259
bypasses

251
00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:44,459
so what the hell is exit Charlie will
want to lower to call and that you have

252
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:44,709
a

253
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:49,999
SOPA Nepal so what your now one of the
fundamental difference between exits are

254
00:14:49,999 --> 00:14:51,970
little 1x a child labor to

255
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:55,279
which we have with html5 is that that

256
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,339
XHR it no longer are supporting just

257
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:02,589
the binding just the pics protocol know
what we have is weekend

258
00:15:02,589 --> 00:15:05,970
you can use text unable for document law
are

259
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:08,980
formed a toute la file file are able for
extra

260
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,999
so we can upload anything and you can
download anything using

261
00:15:11,999 --> 00:15:16,009
pretty much XO chop so that's the one
change all

262
00:15:16,009 --> 00:15:20,379
other significant changes you have it
the with EXIT chart and of course is

263
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:24,899
up before XD a milfy Exeter was strictly
abiding

264
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:29,379
something on SOPC motion policy so if
your PTZ Lord from a Google n if you are

265
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:31,579
using exit out and try to connect to
Yahoo

266
00:15:31,579 --> 00:15:35,769
you won't be able to connect because are
you are doing a Sobe violation

267
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:40,009
now this is news on top what we have is
under the policy which is getting quite

268
00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:44,429
boss cross origin resource sharing
policy so if you follow quarks

269
00:15:44,429 --> 00:15:48,179
then you can make across origin call so
you can make

270
00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:51,809
using its a chart you can make across
oregon call

271
00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:55,679
and what you have is you have negotiate
a pre-flight Paul's

272
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:59,639
ought to negotiate are to access this
cross odeon resources

273
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:02,910
so few extra haters are you know what
you're like origin

274
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:06,089
accident or request methods request
headers and so on

275
00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:09,980
also these hitters will essentially
allow you

276
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:13,290
ought to talk all but the cross to me
now

277
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:17,639
and then what we have is this is a clear
case of more or less like you can see

278
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:21,009
up opportunity or possibility of the SRF
because now

279
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:24,559
you can clearly still channel using its
a chat with Exeter is by

280
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:28,459
by meet its very still you can still
channel to cross domain

281
00:16:28,459 --> 00:16:32,249
all an attacker can send appeal or all
bear

282
00:16:32,249 --> 00:16:35,730
are say is that I can control up now
these particular detectives I can say

283
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:36,339
okay

284
00:16:36,339 --> 00:16:40,559
myelogenous stop so now any any any
domain can now talk with me

285
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:44,639
so what we had is lol still channel one
this year sorry if

286
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,739
all with any stream is possible are here
are some restrictions where

287
00:16:48,739 --> 00:16:52,239
you can do all you can do I'll the you
can pick

288
00:16:52,239 --> 00:16:55,800
appeared on the pages are a dummy farm
and then you can do exit charted

289
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,980
G-seven Excel 2002 menu plate twain's
but I would hear what you have is now

290
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,399
you have a

291
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,069
raw connection so pretty much you can
send any content to the server be to

292
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:06,179
Jason or about four or so on

293
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:10,530
or you can look do with yes RF as well
know what we have here is

294
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:14,689
are if a subtler is allowing to Loris
are lower pH

295
00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:18,620
I'll order or a network which is the
origin is set to stop

296
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:22,370
and pretty much you can do you can send
the request you can grab the response

297
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:25,669
back and you can would be pursue a
response extraction as well

298
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:29,480
so that is how are this one what now

299
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,140
what we having a courses when you do a
pre-flight Paul

300
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:36,519
if you go on using certain types of

301
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:41,220
on 10 tight for example explain or might
be park or so on

302
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,429
on both cases York pre-flight check will
not come up

303
00:17:45,429 --> 00:17:49,529
you just allow you to be allowed to call
to go in

304
00:17:49,529 --> 00:17:52,610
at the same time in the exit row what
you have is something called

305
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:57,010
with credentials so if you creative
potential Struhl

306
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:00,269
then what is going to happen is are your
cookies going to

307
00:18:00,269 --> 00:18:03,320
replay so in this case is pretty much

308
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,100
are you going to internal network
scanning you can do information

309
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,049
harvesting

310
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:10,409
you get started using functionality like
it you up your

311
00:18:10,409 --> 00:18:13,830
and so on so let's take an example you
have

312
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:18,620
a site where you are logging which GPS
and you get a session cookie

313
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:22,610
are now the site will say okay you wanna
buy some product

314
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:27,029
are it'll make extra charge all and
using a challah spirits and

315
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:31,399
are the actual object auditors say into
something for Jason stream

316
00:18:31,399 --> 00:18:35,880
are back to the settling your successful
now your sister still live in your

317
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,760
ending up on the package site saw as
soon as you visit the pH what is going

318
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,960
to happen is they'll get

319
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,140
ship the CSRF Lord are to your browser

320
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,390
and that browser will have a content
type to the white be flight and with

321
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:49,100
potential sector troop

322
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:53,019
sent this case what has been happening
is are without your consent without your

323
00:18:53,019 --> 00:18:53,899
knowledge

324
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:57,570
these kind of a court for example what
we have is the opening

325
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:01,019
are Exeter object your and now we have
open

326
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:04,360
which is a post mattered your are
attacking or

327
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,260
of green who Jay service which is
adjacent be so this

328
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:12,289
in the XML it can be any other so this
are setting up on type2

329
00:19:12,289 --> 00:19:15,899
explain yet setting the credentials to
true and then your

330
00:19:15,899 --> 00:19:19,120
sending garage is an animal up or here
it can be any other

331
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,769
are Street so what is going to happen is
without your consent without your

332
00:19:22,769 --> 00:19:23,570
knowledge

333
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:27,899
a CSRF request will be get or did you
needed from your browser

334
00:19:27,899 --> 00:19:31,240
and it will actually of pic to your pet
store

335
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,370
and without a victim's consent or no
peace still back will take place and

336
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:39,070
acts I'll the peach will get exploited
it CSRs

337
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:42,779
say for example if it agrees that
particular example or here

338
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:46,789
so simple example we are on 100 Oct 21
right now

339
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:51,820
and you go ahead and place an order with
your so you can see the HTTP request

340
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,940
ought to the book in in below what your

341
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,470
any proxy you can just wrapping the
request and are seeing all these

342
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:02,149
West so there's a typical get your
question now when you place an order to

343
00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:03,100
generate

344
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,549
of some kind of all some kind of a
forced request it

345
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:12,130
with Jason so you can see this
particular all Jason request or your

346
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:15,370
and your cookie will definitely get
replayed are

347
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:19,000
are in this particular piece you can see
the content babies explain any good

348
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,679
actual response back

349
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:24,850
this response will not get your order in
the DOM if you don't have allow origin

350
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:25,820
to stop

351
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,980
also you get these response now you
visit other

352
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:34,139
beach or on their site separate domain
is 121 the completely separate domain

353
00:20:34,139 --> 00:20:38,230
are this is not required just for the
dam which day so now what you have what

354
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:38,970
good is

355
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:43,409
all your screening from 106 121

356
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:46,690
you are sending a raw cheese and by
request and we're just fighting the

357
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:47,399
script

358
00:20:47,399 --> 00:20:51,639
you have a bit credentials trujillo so
this will actually play York

359
00:20:51,639 --> 00:20:55,409
years ago also this menu click on gol/

360
00:20:55,409 --> 00:20:58,580
you can see all other HTTP request which
is

361
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:02,309
going to get fired up all fired up now

362
00:21:02,309 --> 00:21:08,250
click on war here

363
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:13,059
and you will see this request

364
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:19,539
here so this is like CSRF from 21 you
have fire request the six kooky replayed

365
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:22,830
the only catch here is a explain safe
your

366
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:26,190
so your site is validating the content
that okay this is Jason

367
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:30,049
by the stakes plane then you can have
some kind of a action here

368
00:21:30,049 --> 00:21:33,110
so this is a pedofile factors which are
possible

369
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:36,590
with EXIT chart in Excel chart is lately
still because won't be able to see

370
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,809
anything anywhere

371
00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:41,330
in your browser because late September
when you click at raff you can see

372
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:45,549
video going and so on bought this was
not the case with exit shot

373
00:21:45,549 --> 00:21:49,380
also this will go through our top

374
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,460
other functionalities like say for
example upload functionality can be

375
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,220
exploited

376
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:56,940
in similar fashion because what is going
to happen is almighty Park request

377
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,100
on the fly you can construct 2x a chart
page

378
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:04,309
and Force cross to me so here for
example you have all seen the App Store

379
00:22:04,309 --> 00:22:07,419
that you have some kind of uploading
bulk orders cease okay I will upload

380
00:22:07,419 --> 00:22:08,620
some bulk order here

381
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:12,820
and you get a success back also were
here that is all up more fear than you

382
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,029
do up for applaud

383
00:22:14,029 --> 00:22:17,340
what is going to happen is this going to
fix the request will get fired up

384
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:21,570
you have a multipart form 8 I'll let you
know you have a boundary and so on

385
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:24,610
now what you can do is you can craft a
binary

386
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:27,760
image file or anything that you want to
create what your

387
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,970
of using exit shot so now when you visit
the Packer peach or even happen is they

388
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:32,570
will send

389
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:36,620
up gaylord all which will create
something like this

390
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:40,269
that you create Ustream like a file on
the fly

391
00:22:40,269 --> 00:22:44,289
and then you create a boundary then you
create a X Exeter all over here

392
00:22:44,289 --> 00:22:47,809
all and then you have a on pain position
over here and then you fire

393
00:22:47,809 --> 00:22:52,139
West and this will actually are start
initiating dop Lord like

394
00:22:52,139 --> 00:22:55,679
a human has done doppler also this is
another

395
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:00,340
back to of which is possible of it X a
child labor to

396
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:04,370
other interesting one in the morning I
think Jeremy are discussed about the

397
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:05,980
internal scanning their

398
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:09,570
you can do a lot of internal scanning
appeal the Lord which is coming

399
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:13,529
ought to you well from internet and then
you have internal servers or ad here

400
00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:14,480
like your

401
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,490
that obligation subtle body or a bad
meal or you are internal HR so it wasn't

402
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:19,070
for

403
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:23,419
now html5 is application needs a lot of
interaction of across to me

404
00:23:23,419 --> 00:23:27,789
say fuming that one of these application
with your has access control

405
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:32,600
up hello origin sec to stop then what is
going to happen is you can actually do

406
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,899
not just the skinny you can go to crawl
you can go ahead and do internal

407
00:23:36,899 --> 00:23:38,429
crawling because now you're

408
00:23:38,429 --> 00:23:41,460
response extraction began you can say
okay now I will

409
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:46,059
extract his response ban allow voting is
set to start what is going to happen is

410
00:23:46,059 --> 00:23:50,840
your transport Lee Rd travel actually go
up into your document object martyr

411
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,299
through Dallas if you can start
extracting the spawning

412
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:58,730
so we're here for example all you have
are or what you're just

413
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:02,179
scanning using extra charge you're
saying that okay let me see a get with

414
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:02,580
them

415
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:06,950
finding anything on that particular IP
address or not you to a port scanning

416
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:10,399
and you see access control origin is set
to true then and then

417
00:24:10,399 --> 00:24:14,230
you will get some point in coming into
your document object mark

418
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:18,480
and then pretty much you have all you
can go ahead and start extracting

419
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,950
so for example if be are

420
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:25,240
go ahead and start simple port scanning
which is that our

421
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,690
X a job you're doing this simple port
scanning is OK

422
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:33,179
are look around any internal IP
addresses so it'll start

423
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:36,809
doing all any of these internal IP
address and say

424
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:41,919
okay iPhone one or two applications are
one twin donuts or words which are

425
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,590
reciting 621 which is say on this
particular so what what you have is

426
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:49,740
access control our region is a call true
so now

427
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:53,490
pretty much you can start crawling the
sites as well

428
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:56,909
because now this is not a one-way CSRF
this is more or less

429
00:24:56,909 --> 00:25:00,070
like a two issues are if you were for
establishing connection you're grabbing

430
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,200
content

431
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,419
are and sending so so for example we
start crawling

432
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:11,419
or here

433
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:16,440
so he say of skin and what you can see

434
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:21,259
what happened is you able to extract
HTML page in the fall

435
00:25:21,259 --> 00:25:24,899
because allow access control origin is
stop

436
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:29,630
center to star you actually get the on
paint which is expected not

437
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:33,049
one base yes our effort is more or less
a good who is CSRF

438
00:25:33,049 --> 00:25:37,529
soon as war and execute the Lord what is
going to happen is you get the squinting

439
00:25:37,529 --> 00:25:41,190
which is coming from across to mean
cross-domain ship you continue your Lori

440
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:45,860
the only thing is all your cookie may or
may not be played depends on the law

441
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:49,740
on the president's box Albert pretty
much it's possible to do

442
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:53,620
all all something which is a quickie
less for example any pages

443
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:57,019
lying on your internal network and if
it's always been a star pretty much can

444
00:25:57,019 --> 00:25:58,029
access

445
00:25:58,029 --> 00:26:01,759
so what other defense mechanism which we
have very less rate this point

446
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:05,710
I what you can do a on dirt bike check
you can make sure your cost policies are

447
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:06,549
in place

448
00:26:06,549 --> 00:26:10,049
of forming uploaded the talk instead
will block this

449
00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:13,789
of as for the scanning is concerned as
far as all the major is concerned if

450
00:26:13,789 --> 00:26:18,539
you can use a secure libraries and will
CSRF protection and stronger Corus

451
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:23,279
implementation of so there's the one
factor another factor is

452
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:27,679
are interestingly up being the pH being
a single mom

453
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,090
are what you can do is you can you
something are

454
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:36,029
using up core checking for example
crossroad cross-domain resource checking

455
00:26:36,029 --> 00:26:39,149
also we have these UAV dressing a bag
was standard one click

456
00:26:39,149 --> 00:26:44,269
tab events extra now html5 in our year
applications are using Flash and

457
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,710
Silverlight send your files and so on

458
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:49,750
and all these are pretty much an object
eg R&B

459
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:53,990
bag or so on so what you can do is if
you find a single dawn application you

460
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:56,789
get entry point into the Document Object
Model

461
00:26:56,789 --> 00:27:00,120
pretty much you can are you can start
changing

462
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,789
are the are playing the source and you
can change is the resource for something

463
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:05,240
else for example

464
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:10,200
saw or hit I'll be held on this tax
assessed you have a single dawn use age

465
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,830
and then some kind of a flash file

466
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:15,880
sitting there so we can extract that
particular flash file

467
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,549
using the spot document are getting even
buy it. call log in

468
00:27:19,549 --> 00:27:23,049
items you src so this is the actual

469
00:27:23,049 --> 00:27:27,250
actual login object now what he say's
change these object to

470
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:30,259
some cross-domain resource so what is
going to happen is

471
00:27:30,259 --> 00:27:34,299
or you have a login SWF file which is a
valid as to be a file coming from the

472
00:27:34,299 --> 00:27:35,070
domain

473
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:38,950
and now you're pointing it to something
else so what's good for example if you

474
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,000
want to pass on these

475
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,159
the Lord all we can pass on all

476
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:47,070
as such what we're doing all we get is
adjusted using a W Val

477
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:50,600
also forced you will actually translate
these resource into

478
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,720
Rd ste text into this text very weekend

479
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,610
possible on single courts and other
courts because if you pass on through

480
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:58,720
the URL

481
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,720
at imported so if it's going to the poor
stated what

482
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,990
tells you it can use this also now for
example

483
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:10,179
if you bought her dinner in our in a
demo page so what do we have here is

484
00:28:10,179 --> 00:28:14,370
a simple login page from say for example
food Oct back took typical bank which is

485
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:15,320
passing your

486
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,919
so this object is actually are SWF file

487
00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:23,480
which is coming from the gym at object
are leading allegedly made to me

488
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:28,360
now if you do appear source yet you can
see logging noticeably a fight here

489
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,570
and you know that you find our one of
the DOM based

490
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:35,970
or excess or here so now what you're
doing is

491
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:40,429
all word and to alert so you will get a
popup it's a single dawn

492
00:28:40,429 --> 00:28:43,889
application with your now if the goal

493
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:47,129
and try to access that particular file

494
00:28:47,129 --> 00:28:50,669
as you can see single courts and other
courts will not walk through its index

495
00:28:50,669 --> 00:28:53,970
here now we go back your

496
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:57,769
and what you can see it's a completely
separate to me

497
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:01,039
all which is 100 or 200 something
separate domain

498
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,049
the seam component is deciding what
you're the only difference is this

499
00:29:04,049 --> 00:29:05,179
little I'm here

500
00:29:05,179 --> 00:29:10,320
this really great line here so now we go
ahead and

501
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:15,070
are trying to change this object bit
that particular SWF file

502
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:19,250
so knife were here

503
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:22,399
and of on other people or

504
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:25,639
all this is kinda far all

505
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:29,059
which we want to inject into our
Document Object Model it's not this if

506
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:30,460
the boss on this

507
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:35,509
but string here

508
00:29:35,509 --> 00:29:38,700
so we pass on this all

509
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:42,120
using simple javascript

510
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:46,870
or we can pass on are in the URL itself
and secured the link

511
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:53,340
also be take this

512
00:29:53,340 --> 00:30:00,340
all and force it into the law into the
browser

513
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:04,340
all this and you can see the law the
source has been changed because now you

514
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,090
have a

515
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:09,419
cross-domain Jackie so the same going is
the same

516
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:12,960
but don't the the component is actually
being

517
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,039
change underline so this are the sum of
the

518
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:19,100
up I'll keep checking stuff for a

519
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:23,139
or are you a hijacking stuff was good so
definitely are you have these

520
00:30:23,139 --> 00:30:26,480
difficulty checking stuff but if you
want to protect your

521
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,149
a browser's or to protect you are sir
were against these kind of object

522
00:30:30,149 --> 00:30:34,870
hijacking and pretty much object src of
a content security policy would kick in

523
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:39,120
because the CSP s something quite FG
object src that you can define

524
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,690
just nor the self of don't object goal
or any other object

525
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:47,230
the CSP will kick in yet so this is more
or less like a CSRF

526
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:50,840
are bitches augmented differently next
year male 5

527
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,039
specs are moving to XSS

528
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:58,029
so cross site scripting is pretty much
I'll pretty much a well-known

529
00:30:58,029 --> 00:31:00,570
are pretty much I was in nineteen
ninety-five percent application would be

530
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:02,700
well there were two some kind of access

531
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:07,769
now with html5 I'll if you look at the
generic sense what you have is

532
00:31:07,769 --> 00:31:12,200
all pretty much you have so many tags
nah like new events tags: new actually

533
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,190
read your tags on your bags all are
added so pretty much

534
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:19,220
are you have all these different acts on
top of it what you have is

535
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:22,840
you have are opportunity after post XSS
as well

536
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:26,190
so they've definitely different up was
texas is a paternity

537
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:31,100
are comes up so basic bags and basic XSS
I really simple you have

538
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:34,610
multiple different we do who excessive
number you have a filter

539
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:38,149
which is reading scripts blah blah blah
you have something to fit a

540
00:31:38,149 --> 00:31:41,629
now these other backtracked does need to
be added to check your figure like a

541
00:31:41,629 --> 00:31:43,639
video or audio and so on

542
00:31:43,639 --> 00:31:47,480
also you have in your bag on a source on
added you can inject you can now import

543
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,759
select Expedia keygen you can actually
inject

544
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:54,419
are and then you can have a form ID past
and so on

545
00:31:54,419 --> 00:31:58,480
so there are tons of different way you
can do attack you can go to html5

546
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,499
sect are taught saw that there is a very
nice cheat sheet which

547
00:32:02,499 --> 00:32:05,769
are what all these different I correct
now

548
00:32:05,769 --> 00:32:10,139
once you have a back successful are
there are some interesting

549
00:32:10,139 --> 00:32:13,549
all began is a mean html5 which allows
you

550
00:32:13,549 --> 00:32:17,799
all pretty much to op

551
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:21,210
to some interesting stuff here for
example

552
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:25,129
if be go forward here

553
00:32:25,129 --> 00:32:29,460
so what we have here is all for them or
so for example this is a page where you

554
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,610
have some kind of a

555
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:34,490
up what a partner to to XSS so you have

556
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:38,279
a search page where you can do a simple
access so-what here

557
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:41,499
now what we're doing here is doing the
testing is

558
00:32:41,499 --> 00:32:45,730
art this is the script now you can see
or hear

559
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:49,269
html5 has something but I free

560
00:32:49,269 --> 00:32:52,460
any an iframe there is a tree wood
courts sandbox

561
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:56,450
so in a sandbox a tribute you can define
are what you want to do

562
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:59,999
so what we're doing what carries in a
sandbox your

563
00:32:59,999 --> 00:33:03,259
so you have excess so you wanna put
earlier of

564
00:33:03,259 --> 00:33:06,519
our the seemed to me nor seen page on
the top

565
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:09,690
and then we can have a coke into the law
was so

566
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:13,289
what we're doing is we're making over
Texas that sticky you can access it

567
00:33:13,289 --> 00:33:16,049
reflected one but once it happened it
become a sticky

568
00:33:16,049 --> 00:33:19,909
on let till that point during that
particular domain Nexus S will keep on

569
00:33:19,909 --> 00:33:21,620
sending you a signals back

570
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:26,700
so what we're doing what good is very
simple we r injecting I free

571
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:30,059
oh and at the back and I've you've just
created all Nord module

572
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:34,120
are which was just listening all for the
traffic and using for the peel or and so

573
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:34,820
on

574
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:38,470
and when we get something of a traffic
back to login now here is interesting

575
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,700
thing began said

576
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:44,559
excess control allow audition to stop so
now what is going to happen is

577
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:49,679
that particular particular browser can
talk with us awake such a channel

578
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:53,850
at the at the same time then we make a
POST request me sick explain

579
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:56,850
so then what is going to happen is all
almost

580
00:33:56,850 --> 00:34:00,129
up beef like Paulson a comment the
picture so now

581
00:34:00,129 --> 00:34:03,249
this is over NFL VBR passing a test

582
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:07,769
Lord your are and this is where we are
injecting iframe

583
00:34:07,769 --> 00:34:10,929
and then we to inject iframe you're
seeing the same to me

584
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:14,389
so the weenies 121 you're just injecting
the same domain

585
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:19,399
what yet I'll and the attributes which
you are sitting on a sandbox that's

586
00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:20,460
important

587
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:24,280
is this allow same origin allow

588
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,740
farm allow script so now what happened
is

589
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:31,129
since what origins are the same beget

590
00:34:31,129 --> 00:34:34,559
from or XSS began Lord iframes doc

591
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:37,970
we can access what is going in sight
there and then

592
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:41,059
you can pretty much whatever you're
listening you can start

593
00:34:41,059 --> 00:34:45,720
of sending those messages back so now on
top of it what we have is we are just

594
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,790
listening

595
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:51,030
art of use your the peel or or
interestingly you can use

596
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:55,609
up wash state a history book which state
is on HTML 5

597
00:34:55,609 --> 00:35:00,130
RVF EPA which allows you to change the
address bar as well

598
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:03,630
saw menu browse around your address bar
will also

599
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:07,300
change so then or good and then you are
listening for

600
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:11,720
who feeds are and then you get the ball
fields anyone and both anything in both

601
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,420
feet

602
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:15,690
you start sending a signals back and
then

603
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:19,089
is actually going two hundred Oct 6 eate
vivere

604
00:35:19,089 --> 00:35:22,540
are listening for the test traffic

605
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:27,160
so not in this case for example if you
go ahead and

606
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:30,900
startling watch be lord

607
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:34,329
so he say Nord and start this so now we
have started the server

608
00:35:34,329 --> 00:35:38,349
and your setting up the law the URL or
appeal or

609
00:35:38,349 --> 00:35:42,460
what he read the script SRC 100 up six
port 8080

610
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:45,680
script so now as you can see

611
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,970
what happen here is the same PHC million
has been ordered

612
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:53,880
and the broad the the user we'll see I'm
on the same side he will browse around

613
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,170
and whatever

614
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:59,819
up happening is even you do on the site
but the at the back and the iframe

615
00:35:59,819 --> 00:36:03,200
this directly on iframe right now is
listening

616
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,790
for all the text boxes so anything and
bring the text box

617
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:10,050
you're listening now so for example die
move from here to login page so

618
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:13,440
plus two pgs to text box of a login can
be

619
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,349
can can be listened as well so we're
here for example

620
00:36:18,349 --> 00:36:21,980
of on this but lap ligation you can see
the messages are coming back

621
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:26,710
x1 x2 let's keep on appalling state also
will keep on getting those

622
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:30,670
messages back yeah so now as soon as you
enter full

623
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:34,020
all your for can be list can be seen for
bought

624
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:37,160
whatever you enter pretty much you can
see that as well

625
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:41,520
so pretty much there are scenarios which
exchange with html5

626
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,569
on on this saw

627
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:47,780
xD My Fire tax office also scanning
defend

628
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:51,050
are reflected persistent XSS and
standard excessive production will come

629
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,520
into picture

630
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:56,040
one another added defense which we have
Aug

631
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:00,630
are it up with the new browser is RCSB
thats on and security policy

632
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:04,109
it's based on origin are which %uh which
beat dictates

633
00:37:04,109 --> 00:37:07,859
what to do and what not to do oh and it
has a different implementation for

634
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:09,740
different browser so they will send

635
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:13,829
I'll actual hitter are with expected CSP

636
00:37:13,829 --> 00:37:19,130
all content X content security policy
for Firefox this for Safari and Chrome

637
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:22,290
up and then you can define or what to do

638
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:26,490
on what not to do on the road this is a
for example you say a script SRC just

639
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:26,839
run

640
00:37:26,839 --> 00:37:30,329
self scripts only and saw also these are
the key

641
00:37:30,329 --> 00:37:34,280
directives that you have on our on a CSP
like connect src

642
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:38,510
which is essentially you can't dictate
that socket and exit at Connect bitch

643
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:42,000
resources object src media I am he

644
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,500
for their sake and for what so for
example you when you get X assessed

645
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:49,319
and someone try to inject appeal or from
be four so on

646
00:37:49,319 --> 00:37:53,190
and if you have all script SRC to self
only

647
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:56,230
then accurate description or going to
get executed

648
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:59,790
so there's a very are interesting
defense out there but some bypasses all

649
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:02,960
for this as well %uh but this really
works of

650
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,000
or all the browsers right now which we
have

651
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,490
up so once this isn't in in the place

652
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:12,930
some new features can be yesterday
exploited

653
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:16,680
so one of them is definitely a storage
so what you have is all

654
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:20,880
with a with html5 you have a story DP
eight so storage API

655
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,260
allows you to all YouTube Lord

656
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:29,369
information locally in your browser be
local story or a session storage

657
00:38:29,369 --> 00:38:33,050
also what you can do is you can use a
local story EPA insists that item and

658
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:34,950
your hash a time and so on

659
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:38,030
so what are you going to see down the
line is not a sensitive information

660
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:38,420
zagat

661
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:42,829
sport on the local storage all
interestingly all the storage is

662
00:38:42,829 --> 00:38:44,109
actually stored

663
00:38:44,109 --> 00:38:48,970
are using SQL light in your profile so
pretty much if malware or so on

664
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:52,260
grab that then pretty much all the
storage files

665
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:56,290
all the storage can be explored can be
expected

666
00:38:56,290 --> 00:39:00,319
so what we're doing what goodies RBL we
have a blind Lord

667
00:39:00,319 --> 00:39:03,500
all which we are passing so this is like
you're checking for on

668
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:07,460
and are lengthened and yes just sitting
anything the store

669
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:11,109
on the lookout for it you know
absolutely no idea you can extract

670
00:39:11,109 --> 00:39:15,349
saw if a site get X ask our site get
exploited

671
00:39:15,349 --> 00:39:18,900
what is going to happen over here is
also for example the site which we are

672
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:19,880
looking at

673
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,290
now this site is been after you log in
it will give you

674
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:26,520
of some kind of our something of a local
storage

675
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:30,390
our session storage now his appeal or
what we're doing is

676
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:33,819
I'll local story to blind local story
and numeration

677
00:39:33,819 --> 00:39:37,859
and then me grab all the local story and
then posting it to

678
00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:41,020
across to me again the the north which
you use for

679
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:44,540
are expecting this saw passing up

680
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:50,240
watch be Lawrence wrote this year now
bossing the local storage be lord hear

681
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:54,400
so we start the server and then we see
okay

682
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,450
boss on the law XSP lord hear

683
00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:01,300
are are different IP and this is over

684
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:04,700
simple the Lord if you're on the loop
for example

685
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:07,960
native Lee in the browser say for
example

686
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:13,190
also this ever just really get that less
variable here

687
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:16,349
she forgot

688
00:40:16,349 --> 00:40:19,670
case get this and forced

689
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:22,829
in the browser Iran you can see there is
a1

690
00:40:22,829 --> 00:40:26,380
local storage all which is right there

691
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:31,280
so now it's sort of a this what we can
do is we can pass

692
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,349
the search page and pason appeal or

693
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:40,290
which is again the same thing shown for

694
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:45,049
and were here we just put our

695
00:40:45,049 --> 00:40:50,280
yes listening for response which comes
back

696
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:54,460
your passing song here

697
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:57,569
and pretty much get

698
00:40:57,569 --> 00:41:00,640
the local store it back so this is
another

699
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,740
lease there like a cookie we have a
place today

700
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:06,900
some sensitive information will be
reciting others

701
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:11,040
other interesting all thing in html5 is
Corey

702
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:15,369
local filesystem like Windows request
file system request file system appeared

703
00:41:15,369 --> 00:41:18,440
with your bros are you using so you have
these

704
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,960
all full-blown filesystem so so for
example application creates a file

705
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:22,690
system

706
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:26,660
on your browser so this is a is a
browser file system and then pretty much

707
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:27,339
as

708
00:41:27,339 --> 00:41:30,700
writing some opens on the file there is
a profile file

709
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:34,250
it as something of a token or sensitive
information or loss transactions there

710
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,170
and so on

711
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:38,819
if your boss on the spin or pretty much
you can retrieve

712
00:41:38,819 --> 00:41:42,670
all different father Jerry sitting on a
filesystem

713
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:46,339
another interesting factor which is are
then you run a single Dom

714
00:41:46,339 --> 00:41:49,390
application what is going to happen is

715
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:52,869
application will create lots and lots of
global variables

716
00:41:52,869 --> 00:41:56,760
our venue in ELISA josip you will start
seeing of global videos and these global

717
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,819
variable speed

718
00:41:57,819 --> 00:42:00,790
you check on all these different
application notes plenty of global

719
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:01,710
variables

720
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:04,760
and a global videos can be easy victory
all

721
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:08,500
with these new and then you you extract
these during your

722
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:13,520
excessive peel now one of the many of
these global variables would have

723
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,740
email at: I would have a cross-domain
opens

724
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:20,260
ossetian 80 fires and so on so this
global

725
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:23,400
variables can be extracted is

726
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:27,500
up so you can run this new and show you
all different

727
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:31,540
our global variables so this is another
a place

728
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:35,809
in HTML I drew an application where are
javascripts

729
00:42:35,809 --> 00:42:40,020
up not the owner developer all all these
different libraries

730
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:43,150
are also using global variables of
course

731
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:48,130
sporting a CSRF Google earns are and
sessions and so on

732
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:51,970
are so there's another all opportunity
that the html5

733
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:56,579
such scanning storage lots or send you
information on local storage and globals

734
00:42:56,579 --> 00:42:57,720
and then you need

735
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,869
up proper excessive productions

736
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:06,190
of another interesting is SQL are
injection in a blind enumeration back to

737
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:09,670
so what you have is up you can create us
client-side

738
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:13,510
sequel are using their best babe sq at
our index TV

739
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:17,450
also you can use open database and
execute call this will create something

740
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:18,109
to file

741
00:43:18,109 --> 00:43:21,180
a client-side the top or what your

742
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:24,230
and pretty much you can do something if
a blind

743
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:27,880
enumeration so we're here for example
you can't run through

744
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:32,440
the windows Jalisco who run through all
the objects and if it is a fine a

745
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,690
database object

746
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:38,000
you run the SELECT query against the SQL
master database which is this girl I get

747
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,930
a visit is a setting on your browser

748
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:42,930
and you extract the table name which is
created by

749
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:46,500
all though the user or by the
application

750
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:51,290
also we got are construct 32 days we
gotta escalate moscow he got a false

751
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:52,130
table

752
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:56,540
other view of people is a vet it able
also pretty much if you run this new

753
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:59,890
blindly on any of the domain you will
see all

754
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:03,119
you will find the finding that means you
will end up finding a school results and

755
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,700
from that you can find item database and
that's pretty

756
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:09,630
then X is a simple you're on all want
equal to one kind of attack vector or

757
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:10,920
whatever you want run

758
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:14,000
against this and you can extract are
data

759
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,369
from essentially up from the browser

760
00:44:17,369 --> 00:44:20,390
so that's interesting another another

761
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:25,339
new feature which is addict who html5 is
called fed messaging and VoIP

762
00:44:25,339 --> 00:44:28,380
workers so what you have is all

763
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:32,299
been ever had a civil W nor to 3 iframes

764
00:44:32,299 --> 00:44:35,530
in your in europe in your browser peach
all these

765
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:39,339
iframe cannot talk with one another the
other centers all the traffic backed the

766
00:44:39,339 --> 00:44:42,089
server and then you go to call into
second I free

767
00:44:42,089 --> 00:44:45,329
now what we have is bit force message
mechanism

768
00:44:45,329 --> 00:44:49,119
what it can do is you can talk with
these two different life seems awk

769
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:52,270
you can talk with you on your background
processes which appeared in a bit

770
00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:53,140
workers

771
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:56,160
saw you have iframe can be ordered

772
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:00,010
and talk with these cross-domain are and
of course message call

773
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:03,809
all will be %uh bill isn't so so for
example if you are

774
00:45:03,809 --> 00:45:07,670
your javascript is listening for any of
these course message call

775
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:11,599
then you can actually I get iframe and
then you can start talking the disputed

776
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:12,500
life

777
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:15,599
so what are the check but you can have
is a bit of course message is sick to

778
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:16,380
stop

779
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,940
or your own domain then the den and then
you were pretty sure that

780
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:23,450
you're talking with the past %uh see my
free so while the check

781
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:27,089
which carries are checking the origin
before start listening

782
00:45:27,089 --> 00:45:30,430
for the new incoming or outgoing data

783
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:33,900
no vet look for is is a worker thread

784
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:37,180
which can start in the background been
up bennett in a peach get

785
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:41,210
loading so what have you sort code is
you are you want to start so for example

786
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:42,809
you have appeared very or who

787
00:45:42,809 --> 00:45:45,990
are checking your mail checking your
Twitter account checking your Facebook

788
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:47,980
and everything runs in the background so

789
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:51,520
anyone who anyone who something
something interesting happening to fire

790
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,450
back and then if we get low reading your

791
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:56,780
a front page so you can start avoid got
three

792
00:45:56,780 --> 00:46:00,230
which is called Val waterworks a new
worker and then you've boss on

793
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:03,270
the GS file which one run in the art in
your bag

794
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:06,410
and then many would you want to listen
or send a message you can use a worker

795
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:08,369
Dark Horse mass it so now you have a
late-night

796
00:46:08,369 --> 00:46:12,119
channel establish between your back and
connections

797
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:15,839
so now what you have there but but but
what do you think we should be a burger

798
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:20,200
is not having is a better naw Yukon to
the vet but could you can access these

799
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,049
particular document object mark

800
00:46:22,049 --> 00:46:26,020
but pretty much you have all other
features what you're like a regex

801
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:30,960
RH Jason all exits are and so on
everything you can

802
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,819
you can Ronald here so this will tread
been running a bad girl

803
00:46:34,819 --> 00:46:38,130
now the security issues which we have is
do not allow

804
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:41,400
across to mean all straight so you gone

805
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:46,170
pointed to some others GSN citron off at
the same time it has a problem with EXIT

806
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:49,470
chart it is a problem with the DOM based
access and it is a problem with the

807
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:53,559
US you can order to deport so for
example is a very simple example what do

808
00:46:53,559 --> 00:46:54,930
how would you tease

809
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:58,559
are you hoping to trade your which is a
message or GS which is listening for

810
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:00,559
your back and meals or so on

811
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:04,210
and then you have your passing read and
stop months you're reading When You're

812
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:04,720
movie

813
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,780
some some on in which is already in the
back to rate

814
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:11,010
you can say okay grab the content and
put it in

815
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:15,290
my place order now these placed order
you have your HTML used

816
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:19,740
so pretty much someone insane our live
content which is going to get executed

817
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:24,400
in your browser so for example if you go
here

818
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,589
and go to these little rejects which are
created

819
00:47:28,589 --> 00:47:32,650
and one of the major discord messaging V
chip right so you go to a message in

820
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:35,980
which the jet and save read my last
message which is a bag don't

821
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:39,000
and then as soon as you click on the
message it's going to get executed

822
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:39,910
because

823
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:43,260
someone to send you a malicious message
which is tunnel true

824
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:46,970
are you and then it goes to bed but good
and bad but good as eventually done

825
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:47,859
little

826
00:47:47,859 --> 00:47:51,480
are the front track so this is another
interesting

827
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:55,780
of scenario and the book is pretty much
what's on on all the browsers as well

828
00:47:55,780 --> 00:48:00,280
also ever contact possible to cause XSS
running scripts also be able to work and

829
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,289
helping them bait

830
00:48:01,289 --> 00:48:04,619
script and there is something all import
script which

831
00:48:04,619 --> 00:48:08,829
are using insider there but you can call
a across to me

832
00:48:08,829 --> 00:48:13,420
all so this is are and for the
particular to force can defend

833
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:18,660
are pretty much all the standard arm
again is unreachable for your dog is tax

834
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:19,220
assessed

835
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:22,390
running a dawn greaser and looking for
the traces and so on

836
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:26,240
so you can find out also this is just a
scratch on

837
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:29,450
on the surface all these are the summer
the fuel all

838
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:33,750
XD if I specifications saw is still
cooking up and lot more to come

839
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:37,200
there are some other interesting EPA's
out there are finally be a bitch allows

840
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:37,619
you

841
00:48:37,619 --> 00:48:41,430
in handling clickjacking our
drag-and-drop abie

842
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:46,119
all which can are which can be all
hijacker exploited cash

843
00:48:46,119 --> 00:48:50,059
it is you have a cash API seeking cash
the PSF

844
00:48:50,059 --> 00:48:53,559
gonna on a cyber cafe in your cash get
polluted

845
00:48:53,559 --> 00:48:57,450
so you're prozor site gaskets polluted
oh that's a possibility

846
00:48:57,450 --> 00:49:01,240
as well so these are the sole the EPA's
which allows you to

847
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:05,240
up perform I'll rich application

848
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:08,599
are inside your Rosa without using Flash

849
00:49:08,599 --> 00:49:12,920
of Silverlight so pretty much a flash in
a Silverlight is dying and we just taken

850
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:13,990
over by

851
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:18,599
html5 an interesting all these attacks
if you talk to vote is not just for the

852
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:20,579
browser it is for all

853
00:49:20,579 --> 00:49:25,109
are more buy devices as well so if a
mobile devices running on our

854
00:49:25,109 --> 00:49:30,000
that you are hybrid application or
typical html5 application then also

855
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,450
are they can be wonderful so a lot is
going on in our

856
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:37,430
HTML fights peace are here are some
references and resources that are great

857
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:38,160
stuff

858
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:42,440
you could text email fight of Starcom up
pretty much good samples out there

859
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:47,039
or less %uh is running a cheat sheet
project for html5 security there

860
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:50,720
our list of good resources and good naw
on loaded

861
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:55,400
are there is a quick she cheat out there
all bitches on html5

862
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:59,680
sect are all are there some interesting
resources out there on html5

863
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,780
security guard dog where r list %uh is
done

864
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:06,299
and then the corbis our blog there are
some interesting

865
00:50:06,299 --> 00:50:10,780
all observations have our own html5
along with some exploits in

866
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:13,990
things up or state saw all the good
references out there

867
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:19,039
are so in conclusion pretty much email
five is becoming a de facto standard

868
00:50:19,039 --> 00:50:22,520
its northern option which you have are

869
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:26,500
and pretty much as you know like a
browser that broken it looks like got

870
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:28,030
the specs are going to give

871
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:32,460
are more fortunate ease are at the same
time some defense are are in place or

872
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:35,099
embed our big into the browser as well

873
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:38,950
also if you are developing or assessing
or are getting

874
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:43,420
html5 driven applications and these
other you the new things which we have

875
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:45,089
to adding a checklist

876
00:50:45,089 --> 00:50:48,369
are for the auditor assessment where how
all

877
00:50:48,369 --> 00:50:52,660
all these particular new calls are are
being implemented

878
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:57,299
awesome that's pretty much it from my
side are like an open floor for the law

879
00:50:57,299 --> 00:51:04,220
any questions that you have are you can
ask

880
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:07,180
okay no question are

881
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:09,640
thank you very much for listening we
patiently are

882
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:13,460

884
00:51:30,789 --> 00:51:32,680

885
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:39,680
sleep
