1
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:11,519
up

2
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:12,330
this

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,150
space

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:21,150
sleuth

5
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:29,270
ladies and gentlemen now let me go to be
a bronco

6
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,570
a is going to give us a scientific but
not

7
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:36,050
academic overview on my way you very
much

8
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,750
up hello everyone so

9
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,870
thank you for standing up or stay here I
i kno I have like two

10
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:48,230
very competitive tracks going on right
now facts and procures up

11
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:51,269
I myself want that to actually watch
their talks

12
00:00:51,269 --> 00:00:55,649
I know they're pretty interesting so
thank you for stymie up

13
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:58,659
so they do have this talk is to be very
formal

14
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:02,949
if you have questions just find the
questions my way

15
00:01:02,949 --> 00:01:06,300
I at any time okay it's better that way
stuff

16
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,408
waiting for their hands and the if you
send me questions

17
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:14,270
I will give like Brazilian drinks with
tears like a

18
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:19,010
Kasasa up Vikas Shah size up Brazilian
drink

19
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:23,560
I am Brazilian by the way and the this
drink has two main purpose

20
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,260
okay before swine is you can actually

21
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,770
clean your car motor with the brink so

22
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,790
if you're going to break it you can just
clean them out of your car

23
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:37,820
and the second purples I don't really
remember because I killed a lot of brain

24
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,320
cells using this drink

25
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,750
so so

26
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,240
just ok i restart actually complimenting
my friends and people who actually

27
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,930
country with for just talk to actually
be possible

28
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:54,350
so Gabrielle Blair balls and at a good
now a to researchers working in

29
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:58,950
in Qualys working on my team actually
coping writing all the cold

30
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,760
you guys gonna see there's a lot of gold
that we needed to write in order to

31
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,250
actually

32
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:07,930
make this research possible so the
greatly contributed to that

33
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:11,780
another Pinedo another researcher
working with polly's for joining our

34
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,250
team

35
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,980
little bit later but also contributed
greatly for the project

36
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,480
a better Feria I researcher working now

37
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,730
for Microsoft which really is that a lot
of different papers

38
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:27,310
on for all many of those techniques that
we discussing in this presentation

39
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,900
Shaurya by the way he is here wrote as
fact see

40
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,930
and I really said the a paper and gave a
presentation hacking about some stir

41
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:35,379
than

42
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:39,650
I just after his presentation I dropped
him an email

43
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:43,189
asking for a little bit more details on
what he did how he did it

44
00:02:43,189 --> 00:02:48,079
and he gladly country with them gave it
backs on how he wrote like his two

45
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:51,290
membership with the two available in
open source that greatly

46
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:55,030
how badass to actually the fact that the
techniques am actually looking to the

47
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,769
album our samples at the picnic where
you said before

48
00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:01,310
and also reversing labs for writing the
two-term cor

49
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:05,359
a they gave that's where I was and we
use that for unpacking my hours

50
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:08,430
and of course to our view guys that

51
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,579
do Mar analysis and write papers and
write blog polls & Country with with

52
00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:16,529
stuff that without this kind of research
community research

53
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,529
it's really not going to be possible to
face Mauer

54
00:03:19,529 --> 00:03:23,790
so I will start saying that I leave here

55
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:29,310
okay in in the Amazon are rests outburst
was very well known for having too far

56
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,629
is that the forces Brazilian locate
smart international territory

57
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,819
its president a Tory but that's not
really true

58
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:41,489
I actually live here I where we have the
fam Bobby Karneval this whole families

59
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:42,219
parties

60
00:03:42,219 --> 00:03:46,310
I but we don't party all the time it's
not like people believe

61
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,540
we don't party all the time the city
that I leave with

62
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:53,879
looks effect like this some follow it's
one of the biggest city in the world

63
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:56,989
sold their there are Brazilian
schoolwork believe me

64
00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:01,790
so today what we gonna serious I

65
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:05,599
iru I will explain a little bit about
like the motivations of this research

66
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,430
what are the fundamentals of the
research what does the approach that

67
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:12,609
we took for doing it I'm how we collect
the data

68
00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:15,959
because if we went to say to scientific
Congress start

69
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:19,250
we need to show you the methodology
behind it and

70
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:23,280
works well in a bit above the Technics
the research that we created what is

71
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,720
available to all love you

72
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,570
after to talk and to give some
conclusions so

73
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:32,840
basically we all know and we are all
here because there are

74
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,379
lots of bureaucrats every day right I

75
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:40,229
in tomorrow landscape we've know there
is like hundreds of thousands of new

76
00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:40,910
powers

77
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:46,060
peoples coming out every day that's just
not possible to analyze

78
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,580
is up manually we don't have enough
analyst Ron allies Mahler's anymore we

79
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:50,990
need

80
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:55,120
ways to alter mate and that's why we
have to other talks above

81
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,120
power in this conference and both of
them talking about

82
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,569
automation because it's just not
possible to do that manually anymore

83
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:08,129
its chill when with see people talking
about hope I'm a shy when we think the

84
00:05:08,129 --> 00:05:09,139
industry

85
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:13,620
people showing automation and when we
read books and papers about

86
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,669
operation their ultimatum Gonzalez of 81
same poll

87
00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:21,639
so if you look like for example hookah
sandbox and other approach

88
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:25,800
like that our public that are available
for the normal research for the

89
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,620
usual research the basic goal to make
that pass to finalizing

90
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:34,060
one our sample don't talk to me the task
of analyzing many samples

91
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:41,060
yes

92
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,980
you can do like a thousand samples

93
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:50,190
at a time yeah we've had this discussion
by email actually

94
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:54,170
just after day at the black hat
basically a out the guys from Google

95
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:57,530
drop me an email saying yes you can
actually signed many samples

96
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,920
automatically forward

97
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,310
for Coco by the matter is it's not an
architecture that you have like

98
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:06,310
with machines and that you can easily
split the Sables between

99
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:10,470
what seems you can do that only one one
machine and then very limited

100
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:14,150
attend when you're talking about
hundreds of thousands of cycles you can

101
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:18,000
use a multiple virtual machines as one's
yes

102
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,020
mood over 20 machine isn't only when
real machine

103
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,070
you still don't managed to actualize
like

104
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:27,890
hundreds of thousands of samples in one
day with only one machine

105
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:32,720
so that's that the main problem and when
we see like the industry talking about

106
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,210
that

107
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:36,720
it's always like this right read the
books and people are like okay let's

108
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,470
help make

109
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:41,450
one step of the analysis or when they
talk about meeting all disabled analysis

110
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,460
always liked it yes

111
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:46,380
you just put more over Thomas things
that's not the way you gonna do it

112
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:51,390
you meet mort real machines II guess you
guys solve it felt great presentation

113
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:55,580
and the beauty a huge machine huge
question of what seems to actually do

114
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,450
this kinda fun

115
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:59,710
analysis and that's a big challenge that
we have

116
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:04,290
become the community amidst work on this
challenge who is one of the projects

117
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:04,620
that

118
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:08,160
are available and our other reports
doing it a

119
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,290
but what we I want to point here yes
when

120
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:14,880
with see the Kompany's a specifically AV
called

121
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,350
stoking above hours it's interesting
because in one side they say there is

122
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:22,000
like hundreds of thousands will say
people every day

123
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,890
and in the other side when the show
statistics the source but the six

124
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,770
against like four thousand fables

125
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:32,740
10,000 samples fifty thousand samples
they never saw a statistic the greatest

126
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,590
museums of Sables the looking

127
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:40,010
that's kind of weird because if for you
have hundreds of thousands

128
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:44,280
every day when you expect somebody to
show you a statistic and

129
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,580
that statistic has some meaning it up to
at least needs to be some millions of

130
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,820
singles being analyzed

131
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,970
and that's that's what I've been whats
basis for his research

132
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:57,530
to get one specific field which was like
all the powers are protecting themselves

133
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:00,600
and look against like museums of powers

134
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:05,080
and give the results and then see if we
can actually find something out

135
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,930
we actually did on on on this research
up before we continue

136
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:13,910
i rude just explain what we look at that
ISO

137
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,060
into the buggy for us for the conference
of or

138
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,520
this talk if picnic that the power wheel
import a

139
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,400
employ to actually avoided the debugging
process I

140
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,010
if I know I'm hours the taxing the rich
the presence of the burger

141
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:31,290
I assume there is a man's the bug
interconnect presence

142
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:35,250
okay not to miss a solid tomorrow we'll
do something you go just because there

143
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,430
is a debugger a passionate

144
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:40,060
but they issue that this to be true so
if the power have

145
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:43,990
anyway to the fact that the burger the
presence of other burger

146
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:48,380
I assume there is a mixed bag picnic
going on a

147
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:52,200
this and that is the same way the same
applies like reported to the friendly

148
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,890
process

149
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:57,120
if there is I have picnics you said to
actually confused it is a friendly

150
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,820
process

151
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,830
I assume the repayment to do the same
with the connect going on

152
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:04,020
up this case m is work a

153
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:07,660
we need a drink with the was cation on
on on the analysis

154
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:11,930
basically because when we look into and
is assigned leon and debugging and all

155
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:12,890
other techniques

156
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:15,970
obfuscation are actually going after us

157
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:19,420
we have problems in the fact that they
can ex-presidents because

158
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:23,420
the Sables also use a station so we also
need to actually the few minutes and try

159
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,860
to understand the implications

160
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:28,380
at 2 p.m. start that connects that you

161
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,910
that are used to to avoid driving or to
the fact the presence of a virtual

162
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:32,530
machine

163
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:37,070
a all his research it started because of
their interview and picnics actually

164
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:41,760
because everybody was like okay both of
them our samples refuse to run

165
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:47,950
EVA Air is that true or not I just see
people say you have the powers avoid

166
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:51,190
we know it's possible to detect the
presence of a VM but what is the

167
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:51,950
prevalence

168
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:56,110
of Mahler's actually doing it wave it's
repaired going to actually run

169
00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:00,580
ever be remembered in in real machines
going to run ever been on virtual

170
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,270
machines

171
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:04,760
which kind of the connects them are are
employing to the fact that gridlock

172
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,460
machines

173
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,480
sold those are the kind of questions
that we should be had

174
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,490
and with the time which funded the
research trucks week over other

175
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:12,160
techniques

176
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,330
what is interesting here yes if you

177
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:19,210
me to remember anything after two stock
anything

178
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:22,360
is that's up knowing

179
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,650
if a binary is my initials are not

180
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:31,220
isn't unsolvable problem rights we all
know that reduces to the halting problem

181
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,430
and that's unsolvable problem but
knowing

182
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:38,380
if a binary employs protection may come
is

183
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:43,810
that's very easy to solve thats does not
require a lot of machine power

184
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,870
and with the the end result basically
what we figure out is like

185
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:51,410
ninety-two percent more of disciples use

186
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:54,560
some kind of protection mechanisms so

187
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,530
if we as an industry just start
affecting the protection mechanism

188
00:10:58,530 --> 00:10:59,420
itself

189
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:03,420
we're going to force them our altars to
stop using protection

190
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:07,240
because that's a problem we cannot solve
if they don't use any protection

191
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,020
but then they will have a bigger
challenge because now they would be to

192
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,459
write much more cold

193
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:14,770
too great to the variations so I hope

194
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:18,870
we other industry we aspire to the fact
Inc this protection mechanism our

195
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:19,959
employees

196
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:23,320
and start showing that as malicious
behavior in programs

197
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,600
because there is not many real-life
programs that

198
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,410
employed this kind of techniques okay so
that's an important message that with

199
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:31,950
its covert

200
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:36,860
up with this research so their
objectives of the research

201
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:40,560
analyze millions of more samples shared
the Cure into

202
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,130
results that we we find and keep
updating it of course

203
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:49,240
and up we just do like always analyzing
you'll faint pulse

204
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,060
I with the ideas like I was more as we
can analyze

205
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:57,180
us batter of course we have a limited
time also for this

206
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:01,400
Falk we analyze like formula in saint
paul's and that's the reason is that I'm

207
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,800
sherry

208
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:08,310
up with we are not only looking to they
aren't sorry frank's okay div the

209
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,400
project itself looks into everything
required like

210
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,470
huge reports but for the talk itself I'm
just going to show

211
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:20,660
I'm sorry things okay but the week over
much of her friends

212
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,810
of course the detection algorithms needs
to be improved so we are always grating

213
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,390
and improving analyzing the Technics

214
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:30,450
up it's interesting that up for

215
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:33,589
for for this to be possible we need to
have a mark that sir

216
00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:36,830
so yes well there is a project car they
cite PE

217
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:40,970
a that we pray to the project is
basically to Great America

218
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:44,120
factor that is open for researchers to

219
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,130
access smaller samples and to have
machine powertrain allies

220
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:51,970
I'm our samples that that's what's great
because

221
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:56,360
up we see that the all that many
researchers that don't work for the AG

222
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,240
industry

223
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,280
they have a really difficult time
actually to get access to more Sables

224
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:06,000
to get access to a huge thing pole bait
up sometimes you do have access to one

225
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,250
specific same

226
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:11,280
but it's very difficult to get a large
collection that is meaning

227
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,540
meaningful so week with this project in
such a way that we give

228
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:19,390
axis for researchers to upload cold into
the portal

229
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:23,410
after they can actually see like the
cold running against millions of samples

230
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:26,790
that we have up

231
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:30,500
their country's open complete with the
comment that so with a comment the deck

232
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,459
that room I

233
00:13:31,459 --> 00:13:34,740
IEEE paper in March 2000 pair I

234
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:38,459
we have a malcontent Kate McShane is
that they are like in three different

235
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:41,440
spots to warrant was there one in German

236
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,100
I'll we receive now 150 gigs of more
samples per day

237
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,490
which is around 200,000 you more samples
per day

238
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:53,140
we receive from different partners most
of them are AV called police

239
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:56,440
so I'm not blaming the Navy call when is
the actually

240
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:01,660
I'll help a lot well we have mouth days
more than 30 million are you an example

241
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:06,440
the company's so bizarre the those are
the distribution of our partners

242
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,440
there are around the globe of course we
have even partners in Brazil

243
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,570
because well the project is hold them in
Brazil

244
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:17,530
up the project for the back and which is
responsible for actually

245
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:20,709
getting two more samples distributing
between the machines

246
00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:24,630
scheduling you fables knowing what are
the researchers available on it machine

247
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:28,030
running the sable sending the same
person wishing to be run

248
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:31,329
eat machine has a dispatcher which gets
a sample

249
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:34,770
start severe starts the staple runs all
the floggings

250
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:38,540
stop the VA and gets the PCAT gets all
the information

251
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:42,089
up we do have both static and dynamic
analysis

252
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:46,610
but or this presentation I refocus on
the static analysis only

253
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:49,900
so all the reasons that I'm showing are
going to be static analysis

254
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:53,250
so you're gonna see a sum up the pic
makes that I the comment that on the

255
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:53,910
paper

256
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:58,160
are not available on the on on the
presentation itself basically because

257
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,750
we don't have a way to the fact the
picnic only start collie

258
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:06,500
I up all the all the results that we
have like from the back and our us think

259
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,980
it back in the Porto in the port was
available to anybody who actually

260
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:13,720
once have access I we support the like
more games

261
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,020
so it's very easy to actually Adam you
called for analyzing samples the

262
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,829
bookings are actually responsible for
analysis

263
00:15:20,829 --> 00:15:25,160
up recapture the network traffic right
now we don't do anything with the

264
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,829
network traffic but we know

265
00:15:26,829 --> 00:15:31,030
there is a lot of researchers doing
research about with network traffic from

266
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,630
our so we can sherry

267
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:37,730
date of course and now we have a compact
versions of each power

268
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:42,470
so up %uh they said their country itself
don't do anything it's just distributing

269
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,270
staples around the machines

270
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:47,920
putting the samples to run and running
bookings the bookings are actually

271
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,050
working conditions

272
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:52,670
holds the bookies are responsible for
actually analyzing some

273
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:56,800
bring about their language independent
so we have right now begins in part on

274
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,750
MC

275
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:01,250
but up we can easily plug like for a
cold

276
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:05,810
rugby cold or whatever other language at
the side if it's not Java

277
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:09,410
because we don't like to up

278
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:12,740
the way that their country was great it
was to be very easy for

279
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:16,110
plugging new called so basically up
looking is

280
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:21,170
any program that receives as input the
main love the power which is a binary

281
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:24,430
ever assault put gives them at ISIS

282
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:27,829
when with pluggable gaming there
thatcher we r we do

283
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:30,589
like all the other the parsing of the
old would so we don't want the

284
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:31,720
researcher to change

285
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:36,560
and if a in his goal in order to write
trucks deployed that and got better

286
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,390
so here are like for example two
examples of bookings

287
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:44,270
their basic programs really simple
programs they just need to serve the

288
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,530
result whatever is the results for the
summer old words with

289
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:50,589
we deal with the old words and that
would put it on the database and we

290
00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:51,890
showed that

291
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:55,140
them but they did you hear is if you are
researcher

292
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,240
and I you have for example an academic
research you doing

293
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,520
are some some idea that you had
regarding our

294
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,780
and you have a cold that the allies only
when Saint Paul

295
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:08,480
you give to us reply get on their
catcher we run against New goes up

296
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,720
samples and we share back to results to
you

297
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,620
and to the community if you're not
willing to share with the community

298
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:17,880
we are not willing to actually help you
as well okay

299
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,060
that's very feeble to understand

300
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:25,709
so up the booking types are basically
static and dynamic a

301
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:29,350
but a this that keep looking are usually
our as a kid

302
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:32,510
outside of the VM that the power is
running

303
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,760
but we have a sub so so I when exception
is the unpacking

304
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,770
looking itself as a nation we use 50 to
think or

305
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:43,320
amor this days that commercial that runs
on Linux from to concor

306
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,180
was really that only and is black hat so
before that the beach run on on my

307
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,750
Windows VM

308
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:52,900
up dictator takes care of the brookings
making

309
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:57,130
stupid decisions right so if a booking
hanks or fails or whatever

310
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:00,910
it's not going to break ever think
they're tetra Tech's Cup at

311
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:04,680
amber for example this factor bookies
they can be executed before the power is

312
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,440
a cutie or after two more hours is a
cute ads

313
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,900
an example perspective looking that gets
acquitted after the power

314
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:14,070
this book is that you're with the
network traffic so

315
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:17,120
right now for example we've got the PCAT
then we split

316
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,640
the protocols so with great like
different sessions for each protocol

317
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,559
using like

318
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:25,920
Marsh archive X Factor's everything then
ticket bookings are the ones that get

319
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,780
the inside the

320
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,800
Retama same itself that was the power of
course

321
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,480
a we with some of them needs to run
before the power is running on the view

322
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,510
from some others

323
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:39,070
the meds to run after Mauer we support
both cases

324
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:43,850
right now we only support yams with we
goals but we planning to plug a a sauna

325
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:45,720
and right

326
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,809
up since we execute the mahler

327
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:54,080
recaptured a network traffic up the
power and though we also make available

328
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,620
the PCAT

329
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:00,990
a the name of the project I psyched be
actually came because the initial idea

330
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:05,290
west to actually analyze the PCAT and do
something usable with them

331
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:10,160
so by sector is the name of the parser
use it by water shark

332
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,420
so week actually got the name of the
bisector

333
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:17,350
prey to the dissect so stupid

334
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:20,559
I'm really bad with names so now
starting with this

335
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,160
specific restart so this is our the
fundamentals for the research trucks

336
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,420
would be possible

337
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:30,460
but what this research comprise actually
so we use at 722 course 100 gigs of

338
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,290
memory

339
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:34,380
we analyze only 32bit Sables

340
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,780
so we can all read any say whether there
were not like 32-bit

341
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:41,150
the staples for packard samples

342
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:46,210
we no matter how many a staples of the
same factor we had we counted only has

343
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:47,120
one

344
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,030
because face we are on a licensed at
goalie without unpacking

345
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:54,800
we don't learn factually to match the
statistics because there is one factor

346
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,230
there its prevalence

347
00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:00,070
so when you look at the numbers it but
there is for example

348
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:03,250
bringing them up the same polls that are
like back and with the same factor we

349
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,730
only counted as one sample

350
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:09,100
0 also for we analyze

351
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,480
all the Packers at their present between
the formula on same pace

352
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,950
so we look into all the Packers to know
what are the protection because the

353
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:18,820
Packers use integrated like a pop
backers

354
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:22,340
representation and for each of the
Packer

355
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,680
we look into each of the different
versions of the back and we also include

356
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,980
on the paper

357
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:30,570
which are two protection mechanism each
of the Packers & each version of the

358
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,340
Packer actually use

359
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,760
because the papers limped into space we
don't believe that for the top 10

360
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,580
Packers

361
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:41,100
but we have it for all the Packers so if
you have interestingly specific backer

362
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,320
and knowing which kind of protection
mechanism Becker emplois

363
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,420
just drop us an email it's a matter of a
querying the database

364
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:52,950
for for it I could Sables okay we
avoided Sables be good entry point my

365
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:53,930
mags

366
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:57,059
and thats only for performance reasons
because are

367
00:20:57,059 --> 00:21:00,170
the connection a in the Brazilian back
and

368
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:03,490
is not really high right now so it was
very hard like to press for tall

369
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:04,450
disables

370
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:08,530
from germany to Brazil and then copping
between the two different sites

371
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:13,440
for the analysis so we limit the the
sides to three-part marred by examples

372
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,420
so our sample sale at this baseball game
lived at the bigger ones 3.9 max

373
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:21,960
actually Sables bigger than that time to
be president saint paul's

374
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:26,770
because a the Brazilian banks they are
very complex and the security megan is

375
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:27,679
they employ

376
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,390
they have a lot of virtual keyboards and
a lot of different ways to revenge by

377
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,809
your machine and the machine

378
00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:36,870
acting so the president fables years we
are returning higher-level language like

379
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:38,650
a Delphine

380
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:44,070
I'll also we said about one specific
asap so which was the flame our just

381
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:44,650
because

382
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:47,910
its way its big deal so we went for two

383
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:51,110
includes like flame on the research so

384
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:55,030
this that's good night is as a nation is
like the main focus of this presentation

385
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:58,780
it improve the throughput that's why we
were able to actualize

386
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:03,300
millions of saint paul's well our
machines are not that because you see

387
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,730
week always growing the number of
machines we now have more course then

388
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:07,690
we've had like

389
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:12,140
when we started and of course the power
cannot do anything

390
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:15,820
when we doing it the appears that come
out as before the war is even running

391
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:19,940
we have the advantage so they do is try
to leverage disadvantage in see what can

392
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,140
we do

393
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:24,890
up of course we needed to develop some
time in america

394
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:28,630
counterparts for some specific attacks
and it is not possible to boost that

395
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:29,320
Cali

396
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,420
but the we we are not including the
results you're in this presentation

397
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:36,570
okay so everything you see here is this
patsick

398
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:40,100
the deployed the dynamic parts are
available on the portal

399
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:44,120
anybody can just drop me an email when I
give an account on the portal

400
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:48,990
up so the more protection techniques in
this work basically called hold greater

401
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:49,670
the like up

402
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:53,830
with smaller techniques we gonna look
act that that was like a

403
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:58,690
a supposed to be very simple right the
AV two sixes for fifteen years

404
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:02,670
so I was expecting to be very easy to
get to like

405
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:06,690
albeit protection mechanism our my hours
are using

406
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:09,950
and the that's actually turn out to be
very heart

407
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:13,870
about the huge majority of the papers
are from at a ferrier

408
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:18,360
summer I repair insisting blog some
analysis from specific weird

409
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,150
our samples that somebody sold the mower
same employing a meal picnic

410
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:25,420
so the guy the comment that in a blog
but he was not really a person on the

411
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,430
technique he was more

412
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:30,020
in person culture analyzing our using
the technique so it was very active

413
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,090
projects require the completion

414
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:35,350
of all the techniques that we needed to
analyze it was

415
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:38,800
very hard so in this paper up

416
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,390
and by the way the paper are available
weekday in there

417
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:46,210
cracking the books page with I just
puppet to than

418
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:49,670
so in the paper we included other common
vision for

419
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:54,940
each of the picnics and a in the end of
the presentation I will give you a good

420
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:55,390
sub

421
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:58,640
address where you can go and download
each

422
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,910
of the technique implemented so that
means we basically

423
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:06,050
implemented every pic make for the power
to avoid detection

424
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:10,410
and they are now open source from get up
so if you are a power alter

425
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:14,030
and he went through greater a superpower
with all the connects

426
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:17,790
just got to get her put it all together
am it's gone

427
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:21,830
and if you want a Veeco money please
just are defecting does that connects

428
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:25,830
because we making it very easy for Mauer
alter structure use that because we went

429
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:28,260
to the fact that using it

430
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:32,850
a of course we are always updating its
like it just for

431
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:36,130
after the presentation with all new
techniques coming out

432
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:39,990
about two days before the presentation a
in black hat

433
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:44,360
well somebody actually got a staple of
the feat Fisher

434
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,170
a and a few actually made it available
to us so we find out that the

435
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:51,440
the picture was using another new
technique that we didn't

436
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,140
including the paper so we constantly
updating the papers for the version that

437
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,290
you getting here

438
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:59,290
is different and the verse that we made
available for Black Cats

439
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:03,600
and I we got updated some with more and
more like picnics ok

440
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,820
I was paying attention on the first
remember in the paper

441
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:11,150
and of course for testing the PLO games
we've had like a pass bad

442
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:15,760
883 same post well of course official it
was like a thousand but we

443
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,450
we saw like a lot of summed up the case
also we believe that famine that it was

444
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:20,890
883

445
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:24,270
edit this best bet is only two to see
the performance of the

446
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:28,030
working that we just wrote to pass for
the mechanism the PLO game to be sure

447
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,440
that everything was okay

448
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,630
it's not really to a important

449
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:36,460
up for each of the facts are making is
that we wrote

450
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:39,990
a we have like three possible results
when is the fact that

451
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:44,250
that means this technique actually
exists on them our sample

452
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:48,120
the other one is of course not for the
fact that which means the picnic is not

453
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:52,550
breast presents on on the more sample or
we didn't manage to find the picnic

454
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,170
presents on a more stable

455
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:57,440
and the other one is we have a evidence
the fact that

456
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,050
up for the members that are going to
show for the statistics that we created

457
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:03,280
we can all rights they have there's the
fact that

458
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,830
because there might be false positives
and we don't want to like false

459
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,110
positives to change our

460
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:12,100
our opinions about the quality of AV
products or other

461
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:17,280
think that we can actually the deuce the
quality based on this research

462
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:23,060
so when we analyze the sable we rely
only all sections Micah does is a cute

463
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:25,100
bow or in the entry point

464
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:28,910
it even if I'm executable sexual history
phiri

465
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:33,300
a choice best run under Section but this
section is bob michael is a cute about

466
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:37,740
we ignore it for for the analysis for
the static analysis

467
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:41,960
I this basically means all the numbers
you see

468
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,180
they are probably even higher because we
actually

469
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:49,320
shoes into ignore things that can
generate more false positives is bad

470
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:54,330
is fed up include them so probably we
having more false negatives

471
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:58,050
because up some decisions that we make
but we don't have post posted:

472
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:02,040
so that's really good okay so the
members when I show you a member

473
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,880
for example if I I'll show you a member
eight to ninety percent of the

474
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,420
motorcycles use

475
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:12,140
a picnic there is no false positives for
sure it's a tonight or more

476
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:15,910
okay it's not eight to nine or less
because we have this kind of

477
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:21,740
decisions on the research up regret the
like a i jus the same related framework

478
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,740
I of course we didn't want to like for
each of the

479
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:28,420
power to run different bookings in each
of the plug easy thing to do the same

480
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,400
with a coat

481
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,960
but the that was possible just because
we where the waves right thing it's

482
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,160
so we created a framework and we just
use it

483
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:40,150
if somebody wants like to add up looking
to that that are you don't need to use

484
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:41,910
this framework you can use

485
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:45,830
whatever you are ready using for the
disassembly and I will gladly plug

486
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:49,480
it's just going to be a little bit
slower than what we have because

487
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,580
here it's basically the framework does
that there's a family

488
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:55,920
and calls back at the Brookings based on
the structure that would use a dress

489
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,530
that

490
00:27:56,530 --> 00:28:02,320
but thats was just because we have like
55 bookings for this research

491
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:07,680
so executive summary I basically I will
show here like the members rights

492
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,400
because

493
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,210
the members are very important and by
the way this is like a

494
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:17,440
a very famous roles like kids this story
in Brazil and I love it

495
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,470
but they're not a kid anymore here so

496
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:24,940
up from the total amount of sample that
we got allies which means like Morgan

497
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,690
for me them saint paul's

498
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:30,480
but we have the that 34 percent are back
at

499
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,070
and seven as 65 percent were not back at
all

500
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:37,720
okay so that's interesting because that
shoals ass

501
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:41,140
the industry looking for the Packers is
make sense right

502
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:44,480
there is a problem with backers samples
are being packets

503
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,360
but if we narrowed down that's we start
looking that

504
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:52,290
the the majority of the Packers are like
you px

505
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:55,590
which is kind of scene 02 and back and

506
00:28:55,590 --> 00:29:00,430
up backers like armadillo armadillos
very prevalent 6 percent of the samples

507
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:04,800
but this is still like even if you look
at armadillo asked back as perfect

508
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:09,380
like its famous backers they still don't
actually account for 10 percent

509
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,800
which is likely that the tax rate to
that we kind of miss

510
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:17,220
right up we see summer weird backers
like a bob

511
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:21,420
soft maybe they'll feed which is use
that for like they'll fit programme some

512
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,810
specific backers

513
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:26,320
and the this is interesting because that
souls

514
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,900
the prevalence of backers are actually
changing a lot it's not like a

515
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:33,770
our model is a big deal it's probably
the one that cuz very interesting

516
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:36,200
technology but it's not my style is the
one that is

517
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,080
use it more are more common more
prevalent up

518
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,570
one thing is the texting the Packers is
something very difficult right

519
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:48,450
a we have basically two ways were
attacked backers we have a database with

520
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:50,140
signatures for the Packers that we

521
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:55,060
with trying to the fact and we also use
a 0

522
00:29:55,060 --> 00:30:00,250
a statistics basically entropy of the
sections to know if its packet or not

523
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:04,760
so for some of the Packers we just say
well it seems to be back at because the

524
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,510
a trapeze

525
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:08,880
very weird but we don't know which
backers thats

526
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,950
okay so it's also included on the
research

527
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:16,280
and the if you have like your own
database or if you have like more

528
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,430
information to share we'd gladly

529
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:22,260
we'll plug it and actually give better
information on the on the back to prove

530
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,450
less

531
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:26,480
a week have like a partnership

532
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:31,090
with the Brazilian banks amber the
Brazilian banks is specifically

533
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:34,780
they have like incidents chains and
Mauer analysts all the banks in Brazil

534
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,050
or

535
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:38,740
it's mandatory for them to have reverse
engineers working

536
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:41,890
working in a bank and %uh there is like
a chamber

537
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:46,850
which is basically all the banks they
the crater like a chamber of banks

538
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:50,260
and up this chambers responsible for a
lot of regulations and a lot of other

539
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,300
considerations between the banks

540
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,740
and went up to the point of this
chambers actor to discuss security

541
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:59,910
incidents because as you well know like
prisoners are famous for writing

542
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:04,770
hours and robbing people a so we always
Robert people on the streets

543
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:08,590
of course we do that on the internet as
well amber

544
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:11,720
because a %uh this chamber of banks they
actually

545
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:15,600
assigned as all the samples that they
see that specifically target president

546
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,730
hours and it's interesting because then
the members change

547
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:21,900
so like 50 percent of the powers are
packard's

548
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:25,700
and if you look into the into the
Packers used by the Brazilian banks

549
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:29,160
they are you that related to the elf and
others

550
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:33,390
I if you want to know okay what are the
protection mechanism the Packers

551
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:38,150
soul refer to the paper amber actually
like as I mentioned before

552
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:41,310
like we really wrote a paper the papers
like 27

553
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:44,660
page it's like a two sided pages and a
small faults

554
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:48,670
which means it's a big paper okay and
the paper the mock wrap

555
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:52,330
the cold the cold is on gets crap so
it's a big piece of

556
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:56,660
research and for each of the Packers you
can see like with by the like the

557
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,010
pressures that we see

558
00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:01,870
and the protection mechanism that this
specific a Packers using

559
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:05,690
so you have that for each of the top
backers and as I mentioned before

560
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:09,210
it for me that for any other specific
packard sum it up a query

561
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:13,420
in our database we have that okay but
that's cool because

562
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:16,840
you can see that up the whole the
Packers a bold

563
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,010
and what they are including and you can
actually start likes

564
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:23,790
knowing that that some kinds of
protections are available in a packer

565
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:27,590
am that actually help us to other Sep to
better understand some statistics that

566
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:28,550
we see

567
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:32,150
the industry talking about of cause
usually they say okay

568
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:36,200
for example the majority of samples the
detective year

569
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:40,550
okay so looking for the Packers you know
that the majority of staples are back at

570
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:43,000
if the project for the Packers they have
like some kind of

571
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,650
and 2 p.m. mechanism that means of
course that much art of staples are

572
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:47,490
actually defected

573
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:50,940
your it's just something that you can
see when you have like

574
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:54,230
more detailed data good

575
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:57,630
so yes please read the paper ok

576
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:01,580
a there is much more information on the
paper damn I will give here

577
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:04,680
okay so please read the paper up then

578
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:08,590
with the suffocating what is the
prevalence of perfect that's a plus

579
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:12,480
so simple that thing quite one of booze
protections that we defect

580
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,090
so the numbers like 88.9 26 percent up
samples have

581
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:20,360
one kind of protection mechanism that's
pretty cool because I this a bit

582
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,750
helpless to reduce the problem right

583
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:26,410
so basically if you want to perform as
well as

584
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:30,770
Amy AV the industry and we all know that
they've is gold

585
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:34,370
actually catch a 92 percent of the power
to rats even more when

586
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:37,600
you considering the web's if you went to
catch

587
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,880
exactly the same level you just need to
have like fifty five different would

588
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,220
ease the texting 55 different and Terry
techniques

589
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:50,380
and you get okay of course I'm
simplifying the problem we all know that

590
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,390
there is a lot of

591
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:54,660
other talents that the fingers from its
replace

592
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,920
but there is no excuse to not have its

593
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:02,250
okay I you're gonna say okay but normal
software we will use the

594
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:07,520
protection picnics it's very rare II am
aware only of the sky

595
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,960
using this kind of perfect for making is
if there are any other

596
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:16,139
I backed its much easier to create a
white listing for normal software using

597
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:19,440
some kind of protection then too great a
black police

598
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,550
for all them hours and it's also

599
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:26,300
much easier to crack a wide release for
just the software that you use arts

600
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,020
protection make a move

601
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:31,159
then create a wide release for any good
software okay

602
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:35,210
so it's much reduce that problem so that
that's interesting

603
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:38,690
and again the members just go bad

604
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:43,399
for four-day AV industry if you include
the bookings that the pact a bid

605
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:47,520
evidence they are not included here if
we included at this

606
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:52,970
movies dismember 8 eight is going to go
to 926 927 percent of the samples

607
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:55,980
okay good so

608
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:59,079
then we split that the entire E in the
specific

609
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:02,920
I think categories and it's interesting
because a 21 percent

610
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,240
of the up the Marist use some kind of

611
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:11,000
ntv year so apparently the industry is
right

612
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,950
they are telling us that through like
you believe Rio machines to analyze my

613
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:15,910
hours right

614
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:20,839
you don't need to random via that's why
the great them they try to sell you know

615
00:35:20,839 --> 00:35:25,190
there's a specific send boxes for
analysis because they're very

616
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:30,040
advance that actually not totally true
ninety-nine percent of his interview him

617
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:34,300
techniques basically the tech 2 p.m. are
using the instructions

618
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:38,410
so if you're go away from VMware use
something else

619
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:42,150
you get against this nineteen ninety
percent of the fact

620
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:45,660
also if you look batter you gonna see
that the use

621
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:51,859
Sott us to you are all things that are
very easy for you to avoid

622
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:56,579
very easy solve this MTV and techniques
all told there are much more advanced

623
00:35:56,579 --> 00:35:57,329
said

624
00:35:57,329 --> 00:36:01,119
they don't even showing the members

625
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,880
so there are yes the to exist but

626
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:09,550
nobody's using their it's much easier to
just the fact the instruction to the

627
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:13,970
to use SLD not even they are SIII GT
which I thought it was going to be one

628
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:15,440
of the biggest firms

629
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:21,210
its it's not even considerable in the
statistics 0.06

630
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:26,079
okay so that's cool because that means
it's not that hard to create a VM

631
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:31,250
that is bullet proof against the huge
majority of them our samples

632
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:35,829
nice if you're looking to enter this
assembly you have like two main

633
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:40,130
I had to do the same with economic
status fake term user sets a current

634
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:41,069
leader Carey

635
00:36:41,069 --> 00:36:44,400
am fake picture using X or so

636
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,440
it's interesting because it's not really
just because their arse

637
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,780
a lot of techniques and they are complex
and a lot of powers are interesting

638
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:56,540
again it some steak that we are
researchers usually make

639
00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:00,460
we went to talk about the interesting
stuff right but the interesting stuff

640
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:05,460
it's not missile really prevalence and
that this clearly shows the case

641
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:09,170
right it's the both the prevalent and
the disassembly picnics

642
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:13,980
are very simple very sick if you're
looking for then to the bugging

643
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:17,030
you gonna see that Microsoft is our
biggest enemy

644
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:21,680
in that field right because basically
the huge majority of samples employing

645
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,849
its the bugging

646
00:37:22,849 --> 00:37:26,450
the use the Microsoft API to actually
think by the resort about the

647
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:27,700
president's

648
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,829
its quite school right it's like okay
for

649
00:37:30,829 --> 00:37:34,550
for her a few really wade through
actually

650
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:38,180
do something well just removed that API
amber

651
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:42,829
they're like with that as a option if
you went to develop a machine separate

652
00:37:42,829 --> 00:37:46,569
so up when you break down the config

653
00:37:46,569 --> 00:37:50,300
the cup terrorist you start seeing that
something like the problem is not

654
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:55,950
us hard as everybody's painting and if
we start affecting the Technics itself

655
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:59,690
and well there's more picnics to be the
fact that I will show some of them that

656
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:01,460
we with attack from some that with

657
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:04,500
we still don't the tax was too early to
write the tax important

658
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,940
but if you start the tactic boost
techniques if thats

659
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:12,450
again the main masses of this stock if
we start defecting

660
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:15,520
the protection mechanism that the powers
use that some

661
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,770
much simpler problem them to say if the
cold is my Michels

662
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:24,500
are not its to Facebook old employer
specific technique that's much cheaper

663
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,800
to do

664
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:30,800
event we're going to force them overall
first to not perfect

665
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,119
and then instead of wasting a lot of
analysts researchers

666
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:37,660
actually looking to sable that are
protected because they are

667
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:41,380
out nowadays the problems you can
clearly see right

668
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:44,579
you want to use this analyst find
direction looking for more interesting

669
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:47,869
stuff and you will be able to roll to
meet with more fangs

670
00:38:47,869 --> 00:38:50,950
to all the research that we see your for
example

671
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:55,579
like us the finals research they needed
them back at Staples to actually do some

672
00:38:55,579 --> 00:38:56,829
good analysis

673
00:38:56,829 --> 00:39:00,210
right to categorize and up that's true

674
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:04,410
so let's force the power alters should
not use those that connects anymore

675
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:07,710
because if they use its easier for us to
the fact that

676
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:10,950
I don't know why we are not the packing
right now

677
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:14,220
actually so obfuscation

678
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:17,220
the same like yo up usually a the

679
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:21,130
special technique the most prevalent
special picnics are really simple

680
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:24,270
so instead of calling big big to a
person a rat's

681
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:28,339
a push up pop in a mathematical
operation true actually force a specific

682
00:39:28,339 --> 00:39:29,069
back

683
00:39:29,069 --> 00:39:33,040
mob sequences extra make it more
difficult to analyze

684
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,069
very simple were obfuscation pic makes
they are

685
00:39:36,069 --> 00:39:40,440
like the balls prevalent once and I
think the thing because

686
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:44,420
that actually help us to do some other
research because now we can build other

687
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,069
research

688
00:39:45,069 --> 00:39:48,910
just called I got a paper table there
will be no function called

689
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:53,509
station other than the very simple words
so if we went to look for a function

690
00:39:53,509 --> 00:39:55,259
call we can just look into that

691
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:59,059
we don't need actually to carry the
morning to try to create a very weird

692
00:39:59,059 --> 00:40:02,690
3x very specific dynamic analysis for
that

693
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:06,579
because most of them are going to use it
any for my worst part using it we gonna

694
00:40:06,579 --> 00:40:07,569
know it

695
00:40:07,569 --> 00:40:11,109
and then we're going to detect because
it uses the protection so it makes life

696
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:11,529
much

697
00:40:11,529 --> 00:40:14,670
user so

698
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:18,460
for this research we actually stood over
the crib that 33

699
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:22,680
it's the bug interconnects for week
currently is coming staples for thirty

700
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,680
one of them

701
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,740
so girls are the picnic that was that it
amber

702
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:29,749
up important for each of the techniques

703
00:40:29,749 --> 00:40:34,269
I'll we wrote in the paper a section
specifically explaining the picnic

704
00:40:34,269 --> 00:40:37,490
I'm in this section you gonna fight to
get her bleak which

705
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:41,230
implements the picnic as I make sure I

706
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:45,059
a lot of the materials on the web we're
not really completes

707
00:40:45,059 --> 00:40:49,440
they said they like small mistakes and
they usually don't have like a really

708
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,359
real example that you can actually try
and see how things work

709
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:56,690
so we implemented each of these
malicious technique as well

710
00:40:56,690 --> 00:41:00,319
but we we implemented a texan but we
also important for the militias

711
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:05,049
and the in a in a presentation you gonna
find the section of the paper for each

712
00:41:05,049 --> 00:41:06,039
of the pic makes

713
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:10,410
and in the paper gonna find that the the
gets her link for the specific program

714
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:11,859
that implements the picnic

715
00:41:11,859 --> 00:41:15,160
we implement the Ming see in the same
way so some

716
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:19,579
at the techniques that use like higher
level wheels API's we implementing see

717
00:41:19,579 --> 00:41:22,950
the picnic that use the same plea does
after we implemented

718
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:27,319
in a sec so those are the into the
bucket that connects

719
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:31,380
that the with attacked as you can see
there are some that we don't some that

720
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:34,890
with effect events but we got complete
with the fact that that's why

721
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:38,880
in the statistics a you'll see some of
them but some others who don't see

722
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,200
because as i say

723
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:44,249
if we detect events with don't show that
on the statistics

724
00:41:44,249 --> 00:41:47,319
but if you really have in person by
specific picnic

725
00:41:47,319 --> 00:41:51,490
it's just a matter of talking to me I do
a query I can get you the numbers

726
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:55,789
very easily for dared to do the same way
we started the mind that connects and

727
00:41:55,789 --> 00:41:56,900
the variations

728
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,900
they are not to read a wide range of
techniques available

729
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:03,160
they are very very limited so we
implemented

730
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:08,029
eight of those by and the those are the
techniques that we implemented

731
00:42:08,029 --> 00:42:11,170
and that those are the sections of the
paper and the same applies here the

732
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:12,950
paper explains the picnic

733
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:16,109
the paper has a review is to get clubbed
with you where you can get the

734
00:42:16,109 --> 00:42:16,910
Coldstream

735
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:20,670
that specific technique the same purpose
cation

736
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:24,109
obfuscation is the one that we lack a
more of the implementation in the

737
00:42:24,109 --> 00:42:25,009
picture

738
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:28,289
just because I we we sold it made for
the prosecution

739
00:42:28,289 --> 00:42:31,859
later and that's also worries about our
nation to you

740
00:42:31,859 --> 00:42:35,150
the members are just going to be even
worse for day for

741
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:38,599
for a TV so I set up 88 percent it's
going to go to my

742
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:44,519
seven or something even higher of tumour
samples using some kind of protection

743
00:42:44,519 --> 00:42:48,039
and the those are like the techniques
that we look for

744
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:51,940
bill station the same here section of
the paper pointing

745
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:55,019
to the kids club and a and 2 p.m.

746
00:42:55,019 --> 00:42:58,049
the connects with we stood at like seven
different techniques

747
00:42:58,049 --> 00:43:01,089
but we currently scanning for six of
them amber

748
00:43:01,089 --> 00:43:04,690
those are the techniques that we
specifically looking for

749
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:08,430
as you can see we didn't care about like
a ratchet three names for

750
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:12,279
and 2 p.m. picnics because looking for a
rest his strained are looking for buyer

751
00:43:12,279 --> 00:43:12,839
is

752
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:16,359
are very specific to web specific by
Amber

753
00:43:16,359 --> 00:43:19,430
and we don't believe it's use it for
anyway because even

754
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,650
in defense guides to hold true great
your VM

755
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:26,920
they teach you how to mod creative %um
that can be detected

756
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,769
so what is interesting is we do
understand the powers are changing

757
00:43:30,769 --> 00:43:33,769
that rats once keeps changing really
fast so

758
00:43:33,769 --> 00:43:37,460
just before our presentation and black
cat jury a.m.

759
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:42,140
gave a presentation back in the box and
I'm so done so it wasn't 17 to 20 make

760
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:47,769
the position but that was in June and
Erica release a eyesight system

761
00:43:47,769 --> 00:43:50,890
which is basically a true that gets like
I'm x8

762
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:54,329
a X 86 binary and will try to transform

763
00:43:54,329 --> 00:43:58,569
as binary it or the equivalent binary
using assessing searchers

764
00:43:58,569 --> 00:44:03,390
so this is a very interesting way to a
brief skate a binary and 12 Boyd

765
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:06,920
about the defection by STATS second
risers rights

766
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:10,460
so a he released on May in June we were

767
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:13,940
shared all the information which was
great without sharing

768
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:17,619
it's not possible to actually fall right
so he's serving for

769
00:44:17,619 --> 00:44:22,079
shared all the information shared about
the codes with that the figures for the

770
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:22,670
SS

771
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:27,599
a Saxxy so we were able to create
actually Sables using best sexy

772
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:31,210
and were able to actually greater the
pack some for the usage of SSE

773
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,529
instructions actually

774
00:44:32,529 --> 00:44:36,039
replacing x86 instruction and we look at
our database

775
00:44:36,039 --> 00:44:39,059
to tell that's it's really a new pic
make them hours or

776
00:44:39,059 --> 00:44:43,529
where not implementing it maybe they
will now that he really said

777
00:44:43,529 --> 00:44:46,980
and that we already have wave artifacts
Inc a

778
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:51,650
the other one that we went into Lucas
the flame because claim it was big meals

779
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:54,230
them if they were giving up our talking
to talk about

780
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:57,589
play right a so basically

781
00:44:57,589 --> 00:45:01,890
up the Indus a POS assayed it's
completely meal with uses woohoo

782
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:03,259
embedded scripting

783
00:45:03,259 --> 00:45:07,730
so we decided okay why not writing up
looking to the title who I am by the

784
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:08,099
bank

785
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:11,759
in my our code and then we can actually
find a lot of variance of

786
00:45:11,759 --> 00:45:15,450
way and we did it flame is indeed the
only power

787
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:18,589
that we saw in our formula samples that

788
00:45:18,589 --> 00:45:23,099
uses newer and the indeed there we've
managed to actually get the different

789
00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:24,289
components of lame

790
00:45:24,289 --> 00:45:28,319
in that way am all September 18

791
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:31,420
floral you posted are the semantic blog

792
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:35,049
that the Fonda I'm I specific from our
using Google's go

793
00:45:35,049 --> 00:45:39,299
and they said it was Neil so we decided
to actually write a PLO game

794
00:45:39,299 --> 00:45:43,369
and save its was really be ok and i cant
that's interesting because we can affect

795
00:45:43,369 --> 00:45:45,390
your samples using the language

796
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:48,450
and we can also detect a variance right
now because there's

797
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:52,660
no other samples using it so that's the
advantage of having art better that it

798
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:55,339
is very easy to plug into replicas
whatever

799
00:45:55,339 --> 00:46:01,749
research went to represents a still
talking about new techniques on July 25

800
00:46:01,749 --> 00:46:07,210
a more good marks and be all there is
the paper on the pink t-shirt spike it

801
00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:10,359
and a it's interesting because the pink
t-shirts pop not

802
00:46:10,359 --> 00:46:15,059
right it's like spike it it's like a
mute or gray a very impressive

803
00:46:15,059 --> 00:46:18,359
I'll bet words that everybody talks
about

804
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:21,890
sold the wrote a paper about the the
their think Fisher

805
00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:25,359
and they've shared about the the the
buyer if

806
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:28,359
us and I was able like to look into the
techniques that

807
00:46:28,359 --> 00:46:31,549
the the the use add up actually

808
00:46:31,549 --> 00:46:35,749
from 25 picnics that up in Fisher use
for avoiding the picture

809
00:46:35,749 --> 00:46:38,940
four of them we are at catch

810
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:42,099
okay what if there is a specific to all
the BG

811
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:45,789
and the for all others that are more
generic we catch

812
00:46:45,789 --> 00:46:49,319
so that means if you crap I'm
anti-virals

813
00:46:49,319 --> 00:46:53,049
that actually the fact lower trying to
avoid the faction

814
00:46:53,049 --> 00:46:56,450
are called avoiding the picture you
could get it is very

815
00:46:56,450 --> 00:47:02,089
advance the military-grade whatever name
mean people gives to that okay

816
00:47:02,089 --> 00:47:07,150
so this roles that it's very interesting
to actually go for this approach

817
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:10,769
because then you make the life of the
writer March if quotes

818
00:47:10,769 --> 00:47:13,829
and the life of us analyzing the powers
or

819
00:47:13,829 --> 00:47:17,109
easy are about you know I'm a Brazilian
I like to have a

820
00:47:17,109 --> 00:47:20,369
easy like ok so

821
00:47:20,369 --> 00:47:23,499
from resources I'm gets her I'll

822
00:47:23,499 --> 00:47:26,950
up we do have all the Colt Ford
Powerstroke

823
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:30,509
for the for the techniques that we
implemented for the powers all research

824
00:47:30,509 --> 00:47:31,430
not dissect

825
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:35,529
not be you have a %uh the updated
version of the paper

826
00:47:35,529 --> 00:47:38,579
the presentation also the hike in the
box a

827
00:47:38,579 --> 00:47:41,549
website you can got like the latest
version of the paper and the

828
00:47:41,549 --> 00:47:42,539
presentation

829
00:47:42,539 --> 00:47:46,730
I we gotta keep updating it so the
papers as a freshman member we gonna

830
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:48,739
keep updating the first remember

831
00:47:48,739 --> 00:47:54,130
the Cat Club is going to be strong like
%uh 2012 but was to updating it when we

832
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:58,079
we a great time you get action we also a
great day

833
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:02,079
lamentation for the picnic itself so we
gonna keep updating also

834
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:06,599
the guitar okay so go ahead download the
researchers

835
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:10,150
drop me a e-mail struck me ideas I
without sharing

836
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:15,489
it's not going to be possible actually
to to evolve and a I'm sold thanks

837
00:48:15,489 --> 00:48:19,079
the portal for dissect is not about what
I said I got be

838
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:22,819
the portal has opened case also need to
drop me an email in order to get an

839
00:48:22,819 --> 00:48:23,869
account

840
00:48:23,869 --> 00:48:27,549
and I will happily share I access for
you guys

841
00:48:27,549 --> 00:48:31,849
so you can see all the statistics from
the paper action it's a huge page with

842
00:48:31,849 --> 00:48:32,450
of

843
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:36,509
rappers a for the statistics

844
00:48:36,509 --> 00:48:41,259
amber just to conclude so people can
actually send questions on my way

845
00:48:41,259 --> 00:48:46,910
I forges research we analyze millions of
dollars okay so for millions of Mahler's

846
00:48:46,910 --> 00:48:50,329
and therefore then we try to the fact
that the

847
00:48:50,329 --> 00:48:54,859
protection mechanism our employees to
avoid being the fact

848
00:48:54,859 --> 00:48:58,630
I have these arguments thats if you try
to avoid the faction

849
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:03,640
you make the defection easier the same
in my opinion applies for its forensics

850
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:06,809
as well as those who try to avoid to be
spot that

851
00:49:06,809 --> 00:49:09,989
as more likely you are not going to be
spot because that's up

852
00:49:09,989 --> 00:49:13,519
a problem marriage if coaches so if prop

853
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:17,829
a given problem is my diesels are not a
somewhat them hours

854
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:21,920
the prevalence and the huge ones are
from our big tried to avoid them at this

855
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,029
is the crap into the same Lee

856
00:49:24,029 --> 00:49:28,430
they haven't the Burgundy have interview
I'm they making actually the defection

857
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:31,839
easier so we may just are defecting that

858
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:35,569
so we gonna force the altar structurally
fallback

859
00:49:35,569 --> 00:49:39,989
through Europe our am that's going to be
much more difficult for them to release

860
00:49:39,989 --> 00:49:41,650
new versions like

861
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:44,720
a new variations because there will be
no

862
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:49,019
backing anymore helping them there'll be
no I'm to protection mechanism they can

863
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:51,230
just change instructions and things like
that

864
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:55,220
track to protect them so we gonna make
their lives more difficult

865
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:59,079
and then we've got to have an advantage
maybe it ought to be there are going to

866
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,499
outsmart us again

867
00:50:00,499 --> 00:50:05,529
but probably not okay so I really hope
to a people look into that

868
00:50:05,529 --> 00:50:09,230
and put a little bit of if arts and also
see the problems

869
00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:12,890
cause I'm sure there are many problems
on on this as well

870
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:17,009
as well so that's what I have to show

871
00:50:17,009 --> 00:50:20,380
I'm open for questions this is my email

872
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:25,099
a this is my weaver or whatever and fell
free also to ask question here because

873
00:50:25,099 --> 00:50:26,460
you want to learn

874
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:30,289
because Shah Sarah remember its kills
your brain cells

875
00:50:30,289 --> 00:50:33,980
that's cool it's good its alcohol

876
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:38,059
and I you can also make a I bring us
with that okay just live mid-level so

877
00:50:38,059 --> 00:50:43,730
very much

878
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:47,579
no questions o.o

879
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:50,890
I am really clear my Brazilian English
with

880
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:54,499
for sexy are on guys

881
00:50:54,499 --> 00:50:58,289
should the questions don't be shy

882
00:50:58,289 --> 00:51:02,950
I really to break the bricks

883
00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:06,769
or here we have a question me

884
00:51:06,769 --> 00:51:10,190
a the only reason he he'd in specific
reason

885
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:13,829
you know and don't know no he didn't
specifically those even more because

886
00:51:13,829 --> 00:51:17,269
there is no he them commercial because
you're a lover of

887
00:51:17,269 --> 00:51:20,279
record because you put it in a section
on mile the slim

888
00:51:20,279 --> 00:51:24,230
sir yet what up the plane was just wanna
live because it's free

889
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:27,690
also I wanted to show something about
like a this is like

890
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:31,950
top notch up very very late past 3 PTR
whatever

891
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:35,890
whether collette so that's why I
included that mutation was just because

892
00:51:35,890 --> 00:51:38,819
to transfer all the Marseille between
all the machines

893
00:51:38,819 --> 00:51:43,950
I'll like with Heather like not really a
lot of time to do all the research

894
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:47,380
and I wanted to show a big amount up
samples safe

895
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:50,880
the huge whether that are bigger than
4.3 point by Max

896
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,180
anywhere the president wants I we just
look at that

897
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:57,710
to get the president statistics and not
actually to get the overall

898
00:51:57,710 --> 00:52:01,039
statistics all that that was the only
reason performance top

899
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:04,900
but yet

900
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:08,230
but more important question is how did
we selected this

901
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:11,309
formula fable since I said we have 13

902
00:52:11,309 --> 00:52:14,829
it was like really random

903
00:52:14,829 --> 00:52:18,230
okay in one question Rodrigo here

904
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:21,869
after in its are you allowed to ask
questions

905
00:52:21,869 --> 00:52:25,519
I yeah axiom that's a very open
conference thing I

906
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:29,509
as she approved so aka

907
00:52:29,509 --> 00:52:33,190
um those who is a Christian is II in
touch with some people

908
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:37,160
doing open source anti-virus to
integrate actuaries into picking

909
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:38,890
techniques into CITIC

910
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:42,799
detection ups well if I am in total

911
00:52:42,799 --> 00:52:46,700
with anybody developing open source
anti-virus trucks with a great that

912
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:50,059
out well asserts fun actually a is the

913
00:52:50,059 --> 00:52:54,289
responsible for club copy which is a
problem sir sir i'm too borrows

914
00:52:54,289 --> 00:52:57,769
and the they are a partner so these have
access to the research actually

915
00:52:57,769 --> 00:52:58,960
everybody has access

916
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,200
research things its public even more now
right

917
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:05,349
so I'm up in part questioning anything

918
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:08,529
even more because other way no right to
vote

919
00:53:08,529 --> 00:53:12,509
whatever are the priorities they have
for the project but the I guess

920
00:53:12,509 --> 00:53:16,960
I should maybe write a patch for them
right because it's open source

921
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:22,019
I cannot blame the open source file the
complaint that was its urs

922
00:53:22,019 --> 00:53:25,579
thank you for the very interesting
presentation I have a question um

923
00:53:25,579 --> 00:53:29,989
dq I'm more interested in the let seitz
state-wise

924
00:53:29,989 --> 00:53:35,009
malware so have you checked what would
be the results on flame and on Finn

925
00:53:35,009 --> 00:53:36,509
finishers stuff like that

926
00:53:36,509 --> 00:53:39,880
you would detect D's Melgar

927
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:43,130
so for that for the let me know I don't
I

928
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:46,269
forgot to put it here but like for the
fictitious

929
00:53:46,269 --> 00:53:49,970
here so pinkish implements like five
speculates

930
00:53:49,970 --> 00:53:54,739
yes I did but how is this message did
you we clear on your tool and see if it

931
00:53:54,739 --> 00:53:57,940
is detected if it's picked up for a bit
okay

932
00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:01,880
it's just know if you just looked OK
teases what's what is documented and

933
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:06,029
yeah we would like to go top step to a
like what up then we don't know but

934
00:54:06,029 --> 00:54:07,999
because we do you about this picnic

935
00:54:07,999 --> 00:54:11,519
it was like it's your way or whatever
maybe it's the member the

936
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:15,259
weird for what they say that's very
difficult to get all the picnic so if

937
00:54:15,259 --> 00:54:17,109
you have some the previously

938
00:54:17,109 --> 00:54:20,509
sign my way and out for of for all
others

939
00:54:20,509 --> 00:54:24,920
completely the meant the we already have
the factions and we found it

940
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:29,940
if this year so it was possible to
detect sure just using

941
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:33,150
thank you

942
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:37,079
we have a question that song there's
more question what I want them cuz shots

943
00:54:37,079 --> 00:54:37,479
left

944
00:54:37,479 --> 00:54:42,460
sorry because we bring some process on
the debate so early in the morning

945
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:45,470
I mention that's you limits to one

946
00:54:45,470 --> 00:54:48,739
excusable section of something like this
so if the mall

947
00:54:48,739 --> 00:54:52,140
was to the and

948
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:55,700
looking stuff in 06 you you would detect
its

949
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:59,509
up okay so the question is a if I am
limited info

950
00:54:59,509 --> 00:55:03,309
to only well executable section know I
am limited to

951
00:55:03,309 --> 00:55:07,470
sexual market the six as a cute bow and
that the entry point

952
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:10,529
so yes if the mall where you stand the
buggy

953
00:55:10,529 --> 00:55:15,190
and then the Burg is a section that is
market doesn't know is a cute couple

954
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:18,609
it does your honor there is no TP writer
anyway

955
00:55:18,609 --> 00:55:22,059
butts I'm not going to the fact because
I'm not going to analyze

956
00:55:22,059 --> 00:55:25,539
right now yes that's true Ford is a
statistic that through

957
00:55:25,539 --> 00:55:28,970
but that's a limitation that it's just
that the seizure for

958
00:55:28,970 --> 00:55:33,190
or the past and as I say that's one of
the things that you also grow

959
00:55:33,190 --> 00:55:37,279
the member of the factions a startup
making it more beer for today be

960
00:55:37,279 --> 00:55:38,539
Baylor's it's going to be even

961
00:55:38,539 --> 00:55:41,869
uglier

962
00:55:41,869 --> 00:55:44,930
by the way it's it's pretty easy to
avoid this limitation

963
00:55:44,930 --> 00:55:48,799
okay just look at the data point and as
a goodwill section and seat the research

964
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:49,849
other sections

965
00:55:49,849 --> 00:55:52,979
and then you do the same with other
sections that's not supposed to give a

966
00:55:52,979 --> 00:55:54,390
lot of false positives

967
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:58,150
but I had no time of in for the
presentation to actually clone it and I

968
00:55:58,150 --> 00:55:59,009
was afraid

969
00:55:59,009 --> 00:56:02,479
of started getting a lot of false
positives any the two redo everything

970
00:56:02,479 --> 00:56:03,619
again so

971
00:56:03,619 --> 00:56:09,410
that's why the limitation

972
00:56:09,410 --> 00:56:12,559
more questions saw let's give him

973
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:19,559
around the closest rights is a

974
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:27,820
ok

975
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:29,640
this

976
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:36,640
sleep
