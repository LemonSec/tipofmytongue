1
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:10,600
up

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,980
space

3
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,930
school

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,730
sky

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:22,730
Smith

6
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:27,470
few years ago started doing some
checking into are

7
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,800
conferences and we put together we we
did a whole bunch of digging

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,870
and one of the things we found is that
isn't InfoSec conference going on for

9
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,480
almost every day of the year

10
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,480
ok in the numbers are just going up um

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,530
it it starts to look a little ridiculous
when you when you look at it

12
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,780
because if you compare the number of
talks that were happening in the early

13
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,559
2000's to the number of talks that are
happening now

14
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:53,350
we clearly spending a lot more time
talking about security

15
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:57,280
and the question is with all pasta is
actually getting better so on the one

16
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:57,969
hand

17
00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:02,370
I was speaking criticism saying this too
many conferences on the other hand

18
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,950
I'm one of the guys organizing a
conference in South Africa called they

19
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:06,550
take on

20
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:11,050
okay so the natural question is well are
you for conferences

21
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,789
all you against them and the answer is
yes

22
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:18,250
okay um and what they mean by that is
I'll

23
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:22,619
I'm for research and i'm for up doing
research at a ground roots level

24
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:26,849
and so the big question becomes will
what's good research

25
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:30,410
okay and its it's not an easy question
on sup

26
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:33,450
so if we take a look at %uh stuff we've
done %uh

27
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,910
in the past few years really quickly um

28
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:40,369
week I gave a talk at forty four corn
last year which is up

29
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:43,569
nice InfoSec conference in in London %uh

30
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:46,849
basically titled penetration testing
considered harmful

31
00:01:46,849 --> 00:01:49,940
and partly because I've been up into
still for

32
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:53,360
just about the last decade by caused
about of 20

33
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,360
security guys on the internet the call
me a complete dumbass

34
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,390
and at least are some of the other half
to say there's some stuff in there that

35
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,039
make sense

36
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:05,569
um and then we put out a plugin that
allows you to do GPG encryption in

37
00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:06,179
Chrome

38
00:02:06,179 --> 00:02:11,870
and arm in 2011 for the first time I
skipped I'm going to a black cat

39
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:15,150
on I haven't missed a black cat biggest
in years but sitting at home

40
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:18,739
it may be one though when people treat
about black cat

41
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:21,970
with the tweeting of the talks or
whether they treating more about the

42
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:22,590
party's

43
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:26,680
and instinctively at the people the
party's so we collected the whole bunch

44
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,319
of tweets and then some analysis

45
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,359
and it turns out I was wrong actually
people do talk more about the talks on

46
00:02:32,359 --> 00:02:33,980
Twitter than they do about parties

47
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,040
but at least now we have empirically
have evidence for that

48
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,200
um and then a little while after that

49
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,219
um we put out a tool we don't be such a
tool that basically allows you to

50
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:45,140
shoulder self

51
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,560
automatically so basically using I'll

52
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,670
using some of them up cool I boobies
using OCB

53
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:56,659
computer vision libraries we can look at
an iPad a look at the tablet and see

54
00:02:56,659 --> 00:02:58,200
which keys are being pressed

55
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,349
up because of the fact that the keyboard
lights and basically you put together an

56
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:03,849
app that automatically show

57
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:08,230
itself um out any mention to the
conference collector ap

58
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,519
whale not so humble aim is to categorize

59
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,120
list go into detail on every security
conference

60
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,290
since forever um

61
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:22,040
early before that we put out an app on
the App Store that basically takes a

62
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,819
photo view every time your screen savers
disabled

63
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:27,900
in part I was just playing to see how
the App Store wat

64
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,599
in truth what it meant is there's a
whole bunch of pictures of random people

65
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,689
on the internet that probably shouldn't
be there

66
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:37,430
um and in 2010

67
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:41,150
um what I wanted to do was see if we
were getting better with memory

68
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,439
corruption bugs or not

69
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:46,510
and what did had us do is go through arm
all of the law

70
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:50,719
bugs in that ok currently saved in
always will be

71
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:54,430
literally every one of the like eighty
thousand bucks and see if we can get

72
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,950
better classifications on them

73
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:59,409
and okay so sold I've stated

74
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:03,329
so he started stalking the centerpieces
the first thing you have to do is

75
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:04,069
categorized

76
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:07,579
what you mean by Katie such and he says
he's not talking about

77
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:11,989
ordinary run of movie such what he's
talking about his Nobel Prize what

78
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:15,569
and he says it may not be nobel prize
walk in your field buddy

79
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:19,019
he says you can't tell what's
significant work and and what isn't

80
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:22,900
any he says well how did he come to do
the study

81
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,940
ok can you talk about one of the most
%uh in the end recognize mathematicians

82
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,720
in its field

83
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,930
and he says well he worked on the
Manhattan Project

84
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:34,600
he was one of those guys putting
together the bomb n

85
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,660
any says while he was doing the
Manhattan Project he came to the Allies

86
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,830
that he was just a stooge okay because

87
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:45,260
he was working on the computers for
feynman then for me

88
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,440
oppenheimer he says he looked around and

89
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,540
he was envious okay because he saw that
these were great minds and they were

90
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,330
doing great stuff

91
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,690
and he became interested in what
differentiates those guys

92
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:01,010
from other guys and in fact what
differentiates those guys

93
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:05,090
from him and you see in part why i think
is talk is so awesome

94
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:09,680
because two paragraphs in we've already
got coolness

95
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,930
anyone know what that means I don't
either I can't even read

96
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:18,280
um essentially it's the unexamined life
is not worth living

97
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,030
okay and and what you looking at you is
him saying inspecting and saying well

98
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,070
what differentiates

99
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:26,810
those guys up from him and

100
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:30,690
if you look at it InfoSec we've got just
as many chances

101
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:34,340
to look around and be envious okay for
almost

102
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:38,250
every walk of life that you could come
from this someone

103
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:42,210
under similar conditions that has stood
up and done of some stuff

104
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:45,940
um you still a student how could you
ever be as late as

105
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:49,450
Jeremiah helpful was doing lead stuff as
a student

106
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:53,290
you sitting in some I'll Helen gone part
of the world

107
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,500
you find guys like so many who've done
I'll awesome issued

108
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,380
find guys doing awesomeness from poland
you unemployed

109
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:04,140
Moxie did lots of his awesome stuff when
he was unemployed

110
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:07,820
it couldn't have been lucky that he kept
doing these great things

111
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:11,000
okay and he goes on to say you see it
again and again

112
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,400
if someone's great they keep doing great
things

113
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,100
okay and you'll notice the same in the
InfoSec field if you take someone

114
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,910
are like dino days Ovi you'll notice
that across the years

115
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:25,610
he's touched lots of different areas um

116
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:30,590
always 10 shellcode wifi almost
everywhere he scratches he finds

117
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,390
coolness

118
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:35,070
and you see it from guys like HD Moore
you see from a bunch of people

119
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:38,240
'em you see it from guys like Dan
Kaminsky

120
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,220
was repeatedly I'll put out something
interesting and if you look back

121
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,730
you'll find more and more things in his
past where he is done interesting stuff

122
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:49,790
so on for those of you who've never used
SSH

123
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:55,060
and used the proxy mode like if you
wanna hotel wifi for example

124
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,340
dams the guy who actually committed that
code to ssh

125
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,520
okay and so again you see I'll more and
more

126
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,070
more and more the guys keep doing I'll
good things

127
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:08,750
and so it kind of comes back to pastures
fortune favors

128
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,200
up the prepared minds think and what
happens is

129
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,070
is that the prepared mind sooner or
later finds the coolness

130
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:20,450
does it okay so with his luck its luck

131
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:24,720
exactly which thing you find coolness
what but that you find the coolness

132
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,030
%uh isn't luck and so instead of talking
about

133
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,300
what isn't the key characteristic the
question becomes

134
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,960
well what is the key characteristic and
what he says

135
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,370
is I'll independent both and the courage
to pursue them

136
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:43,060
okay he he goes into this question and
of course the logical question at this

137
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,320
point is

138
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,430
what about having a lot of planes okay
um

139
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:51,710
show you need a lot of planes and he
says look

140
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:55,330
everyone in this room and I guess the
same goes for Hugo

141
00:07:55,330 --> 00:08:00,410
has a lot of plates um thats necessary
but not sufficient

142
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:04,640
okay it's got to be more than that and
he cites two examples of guys who he

143
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,690
worked with

144
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:08,720
who looked kind of ordinary and none of
the mall

145
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,900
until they got their first breakthroughs
okay

146
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,850
and once they got those first big blue's
the kind of got the courage to go out

147
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:18,180
into more cool stuff

148
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,030
okay and all he talks about it and says
once you get your courage up

149
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:26,060
and believe that you can do great things
you generally go out and do these great

150
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,050
things

151
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:30,470
and InfoSec you kind of see the same
thing happening

152
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:35,320
so if you haven't gone and a red any of
the stuff put out by the call in team

153
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,469
okay what you'll notice is at some point
the column guys

154
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:41,969
actually took so Mills I'll exploitation
class

155
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:45,300
well that's what it looks like so at
some point they were little uniting a

156
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,160
beginner's

157
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,579
here's how you do a stackoverflow on
some all but three Winamp

158
00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:53,680
%uh type program okay and from there

159
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,730
the guys just went on I'll so from that
initial tutorial they started putting

160
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,689
out more and more goodness

161
00:08:59,689 --> 00:09:03,519
and today it's very nice plugins for
debuggers to help you

162
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,889
I'll do you exploitation nicely

163
00:09:06,889 --> 00:09:10,060
um in a similar note if you've ever
looked at

164
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:13,879
stuff put out by johnnie long 'em John
long popped up

165
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:17,589
like at DEFCON in 2004 and he did

166
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:21,560
when it was like initially most of the
guys looked at it and kind of went

167
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,930
man you did this talk on Google hacking
like finding stuff with Google

168
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:29,610
and a whole bunch of people went like
that's a nice like you know how to use

169
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,370
Google

170
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:33,459
but what that little bit of confidence
%uh John went on

171
00:09:33,459 --> 00:09:37,709
to do more and more interesting stuff um
and a macho home you view follow it but

172
00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:39,019
today john is living

173
00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:42,529
in Uganda where he I'll runs hes
commissions

174
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:47,259
and his basically doing like view
tangible good in the world

175
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:51,199
and I love this started with him are
getting his confidence up

176
00:09:51,199 --> 00:09:55,600
okay um so he got his confidence up and
the rest of the world was probably

177
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,110
better for it

178
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:02,029
and then you bump into I'll agree
Christian for most of us were starting

179
00:10:02,029 --> 00:10:03,399
to get a little

180
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:06,910
which is I'll how important is age

181
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:11,050
okay and up he mentions because it's
quite a common misconception he says

182
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:11,870
will

183
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:16,360
I'm stranded lots of the things I'll
when he was disgustingly yup

184
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,999
ok and is a kind of a misconception that
is if you haven't done your great work

185
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:24,370
up by a certain age you never gonna do
it and you'll see in InfoSec

186
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:27,649
we kind of have the same thing so at
back at Vegas

187
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:31,600
they give the pony awards and for the
Lifetime Achievement Award

188
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,870
a you see that I think it was Dave I
tell who said that

189
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:39,509
like models hackers with a lot of black
they think the more famous than they are

190
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:43,149
and it could be years effectively and at
age 30

191
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:46,930
okay um and so the question is whether
this is true

192
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:50,019
whether you have to be young to do cool
stuff

193
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:53,589
okay but I'll again having comes back
and says look in

194
00:10:53,589 --> 00:10:58,089
in some fields it seems that you
actually get better as you get older

195
00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:01,949
and so for InfoSec we don't have a
definitive I'm so

196
00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:04,980
except you can't look at the time line

197
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,749
all a line of people who actually doing
cool stuff

198
00:11:08,749 --> 00:11:13,059
and on one and a bit you have %uh Joe
Hart who at 19

199
00:11:13,059 --> 00:11:17,259
was about taking dawn Playstations up
custom encryption

200
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:22,120
or custom up protected up messing with
the iPhone bootloader

201
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,360
and way at the top you had robert modest
was told rocking at seventy-eight

202
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,519
and for almost every age in between you
have people doing coolness

203
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:34,170
so it's probably pretty clear to see
that age doesn't

204
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:37,550
become a limiting factor um but what

205
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:40,860
is a look interesting limiting factor is
that when you were young

206
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:45,889
you seldom clouded by success okay and
having goes on to talk about this way he

207
00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:46,620
says

208
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,550
that success seems to have killed more
scientists

209
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:54,809
than anything else because once you
become famous and once you do something

210
00:11:54,809 --> 00:11:56,019
great

211
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:59,160
it's hard to go back and work on the
little acorns

212
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,589
acorns that then give rise to great Oaks

213
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:06,119
okay you see this happening consistently
InfoSec with someone does

214
00:12:06,119 --> 00:12:09,290
a good piece of work and then disappears

215
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:12,360
my and what happens is effectively um

216
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,579
early recognition seems to stabilize you

217
00:12:15,579 --> 00:12:19,180
and its in interesting for us in InfoSec

218
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:23,860
because for those of you who have a look
at up Moxie Mullins bike stuff

219
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,879
like Boxee went back and found out that
you could get

220
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,619
a certificate for any domain in the
world

221
00:12:30,619 --> 00:12:34,129
using the mold bite okay like literally

222
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:37,790
Adam I'll bite to your certificate
request and you can get the thoughtful

223
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,490
ppl dont call

224
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:42,800
okay what's interesting is almost
everyone Ustaz

225
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,439
up interesting what stocks InfoSec
stocks going into what the null byte

226
00:12:47,439 --> 00:12:51,329
at like 2001 okay it's a all the tech
it's a

227
00:12:51,329 --> 00:12:56,040
sobil attack um it just needed someone
to look at it with the beginner's mind

228
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,819
and they would have found that coolness

229
00:12:59,819 --> 00:13:02,850
0 at some point recently um comex

230
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:05,999
up the guy who now looking for Apple but
the famous

231
00:13:05,999 --> 00:13:09,209
are iPhone hacks or didn't ask me
anything

232
00:13:09,209 --> 00:13:13,180
on reddit well which is basically like a
question and answer session

233
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:16,869
and what's interesting is I'll at some
point someone asked him like

234
00:13:16,869 --> 00:13:20,869
how did you do the stuff and this is
well you know I

235
00:13:20,869 --> 00:13:24,480
enjoyed hacking original the sequel
injection and crap

236
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,730
and then he moved on ok and what's
interesting is

237
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:30,869
I'll let City Comic started playing at
home

238
00:13:30,869 --> 00:13:34,600
started doing the sorts of attacks that
people off at

239
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,939
and grew up in became comics okay I'm
its interesting for

240
00:13:38,939 --> 00:13:43,600
the all guys in InfoSec look down on the
script kiddies on the Nexus S is on the

241
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,240
sequel injectors

242
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,850
because good to be the next guy you
laughing at could grow up to be the next

243
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:50,339
comics

244
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:53,629
okay so the the pic you could take away
from that is

245
00:13:53,629 --> 00:13:57,980
okay I'll so you need a lot of time okay
you need to be a student

246
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:02,220
like Jill Watson comics up playing
around with sequel injected

247
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:06,730
any you're having comes back it uses in
terms of working conditions its

248
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:10,220
probably not what you think it is okay
he says that

249
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,639
what most people think ideal working
conditions

250
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:17,670
or not okay and what he's talking about
is the adage that says that

251
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:21,990
I'll genius needs constraints any gives
examples of

252
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:26,480
of things in his life we actually the
guys with the most resources don't solve

253
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,230
the problem because they had too many
resources

254
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:32,490
and it's the guys working with the
constraints that do

255
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:35,850
and what he says though is the thing
that you clearly need

256
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:39,119
is life okay and he points out that

257
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:42,199
almost all great scientists have
tremendous

258
00:14:42,199 --> 00:14:45,550
amounts of drive up so he could muted

259
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:49,699
thats is that if other sport as long and
as hard as he did

260
00:14:49,699 --> 00:14:53,309
they'd get similar results and of course
this is

261
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,329
I'll brings up an interesting paradox
because if you have a look

262
00:14:56,329 --> 00:15:00,759
at famous InfoSec rock stars you not
seeing the

263
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:04,709
I work long hours and I'll sleeve
through the night

264
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:07,720
mostly what you seeing is guys up
partying

265
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,209
at conferences okay and I'll

266
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:14,499
you can't get this image a lot but its

267
00:15:14,499 --> 00:15:18,499
it's safe to say that this stuff is
almost completely false

268
00:15:18,499 --> 00:15:22,470
okay foremost every speaker who you see
speaking at a conference

269
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:25,990
and talking about living the party life
and partying at three

270
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:29,839
I can't get into you these guys spit
many many months

271
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,730
of not going out thinking so that they
could work on the talk

272
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:37,660
okay this tremendous amount to be such
that actually get hidden

273
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:41,230
and so most people think up that its its
kind of chilled

274
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:44,629
I ask people for quotes on this and the
got

275
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:48,499
actually went the way um he says that
thinking this much takes

276
00:15:48,499 --> 00:15:51,519
if it and you can't just start out like
that so

277
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,869
so that's gonna take work but um
essentially

278
00:15:54,869 --> 00:15:59,089
Malcolm Gladwell was talking about this
when he put out his appliance book

279
00:15:59,089 --> 00:16:02,139
okay when he said that are you basically
need 10,000

280
00:16:02,139 --> 00:16:05,970
hours of practice to people gates a ten
thousand dollars affect us to become the

281
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,389
Beatles

282
00:16:07,389 --> 00:16:10,869
and home in a way haven't touched on
this

283
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:14,980
I'll all this time ago would you started
talking about someone who worked with

284
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:15,660
called John

285
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,800
2t okay don't know how to pronounce his
son im

286
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,800
but at some point he found out that this
guy working with him John to keep

287
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,559
was super elite and then you realize the
John took it was

288
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:30,579
actually younger than he was and so he
goes to his boss and says

289
00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:34,019
this is impossible OpenID this young

290
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:37,420
can be this book it like he just knows
too much for someone his

291
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:42,069
age and I'll his boss up call boat book

292
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:46,040
essentially told him you'd be surprised
how much should know

293
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:50,639
if you worked as hard as two key did ok
and what is boss was essentially

294
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:51,790
pointing out

295
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:56,230
was that knowledge and productivity I
like compound insist

296
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:59,230
okay and he goes on to say that I'll

297
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:02,749
essentially the more you know the more
you learn the more you learn the more

298
00:17:02,749 --> 00:17:04,050
you can do

299
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:07,329
the more you can do the more
opportunities you get and

300
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:11,670
he goes on to say that given to people
approximately the same ability

301
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:15,829
if one person works jest 10 percent more
than the other

302
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:19,380
overtime he'll more than twice I'll
produce the former

303
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:24,750
okay and essentially what he's saying
the is hard work pays comp on benefits

304
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:28,590
okay um he goes what this is something
that's interesting way he talks about

305
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,690
his personal relationship and he says
look

306
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:35,880
this type of dedication takes a toll he
says if he's honest

307
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,760
there were times he had to be unfair to
his wife he says because

308
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,549
that's what our hard work takes okay and
you kind of see the same thing

309
00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:47,919
are happening again and again InfoSec so

310
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,149
do you know there's a movie tweeted at
some point that he said

311
00:17:51,149 --> 00:17:54,429
if informed about chances are someone
else also has

312
00:17:54,429 --> 00:17:57,500
and chances are that person is actually
to be so

313
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,070
okay um I'm not sure how many of you
know to be so

314
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:04,309
te vous from Google but Thomas is done

315
00:18:04,309 --> 00:18:08,260
a whole bunch of awesome stuff if
there's a platform out there

316
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:12,399
at some point you are vulnerable to a
bug but that tablets has put out

317
00:18:12,399 --> 00:18:15,730
the early iPhone Jailbreak came through
with bugs

318
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:19,070
PSP jailbreaks came from his buds

319
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:22,080
he breaks everything he looks at right
um

320
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,179
know what's interesting is if you look
at TV so at some point he tweeted

321
00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:27,890
something like this which is

322
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:31,250
this crack me was very hard work from
but it was fun

323
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:34,690
and any links to this crack me that he
was doing ok im

324
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:38,630
what's interesting is um I pulled up
this crack me

325
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:42,179
and if you well if you look at it let's
just see if I can

326
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:47,240
make it bigger if you look at this crack
me you see something interesting here

327
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:52,440
we he certainly goes through I'll if you
know what crack me zaw

328
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,510
okay so crack means I'll site %uh that's
dedicated to

329
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,570
up people who put up taxes and other
people who

330
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:02,789
go in and then work on both tracks it
gives you a chance to work with your

331
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:04,539
reversing skills

332
00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:07,700
and to be so goes through this crack me
and if you look at it

333
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:12,039
he talks about weeks and weeks that he's
put into this crack me

334
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:15,070
okay this is something that he did in
his spare time

335
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:19,700
okay and even this documentation is
completely unnecessary unite

336
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,070
but this is something that he's put in
months and months of

337
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:26,210
if it and essentially at the end for him

338
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:30,350
it's just fun it's just the stuff that
he did to get meat

339
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:34,720
and what's interesting is um I spoke it
broke on a little while back

340
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,860
and while I was waiting to give my talk
I was looking at this guy

341
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:42,100
%uh in the cloud I'm not sure you can
tell but this dude is watching

342
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,549
episode of How I Met Your Mother okay

343
00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:49,130
so he's come to a security conference is
sitting in the cold

344
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:52,130
and he is watching the video ok and

345
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:56,200
at this point like I think option is
pretty straightforward

346
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,380
you have to decide which of those two
guys you up you either to be so

347
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:05,490
all you i watch movies at conference guy
okay and both those things have natural

348
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:08,990
on national parks and national and okay

349
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:12,480
if you look at up guys like Joe Hart in
comics

350
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,970
and you think like those guys are really
disgustingly yup

351
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:20,279
to be doing I'll such cool stuff but
then you have to ask yourself

352
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:23,870
what were you doing at 98 okay like hope

353
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:28,269
ninety deals are spending the nights
I'll looking at iPhone internals

354
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:32,200
was going to the next party okay if you
wanna pull off the coolness

355
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,429
I'll that's the stuff that it takes

356
00:20:35,429 --> 00:20:38,919
so I guess the question is um

357
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:42,490
is it a little bit hot okay and having
missus

358
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:46,570
noble I'll or he touches on the geniuses
ninety-nine percent

359
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:49,870
perspiration and one percent inspiration
but actually

360
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:53,639
I'll somebody spoke about this better
than 0

361
00:20:53,639 --> 00:20:57,269
better than having which is the guys
from cracked magazine

362
00:20:57,269 --> 00:21:01,580
okay on on the one hand at photograph is
slightly disturbing

363
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:04,700
but but other than that the guys

364
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:08,620
wrote this article about whole I'll the
movie Karate Kid is one

365
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:13,149
all of us whatever and what he talks
about diseases that in

366
00:21:13,149 --> 00:21:16,950
movies like The Karate Kid or rocky
we've kind of grown up

367
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:21,139
with this new thing that's is guy
doesn't have the skills

368
00:21:21,139 --> 00:21:25,100
visible there's a music montage and the
guy has the skills

369
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,179
okay and so we've kind of gotten used to
this thing that's is

370
00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:32,769
you go from don't know the stuff movie
what music montage

371
00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:37,289
and it's okay you know the stuff aces it
kind of gets you to the point

372
00:21:37,289 --> 00:21:41,179
will you forget how hard the stuff it's
and what he says is

373
00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:44,820
he says it's like diets it's not just
that it's hard because you know that the

374
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,019
die it's going to be hard when you
started

375
00:21:47,019 --> 00:21:50,100
he says but it's so much harder its

376
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:54,169
it's almost not fit he says like you can
run for half an hour

377
00:21:54,169 --> 00:21:58,630
um eat a muffin and that's your off an
hours-long just gone

378
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:01,820
soul it's not just a little bit hot it's
a lot

379
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,990
hot okay and in part we've kind of

380
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:09,809
I'll started growing to not like stuff
that's that's hot

381
00:22:09,809 --> 00:22:13,230
and what happened talks about is he says
that great problems

382
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:18,159
need emotional commitment uses about the
great scientists are really really

383
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:18,970
committed

384
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:22,809
up to producing first crosswalk and what
he cites

385
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:26,769
is or one of the things that he touches
on is he says the almost

386
00:22:26,769 --> 00:22:31,130
everyone who studies creativity comes
out and tells you

387
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:34,240
that creativity comes out of your I'll

388
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,010
subconscious and he's not the only one
who said this right

389
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:43,320
like I'll fill you simply 0 John Cleese
gave a talk at the World creativity

390
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,220
photo

391
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:47,690
and he gave his talk on creativity
essentially what

392
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:51,159
his whole talk is about is on how you
get out of the way

393
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:54,240
of your subconscious and Paul Graham

394
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,000
I'll says almost the same thing like you
wrote an essay called

395
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,130
the top idea in your mind and in paul
got his essay

396
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:06,380
he sensibly says that in your mind
there's only a few things

397
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:10,070
that you think about in the shower in
the morning and what you want to make

398
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,200
sure it is

399
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,230
that the problem you feel you want to
solve is the stuff that's occupying the

400
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,399
top spot

401
00:23:16,399 --> 00:23:19,980
okay and then all programs essay he was
basically saying if you running a

402
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,029
startup

403
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:24,100
you want to be thinking about the
problems you solving not thinking about

404
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,360
raising money

405
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,490
because one of those two things are
going to be the top idea in your mind

406
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:33,860
%uh you need to make sure that it's art
that you working on the right problem

407
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:38,480
and so the question that that you've got
ask is the sky everest

408
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,720
like it seems like all having ever did
was was tied to learn

409
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,429
and what's interesting is even when you
tested he seemed to

410
00:23:46,429 --> 00:23:49,500
optimize for learning okay and so in his

411
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,789
I'll s2 in his speech he talks about how
we ended up having lunch with the

412
00:23:53,789 --> 00:23:54,940
chemists

413
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:58,740
essentially what he says is used to go
sit with the mathematicians

414
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:02,710
and the great mathematicians got their
prizes and left Bell Labs

415
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:06,190
and then used to sit with the physicist
and the great ones left

416
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:09,700
and so he says he went to the I'll had
lunch with the chemists

417
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:13,690
enough to sit with them for a little
while ago he of the guys like a look

418
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:17,539
what are the top problems in your field
okay and

419
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:21,419
guys listed some and after a little
while the of the guys will look

420
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:24,549
what problems are you guys working on

421
00:24:24,549 --> 00:24:28,860
okay and what's interesting is you see
the disconnect between

422
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:32,600
guys knowing what the big problems I'll
and what the guys

423
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:37,250
actually actively working on okay and
what he says is there's a whole bunch of

424
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,899
scientists who spent almost

425
00:24:38,899 --> 00:24:42,940
all the time working on problems that
you know what the start

426
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:47,220
I'm not that important problems in your
field okay InfoSec

427
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:51,580
I think this stuff applies to us like
really really seriously

428
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:55,190
you can spend a lot of your time um
hacking at the weeds

429
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:59,070
and not getting to the fundamental stuff
that's going to move the ball forward

430
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:02,649
okay we we can have spent no time by
definition

431
00:25:02,649 --> 00:25:06,730
on stuff that's not going to be great
work will find the next blog

432
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:11,350
in the next product but its it's not
going along to anything significant

433
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:14,830
okay and again um Paul Graham talks
about this

434
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:18,159
when he talks about good and bad protest
the nation

435
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:23,220
and what he says is he says what's the
best thing you could be working on

436
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:26,700
and the question that follows is why
onto working on that

437
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,380
best thing that you could be working on
and he said something interesting which

438
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:32,960
kind of kicks you in the gut

439
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,009
he says that sometimes you shy away from
it because it's just too much of a

440
00:25:37,009 --> 00:25:38,100
challenge

441
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:41,370
instead of tackling those big hairy
audacious goals

442
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:45,899
as to politely called it you go for the
hope for the small hits

443
00:25:45,899 --> 00:25:49,429
okay and its its ok to fix almost
everyone

444
00:25:49,429 --> 00:25:54,860
I'll in truth I've started or I've
stopped doing as many conference talks

445
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:58,909
because I can't get the feeling that as
conference because we do some of the

446
00:25:58,909 --> 00:26:00,059
same thing

447
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:03,549
%uh you do a talk you get a dopamine hit
I'll

448
00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:07,720
and then you move on and you can't get
used to the small hits of dopamine and

449
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,490
it kinda stopped you from looking

450
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:12,490
on foodie cool stuff

451
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:16,100
um so what happened did well what he
prescribed

452
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:19,919
prescribed for himself was something
that he called plate bolts time

453
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,269
okay that sounds grandiose but
essentially what he did was on Fridays

454
00:26:24,269 --> 00:26:28,320
Friday afternoons he called the side
time just to think about

455
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,059
I'll what he called great thoughts so
it's something say

456
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:35,130
house computing gonna change life at
Bell Labs

457
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:38,960
all like for us it would be what happens
when internet com

458
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,899
communication is completely ubiquitous
what happens with everyone's got a

459
00:26:42,899 --> 00:26:44,919
smartphone and everyone's checking in

460
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:47,950
I'll all the time okay but it allows you

461
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:51,610
to see a little further and what's
interesting is

462
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:55,470
I'll I mentioned to Modi the and took
away the gives the stalk like

463
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:58,710
he gave this to look at web 2.0 last
year

464
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:02,429
where he basically said the world's got
huge problems

465
00:27:02,429 --> 00:27:05,480
okay like we've got massive unemployment

466
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:11,380
up we've got a global warming and the
best and the brightest are working on

467
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:14,909
like I fought applications for the
iPhone all

468
00:27:14,909 --> 00:27:18,460
how to sell advertising to people up for
Google

469
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:22,289
like it's a question of whether we
working on the stuff that matters

470
00:27:22,289 --> 00:27:26,490
and up he often quotes this poem by they
nobody a bill Cup

471
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:30,370
which is a beautiful poem any it the
port basically says

472
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:34,110
like when we pick small targets even
when we win

473
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:37,299
the victories make a small okay and

474
00:27:37,299 --> 00:27:42,419
essentially it's a call to arms to to
work on Plato problems

475
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:46,000
um and so having goes on to talk about

476
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,179
about the importance of being prepared
okay and

477
00:27:49,179 --> 00:27:53,080
he basically says that if you've got
these great scientists

478
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,889
they sit around and they know these
problems that are worth chasing

479
00:27:56,889 --> 00:27:59,919
and the cut wait for that break with a
think

480
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,750
okay here's an angle it and the big dive
into it

481
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:08,100
okay and he quotes um what he calls a
horror story

482
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,879
okay where the guys at Booker T
basically pointed out that they had

483
00:28:11,879 --> 00:28:12,629
clients that

484
00:28:12,629 --> 00:28:15,830
what they had the date up um to do

485
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:20,110
the ball before everyone else but just
haven't got a lot on

486
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:23,879
to crunching that they tell you it and
it's interesting

487
00:28:23,879 --> 00:28:28,090
because he talks about I'll the number
of times that you have great scientists

488
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:30,330
who just haven't chased on an angle

489
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:33,850
just because the kind of haven't gotten
around to it and

490
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:36,639
the interesting thing to note is how
many times that happens to you in

491
00:28:36,639 --> 00:28:37,750
InfoSec

492
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:41,309
use it at all and you'll see something
get published that the man you had that

493
00:28:41,309 --> 00:28:41,870
idea

494
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:46,409
three years ago you just hadn't actually
chased it all the way through

495
00:28:46,409 --> 00:28:50,169
okay and I guess it's I'll one of the
key characteristics that is talking

496
00:28:50,169 --> 00:28:51,000
about

497
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,570
when when you see something that's what
chasing are you jump on it

498
00:28:55,570 --> 00:29:00,149
and one of the next door all comebacks
when you talk about all this grandiose

499
00:29:00,149 --> 00:29:01,330
doing great

500
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:04,450
great stuff things is someone who comes
back and says man that's all well and

501
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:05,490
good

502
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:09,950
but I've got to get paid and in my job
I've got to do a lot of a little pigs

503
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:13,659
I can spend all my time chasing these
ugh great thoughts

504
00:29:13,659 --> 00:29:17,240
and you that I'll having gives you a
solution

505
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,850
and he basically talks about the time
when

506
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:25,120
he had to do work for government got
that some military contractor or some

507
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,470
military official comes to it and
basically

508
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:31,929
gives him long division to do okay so
it's work that's

509
00:29:31,929 --> 00:29:35,129
insulting for someone in someone of his
stature

510
00:29:35,129 --> 00:29:38,480
but it's where the con money comes from
and so he has to do it

511
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,950
and what he says is he goes back to it
ain't what you do

512
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:45,289
it's the way that you do it because what
he talks about is

513
00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:48,519
I'll the way that he went back and solve
that problem

514
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:53,070
he ends up solving it more elegantly and
he actually says that

515
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:56,299
through that exercise he came out with
Hemings I'll

516
00:29:56,299 --> 00:30:00,000
with the new method of solving
differential equations okay so he went

517
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,710
back

518
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:03,919
looked at the problem decided to solve
it more elegantly

519
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,919
and essentially changed mathematics

520
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:10,350
and if you look a study buddy like back
in 2000

521
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:14,990
if you ever been an exploit you avail
you running heated my stuff

522
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:18,700
they could literally go to hell that's
you know that's it you'd pull some

523
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,990
exploit you'd hope it compiled yet hope
it then

524
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:25,389
okay in the shell called was iffy and
then I'll

525
00:30:25,389 --> 00:30:28,629
HD Moore started Metasploit okay and he
did what

526
00:30:28,629 --> 00:30:32,269
everyone else was doing joining together
shellcode

527
00:30:32,269 --> 00:30:35,990
and up attack victim is payloads

528
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:39,179
but he did it so much classier okay and

529
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:42,960
everyone bill in the exploit will be so
much richer for it

530
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,559
and and having literally says you should
do your work in the fashion

531
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:49,669
that others can stand on your shoulders
okay and

532
00:30:49,669 --> 00:30:52,850
again if if you take the Metasploit
example

533
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:56,700
Metasploit isn't just I'll a tool to
attack

534
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:01,409
things like these days Metasploit is
exploit developers workshop

535
00:31:01,409 --> 00:31:04,600
okay let's win it's because he's put
together all of these pieces so that

536
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,539
other people can build on it

537
00:31:07,539 --> 00:31:11,919
and then uses look is gonna talk about
something that's kinda ugly

538
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:16,519
and in an ideal world you really
shouldn't have to do this

539
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:19,970
but what he's talking about is actively
marketing

540
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:24,080
and selling yourself and again if we go
back to do you know the soviet some

541
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,090
point he says look

542
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:29,389
he looked years ago if you want people
to care about your research

543
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:33,100
you have to do marketing okay so it
doesn't matter how cool you r

544
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:37,129
if you just called yourself in a room
I'll at some point

545
00:31:37,129 --> 00:31:40,929
you've got to do marketing and having
agrees because he says

546
00:31:40,929 --> 00:31:45,980
it's not just sufficient for you to do a
job you actually have to sell it

547
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:49,649
okay I'll so very quickly he summarizes

548
00:31:49,649 --> 00:31:52,769
uses you've got a walk on important
problems

549
00:31:52,769 --> 00:31:56,190
you've got denied that it's all luck
okay and then

550
00:31:56,190 --> 00:32:00,559
you have to make sure that you're not
just thinking about small problems

551
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:05,120
and he takes a small diversion and says
look for all of the stuff

552
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,409
like for all haha this work is like

553
00:32:08,409 --> 00:32:12,549
is the effort really worth it okay he
comes back in uses

554
00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:16,919
its absolutely worth it okay and in his
paper yet to pieces

555
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:20,350
doing the very first crosswalk and
knowing you've done

556
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:24,169
first-class walk is as good as wine
women and song

557
00:32:24,169 --> 00:32:27,399
I'll all put together because the truth
is

558
00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:31,730
that the value in the struggle is work
even more than the result

559
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:35,970
okay I'll like doing great work is
intrinsically valuable

560
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:39,549
okay and services well hold on if

561
00:32:39,549 --> 00:32:45,039
doing great work is solely warding why
do so many talented people feel it

562
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,080
okay if if these are the things that we
say all you do to it

563
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,230
to do great work why do so many people
not make it

564
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:55,970
and sources will look the one thing we
touched on was drive and commitment

565
00:32:55,970 --> 00:33:00,019
okay and he goes back into the city says
that the people who do

566
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:03,309
it work um with less ability okay

567
00:33:03,309 --> 00:33:06,330
basically do it just by being more
committed

568
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:09,710
okay essentially says that even if you
have an

569
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:14,120
up us inferior intellect just being more
committed will help you push over the

570
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,149
line

571
00:33:15,149 --> 00:33:18,730
and I'll this came up during his Q&A
session also

572
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:22,379
with someone basically Austin up to to
go into this

573
00:33:22,379 --> 00:33:26,110
matter of time and commitment to get and
he said should be

574
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:29,289
I'll says look let's be honest

575
00:33:29,289 --> 00:33:32,700
um you can go home and play with the
kids

576
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:37,129
and have a nice life and essentially you
have a nice life

577
00:33:37,129 --> 00:33:41,519
okay but if you want to do great stuff
you've got to be committed to it

578
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,129
okay and again this is this is where he
talks about up being unfair to family

579
00:33:46,129 --> 00:33:49,529
and he says like you fooling yourself if
you think that you can do it

580
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:53,090
without some of that out great work
takes commitment

581
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:57,440
you gotta know that that's the cost and
you've got to be prepared to pay

582
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:02,190
missus that the second problem is one of
personality defects

583
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:07,009
okay and I'll he goes into a bunch of
them he talks about not delegating

584
00:34:07,009 --> 00:34:10,440
and then one of those that he talks on
that's interesting is

585
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,510
I'll that of Eagle assertion

586
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:16,770
and this one is interesting for me
because again you talked about his

587
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:18,840
colleague John toukie

588
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:22,490
and what this is about to key is that
two key almost always

589
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:27,300
under dressed for situations okay and so
he cites the example uses

590
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:31,629
John to be would go into someone's
office and because he was on

591
00:34:31,629 --> 00:34:36,030
office it would take a while before the
possum realized that he was talking to

592
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:36,339
of

593
00:34:36,339 --> 00:34:39,540
what he calls a first-class fellow okay

594
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:44,349
and and so what he says is he says that
all well his could be a life spent

595
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:47,750
to spent a lot of time having to
convince people

596
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:51,809
that he was what talking to when he
could have just this the part

597
00:34:51,809 --> 00:34:56,040
also again he says you don't have to
conform

598
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:59,040
he says but what he's saying is that the
appearance of conforming

599
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,410
goes a long way okay and I'll it's
interesting it's one of those parts of

600
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:06,020
the speech a paper that really make me
think

601
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,369
because because I always thought that
and addressing was

602
00:35:09,369 --> 00:35:13,849
a scion of not having an ego so waiting
t-shirt and jeans

603
00:35:13,849 --> 00:35:17,079
%uh shows that you don't have your head
stock up the only ahead

604
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:20,420
but actually if you think about it it's
almost completely the opposite

605
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:23,690
its me saying I don't have to dress up
because I'm cool

606
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:28,579
okay and I'll yeah it's one of those
things that I guess we have to fix

607
00:35:28,579 --> 00:35:32,599
um and then almost recently um

608
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:36,490
having SES many a second-rate fellow
gets caught up

609
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:40,920
in some little putting of the system
okay and I don't think that

610
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:44,300
having was talking about putting as into
to hear

611
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:47,970
but it kind of gives you or an
interesting segue

612
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:53,280
and what I'm talking about your is how
these days with Twitter and Facebook

613
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,109
its kind of common to see people
spending a whole bunch of time

614
00:35:57,109 --> 00:36:00,780
talking about research and talking about
InfoSec

615
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:06,050
but not actually doing research or doing
or working on any of the heart problems

616
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:09,540
and it's a bit of a crazy generalization
because there's some people who treat a

617
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,170
lot

618
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:13,990
and still get awesome stuff done but
having said that

619
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:17,730
have also seen enough people say things
like

620
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:21,369
I've got a paper to you so I'm gonna be
putting my head down and I won't be on

621
00:36:21,369 --> 00:36:23,579
Twitter for the next two weeks

622
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:27,559
okay and if you one of the people whose
it was said something like that at some

623
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:28,579
point

624
00:36:28,579 --> 00:36:31,579
in almost by definition what you're
saying is that this to the time that you

625
00:36:31,579 --> 00:36:33,030
on twitter

626
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:36,030
you don't have your head don't working
on heart problems

627
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:39,050
okay um so you can do

628
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:42,050
what you want with that but what's
interesting is

629
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:45,970
that we could've convince ourselves that
we the exception to this rule

630
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:49,970
that we can spend no time talking about
the stuff in so doing the stuff

631
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:53,480
and mostly we convince ourselves I'll
because of

632
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:57,200
self-delusion okay and what happens is
is

633
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,000
he goes into this %uh to some link
releases that we give ourselves

634
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,980
alibis for almost everything okay you
can very quickly give yourself an alibi

635
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:09,319
like I didn't do it because of this they
didn't do it because of that

636
00:37:09,319 --> 00:37:12,980
my work doesn't belong only to my boss
doesn't give me the freedom

637
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:16,589
and and having says Ben don't kid
yourself

638
00:37:16,589 --> 00:37:20,930
it seems like it's okay to lie to other
people but don't lie to yourself

639
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:25,430
look at some point you need to stand up
and say a lot during the coolest

640
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:29,240
because I'm not committed enough to it
and it's cool you don't have to be

641
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,400
but but don't make up a fake excuse

642
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,599
okay and so what he says is you need to
know yourself

643
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:39,369
you need to know your weaknesses you
need to know your strengths

644
00:37:39,369 --> 00:37:43,380
and and sometimes uses that knowing you
own weaknesses

645
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:47,800
can can end up turning it to a stick to
use is for example he knows

646
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,760
that he has a huge Eagle and so in part
what works for him

647
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,240
is committing to something publicly
because once is committed to be

648
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,200
publically

649
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:00,059
his Eagle won't let him not to it okay
he's going to force himself to do it

650
00:38:00,059 --> 00:38:01,109
just because he knows

651
00:38:01,109 --> 00:38:04,290
ego is that important to okay so

652
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:07,609
so quick somebody people don't win
because they

653
00:38:07,609 --> 00:38:12,359
not working on important problems they
not becoming emotionally involved

654
00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:16,500
they give themselves themselves alibis
and they keep pushing what

655
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:20,000
other people due to luck okay and I'll

656
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,069
after that having basically said go

657
00:38:23,069 --> 00:38:26,880
in like the most straightforward way
which is apparently the way you told

658
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,880
I told you how easy it is I told you how
to reform

659
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,280
I'll go ahead and be great and

660
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:41,280
do great stuff and that's all that I
have

661
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:49,550
are any questions for own

662
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:52,869
nothing it was clear story probably

663
00:38:52,869 --> 00:38:57,650
nobody these reverend if you got a
question will come to you with a

664
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:00,809
microphone

665
00:39:00,809 --> 00:39:06,079
I guess you question whether

666
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:10,089
hi this is Judy fun i won I would like
to

667
00:39:10,089 --> 00:39:13,190
no you mention some people have

668
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:16,730
stable and good life and other people

669
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:21,180
12 make 30% of their hands so they can
walk on many things

670
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:24,880
to have such as king of how to life

671
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,150
this walk I'll so the question

672
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:32,200
is I'll how to get work-life balance

673
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:37,440
um and men the honest on so is

674
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,829
I don't think that work life balance
I'll so

675
00:39:40,829 --> 00:39:44,030
so what on so in general that I'll

676
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:47,760
but having said okay as they exit using

677
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,099
understand that it's not good balanced

678
00:39:51,099 --> 00:39:54,680
if up understand that it's not going to
be balanced

679
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:58,890
if you want to do great stuff you've got
on the stand and commit to the fact that

680
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:02,290
this going to be a lack of balance but
I've been speaking to

681
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:06,970
a few guys about the stuff and one of
the things they point out is that

682
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:11,190
it's not balanced to outsiders though so
it's not balance to someone else

683
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:15,150
looks set to be so in SES that he spent
all these weekends

684
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:19,670
foot three months working on the correct
me what to tell us that is happy place

685
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:20,380
right

686
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:24,230
like he's not doing it as a kind he's
doing it because that's how he chose to

687
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,880
spend his time

688
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:29,680
and and sofa tell was I think if you
tried to force him to take a holiday

689
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,599
instead of working on that crack me
you'd actually be killing him

690
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:39,130
okay so I think 0 I think into the
weirdest stuff does become problematic

691
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:42,339
Israel you have external commitments so
if you have

692
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:46,280
a wife and if you have children the
question then becomes how you balance

693
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,819
that stuff

694
00:40:47,819 --> 00:40:51,299
and the honest answer for that by coming
says look

695
00:40:51,299 --> 00:40:54,369
his hat to neglect his wife at times

696
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:58,220
but I think you see that happening just
about everywhere ask any of the guys who

697
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,559
run the startup

698
00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:02,579
how many times they've had to bail on
dinner because

699
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:06,240
servers were overloaded do because of
some cases

700
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,420
its it's a trade off and I think it's
one of those things that we've got to

701
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,530
accept

702
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:14,309
that if you want to do cool stuff for a
few 10 get the results

703
00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:20,839
you you've got to put in those miles

704
00:41:20,839 --> 00:41:27,839
anyone else

705
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:36,140
I my name is heavy my question is how do
you know

706
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:39,920
you have the skews actually to go for
doing something

707
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,400
right how do you how do you know
actually already

708
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,700
on much yet you have to work on this
case stand it

709
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:49,810
involved in something okay so the
question is

710
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:53,310
how do you know when you have enough
skills to do the great stuff

711
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:56,440
um so you've got a tool up and do the
basics

712
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:00,300
and I think what having was saying in
part what I was saying

713
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:05,590
is you've got to stop doing stuff and
when you stop doing stuff

714
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:10,150
maybe some of that stuff becomes cleats
to okay so you put the hours in

715
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:13,880
and like if you take the example they
are saying moxie

716
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:17,130
was able to get any city in the world
with a slash

717
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:21,440
you know attack okay so part of the
thing is

718
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,590
actually getting on the field throwing
your hat in the ring

719
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:28,450
and doing it um so one of the problems
that have started seeing a lot

720
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:31,860
and it's why we started the city calm
confidence up

721
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:35,020
that I mentioned earlier is that new
instance

722
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:39,230
out to the field of InfoSec see this
very high pollak you see some guy's neck

723
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:40,690
stiffness and they doing

724
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:45,200
great stuff consistently and it becomes
hard to stop

725
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:49,150
at the bottom okay because does this
whole mountain of stuff that needs doing

726
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:54,070
and I think imparted goes back to what
having was saying about doing something

727
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:58,520
and then that giving you the confidence
to do more and i think im pot

728
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:02,850
this always guys starting right if you
take most of the guys what we end up

729
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:08,190
awesome i phone hacking right now did
not been working on those platforms long

730
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:11,650
like you what has been a while alive
that long I'll

731
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:15,600
and these guys have just pick the stuff
up and they started hacking it

732
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,930
so especially for what we do I think
there's a big push for

733
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:22,350
just getting into stuff Lake

734
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:29,300
good things will come out of it yet

735
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:33,150
hi

736
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:36,810
my name is fighting from Singapore
adjustment to us a fundamental

737
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:40,650
topic you in your research basically my
spirits of

738
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:43,980
doing this research right I police

739
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:47,530
come across problems when I title for
what my research

740
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:51,130
all all what an article so like for
example

741
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:55,280
picking all the iPad 2 I to post because
but maybe says

742
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,810
GPS taking also said you know being even

743
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:02,250
what was that because someone might

744
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:05,470
would and bass Wendy be paid to be

745
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:08,500
issues has been done this article has

so this Michael I'm pic facing you might
be said

747
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:14,670
to be had to be made known to the public

748
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:19,310
if I want to did I wanted it to be
knowing me knowing

749
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:23,570
disc decided the the eighty be

750
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:26,700
up performance E yet

751
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:31,420
so so just to repeat the question is you
start doing something that you put

752
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:33,670
together an article on social
engineering

753
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:37,510
and you try to get it published and
someone says the stuffs already been

754
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:38,110
done

755
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:42,000
okay and I think getting a
self-published

756
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,010
I'll in most fields is difficult with
the interwebs its kinda easy

757
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:50,380
like you put it out there my blog XVI
has three people who pleaded

758
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:54,010
and told them related to me um but

759
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:57,280
but the honest answer is are I think

760
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:01,690
if you look at what what I touched on
their comics was doing sequel injection

761
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:02,200
stuff

762
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,470
okay so you you put in hours

763
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:09,040
you do that stuff and at some point your
stuff gets good enough

764
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,470
and it bubbles to the top okay and
you'll see often

765
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:17,610
um InfoSec there were guys who published
stuff and it went for five years

766
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:21,170
without everyone giving it the kid it
was to you on

767
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:24,230
and sometimes you seat for a whole
classes of attack

768
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:27,530
um so im in 2001

769
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:30,820
i totes our chapter on web application
hacking

770
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:33,870
for one of the for the hacking exposed
gets

771
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:38,100
and I almost didn't include cross-site
scripting they glued to the

772
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:41,740
I thought this was the lamest thing ever
I included

773
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:45,700
under protest I said like this sucks
because at the time it was just putting

774
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:47,640
up but to act like people will

775
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:51,240
putting in Texas for peach be cut and
stuff like that

776
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:54,560
and today the tech over text that you
can put together with cross site

777
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,320
scripting

778
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:59,560
or sumn and I think for that well what
you have to go for

779
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:02,580
is some of what having saying which is
just college

780
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:06,770
and perseverance you keep doing the
stuff you keep putting it out

781
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:10,350
and sooner or later good stuff what
happened um

782
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:14,830
I think so lastly just to flog it he
talks about

783
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:18,330
girl journey being what it so active

784
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:21,640
doing the research and active putting
your doc together

785
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:25,610
active putting it all on people should
be worth it in itself

786
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:29,600
and normally what happens is you'll find
a group of people who think that stuff

787
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:29,880
is

788
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:34,540
awesome and from there you get to move
on but I think if you consistently doing

789
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:35,160
stuff

790
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:40,340
that's always been done the maybe like
part of it should be finding jobs

791
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:43,700
some other guys will push you onto the
next level also

792
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:47,810
like the stuff should be hard for you if
if it's not hard for you if you just

793
00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:50,970
documenting the stuff that other people
have already done

794
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:54,350
then that's probably something you
should welcome to thank you very much

795
00:46:54,350 --> 00:47:01,350
her own

796
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:10,880
this

797
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:17,880
sleep
