2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,740
space

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,460

Mitchell make it a senior filmmakers you
you don't love things like her name

13
00:00:53,589 --> 00:00:57,370

00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:03,730
so before we start with the actual
presentation itself

15
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,340
we have some a special was to announce
on

16
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:11,570
in a way these were a hedge against not
getting anything in for premium

17
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:15,230
so that if we got nothing in which it
still gives money up so

18
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:19,799
we have two awards to you you get out
last man standing or

19
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,970
and a specific achievement award and and
it is going to work

20
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,530
liked it see if I get a volunteer from
the audience who has a camera and

21
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:32,409
Twitter account

22
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:36,650
and a working internet connection anyone

23
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:40,360
wanted to take take pictures me sort of
life awarding an award

24
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,470
and while the guys I know islamic you're
sick in is

25
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,560
is permanently on Twitter and will serve
see it first

26
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,850
hand maybe fire photos some were able to
take so

27
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:53,649
this is the guy

28
00:01:53,649 --> 00:01:58,560
where Oregon ten thousand dollars for
the last man standing water and what the

29
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,460
last man standing what means is that um

30
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:04,440
overtime discuss consistently been
sending us reports have

31
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,890
high-quality and whenever exhausts one
area

32
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,290
fucks he just needs on find another area

33
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:14,959

found a few bucks in opera

34
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,700
for a few bucks our program and then and
then given up this guy seems

35
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,330
seems like it's nothing we can do that
can cause them to give up say giving him

36
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,830
ten thousand dollars award and

37
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,760

41
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,510
for last man standing for another guy

42
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,829
call to with Twitter comes at a cat on

43
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:47,760
names after caton I believe both these
guys are from finland

44
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,980
still not quite sure what it is about
Finland at a Scott unit but a small

45
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,329
country in a population relative to the
world with very high proportion

46
00:02:55,329 --> 00:02:59,269
of incoming bugs from Finland's I'm a
storefront work out what what's in the

47
00:02:59,269 --> 00:02:59,930
water that

48
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,620
so that we can bring some ourselves
saying ten thousand dollars for

49
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:07,269
also reason he's in sending us a
fantastic for IQ

50
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:10,489
bucks across all areas of the cake base
and

51
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:13,090
were very impressed that it is
persistence and be able to find these

52
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:13,519
bikes

53
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,170
on

54
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:21,160
this is actually I believe them is in
our employees here

55
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,220
is going ten thousand dollars I'm on
things not widely known is that

56
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:28,450
the crime guys my team they find 10
bucks in in Firefox and send it over and

57
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,709
get some reward occasionally

58
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:33,880
and as a guy that works for and there's
a guy that works

59
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,269
on the syllabus and just punch boxing
crime we sent in a bunch reports say

60
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:40,480
among seems as president is actually a
collaboration

61
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,980
than you might realize um so this
doesn't end thousand dollars because

62
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:49,620
his done a lot of a lot of work in a
specific area of %uh v8 JavaScript

63
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,750
engine is awesome

64
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:55,370
very jobs 2008 isn't a very large number
very interesting bargains and motors and

65
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,409
we've been very happy

66
00:03:56,409 --> 00:04:01,069
to fix those and again overtime to keep
final bugs and he's a sweet catching

67
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:01,849
regressions

68
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:05,510
and week we particularly love that
because some cuts or aggression we can

69
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,400
fix it before it ever

70
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,110
ships to a stable version of POW's a and
you know what impacts uses

71
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:14,959
say that's a that's thirty thousand

72
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,200
dollars given out already and learning
about three and a half minutes and

73
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:22,719
at sea see if we can keep this up am

74
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,950
is a gorgeous picture the if the
periodic table

75
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:29,020
see that white is when I could find

76
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:34,500
on and unfortunate that this sort of
theoretical physicists

77
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,700
who who served from make some these
elements on doing very well earning up

78
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,300
to number

79
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:43,440
best I can tell on they've mate number
of 109

80
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:50,440
middle-aged number and making somewhere
for that

81
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:56,770
and I've reserve the name element number
1,337

82
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,800
so if they ever get high enough to make
that I've

83
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,840
we've preening pentium and and books
that name

84
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,310
says the gym isn't Cup today

85
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:12,360
we've already covered the surprise
reports um

86
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,479
known surprise you that I think because
we didn't have that come into anything

87
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:16,060
lined up

88
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:20,320
that was a pricing I am when a cover a
history of the reward programs not just

89
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,039
hours but

90
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,740
so industry-wide gonna get his trip any
im

91
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,099
on anions any the age and im really

92
00:05:28,099 --> 00:05:31,219
is measured in months but already has an
ancient history some might say so

93
00:05:31,219 --> 00:05:36,070
will cover um we tell them the warm
that's just

94
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,460
a sort of peripherally related story
that we've never told before

95
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,640
I'm something happen come security that
we thought was was kinda fun

96
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,780
am humbled the story so we're gonna tell
a story

97
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,789
just briefly and then

98
00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:52,070
the reason some stats on how the
programs doing

99
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:55,350
overall since we launched it and then

100
00:05:55,350 --> 00:06:02,050
an EMT results we do have some results
to give up that's quite exciting and I

101
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,650
will take some you name any time you
have left

102
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,710
so

103
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,810
here is a time line of some

104
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:13,310
well-known vulnerability war programs or
or

105
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:17,949
programs in general we decided to start
1981 where a very famous

106
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:21,020
Computer Science Guy Donald Knuth
actually

107
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,289
a top counties for bugs in in a book he
raped

108
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:29,250
and if you found no a bargain with the
albums he described

109
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:33,419
here just cut your check insanity so so
that was a fairly early

110
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:36,729
version of bug bounties starting in 1981

111
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:40,729
I'm times but since of whether on the
most famous programs is of course

112
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:43,930
the Mozilla bug bounties start of the
netscape a county we think that dates

113
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,729
back to about 95

114
00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:49,210
a Lucas in your dnt correctness that's
wrong

115
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,490
still going strong on

116
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:55,710
in 2002 we had starter

117
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:59,509
some companies that are sort of the
party brokers they buy from ability

118
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:04,949
and and I'm typically use that to pull
some product they have insanity to love

119
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:05,840
to the

120
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,100
effected vendor

121
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,270
miss you 30,000 for us extension of the
netscape a county

122
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:19,090
I'm CDI summit I defense 2005 and
starting to get

123
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:22,949
quite a few popping up from from 2007 on
what's up and

124
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:27,330
I have courses is a similar thing the
pentium cover that a bit later

125
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:31,150
the Crimean was program have to study
January 2010 so

126
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:38,150
its two-and-a-half years old now already
again yesterday that we don't ship

127
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,750
partially spurred on by the success of
the if the Crimean War program

128
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:46,590
the Google the sort of people website
side of things launched

129
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:50,539
a program that was won the first four is
that you know of to sort of

130
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:53,669
invite research is to make money off it
website books

131
00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:58,060
am has changed in legal discussions
launch that seems to come just fine

132
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:02,419
and lots of people piled on since we
have

133
00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:06,910
miss Tila I did their web sites to their
bounty program

134
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:11,190
quite MZ Facebook waitin and

135
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:15,039
and they pay money for excess and sign
their website

136
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:19,169
and since I write this light I'm updated
this actual picture

137
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:23,889
sons are at the site things instincts
just list the

138
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:26,930
the phone for the programs I found
launch since I read that slight and it's

139
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,490
not that ok so

140
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:31,949
on DNA if you find a bug

141
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:36,419
in a Samsung TV you can make some money

142
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:39,860
if you go to the Earl they list for the
Hall of Fame you can

143
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,060
seat is empty so you could make history
by being the first person to make money

144
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:43,919
off a bug

145
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,310
Samsung TV on a powers of very very
well-known

146
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:52,470
I prefer website they launched their
program just a few months ago engine

147
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,790
2012

148
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:58,230
and one thing i just under Section I
notice that as it was launched

149
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,470
the serve had guide Pay Pal security

150
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:04,800
in blog post launched this program said

151
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,470
he had reservations about the idea of
paying such a bug reports but having

152
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:09,670
studied the data

153
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:12,930
the publicly available later the people
such as

154
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:16,920
such as premium and Facebook and people
wept

155
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,430
see how those programs actually gone you
swayed by the evidence that he should

156
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:24,270
getting lunch program for for Pay Pal

157
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:27,520
so the history specific to the Crimean
roll program

158
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,890
when we launched the rewards we offered
were between five hundred and

159
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:34,810
1337 bolts

160
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:38,150
with my swap that I'm going at it just
five hundred dollars just

161
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:42,010
you know you needed for ten to the war
TD so cautiously on

162
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:45,660
went well we felt that we could safety
increase the

163
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,449
the water mounts a week fairly quickly
increase the top awards to you

164
00:09:49,449 --> 00:09:53,589
from leads to it three thousand dollars

165
00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:56,270
less well-known we've actually been
expanding the scope of what we cover in

166
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,170
the program since launch

167
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:01,760
did you know that will we will actually
pay for bugs and

168
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,179
Adobe Flash or the next connally's the
things that we

169
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:08,850
we use in some of our sum up I'm
products like I'm less that comes with a

170
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,640
copy of the lights can also

171
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,630
will actually paper budzyn also open
source software and I'll see

172
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:17,929
contribute this fixes immediately back
to the the repository

173
00:10:17,929 --> 00:10:22,699
to a bug fixes sometimes back to the
earning for checked

174
00:10:22,699 --> 00:10:26,350
and just recently 9 August we

175
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:30,179
sort of up the rewards again so we

176
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:33,679
we've got up for water ten thousand-plus
where the pass in the straits that we

177
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:35,120
voices have the rights to you

178
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,949
brought up a charity beyond our
top-level something that really

179
00:10:37,949 --> 00:10:39,360
impresses comes in

180
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,520
am I met a bunch by missus

181
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,910
so we saw the now fitted with a focus on
exploit ability

182
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:51,260
previously for a one thousand dollar but
we might

183
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:54,819
we might have a bug it's probably not
exploitable on at the same for but that

184
00:10:54,819 --> 00:10:55,929
probably is explainable

185
00:10:55,929 --> 00:10:59,750
so with these new bonuses we starting
more detailed look at the bug

186
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:03,540
and answer topped the one thousand
dollars up to maybe

187
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,939
four thousand dollars or if something
particularly exploitable

188
00:11:06,939 --> 00:11:10,679
in our opinion or so minutes proved was
that it is and it's automatic

189
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:14,839
automatic topped up one example we use
to pay just five hundred dollars for

190
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:18,390
possible cone out outta bounds read on

191
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:22,089
and that again would range from not
exploitable to particularly exploitable

192
00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:23,030
bucks

193
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:26,339
and just recently we use this new

194
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:32,020
impressed anything see we we use this
new bonus structure to pay 3500

195
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:35,790
for but that would have previously

196
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:39,470
in religious five hundred dollars so
someone have a

197
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:46,350
someone have a spectacular and i
pressing in back in the room to

198
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:49,730
Sabah how much is it worth

199
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:56,730
pay someone ten dollars if they can stop
it happening okay said

200
00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:02,509
is dependent like that is very three new
there that is already history so

201
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:06,809
so two starts back in February 2011
where we

202
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:10,589
sort of pity back to the woman and and
contest and we said well

203
00:12:10,589 --> 00:12:15,300
kind of like this contest you want to
put some more money into that contest to

204
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,990
motivate people to go of the crimes that
are the other browsers because

205
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:22,319
at the time not me people going of the
crime and we wanted to make a pic of

206
00:12:22,319 --> 00:12:26,769
frames that we could get some instinct
things in and and lands Miami

207
00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:30,230
you can't learn if you not receiving any
reports on experts on

208
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:33,769
bucks so we three in a twenty thousand
dollar

209
00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:37,230
up for Wat on so made a great things in

210
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:40,300
I'm direction I'm a bank do the same
again

211
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:44,129
and every this year so having we should
agree

212
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:47,759
as we do the same thing and there was a
a misunderstanding which sprint was

213
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:48,410
going into

214
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:51,769
I'm which courses to withdraw
sponsorship on this is

215
00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:56,579
in February 2012 with cancer West wept

216
00:12:56,579 --> 00:13:00,170
and as hell going on just a month later
and since the

217
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:03,809
this we'd already announced that we are
Canada's top up and then had to withdraw

218
00:13:03,809 --> 00:13:06,869
about it what if we motivated researcher
to

219
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:10,279
go of the crime based purely on the fact
that might get a top what specific

220
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:13,629
crime so we felt kind of obliged to on
something let

221
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:17,110
researchers work if they'd started it
still have the same sort of value

222
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:20,569
I'm so with minimal planning

223
00:13:20,569 --> 00:13:25,480
we sort of hasty launched any on

224
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,299
and I did very well don't contain
details you have enough time I think

225
00:13:29,299 --> 00:13:29,740
what we did

226
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:33,509
quite a few blog posts detailing that
the fantastic submissions that we call

227
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:37,779
week eight hundred twenty thousand
dollars and the amount of

228
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:40,600
the amount of data we got not many
things we learned in the hardening

229
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,379
measures we were able to apply to crime

230
00:13:42,379 --> 00:13:45,980
were invaluable to us we are very happy
and then

231
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:52,470
now an EMT history so it's just that by
virtue middle

232
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:56,179
a little tale from a warm where warm is

233
00:13:56,179 --> 00:13:59,709
something interesting comes in am civil
huddle around for the offices

234
00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:04,059
and so and deal with it so in May 2011

235
00:14:04,059 --> 00:14:08,059
on communities VPN issued what we call a
non-disclosure

236
00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:11,139
it's where you sort of support to Genoa
vulnerability but don't

237
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:14,860
given you any details they can go fixing
the vulnerability

238
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:18,299
and that was displays are YouTube video
you know I

239
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:22,589
I'm sure you've seen the source videos:
where so the a browser

240
00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:27,459
and video in the past is a website Nana
up pops help and it's like paint paint

241
00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:27,850
paint

242
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:32,040
and as well as you can tell from the
from video or is that

243
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,759
so from my experience working right its
30 teams in or security team would just

244
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:37,240
say

245
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,679
this is ridiculous this is a video its
number five acclaim

246
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:44,850
just kind of got home and get on with
our databse

247
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:48,589
if the security what you do

248
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:51,629
is you undertake a detailed analysis
pixel by pixel

249
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:56,589
YouTube video so this is a freeze-frame

250
00:14:56,589 --> 00:14:59,889
of the video I miss a few minutes long
some gonna show you that it is a

251
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:01,399
freeze-frame in the middle of the video

252
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:06,019
on its after the the the Pirates
reported to a fight of you know calpers

253
00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:07,329
appeared in them been minimized

254
00:15:07,329 --> 00:15:10,720
um so this freeze frame shows

255
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,419
sort of the the pain crime in foreground
with a process

256
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:17,819
when this process manager whatever it's
called on the next guy

257
00:15:17,819 --> 00:15:22,709
in the background I'm showing and yet to
receive a process manager is to proof

258
00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:23,189
that

259
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:27,809
you have I'm sandbox execution as you
bust out the sandbox

260
00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:31,240
I'm so and one of the on the labels and
in here is

261
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,569
is medium and windows that means you've
passed out of the samples

262
00:15:34,569 --> 00:15:40,369
say I know if they don't see anything
suspicious or ingesting

263
00:15:40,369 --> 00:15:43,869
about this freeze-frame for me probably
not at the range or a

264
00:15:43,869 --> 00:15:47,319
anyway the first thing we noticed
interest is here

265
00:15:47,319 --> 00:15:52,439
zemin of that section if you notice
short hip

266
00:15:52,439 --> 00:15:55,649
just slightly above the crime logo in
the process tree

267
00:15:55,649 --> 00:15:59,410
is another logo which just two pixels

268
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:04,740
that's cool pixels is exposed it so
happens that the

269
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,759
any possible a good I can be in the
crime process to Rees is a

270
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,879
a process named run 32 deal

271
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:15,009
which is it's just a name what it means
is that to Adobe Flash has been

272
00:16:15,009 --> 00:16:15,939
instantiated

273
00:16:15,939 --> 00:16:19,720
so that this is a massive club and just
two pixels

274
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,329
leaks whole amount of information here
that's not it's not everything

275
00:16:24,329 --> 00:16:27,490
what we I like it now

276
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:31,049
see if these points can work little bit
is

277
00:16:31,049 --> 00:16:37,129
for processes the folk I'm processes
running

278
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:41,240
and that this particular configuration
of number processes and

279
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,669
integrity level of processes indicated
also is is

280
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:49,279
uniquely can system with debut fashion
having being launched

281
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,589
am just to confuse us initially one of
these

282
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:56,019
on these things actually mislabeled by
process manager and this that's unknown

283
00:16:56,019 --> 00:16:56,819
race condition

284
00:16:56,819 --> 00:17:00,289
in in that the process manager on

285
00:17:00,289 --> 00:17:03,529
second pieces for been so we until when
and

286
00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:08,250
disease foundation understood what was
going on

287
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:12,039
the sort of virtual memory size

288
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:15,159
has the maximum size that's probably the
heap size and

289
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:18,360
Smith in days but it's clearly shown the

290
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:22,589
so the flash process or too fast pace as
about this one

291
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:26,209
is joining us for under megabytes in
size and that's that's

292
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:30,100
that's particularly large I'm it sort of
tells you that

293
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,590
combined with the length of time it
would take to run it tells you that some

294
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:33,649
spray is gone

295
00:17:33,649 --> 00:17:36,850
so that wasn't clear that we also use no
response

296
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:42,620
and finally and this is the need two
weeks p7 by circumstantial

297
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:45,770
but you can see there's in Scopus when
they which implies as

298
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:49,620
a large HTML element that sort of blank

299
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:52,980
is gonna beyond me bounds at the window
naked

300
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,620
Ducati are our temptations that's a
that's a sort of

301
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:00,129
hidden plugin element

302
00:18:00,129 --> 00:18:03,330
61 freeze-frame in qualitatively so you
know I'm

303
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:07,889
enough for us to conclude with absolute
certainty that

304
00:18:07,889 --> 00:18:11,240
which can be something about security
but AP flashed and this

305
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,639
of it as a cue crime experts over is
like a bit misdirection essay

306
00:18:15,639 --> 00:18:18,649
week dug into into win again Adobe Flash

307
00:18:18,649 --> 00:18:21,820
said response

308
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:25,470
we his head of tapas

309
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:30,159
he said if Thomas tabs on Monday I get
the full name

310
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:33,779
that few people he's well known as Kate
immunity for being a bit machine when it

311
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:34,379
comes to

312
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:38,850
research and finding bugs so we site
will out as a secret weapon

313
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:42,460
and we paid him up with another fussy
weapons which is a large amount of

314
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,730
computing resource

315
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:47,190
um 2000 CPU cores

316
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:50,309
I think he's been using more since then
on other problems

317
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:56,200
um he used a CPU cores to download every
fast fun on the Internet

318
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:01,230
and do some analysis on them so he can
assess if these files that represented

319
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:04,779
a a large amount of coverage a flash

320
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:09,049
so that with minimal setup files you can
get a good so testing basis if you like

321
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:12,539
that was too that's a twenty thousand
files and then using the same

322
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:18,549
2000 Cebu cause he see the titties and
fussing I'm resulting about 100 bucks

323
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:21,549
we don't know if we got the specific
back in the video but a bunch for such

324
00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:22,000
as

325
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,370
sort of I about you've got my back so we
killed some bucks

326
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:31,779
that was rampage in a more rapid number
two we thought well

327
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:35,520
something wrong of some boxes lock it
down so we had some lockdowns

328
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,860
we found based on internal review we
found some

329
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:43,129
memory corruptions in in every democrat
shins we fix those

330
00:19:43,129 --> 00:19:47,460
am accelerated work on something at the
fax was now launched which is

331
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,610
brings fashion to the same strength some
books

332
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:53,919
give or take as the core chrome browser

333
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,570
went on a third rampaged

334
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:01,770
has mentioned from the fees from
analysis we thought we detected a

335
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:06,889
a bit of a spray due to the size of the
if the process after the expert run

336
00:20:06,889 --> 00:20:11,090
so we I see a fight some lockdowns to
flash to limit the amount of

337
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:15,000
a certain type of thing it out a project
nothing um

338
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,399
this really was a rampage to be when bit
too far and

339
00:20:18,399 --> 00:20:21,750
and the string camps doesn't mean
anything in particular to use a

340
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:26,690
which was it means that that the that
this capitan had been breached

341
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:30,629
I'm fortunate wish and quite a few uses
22 you too

342
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:34,659
certain flash files using a lot of love
these things so we had to back out of

343
00:20:34,659 --> 00:20:39,549
on some fortunate that a

344
00:20:39,549 --> 00:20:42,679
definitely part of the story and finally
we invited the community from page

345
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:46,049
number four to join us we said well this
is a facebook status of scale of the

346
00:20:46,049 --> 00:20:46,700
number I

347
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:50,490
looking flash on again this isn't widely
known we haven't

348
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:54,090
receive many submissions in in flash
which with PayPal

349
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:59,590
but what they say if and losses and then

350
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:03,250
so just some just some stats from a
program so far

351
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,330
so we've actually paid out its numbers
now today

352
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:09,970
because since already sites last night
after me

353
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:13,020
um we actually issued formal reports

354
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:16,480
that's 489 to draw or paint

355
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,760
across those a Fondren 85

356
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,040
rewards is two million

357
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:27,379
local currency amazing

358
00:21:27,379 --> 00:21:30,480
upon the state before in in Brazil and

359
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,619
where the difference between position
currency and

360
00:21:33,619 --> 00:21:37,059
some other kind nearby time such as a
factor 50 or so

361
00:21:37,059 --> 00:21:40,159
is there some guests in the audience
West bring it to US Dollars actually

362
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,619
about three to one side

363
00:21:41,619 --> 00:21:45,070
at six hundred and fifty thousand
dollars I'm and that

364
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:48,129
numbers also stay last up to place at a
quarter of a million

365
00:21:48,129 --> 00:21:53,109
based on the wards issued within the
last last 24 hours ascent

366
00:21:53,109 --> 00:21:56,460
that's just the Crimean program cables
as web program it easy

367
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,649
rewarded a bunch major such as so the
table across Google

368
00:21:59,649 --> 00:22:03,619
white is in excess of a million US
dollars and

369
00:22:03,619 --> 00:22:06,990
given that we keep expand the programs
and pushing the numbers up for would pay

370
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:10,299
hoping that this one million dollars
with some two million dollars and

371
00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:13,899
and just keep going up over time first
wicket

372
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:20,559
after all the community for work that
help make everyone save

373
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:24,149
um I'm gonna get in huge amount of
detail

374
00:22:24,149 --> 00:22:28,020
in this talk but a sometimes media talks
him into this week

375
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:31,720
was sort of trying to convey to people
are thinking of launching program

376
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:35,990
what challenges they my face said to
just go into a little bit of detail that

377
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:36,780
way

378
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:41,760
one slight wheel out is a slide that
illustrates the sort of relative ratio

379
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,559
bugs you get before you launch the
program which is a

380
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:49,049
up to Jan 2010 here if versus the

381
00:22:49,049 --> 00:22:54,559
quantity incoming reports after foster
program is ok as well hey

382
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,740
a a you know

383
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:02,530
up by a factor of any maybe 45 in this
case

384
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:06,500
I'm the point being you should learn
from these programs because you've been

385
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,240
some bugs

386
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,659
that will enable you to make these safer
but don't do surgery for house in order

387
00:23:10,659 --> 00:23:13,049
you need to have enough stuff on hand

388
00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:17,260
to handle a five times increase in the
incoming low

389
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:20,530
of bugs that such as the sending in I
mean

390
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:24,190
it's fine said to get a huge number bugs
in but there's any benefit to use a few

391
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:24,720
of them I'm

392
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,720
out the trash can fix them

393
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,149
I'm just a underline the point when we
launched the

394
00:23:31,149 --> 00:23:34,220
program for Google web sites the spike
is

395
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:38,260
signif was significantly larger actually
that's actually represent the times

396
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:41,770
10 spike in numbering coming reports

397
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:46,359
and weekday know for sure why was
awaiting hands on me so well

398
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:50,270
its its kind of lower-cost eventually
for such a stocking and trying to find

399
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:50,940
excess

400
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:54,450
website and is too can find the memory
corruption in a browser

401
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:57,490
get as a definite times 10 spiking
coming late here

402
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:01,190
and backed off that to a level that is

403
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:04,820
something like four to five times the
level of incoming reports that we have

404
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,639
before launching

405
00:24:05,639 --> 00:24:09,599
the web program so do lunch program

406
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:16,599
DB where before you do so what you're
getting yourself in for

407
00:24:18,099 --> 00:24:21,220
I did see a little mouse cursor whizzing
around my

408
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:25,200
Maya displayed on here and corresponding
without the button doesn't work I know

409
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,530
if anyone is able t

410
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:30,639
manually next light for me

411
00:24:30,639 --> 00:24:34,379
second biggest ones worth forty dollars
twice as much as the first but I think

412
00:24:34,379 --> 00:24:36,260
because it this is actually a

413
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:39,629
last year much more serious dos

414
00:24:39,629 --> 00:24:46,629
to have anyone working this

415
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:08,279
between them to get back is forwarded

416
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:18,970
no effect

417
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:28,480
is nothing and is an exciting doesn't
work

418
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,730
given a bit how much like to fix this I
can take an inline question if anyone

419
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:52,710
has anything so far

420
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:58,269
yes I'd love to go back a couple slices

421
00:25:58,269 --> 00:26:05,269
shows the question is

422
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:14,159
um what are the categories a bugs we
have on

423
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,779
and we ranked by severity ranging from
low to critical

424
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:25,049
with medium and high in the middle and
I'm sorta some textual descriptions

425
00:26:25,049 --> 00:26:25,580
published

426
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,299
that sort of say what what each which
but represents

427
00:26:29,299 --> 00:26:32,419
at the top level critical it sends you
are single pack my

428
00:26:32,419 --> 00:26:38,240
of mice the local user account we have
many of those because of some books

429
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,250
a lot of fucks a the next level bounced
high severity

430
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:45,080
in fact the majority of and
high-spirited bags essentially

431
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:49,779
possible or probable code execution but
insight confined within the bounds of

432
00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:50,480
the samples

433
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,929
still a very serious condition but
someone with one of those bugs has to

434
00:26:53,929 --> 00:26:55,690
then passed out at the same box in the
nation

435
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:59,860
I'm mediums of a casual something is not
quite bad enough to be high

436
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:04,259
but is it wasn't like and lace arguments
about that were not particularly worried

437
00:27:04,259 --> 00:27:04,720
about

438
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:11,490
but is technically a security for them

439
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:15,429
so

440
00:27:15,429 --> 00:27:18,549
already on for the an EMT results so on

441
00:27:18,549 --> 00:27:23,179
we had entry and unknown entry hack

442
00:27:23,179 --> 00:27:26,509
hat or fascinator this this time which
are not met him but I names

443
00:27:26,509 --> 00:27:29,590
keep that tracking of and he should have
live tweeting his

444
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:33,429
his ongoing battle with opinion entry
and his

445
00:27:33,429 --> 00:27:37,080
and his rising and tumbling fortunes
trying to get something to work

446
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,720
am then we see this one only happens in
these competitions is you

447
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,740
you give such as a bunch latest and say

448
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:48,190
to give you much money come up with this
and they all all investors such as go

449
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:48,659
away

450
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:52,450
spend much time trying to get something
going and

451
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:56,519
there by the time it was something works
or they went on a

452
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:59,889
misconception that if you don't end up
no one tried

453
00:27:59,889 --> 00:28:04,600
that saps not the case lot of people try
and just don't get something working

454
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,870
I mean if if you think it's not working
so I gonna come upon stations and sweat

455
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:09,740
a little bit and say I can't do that I
can't do it

456
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:14,279
so so as I see the peace that indicated

457
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:18,419
sorta life tweet is non entry and which
and dispels known and

458
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:22,809
miss I covered I said it's getting it's
more detail on

459
00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:26,679
on that he had if your gonna break

460
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:30,940
into a somewhat browser any one way to
do it is two bucks

461
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:34,269
you dedicate XD inside the sandbox in
any

462
00:28:34,269 --> 00:28:38,889
at another pot busts are the same box on
busting out some boxes for the orange

463
00:28:38,889 --> 00:28:39,679
thing of that

464
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:45,029
and era as 10 very popular where you
might go about trying to do that is

465
00:28:45,029 --> 00:28:48,299
is find a park in the underlying
operating system panel if you can

466
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:51,350
if you cannot get to rescue inside the
kernel

467
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:54,519
all some boxing bets are off save eat at

468
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:57,519
did have and drive a vulnerability I'm

469
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:02,139
he's actually yes we just a backup it
well

470
00:29:02,139 --> 00:29:05,370
before we on a before as we don't spank
him we

471
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:09,240
carefully documented the exact laptop
model was going to be used to pay him

472
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,309
and that was in response to feedback
from pan am one people

473
00:29:12,309 --> 00:29:15,710
Pinkie Pie in fact after penny ones as
well

474
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:19,200
if you just told me what what laptop you
can use I could have gone after the

475
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,720
GP driver fine and one exact GP had
machine and said you know you can be

476
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,350
easily made me of something else

477
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:29,659
using means that always based on his win
in pain and one

478
00:29:29,659 --> 00:29:33,100
but anyway the point was taken so we
said that laptop model

479
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:36,309
can teach companion to and keep it
probably looked at what

480
00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:39,649
once driver had any and went after that

481
00:29:39,649 --> 00:29:44,619
I guess one postulation you can make is
that the quality of the party either

482
00:29:44,619 --> 00:29:45,730
shipped with Windows might be

483
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:50,419
lower them the colin is timely self in
this case

484
00:29:50,419 --> 00:29:53,759
he was right he he found

485
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:57,309
Park and drivers IOC to lynn
fermentation

486
00:29:57,309 --> 00:30:03,110
and it led to led to these messages from
the keys on Twitter

487
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:06,279
this message for these messages

488
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:09,369
if I know that is unfortunately his
kennel o'day

489
00:30:09,369 --> 00:30:14,169
didn't work inside the crime some books
um reason for that is

490
00:30:14,169 --> 00:30:18,720
wanting some boxes do is they want as
they limit limit the handles you can

491
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,539
open all

492
00:30:19,539 --> 00:30:23,480
William capabilities handles once you've
opened them and that was sufficient in

493
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,119
this case

494
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:27,779
sometimes I'm a position in this case to
prevent him from running

495
00:30:27,779 --> 00:30:32,399
this buggy helpful code inside examples
however

496
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:35,840
it was hoped because me this year

497
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,460
impending to what's new is we're paying
out possible rewards for people who have

498
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,169
a

499
00:30:40,169 --> 00:30:44,679
a partial explicit safety get to rescue
inside some books but never quite break

500
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:45,179
out of it

501
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:48,929
that's worth apostle same

502
00:30:48,929 --> 00:30:54,700
not to worry heat up the other half is
to patching

503
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,980
I regrettably is in Flash and

504
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:01,369
we just gonna second flash rampage
different to the first batch rampage

505
00:31:01,369 --> 00:31:02,909
that with that was covered earlier

506
00:31:02,909 --> 00:31:06,710
and that second class rampage

507
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:10,330
court the same bug the he had was was
fun to use

508
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:15,269
and M the key to is displeased

509
00:31:15,269 --> 00:31:21,789
however thanks to penny ante something
interesting time if this

510
00:31:21,789 --> 00:31:24,940
the the broken drive about nikita

511
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:28,399
you don't have his fingers and germanium
so he thought he was just opens in a day

512
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:31,909
so we've got a nice really interesting
but with has been published

513
00:31:31,909 --> 00:31:34,919
as the link to the pastebin describing
the bug

514
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:38,100
kinda interesting if your defenders
particularly useful to see

515
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,659
people going off turn how what about the
other end party drivers

516
00:31:41,659 --> 00:31:44,809
so I see this is a as a win for penny
into

517
00:31:44,809 --> 00:31:48,409
you know shaken out of without paying
anything shake-out if I can the broken

518
00:31:48,409 --> 00:31:53,889
one straight

519
00:31:53,889 --> 00:31:57,590
nikita am I graciously finished by

520
00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:01,289
asking someone should save me by
dropping elite elite exploit

521
00:32:01,289 --> 00:32:05,809
the penny into with with the point being
that my talk with a 40 ended by now to

522
00:32:05,809 --> 00:32:06,399
an extent

523
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:10,100
if they're have been an EMT entries

524
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:14,730
so enter Pinkie Pie we have a confirm
sixty thousand dollar wins think it by

525
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:18,409
I am is the second time he's done that

526
00:32:18,409 --> 00:32:22,659
guys become a legend this image here is
the

527
00:32:22,659 --> 00:32:26,359
image that appeared on the laptop on the
pain one competition

528
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:29,769
as exploit worked I'm scariest

529
00:32:29,769 --> 00:32:33,100
stack trace your laptop to to see if the
painting work in this

530
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:36,460
jumps out at you this is the second
sixty thousand dollar when this year

531
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:41,990
a hundred and twenty thousand dollars
just companion wins for the

532
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:45,809
Anza or somewhere very happy have him

533
00:32:45,809 --> 00:32:50,309
have and having heard him answer again

534
00:32:50,309 --> 00:32:54,299
so a obviously we nasa confirms this is
in the

535
00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:58,399
the first confirmation of the when we
actually confirm the win

536
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:02,899
earlier sort of last night assimilation
time we confirmed the wind by

537
00:33:02,899 --> 00:33:06,019
actually being a patch that closes

538
00:33:06,019 --> 00:33:09,019
the halls he used album release a patch
we we

539
00:33:09,019 --> 00:33:12,669
announced neighbor wats without actually
re: states further

540
00:33:12,669 --> 00:33:16,779
crime up the crime accident acted a
sixty thousand dollar reward

541
00:33:16,779 --> 00:33:20,039
for Pinkie Pie

542
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:23,609
I am kinda pleased with the time it took
to get the patch out

543
00:33:23,609 --> 00:33:27,990
we we saw the we'd like to sort of push
ourselves when we can so we set

544
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:28,690
ourselves

545
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:32,539
an informal goal of being foster than

546
00:33:32,539 --> 00:33:36,029
releasing a patch fast and needed for
pain the pentium want competition

547
00:33:36,029 --> 00:33:40,590
anyone was less than 24 hours as in just
lessons and frost penny

548
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:43,600
to use a about about 10 around I'm

549
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,919
putting on extra help help by the time
zone difference here

550
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:51,100
so what happened is we sort of received
the explicit 2 p.m. local time

551
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:54,500
um handed it off to of what we call home
team's

552
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,869
team back in California as approaching
about 10 p.m.

553
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:01,460
11 p.m. and then

554
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:04,510
barrister maybe so but drinking was the
home team is sort of sweating it out

555
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:08,119
midnight of the Hyundai back back in
California

556
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:11,419
over thinking of them there in spirit so

557
00:34:11,419 --> 00:34:16,700
and that they they dealt with the box on

558
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,520
checked in and kicked off of the
automated stuff that tells you if you

559
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,500
fixed it correctly

560
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,168
without regressing anything and they
went slapped and then they got up the

561
00:34:23,169 --> 00:34:24,760
next morning

562
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:28,510
and they have not run it said yes so
good and then they they released

563
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:32,389
8 a.m. also Mountain View time midnight
also malaysian Prime

564
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:36,950
said if we use Malaysian times a
benchmark gotta send a patch of peace

565
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,299
with

566
00:34:38,299 --> 00:34:42,429
I'm and it wasn't even a real emergency
I the term

567
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:46,730
o'day is misused by law if we if back is
working

568
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:49,970
a that's a reload a by Nikita he's a
real

569
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:54,409
old days when the first time vendor his
about a bug

570
00:34:54,409 --> 00:34:58,900
is if 8 you know uses being exploited
unexpectedly or if someone drops

571
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:02,790
something on full disclosure
unexpectedly its own get your private

572
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:06,260
notification of a bug without telling
the world

573
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:11,040
exploiting anyone and that on a day

574
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,359
butts not a real emergency but we do not
get the engines test-fire

575
00:35:14,359 --> 00:35:17,330
you know what if one day we do get a
real emergency it's good to know what

576
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:19,150
sort of response time we

577
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:22,540
automated infrastructure that's what
does the bills and the test

578
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:25,630
and the packaging up and and all that
stuff it does

579
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:29,210
a complicated up what's how what's the
minimum time

580
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:32,599
that we get that's a run in so that one
if and when we do get a real emergency

581
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:33,839
we can

582
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:37,220
we can protect people very quickly are
automatic update

583
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:42,260
so liking engines test for

584
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:47,330
some some pictures so this picture was
taken from behind the Google desk

585
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:52,880
has the entry was coming in the paint
entries coming in so

586
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,990
they sponsor

587
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:02,049
says product managers laptop screen here
I thought I could make out instant

588
00:36:02,049 --> 00:36:07,510
access his email so I plant that out

589
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:10,650
%uh Pinkie Pie wasn't here on site so

590
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:14,660
party at a friends here which is good
because he was able to and by proxy

591
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:18,770
by this fenders enables except the rules
on his behalf send us the

592
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:22,210
the link which we then checked looked

593
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:26,230
pretty legit so we sent off for home
team formal validation

594
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:30,470
sensing things in speeches me here have
sort of

595
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:33,420
so they've got a beautiful evening going
away from the laptop is if there's

596
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:38,799
role-playing it's coming out on the
screen

597
00:36:38,799 --> 00:36:42,630
this guy here I don't have palaces in
the audience friend of mine

598
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:46,660
works for Adobe and as a little tear on
his face not sure if you can

599
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:50,359
you can tell from where way looking and
is what he's thinking

600
00:36:50,359 --> 00:36:56,859
and it was not in Flash

601
00:36:56,859 --> 00:37:01,499
and I just didn't

602
00:37:01,499 --> 00:37:05,509
any photo of the situation is going down
and he randomly picked this one

603
00:37:05,509 --> 00:37:09,499
occurred to me that a my 40s on says
property of

604
00:37:09,499 --> 00:37:12,669
Annapolis Rd the property thank you by
Cassius

605
00:37:12,669 --> 00:37:15,749
to he things crime pretty hard

606
00:37:15,749 --> 00:37:20,699
and I'm responsible for crimes property
think by and sand dollar signs appeared

607
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:22,579
this guy's at

608
00:37:22,579 --> 00:37:27,259
is although it took a while to to send
to the home team to confirm you know he

609
00:37:27,259 --> 00:37:27,880
kinda you

610
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:34,459
Israel with enough yeah it was real this
is the home team refer to the home team

611
00:37:34,459 --> 00:37:35,279
quite a lot so

612
00:37:35,279 --> 00:37:38,459
with the away team

613
00:37:38,459 --> 00:37:42,439
we have it easy Lisa sit behind to beat
a bitch some researchers maybe

614
00:37:42,439 --> 00:37:45,959
is it /url in a browser as the extent of
the hard work we have to do

615
00:37:45,959 --> 00:37:51,319
on a drinking where's the home team have
to do the hard work which is

616
00:37:51,319 --> 00:37:54,709
decompose the exploit into the citron
pieces

617
00:37:54,709 --> 00:37:59,469
find some to fix each piece get each
piece fix that stuff can be hard to do

618
00:37:59,469 --> 00:38:05,019
and how r tricky the bug is find time to
review the fix

619
00:38:05,019 --> 00:38:08,539
you know if your 1i for the fix is
correct so

620
00:38:08,539 --> 00:38:11,900
area superstars nothing to back in
sewing

621
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:15,279
probably its it's way beyond midnight
local time California

622
00:38:15,279 --> 00:38:20,039
but on said

623
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:23,249
such Justin she may know his name is
written 31

624
00:38:23,249 --> 00:38:26,979
book amongst the security community
havin fun I'm

625
00:38:26,979 --> 00:38:30,089
and has already smilgis

626
00:38:30,089 --> 00:38:37,089
smiling even though he's got a lot of
work to do if by so this is a picture a

627
00:38:39,249 --> 00:38:39,739
laptop

628
00:38:39,739 --> 00:38:46,089
and this is the laptop that was pained
by by the pinky I explain take

629
00:38:46,089 --> 00:38:50,099
likes so you can see but we've written
on it and by Pinkie Pie

630
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:54,309
penny into 18 seriously removal signed
it

631
00:38:54,309 --> 00:38:58,630
and this we said today laptop to the
charity auction which is going on I

632
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:59,749
think shortly after this

633
00:38:59,749 --> 00:39:05,179
stalk ends to appease history the
laptops about six hundred dollars worth

634
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:09,489
maybe assigning it is raised for you
lower the value for defacement

635
00:39:09,489 --> 00:39:15,589
I'm we've actually left the effective
the x-play on laptop so the

636
00:39:15,589 --> 00:39:19,189
expert to demonstrate had you naked had
for the machine

637
00:39:19,189 --> 00:39:22,259
drop to file on the desktop striking

638
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:25,449
stopped as a freshman this seven install
has a current logo and a

639
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:32,069
a final in this top called simply lolzz
and

640
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:35,859
I at this will increase the value of the
laptop or not but I am

641
00:39:35,859 --> 00:39:39,169
probably DX placed in the cash

642
00:39:39,169 --> 00:39:42,779
his laptop you know we visited /url
browser's cache

643
00:39:42,779 --> 00:39:46,400
girls depending on the cash in hand is
that they they get from the site

644
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,319
they the expert comes from say you maybe
have to get a copy of the explain

645
00:39:50,319 --> 00:39:53,709
cat we actually applied the patch to the

646
00:39:53,709 --> 00:39:57,359
to the laptop before handing it over for
charity so you actually immune against

647
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:57,919
his

648
00:39:57,919 --> 00:40:03,609
sex but if you if you get his laptop
however the exploit me so instinct due

649
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:04,749
to reasons we guarantee

650
00:40:04,749 --> 00:40:09,369
surely said or something about getting
an expert in yesterday

651
00:40:09,369 --> 00:40:12,489
action the same days I can talk about it
in more detail today

652
00:40:12,489 --> 00:40:16,179
I must be cool I love giving out details

653
00:40:16,179 --> 00:40:19,390
I can give up too many details because

654
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:24,589
African out to me details actually
better the bug is actually on the boxes

655
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:26,759
in WebKit now oversees used by

656
00:40:26,759 --> 00:40:29,890
almost every small thing on the planet
and

657
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:32,949
passing finds a bit slow and passionate
browser so

658
00:40:32,949 --> 00:40:37,089
you know maybe you can buy the laptop
nice one day exploit could one day

659
00:40:37,089 --> 00:40:38,089
exploit because

660
00:40:38,089 --> 00:40:41,489
has limited lifetime because the patched

661
00:40:41,489 --> 00:40:44,689
I thought that but certain

662
00:40:44,689 --> 00:40:48,609
love devices have so this these are the
faces

663
00:40:48,609 --> 00:40:52,229
think by went through to you to to get
the win

664
00:40:52,229 --> 00:40:58,099
say overall the rick is gone is he's got
good excuse inside the same box and then

665
00:40:58,099 --> 00:41:01,630
another bullet yeah December so phase 1a

666
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:05,189
gotta find a park inside the render some
boxing executions

667
00:41:05,189 --> 00:41:09,409
December it was a bug in a an SVG
scalable vector graphics

668
00:41:09,409 --> 00:41:13,900
on use of the free upper house as a

669
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:17,420
expert having love use after free in
them so that you no surprise there

670
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:21,429
we actually had a rafter SPG fix in the
office

671
00:41:21,429 --> 00:41:25,269
I'm so we can object that the SPG spec

672
00:41:25,269 --> 00:41:29,299
already specified you stack so just just
a just so short

673
00:41:29,299 --> 00:41:34,219
forecast exploiters from I'm doing hard
work with just at a free tack to the

674
00:41:34,219 --> 00:41:37,289
to the spec and then you know by
ordering their the free

675
00:41:37,289 --> 00:41:40,420
before the ease you can save it

676
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:44,150
people a bunch of time

677
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:48,359
one thing to note is that a speaking of
having a rafter species of 23 bucks if

678
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:50,829
you go back a couple have used in
September 2010

679
00:41:50,829 --> 00:41:54,759
and look at our lease nights on our
business blog

680
00:41:54,759 --> 00:41:58,239
couple releases back to back on a stable
channel I think this is

681
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:03,619
think crime 6 was stable at that time in
history went out to crime

682
00:42:03,619 --> 00:42:08,769
22 busy but I think in baton from six we
were

683
00:42:08,769 --> 00:42:13,569
paying out for such as sending us as
would use of the free books

684
00:42:13,569 --> 00:42:16,659
so one astute individual is it visionary

685
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:20,880
and happy to comment on a blog posts I
think his name

686
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,859
handle missed it is just NC Spc

687
00:42:24,859 --> 00:42:28,920
and looking at the trend he saw here he
observed

688
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,089
predicted the SPG module will make you
go bankrupt

689
00:42:32,089 --> 00:42:36,219
on we're not quite yet that yet but
we're sixty thousand dollars place at

690
00:42:36,219 --> 00:42:37,459
which is

691
00:42:37,459 --> 00:42:40,979
the biggest step we've got closer to
bankruptcy virus PG

692
00:42:40,979 --> 00:42:44,959
yet

693
00:42:44,959 --> 00:42:49,339
so we found a bug it's a nice
nice-looking use of two free

694
00:42:49,339 --> 00:42:52,739
in SVG in WebKit am

695
00:42:52,739 --> 00:42:56,609
but a bug this annex with a very
different things and that's affected him

696
00:42:56,609 --> 00:43:01,239
in the value we pay for expert's opinion
to sixty thousand dollars verses

697
00:43:01,239 --> 00:43:04,689
get back in SPG would now BB

698
00:43:04,689 --> 00:43:07,709
3 three to five thousand dollars and how

699
00:43:07,709 --> 00:43:12,009
nasty say the big difference that's
because

700
00:43:12,009 --> 00:43:15,759
10 a bug in the next play requires lot
of specialized experience

701
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:20,219
quite difficult to me time-consuming
second-hand

702
00:43:20,219 --> 00:43:23,689
total pink I spent about a month working
on this

703
00:43:23,689 --> 00:43:28,509
I'm sure finding the bug was a small
part about this is analyzing it

704
00:43:28,509 --> 00:43:31,999
so out on issues of different execution
so

705
00:43:31,999 --> 00:43:36,709
on

706
00:43:36,709 --> 00:43:41,119
a bit like this it is not going on this
diagram Amazon's working now so I'll try

707
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,719
find sales down so the names of these

708
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:47,929
objects have been changed to protect the
innocent

709
00:43:47,929 --> 00:43:51,269
so got going on here is a go an
objective type SPG which

710
00:43:51,269 --> 00:43:54,579
parent has a point 30 an SPG widget

711
00:43:54,579 --> 00:43:58,650
and use of indicated such that

712
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:02,150
as that this SPG widget gets fried but
to disguise

713
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:06,429
apparently kept kept a pointer to this
object is free

714
00:44:06,429 --> 00:44:09,799
so have a good use after free in the
browser

715
00:44:09,799 --> 00:44:13,059
one of the properties have is that you
as the attack to get to an arbitrary

716
00:44:13,059 --> 00:44:13,880
JavaScript

717
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:17,639
between the free use and what you can do
was running out of a job

718
00:44:17,639 --> 00:44:20,969
you can arrange for an object of your
choice to get allocated

719
00:44:20,969 --> 00:44:25,569
in defeat slot so this guy thinks he's
pointing to one of these

720
00:44:25,569 --> 00:44:28,609
but actually explains why the switch is
it any different type of object that the

721
00:44:28,609 --> 00:44:30,019
attack it uses

722
00:44:30,019 --> 00:44:33,789
to see needs and a very good type:
object to choose the attackers

723
00:44:33,789 --> 00:44:38,119
something called the rape for some Sep
you like a strange sequence bites

724
00:44:38,119 --> 00:44:45,059
use the attacker can control despite sry
downright

725
00:44:45,059 --> 00:44:52,059
I'm so what he did is he

726
00:44:53,069 --> 00:44:57,880
is he he lined up this array pointer in
length

727
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:01,079
in the values teach he controls

728
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:06,089
with values in here so that so this guy
is reading an array

729
00:45:06,089 --> 00:45:09,569
from 0.74 by the attack Anna

730
00:45:09,569 --> 00:45:12,939
that's that's pretty serious but
normally

731
00:45:12,939 --> 00:45:16,329
that when defeat I as a lot because if
you just

732
00:45:16,329 --> 00:45:21,139
guess around the address es la chance of
going to be mapped over his map monthly

733
00:45:21,139 --> 00:45:25,069
what you think it is so to defeat Nassau

734
00:45:25,069 --> 00:45:28,639
pink bicycle trick that we me to do
something about that as a

735
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:31,949
as an issue in Windows seven where
there's a

736
00:45:31,949 --> 00:45:35,719
yes our patient sir particular system
object to

737
00:45:35,719 --> 00:45:39,469
particularly consistent location so

738
00:45:39,469 --> 00:45:42,549
that's unknown address he pointed
pointed to that and that

739
00:45:42,549 --> 00:45:46,119
if your primitive where you can stop
reading

740
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:48,900
what's in that system object not
system.object things point is other

741
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:51,619
things like the heap and eventually

742
00:45:51,619 --> 00:45:55,099
let's keep losing memory and these are
the things you need to stop Rob chain

743
00:45:55,099 --> 00:45:55,849
which is that

744
00:45:55,849 --> 00:45:59,679
the modern way have getting around at
nasa law

745
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:03,199
I'm know a star chain is

746
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:07,569
your 7 overlap here between the freedom
project in the object we control which

747
00:46:07,569 --> 00:46:12,139
his virtual pointer so

748
00:46:12,139 --> 00:46:18,699
on Steve use this problem it ascertain
the occasional the code in memory

749
00:46:18,699 --> 00:46:22,699
you can set up a veto pointer that
points to the table the points to you

750
00:46:22,699 --> 00:46:29,699
to it Cup instructions iraq change

751
00:46:29,849 --> 00:46:32,969
just one more thing it's worth noting
here

752
00:46:32,969 --> 00:46:36,229
instant check that was used is

753
00:46:36,229 --> 00:46:39,499
your activities him talk about it been
this guy

754
00:46:39,499 --> 00:46:43,069
reading content that week specified

755
00:46:43,069 --> 00:46:47,309
if no se port method on this guy
JavaScript that will cause

756
00:46:47,309 --> 00:46:50,939
a right into into the streets but which

757
00:46:50,939 --> 00:46:54,249
at C's becomes a right into the object
we control the rape of a

758
00:46:54,249 --> 00:46:57,889
advances rape of you can be back written
value

759
00:46:57,889 --> 00:47:00,929
if that was a pointer that would be
another way to defeat a slower in this

760
00:47:00,929 --> 00:47:03,569
case the sex but it wasn't a point it
was just a

761
00:47:03,569 --> 00:47:07,159
a static value that static values used
in next week sort of

762
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:10,529
scam through Holt on these are a bus to
find me

763
00:47:10,529 --> 00:47:14,809
to find the exact one had been allocated
on top of this feat slot

764
00:47:14,809 --> 00:47:21,809
and I made expert reliable

765
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:30,359
and I think covered this I'm not sure
how we'll know in this

766
00:47:30,499 --> 00:47:33,729
es la bypass is that was used

767
00:47:33,729 --> 00:47:38,809
on that was used with 27 as predictable
object location

768
00:47:38,809 --> 00:47:42,799
at the system level on its claim on
think if I it's the second time is used

769
00:47:42,799 --> 00:47:44,409
it so and kicking ourselves for

770
00:47:44,409 --> 00:47:48,519
for not thinking of a waiter force
windows to do something a bit different

771
00:47:48,519 --> 00:47:53,439
with up-to-date it's very difficult as a
guy smiling

772
00:47:53,439 --> 00:47:58,709
disease he looked at this we hear that I

773
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:02,919
its allegedly fixed in Windows 8 a few
Japan Ian

774
00:48:02,919 --> 00:48:06,439
if there is one properties when is a
tumour see if was chill

775
00:48:06,439 --> 00:48:10,049
think if I comes up with next I'm it's
worth noting actually

776
00:48:10,049 --> 00:48:14,069
Adam crime moment is coming 32-bit
process you get

777
00:48:14,069 --> 00:48:18,749
much better Aslan 64-bit um to an extent

778
00:48:18,749 --> 00:48:23,439
tournament as a definitely you do so
they'll probably be a 64-bit Windows

779
00:48:23,439 --> 00:48:24,289
version a crime

780
00:48:24,289 --> 00:48:27,449
motivated by good 64 as long and as a
which

781
00:48:27,449 --> 00:48:33,709
is going production same course on thats
phase one base

782
00:48:33,709 --> 00:48:37,099
now after they all this we have to
execution

783
00:48:37,099 --> 00:48:40,509
inside crime some books so

784
00:48:40,509 --> 00:48:44,519
the options you can't act kinda like we
discussed earlier like Nicki

785
00:48:44,519 --> 00:48:48,849
as a rock in office trying another thing
even the

786
00:48:48,849 --> 00:48:52,489
is you can attack the part of crime
itself when you're inside a sandbox you

787
00:48:52,489 --> 00:48:53,239
typically need

788
00:48:53,239 --> 00:48:56,299
services provided to you by something
with high privilege

789
00:48:56,299 --> 00:48:59,479
for example what if a website

790
00:48:59,479 --> 00:49:02,539
prompt you to upload a file I'm inside
the some books

791
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:06,219
site crime some books least he certainly
conscious read-option files of this

792
00:49:06,219 --> 00:49:09,939
say unita ask things to do

793
00:49:09,939 --> 00:49:13,649
correcting ft need to ask the privilege
and to

794
00:49:13,649 --> 00:49:18,109
ask the user to pick a file up late
obviously if he

795
00:49:18,109 --> 00:49:21,259
if the some boxed taken just say on this
file

796
00:49:21,259 --> 00:49:25,139
provision said Hugo and that we have a
samples

797
00:49:25,139 --> 00:49:28,579
so that's a pink ID he

798
00:49:28,579 --> 00:49:32,429
attack somebody's message is that flow
between some box code and

799
00:49:32,429 --> 00:49:35,719
the untrusted side and the trusted site
which is the

800
00:49:35,719 --> 00:49:39,029
which is the site is a privilege is the
content

801
00:49:39,029 --> 00:49:42,229
making files read files right files
flight services say

802
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:47,249
you after the semantics knots and
tactics if one of its in tactics that

803
00:49:47,249 --> 00:49:47,829
would be sorta

804
00:49:47,829 --> 00:49:51,299
be fitting some some fields of the
binding protocol between

805
00:49:51,299 --> 00:49:54,969
the the intestine trusted site but it
didn't after that probably because

806
00:49:54,969 --> 00:49:56,639
that's been fussed fairly well

807
00:49:56,639 --> 00:50:01,439
however the semantics you've got quite a
large number of different messages

808
00:50:01,439 --> 00:50:06,199
which you can which you can try and
trick if you like to doing something

809
00:50:06,199 --> 00:50:11,709
shouldn't be able to do so what finish
complexity

810
00:50:11,709 --> 00:50:18,709
it Pinkie Pie used to bust out at the
same box unfortunately even a message

811
00:50:19,029 --> 00:50:20,349
where you could just say

812
00:50:20,349 --> 00:50:24,569
tell a trusted and can hear some bites
can you write them to this file please

813
00:50:24,569 --> 00:50:28,159
on and that is that's not ideal

814
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:33,119
kidding ourselves about that one we
think it's just bad it deserves multiple

815
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:33,789
mean Jen's

816
00:50:33,789 --> 00:50:38,539
so another way of putting it is United
and always write files based on trust my

817
00:50:38,539 --> 00:50:39,599
PC messages

818
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:44,099
if we do we're gonna trust the file
pacifying and the content of the file

819
00:50:44,099 --> 00:50:48,999
am yes we from if that message and in or
that was undertaken to make sure

820
00:50:48,999 --> 00:50:53,079
and will continue to be taken an ongoing
managed to make sure that you think make

821
00:50:53,079 --> 00:50:53,529
a mistake

822
00:50:53,529 --> 00:50:57,049
again save money but much

823
00:50:57,049 --> 00:51:00,089
time left: as we doing crime into
security is still possible to make

824
00:51:00,089 --> 00:51:00,639
stakes

825
00:51:00,639 --> 00:51:04,059
but that's why we have pentium um I it's

826
00:51:04,059 --> 00:51:06,719
I think sixty thousand dollars is a
reasonable price to pay to have that

827
00:51:06,719 --> 00:51:07,279
gone

828
00:51:07,279 --> 00:51:13,669
and with that have about 10 minutes left
according to this thing here

829
00:51:13,669 --> 00:51:17,479
love to answer any questions you have

830
00:51:17,479 --> 00:51:21,369
so how does

831
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:25,539
writing if i'd give code execution how
does what you could rescue

832
00:51:25,539 --> 00:51:29,649
writing the file %uh the question is how
does writing focused execution

833
00:51:29,649 --> 00:51:34,209
on you can pic i think is not a right
but specifically

834
00:51:34,209 --> 00:51:38,099
and overwrite primitive so I

835
00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:42,409
with so the process doing this right at
the medium integrity double

836
00:51:42,409 --> 00:51:45,719
which is basically on some boxed and you
can ask it to write

837
00:51:45,719 --> 00:51:49,219
to any file save presumably overwrite

838
00:51:49,219 --> 00:51:54,169
friend sexy insulation able to do that
right any far

839
00:51:54,169 --> 00:51:58,359
medium integrity level it's game over we
didn't we

840
00:51:58,359 --> 00:52:02,029
in both look into it just awarded win
sixty thousand dollars

841
00:52:02,029 --> 00:52:05,219
facepalm facepalm Dos Equis guy

842
00:52:05,219 --> 00:52:09,199
although the engines came out i think im
ganzen tells a Google Base miss actually

843
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:10,229
I think

844
00:52:10,229 --> 00:52:13,519
share and I'll

845
00:52:13,519 --> 00:52:20,519
now exxon any more questions

846
00:52:22,209 --> 00:52:25,349
no more questions

847
00:52:25,349 --> 00:52:32,349
then let's give him a big close

848
00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:40,430
thank you

849
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,910
ok

850
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:44,990
this

851
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:45,650
this

852
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:52,650
sleep
