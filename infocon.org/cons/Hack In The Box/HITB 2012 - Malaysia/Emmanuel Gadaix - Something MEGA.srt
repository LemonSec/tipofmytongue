1
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,480
up

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,900
space

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,810
space

4
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:20,810
skills

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,910
good afternoon this is my second speech
at the che tebe

6
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,640
this time I made one yesterday which was
more serious security

7
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,449
and obviously more popular today's just
dies

8
00:00:37,449 --> 00:00:40,890
a very serious I'm just going to talk
but others may go good story for those

9
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:41,830
who are interested

10
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:45,970
I'll give you a few insights about this
is a case talk about

11
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:52,010
what the plan is those guys since I have
and pre

12
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,879
worsened injury case user legal story
you can ask via

13
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:00,059
any questions you want I'm so everything
started

14
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:03,960
a long time ago in 2005 actually

15
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,420
yep in 2005 going on here

16
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,030
good input to rewind feature now

17
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:17,479
it is stable okay I'm now

18
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:24,479
me doing that right technical help

19
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:41,980
by any wealth talking you probably all
heard about

20
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:46,000
megaupload which was created in 2005

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,430
by befriends were actually wanted to
answer

22
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:53,550
very specific problem is hideaway send
large files

23
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:58,000
by email you know the Internet became
popular in the late 90's and

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,850
is nearly 2,000 people was trying to
send big stuff

25
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,940
it became a serious problem occurring
excellent

26
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,080
its

27
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,390
the year and at the time

28
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,550
there was no Dropbox it was my Google
Drive was

29
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:19,650
no easy way to actually share large

30
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:24,420
file so it was an instant success that
it basically spawned an entire industry

31
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,440
that was already some other players like

32
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,630
wreckage in the field in the SoCal cyber
locker feel and

33
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:35,670
and it was so popular that every time
they added new servers and new band was

34
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,860
it was immediately

35
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,960
saturated so that was definitely a huge
demand

36
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,630
for people to be able to share large
files in easy way

37
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,930
bypassing emails or is the old way of
applauding

38
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:51,620
FTP server and things like that I'm
going to dominate this

39
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,860
the launch the streaming service which
was

40
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:59,070
one of the first one obviously YouTube
was already but at the time you too the

41
00:02:59,070 --> 00:02:59,910
quality was

42
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,970
for and you could only applaud small
files

43
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:07,720
megavideo try to is the best possible
player

44
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,020
allow you to a little salsa files I'm

45
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,239
and then is a they carry on with this
success always increasing the bandwidth

46
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,400
and storage

47
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,840
icing by by the end they had something

48
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,520
in the region of eighty petabytes of
storage

49
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:26,920
and almost 2 terabytes habits of Bend
Wis

50
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,980
nozzles numbers problems to you but they
are huge

51
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:35,590
me I was using more Ben with largest
internet exchange in Europe

52
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,739
I'm and of course

53
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:41,800
few services were long

54
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,060
maybe the authorities also has a
copyright Matthew I didn't like

55
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:51,829
we were talking to artist to produce and
directly on the Internet so make a box

56
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:52,540
for example

57
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:56,680
initiative to a little parties to
produce territories and music

58
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,079
website and keep ninety percent of the
revenue which

59
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:04,130
obviously is different from the business
model loves in PA

60
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:07,570
are hi with take muscles a profit

61
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:10,780
limited distribution rights and all
sorts of constrained

62
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:16,109
going to everybody so the service was
accused of piracy

63
00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:19,410
which obviously we had some users

64
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,480
doings at and abuse fuels

65
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,110
services on the cloud seeing the
problems but for some reason they chose

66
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,560
to take down nigga

67
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,130
so they had to kinda hollywood-style
operation

68
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:36,150
19 January 2012 im Siemens Dennis lien

69
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:40,700
something like seven countries I think
as aristide people they seized Assets

70
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,260
with someone yes individuals arrayed

71
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:47,490
New Zealand the use a special tactics
group most

72
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,410
force in the police they had the copters

73
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:57,610
assault weapons and military-style thing
and the house that was taken down was

74
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,000
mostly populated by a Filipino 9

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,150
nannies children so I don't know where
this ends a

76
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:07,020
special tactics group to take him down
but anyway a

77
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,050
what happen is that the FBI

78
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:14,660
the FBI was responsible for conducting
this operation

79
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:19,420
but obviously they've been fed
information buys in PA and their cronies

80
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,020
about

81
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:24,250
megaupload trying to paint it as a
largest

82
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,320
provider of piracy whatever nonsense
they could come up with

83
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:31,970
and they'd not on these physical asset
seizures with this

84
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:35,340
sees all the bank accounts and and
corporate assets personal assets but the

85
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:35,690
rules

86
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:39,669
domains I'm sure you've heard about
doing seizures is basically

87
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:45,060
you've got a dot com the USS well they
don't really have jurisdiction over

88
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,970
technical oversight to the cans they can
see through them

89
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:52,260
and they've done that me times including

90
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,900
times where companies were completely
innocent hosting providers and stuff

91
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,380
like that

92
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,800
I'm so other domains were taking down

93
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,800
and charges were copyright infringement
of course

94
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,380
which is supposed to be protected by the
MC rules will talk about that

95
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,760
racketeering whatever that meant

96
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,680
money laundering and conspiracy to
commit criminal infringement

97
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,770
witchcraft calls charges

98
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:22,100
the funny part is that there's a
racketeering and money laundering

99
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:26,330
charges a very interesting because
actually they would put their

100
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:29,530
so the FBI could apply with schools a
Rico

101
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:33,300
charges racketeering influenced corrupt
organization

102
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,960
act which is away usually to take down
drug dealers

103
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,320
and US authorities they knew they
couldn't

104
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,180
takedown with an extra died me up with
egg sixty-some

105
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:49,500
even if they had civil case wasn't
enough mothers in

106
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,470
extradite so the poodles charges of
money laundering and racketeering

107
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,540
just to give you an example to do
something I didn't really understand

108
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,920
those charges was a cane

109
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,850
the finances of make it work pretty open
there was no secret bank account there

110
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,020
was nothing

111
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:08,720
hidden I'm so I found in very bizarre I
looked up the definition so

112
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,800
I'm money laundering you understand what
is money laundering

113
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,120
you get money from a crime and then use
it to

114
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,060
by a pack of cigarettes and that's it
you've committed money laundering

115
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,890
record during the scene is basically
financing a business with

116
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:25,990
as a business so basically in the case
of

117
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:29,860
makeup is a company I was running
megaupload was

118
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,940
racketeering because megaupload was
financing may get this

119
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:37,950
let's that's how they were able to put
those charges

120
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:41,580
which in my opinion are completely
irrelevant to the case because there was

121
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,590
nothing hidden

122
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:47,300
about megaupload so what happened rings
a bust in on that day

123
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,590
I'm there were four executives in New
Zealand there was they were already that

124
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:55,920
does come mention it was sent to jail

125
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,480
came spent months in jail in in this

126
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,890
few times math yes ramen scene where

127
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:07,010
freedom after a couple of weeks we go to

128
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:12,850
then they were assigned residence was
electronic bracelet monitoring

129
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:16,820
right to use the Internet when we
visited then we had to take

130
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:21,260
way of phones and computers et cetera
and even chisels restrictions but lifted

131
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,650
soon as is the only restriction they
have that the county museum

132
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:28,260
the other executives that were indicted
one of them is

133
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:31,300
managed to fight back to Germany where
is say from

134
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:35,890
US extradition proceedings by law and
the other two guys are in this and in

135
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,079
Slovakia

136
00:08:37,079 --> 00:08:42,240
but there's also I am over 200 employees
lost their job on that day

137
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,220
and all the media assets were seized

138
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:50,010
now you when when when I said 200

139
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:54,140
employees lost their jobs is that not
only does the job from one day to the

140
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,470
next they also

141
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:59,180
didn't get paid because authorities
seized although

142
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,700
corporate assets including the bank
accounts so we were in a position and

143
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,920
wanted to the next week

144
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,260
employees that we had to fire without
pay

145
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,410
we had to cancel the office leavin a

146
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:14,149
turned out to be a real nightmare and
BP's without

147
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:17,920
any kind of evidence we haven't been
able to to seize evidence that the US

148
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,250
government with agence

149
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:22,269
mega nothing serious has been

150
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:25,709
would forward souls there was no
presumption of innocence

151
00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:30,190
was not due process and what they did
busy they came in and they started to

152
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,230
collect all the assets

153
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:35,959
started by Kim's car collection which is

154
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:40,950

anyway

158
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:54,810
what happened this is important right
because this is

159
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:59,420
I believe she's actually something that
will be remembered

160
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:05,029
as as a landmark where the US due
process was completely

161
00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:09,420
ignored and implication for countries
that

162
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,660
that present itself as a land of the
free become a

163
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:17,009
human rights and whatever there was no
due process from the beginning

164
00:10:17,009 --> 00:10:20,899
has been irregularities in the police
paperwork has been admitted in court

165
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:22,240
certain

166
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,999
been illegal use of were typing extended
the prime minister in use even had to

167
00:10:26,999 --> 00:10:28,060
apologize to

168
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,180
Kingdom comment citizens in

169
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,430
because this by agencies a GC is BS

170
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:37,589
legally conducted wiretapping

171
00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:42,870
the Constitution forbids the asset
seizures were declared unlawful

172
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:46,399
the US as and really ruled the earth on
that but

173
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,980
the are not able to charge criminally
non-u_s_ corporate entity

174
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:56,220
and they did so this is kind of strange
right

175
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,620
I don't know if you realize the
implications of that right its

176
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:03,519
free normal that the US doesn't have
jurisdiction criminal jurisdiction

177
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,749
over non-us entities let's try to revert

178
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:11,860
this issue you mentioned that them that
US companies become criminally liable

179
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:16,420
because they commit crimes in all the
countries for example

180
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:20,709
a month the US porn industry which is
the largest in the world

181
00:11:20,709 --> 00:11:24,569
music for use pornography all the time
but this is illegal in the Middle East

182
00:11:24,569 --> 00:11:25,120
CC's

183
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,249
and as a blasphemy law right so should
the Middle East

184
00:11:28,249 --> 00:11:31,379
takedown US companies and Susie US
government

185
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:35,079
US citizens you know what I mean right
that there's something about due process

186
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:36,899
that hasn't been followed here

187
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:40,790
I'm and if the US as jurisdiction over
every company

188
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:44,509
in every country in the world and I
think it's a very scary thing

189
00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:47,910
I'm do using an extradition treaties did
not

190
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:52,610
here see the cases so that's why
extradition would probably

191
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:56,360
never work is a trying to extradite
someone

192
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,829
on charges acid

193
00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:02,970
in fact they will be extradited because
in use in

194
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:07,149
know it as there's been a lot of
collusion between the FBI and then

195
00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:08,019
países

196
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:12,029
been a lot of political influence I'm
cruised on which is a

197
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:15,180
number one lobbyist

198
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,579
in PA was in washington talking to

199
00:12:18,579 --> 00:12:22,860
a man be done about this you know they
were I don't know if you remember

200
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,339
last year they were trying to pass a
supine people's

201
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:30,709
sings wings and it was pretty vocal
about the opposition's

202
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:33,980
draconian laws and and we believe that

203
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,870
because Obama impassable knows but he
still needed the Hollywood money for

204
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:38,639
reelection

205
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,600
basically sold them me go on a platter
can offer

206
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,259
back-room deal political corruption
cronyism

207
00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:50,749
definitely an abuse of power violation
of international laws

208
00:12:50,749 --> 00:12:54,870
and let's not talk about all the users
millions of users on May guidance on the

209
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:58,249
form on this is an ex they don't have it
access to their files

210
00:12:58,249 --> 00:13:02,920
I'm which is kind of interesting private
property concept

211
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,490
which is ruling most democratic
countries has been

212
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:11,889
trample you know company's ability
failed because the Queen

213
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:17,139
files people is back couples if any
pictures the Conexus and

214
00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:20,540
the courts want free up date

215
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:24,209
the BBC you have to sue me houses
hosting provider or whatever

216
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:27,910
so they're they're really playing
hardball the Society's obviously playing

217
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:33,209
delaying tactics so the their reasoning
that the longer they wait

218
00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:36,639
more destroyed me couple will be which
is

219
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,949
logic you destroyed company could be a
fun

220
00:13:39,949 --> 00:13:43,629
usually doesn't work well for them

221
00:13:43,629 --> 00:13:47,689
however

222
00:13:47,689 --> 00:13:51,439
however it's not a simple as a US
authorities would like you to believe

223
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:55,180
I'm the important thing that from my
point of view we know we were operating

224
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,019
illegal business

225
00:13:57,019 --> 00:14:01,100
as hell regulations the NCAA regulations
when you are hosting providers

226
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,220
that indemnify you from users content

227
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,410
the rules at the MCA that you have to
take down offending

228
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:10,519
and when when requested takedown
procedure

229
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:13,790
and we were following that to the letter

230
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:17,790
will take down requests were processed
in less than 24 hours

231
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,980
and most of the time much faster to meet
it processes

232
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:25,139
I'm you know there are many companies
like make is probably I can think of at

233
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:26,769
least 25 lockers

234
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:31,480
and a lot of them were very aggressive
posting on forums and colluding with

235
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,740
parents and

236
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:36,769
offering rewards citron and make was
trying to be a good citizen that

237
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:37,740
industry

238
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:41,829
cancels the reward program a long time
ago we were improving the DMCA takedown

239
00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:42,720
system

240
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,610
and we never cooperated with annuals
form signed

241
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:49,910
listing copyrighted content

242
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:53,879
but the funny part is that there was no
conspiracy said they're charging the guy

243
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:58,170
Wiese conspiracy to commit something but
there was no conspiracy

244
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:01,559
you know i mean those guys is a X
hackers from really

245
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:05,550
top technical guys have been around in
this industry for

246
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:09,089
long time that used to run a pen this
company in the nineties

247
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:12,569
you know they know about security yet
those guys that didn't creep

248
00:15:12,569 --> 00:15:17,350
the emails they they use Skype for Chad
use Gmail for their corporate e-mails

249
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:20,910
is they had anything to hide you seeing
that would really do it without

250
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:21,980
encryption

251
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:26,509
I don't think so I am they had they they
didn't feel that had anything to hide

252
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:28,399
their work they were paying lawyers

253
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:33,110
fortunes millions to make sure that they
were complying with the law and that

254
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:36,759
everything that we're doing was legal
and within the framework of the DMCA

255
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:40,149
and and but of course like every cloud
storage provider

256
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:44,029
they had uses that abuse the system and
and stored files in

257
00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:49,429
in license to infringing content et
cetera

258
00:15:49,429 --> 00:15:53,740
it happens to love them I mean you can
you can just use Google search and you

259
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:57,490
you will find illegal content. Dropbox
and Google Drive skied

260
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:01,509
YouTube anything you can think of but
the real

261
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:06,139
truth is that the majority of the users
were on the conducting the judgment

262
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:09,670
operation make storing zone files

263
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:12,689
they were in just using work

264
00:16:12,689 --> 00:16:16,629
storage cloud storage again very
generous offer unlimited storage

265
00:16:16,629 --> 00:16:20,519
for as long as you can which is thing
was a great deal I know I've gone off my

266
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:21,360
back up there

267
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,720
hope to recover one day and

268
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,089
this is just an example to show you the
accusing me of and

269
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:34,639
encouraging copyright infringement not
respecting the MC rules it was a DMCA

270
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:35,769
rules say that

271
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:41,029
when there is an offending content it
should be taken down within 24 hours

272
00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:44,100
I am this is

273
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:49,449
you know this is a youtube search I've a
minute in French because

274
00:16:49,449 --> 00:16:53,100
French people like like two parts
content something about it

275
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:57,220
and if you just put that which means
complete movie

276
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,540
in YouTube then you would get at least
hundreds

277
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:04,230
of full-length movies you can see this
is also the real

278
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:07,890
movie length: you can see that they can
stay for

279
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:12,250
months being taken down the can be
viewed by millions

280
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,270
and yet Google it's okay but

281
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:19,439
may get be do is not OK I'm

282
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,689
I don't understand how that works with
me

283
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:26,439
obviously YouTube is making money from
from those movies

284
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:30,870
posted because a good add advertising
fees and

285
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:33,880
the same win again was making movies
with subscription

286
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:39,360
ads and of course some users are using
the system is pretty on you

287
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,740
but on YouTube you can search you can

288
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:46,640
you know may give it was there was no
searches re

289
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,730
didn't want people to be able to search
for copyright infringement

290
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:54,030
it on youtube its okay

291
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:57,230
I'm this bit of backlash with

292
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:00,620
make a story a lot of people have spoken
about it

293
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:05,830
if on private organizations and some
famous people like

294
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:09,290
like steeples neck cofounder

295
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:13,150
a pool right am time is right for you
don't shut down the whole street because

296
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,390
somebody speeding

297
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:17,850
you don't take down an entire business
because a few users

298
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:21,120
that you do not control right and those
users have

299
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,170
made something that and you supposed to
be to make the whole business

300
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:28,240
unlawfully is it doesn't make sense
doesn't make sense specialties at

301
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,570
they'll knows that prevent hosting
providers from inspecting the content

302
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,830
rides a privacy law that have been put
in place to protect

303
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:40,679
users from snooping powers a posting
providers

304
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:43,809
so legally we cannot inspect the content

305
00:18:43,809 --> 00:18:46,830
to check if its lawful and unlawful

306
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:50,370
but we have to respect to take them when
they come in on both phones we were

307
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,470
really

308
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:54,529
doing the right thing they took a stand

309
00:18:54,529 --> 00:18:58,350
she's saw

310
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:01,490
I'm of course make ice is fighting the
battle on many fronts

311
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:04,890
in hong kong US in Germany

312
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:08,269
it's costing a lot of money and they've
decided that

313
00:19:08,269 --> 00:19:13,600
the best defense will be offense right
so they've decided to restart mega

314
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,010
because there is nothing is makeup he's

315
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:20,529
wasn't legal business should be done
just

316
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:24,559
started again and this is going to be
quite interesting

317
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,289
we see with the authorities Zide

318
00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:32,010
is basically we're going to relaunch may
go with with a few twists like he's

319
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:32,890
going to have

320
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:36,649
photography going to a few interesting
features he's going to follow the

321
00:19:36,649 --> 00:19:37,640
business model of

322
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,390
of Dropbox lose the file-sharing

323
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:44,720
being able to share between users et
cetera so

324
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,480
once a new guy would be live in its its
planned for

325
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,500
for the end of the year before the end
of the year then

326
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,409
the Department of Justice in the US that
have to make a decision is a new nigga

327
00:19:55,409 --> 00:20:00,350
legal then if it is why is the old make
a legal because it's the same

328
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:03,519
and if they want to make it illegal then
that have to talk to Google and

329
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:05,429
Microsoft and others

330
00:20:05,429 --> 00:20:09,870
and tell them sorry we have to stop you
out service because it's illegal

331
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:14,669
you cannot handle all that you know will
will tell US companies it's okay you can

332
00:20:14,669 --> 00:20:15,659
do what you want but

333
00:20:15,659 --> 00:20:18,860
all the foreign companies cannot scan of

334
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:23,549
we in and I'm I mean I don't know how
much you full of political development

335
00:20:23,549 --> 00:20:25,279
in the US

336
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:28,610
person they have always been interested
in the topic and I I feel

337
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:34,279
last few its its really not going in the
right direction

338
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:37,500
it's basically a police state
increasingly

339
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,200
toning insist citizen severe

340
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:48,200
drones with police its to fascist
society fascism like to call it

341
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,760
so what's a new mega going to be about
means is a bottom line that

342
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,880
what we found the hard way we speak that
you cannot trust government to safeguard

343
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,899
your data

344
00:20:56,899 --> 00:21:01,130
they've if taken down our own aren't our
data centers and sees

345
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:04,960
all the services at thousands of servers
storage

346
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,610
I'm and we we can access it so people
lost there's a date until we can

347
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:13,010
so what we going to do this everything
is going to be in cryptid

348
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:17,450
nothing is going to be hosted in the US
no nasa

349
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:20,549
as to make eyes wide in the US is it

350
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:24,260
because you scared like say it's not
really is that it's it's more of an

351
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,740
economic sanctions

352
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:32,399
to to give them money but we will offer
the service in the United States

353
00:21:32,399 --> 00:21:36,360
what will change this time everything
will be included

354
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:40,240
it's going to be as transparent as
possible the end-user because she's a

355
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,779
these problems encryption and uses on
use it because it's complicated

356
00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:48,080
we're going to make it simple going to
be client-side

357
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,279
which means no critics contend will ever
the wire

358
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:57,179
the hosting providers will have no
liability everything will be included

359
00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:01,889
there's going to be a a a look new
features compared to the previous one

360
00:22:01,889 --> 00:22:07,159
going to be just a full download is
going to be the whole by management

361
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,779
of cloud storage management like %um

362
00:22:10,779 --> 00:22:15,399
box where you can which you can create
access control these

363
00:22:15,399 --> 00:22:19,399
also sings we're going to offer

364
00:22:19,399 --> 00:22:24,130
API busy with developers to develop
their own application to take

365
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:28,580
advantage of the cloud infrastructure
that building

366
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:32,429
that with this we developers would
create some

367
00:22:32,429 --> 00:22:35,480
very ATF ways to

368
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,399
take advantage file-sharing group to

369
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:43,679
system operation create an ecosystem
that just

370
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,039
be able to be stopped I like the
previous one will have

371
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:51,820
legal compliance will have DMCA takedown
in Sitra

372
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:56,080
with negotiating with a number of
players in the industry

373
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,139
use the knowledge that would be because
this is what

374
00:23:00,139 --> 00:23:04,409
cause this trouble last time and I am

375
00:23:04,409 --> 00:23:08,399
and the eighties not to encourage piracy
on the contrary the ID's to

376
00:23:08,399 --> 00:23:12,250
create a new model for distribution of
media new models where

377
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:16,090
creators can be rewarded without having
to go through

378
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:19,880
missiles users taking money

379
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:24,190
I personally believe that created should
be rewarded for their work

380
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:28,549
this is how the going to make movies and
music that

381
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:31,980
that we like and they need to be paid
but

382
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:36,700
current business model which was created
last century was there was no internet

383
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,929
was there was no easy way to actually
shared

384
00:23:39,929 --> 00:23:45,490
files and with distribution meant you
had to manufacture every

385
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:49,309
every copy of artwork being distributed

386
00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:54,049
its definitely not the same landscape
now that business model needs to be full

387
00:23:54,049 --> 00:23:58,200
the problems at the end and and they're
drawn they don't want it

388
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,260
to people they want to keep it same way
with

389
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:05,549
keep control over everything billions

390
00:24:05,549 --> 00:24:09,130
this is a status quo they have no
interest in changing of course not

391
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:12,760
but I'm the Internet is a force to be
reckoned with

392
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,279
and not going to be able to

393
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:20,580
to prevent was initiatives they might
put down one company but they'll never

394
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,830
be able to put down

395
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:26,429
the company's and they might try to
force us to respect than that

396
00:24:26,429 --> 00:24:29,799
stupid antiquated and only thing you're
yes

397
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:32,950
travel and DVD in one country you can't
watch it in

398
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:36,190
this kind of stupid irrational sings I'm

399
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:40,950
about time that it changes first they're
going to start to launch make

400
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:44,019
looks pretty quickly this there were
about to launch it

401
00:24:44,019 --> 00:24:47,730
the time of the bust me a box is a
platform where artists can produce

402
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:49,539
themselves directly

403
00:24:49,539 --> 00:24:53,450
already made a lot of partnership

404
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,669
with people who want to produce himself
without

405
00:24:56,669 --> 00:25:00,070
things in two majors

406
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:04,000
JD's effect 90 percent of the revenues
artist and to lose them

407
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,620
to profit from the freedom

408
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:11,029
because this is a thing of people they
want free content they want to just

409
00:25:11,029 --> 00:25:15,269
download and listen this is what the

410
00:25:15,269 --> 00:25:19,690
MP don't like but if you can monetize

411
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:23,220
whose free downloads and give back that
money to the artisan where is the

412
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,880
problem is Justin

413
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,590
business model as we are we have created
that that's going to be

414
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:31,850
obviously if you wanna free download you
going to to have

415
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:35,990
add that supports financially and those
revenues will be

416
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:40,059
sent back to the artist directly I'm

417
00:25:40,059 --> 00:25:43,710
then we going to launch and they said a
set of guys that you

418
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:47,370
going to be able to develop apps in on

419
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:51,570
Windows on a Mac iPhone and Android
we're going to have

420
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:54,809
also 250 eyes in every language to

421
00:25:54,809 --> 00:25:59,509
be able to enable developers take
advantage of our cloud infrastructure

422
00:25:59,509 --> 00:26:05,220
all the fun management cryptographic
functions and go with it

423
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,539
and that's it this is this is a be
vision of niggas

424
00:26:08,539 --> 00:26:13,809
vision of a free internet that we don't
corporate guidance to control us

425
00:26:13,809 --> 00:26:17,309
countries to dictate what can be done
and say that

426
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:21,610
something is okay for you this company
based give somebody else

427
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:24,710
you know there has to be some due
process has to be some freedom on the

428
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:25,919
internet

429
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,210
you know you should be free from being
spied upon

430
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:32,950
you shouldn't be scared to express an
opinion am you know

431
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:37,309
about you having the power that's what
about and

432
00:26:37,309 --> 00:26:40,470
we hope that weeping into exposing some

433
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:45,019
corruption to cripple that medium

434
00:26:45,019 --> 00:26:48,700
the truth will come out souls that there
wasn't that was me about being a little

435
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,259
bit about mega

436
00:26:51,259 --> 00:26:56,120
if you have any question

437
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:03,120
on

438
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:13,200
should aw it was a joke ok

439
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,890
but honestly some of the charges

440
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:21,170
some very close to you know

441
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:25,070
to synchronization spends time 1500

442
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:32,070
something

443
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:44,019
why I don't know my ask the lawyers this
isn't racketeering

444
00:27:44,019 --> 00:27:48,000
when finance one business was a profit
mother

445
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,110
illegal business to I saw it was weird
because if you ever

446
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:58,059
a group of companies you know and is one
holding companies and there are several

447
00:27:58,059 --> 00:28:00,029
other companies that depend on each
other

448
00:28:00,029 --> 00:28:03,269
then it means its is always racketeering

449
00:28:03,269 --> 00:28:07,010
you never do business in a vacuum but

450
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:10,080
as I said charges it just then there

451
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,630
so it could fall into Rico category
handles them

452
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:18,110
superpowers deception

453
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:21,549
can boss people in foreign countries
intrudes migrant

454
00:28:21,549 --> 00:28:28,549
this is wide charges absolutely no legal

455
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:41,000
what yeah its its I'm

456
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:47,520
passing you see that was a Skype blog
Sina and a lot of people have been

457
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,909
asking themselves in

458
00:28:48,909 --> 00:28:52,490
does it mean that Skype was into
sensible use

459
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:56,860
actually it's not secure nowadays

460
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:00,610
can be intercepted its Microsoft with
film

461
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:04,460
sings we know that but what happen is
that some

462
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:08,309
chat logs were email from one me user to
another

463
00:29:08,309 --> 00:29:12,059
and that's how they got them got them
from the mail because no one gave

464
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:12,850
basically packed

465
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:16,929
logs for reference whatever thats got
wasn't Skype interception

466
00:29:16,929 --> 00:29:21,260
it doesn't mean that Skype these safe to
use now wouldn't recommend

467
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:28,260
just good to have a server with like

468
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:36,840
decodable yeah I i country

469
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:41,399
like at least some government agencies

470
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:45,490
on like machine for Voice interception

471
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:50,630
Yemen government many ways to subscribe
you don't have to bring to cryptography

472
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,899
basically Microsoft attended one

473
00:29:52,899 --> 00:29:57,870
yes yes indeed II Soul recent

474
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:00,890
deception is it a surprise

475
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:05,399
no in my presentation yesterday

476
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:08,620
someone who attended I talked about
interception systems

477
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:11,950
the authorities are using track to the
communication

478
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:15,580
this is to see so sophisticated you have
no idea

479
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:19,549
the intercepting communications country
level than they do in correlation with

480
00:30:19,549 --> 00:30:23,840
emails with Chad social stuff period

481
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,760
interception now and for Skype is a
conference a crypto

482
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,890
little to children on your PC use that

483
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:34,390
stations basically

484
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:38,330
make that like Holly called inspected

485
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:42,149
like my notes basically all belong to
Microsoft on this machine

486
00:30:42,149 --> 00:30:47,419
you can just de kooning using

487
00:30:47,419 --> 00:30:54,419
well I'm gonna

488
00:30:57,149 --> 00:31:00,340
it's sad when everything you do

489
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:03,460
spied upon by can Cummings

490
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:07,610
was spied upon weeks before the case
happens this was the only legally

491
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:11,010
you know when authorities stopped
respecting

492
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:18,010
lolol thats when you should being word

493
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:28,629
yeah he had know they they entered the
rooms is the nannies rooms with assault

494
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,610
weapons and said %um

495
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:38,610
engine the Philippine on

496
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,330
confident is

497
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:46,759
all love you are dad you will win the
battle because the bottle actually as

498
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:47,309
you say

499
00:31:47,309 --> 00:31:51,190
is against the measures and the politics
and

500
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:55,730
are not broach that sa sent three ago
hold

501
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:59,539
yellow of course is always an element of
doubt because you're dealing with the

502
00:31:59,539 --> 00:32:01,269
United States and I just said

503
00:32:01,269 --> 00:32:05,249
the United States and zone is not you
know as a beacon of democracy that we

504
00:32:05,249 --> 00:32:05,779
used to

505
00:32:05,779 --> 00:32:10,190
respected for it's turning to fascist
society where cronyism

506
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:15,570
corporatism corruption is someone
doesn't agree with me

507
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:20,619
is we can have a long discussion about
that it's happening just took

508
00:32:20,619 --> 00:32:24,200
yourself with the news is it's happening
all over the place you come is not a

509
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:28,559
single with without a new video of
police brutality in the States some new

510
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,080
civil rights being trampled

511
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,899
some even the basics constitution is
being

512
00:32:33,899 --> 00:32:36,990
nor you know in Russia these in his

513
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:40,460
illegal now Nick propaganda parties make
you have a law firm

514
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:47,210
months ago governments for you

515
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:52,539
I think we shouldn't give up in as an
internet users are using

516
00:32:52,539 --> 00:32:56,389
way to kick the can much you can get its

517
00:32:56,389 --> 00:33:00,230
that's okay nothing to fear on a citizen

518
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:03,860
well I don't agree with this I don't
think it's because you've got nothing to

519
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,350
hide that they should be able to read it

520
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:09,269
Singh you know your life you like their

521
00:33:09,269 --> 00:33:12,909
observance unless is due process

522
00:33:12,909 --> 00:33:17,740
nicholson national security yeah
national securities the same thing that

523
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,399
happen

524
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:21,990
that happened with airport security in
the laws we know it's totally useless

525
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:25,809
but we accept somehow

526
00:33:25,809 --> 00:33:28,999
yeah I mean until when

527
00:33:28,999 --> 00:33:33,389
is it okay the keep pushing aggressive
goes to spice

528
00:33:33,389 --> 00:33:36,850
to observe to intercept know when when
is it too much

529
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:40,220
when Wendy's sort of draw the line
dances

530
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:43,730
too much good backtrack this can

531
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:48,619
1984 1983 upon us now was a joke use a
good night sweetie

532
00:33:48,619 --> 00:33:53,249
it's really it's really happening

533
00:33:53,249 --> 00:33:56,340
I'm sure you know that more than most
working

534
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:03,340
wants to have to prevent

535
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:10,230
oversees Universal's used sorry

536
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:13,510
have to come okay so with the section

537
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:17,500
you basically lost love home sOooo

538
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,918
as we have them good use to prevent

539
00:34:20,919 --> 00:34:23,980
the guy that happen again the new
textiles well

540
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:28,549
I'm we're not going to lose States we
going to

541
00:34:28,549 --> 00:34:33,790
we're going to start by you know by
working with service providers

542
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:37,299
commitment not being lead

543
00:34:37,299 --> 00:34:40,409
US them

544
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:44,339
and I think there are many people would
like to have the way

545
00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:48,929
stole it the cloud insecure but secure
from the cryptographic

546
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:52,599
secure from the main secure from US
interference

547
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:59,040
was the name change well yeah

548
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,180
I believe in encryption good

549
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:09,180
them compromise system

550
00:35:09,369 --> 00:35:12,400
I feel we should

551
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,980
thing is it's about the reliability
right

552
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,980
sold I think in terms of heavily beaded

553
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:24,400
help if on brings the show were down
even even if it was in group 2 like

554
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,849
use is not there you know availability
we the Omega we were storing files in

555
00:35:28,849 --> 00:35:30,020
multiple occasions

556
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:33,470
to provide some high-visibility when the

557
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:37,940
actually we had wanted business no one

558
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:41,880
done pictures will probably feel the
same

559
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,190
because we going to use Creek of

560
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:49,270
one issue that we can't use duplication
which is an issue

561
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:53,339
stories and before before when someone
upload one big fun

562
00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:56,520
checks on next time it's uploaded we
don't reuploaded

563
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:00,579
story twice scalded occasion it's a
process that's quite common in the

564
00:36:00,579 --> 00:36:01,210
industry

565
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:05,060
it's also once a reason understand

566
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:09,180
business model this is that when there's
a takedown with remove all the files but

567
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,119
I can we do that

568
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:13,500
if a file is being too many users we
don't know maybe one guy

569
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,349
license as the other guy doesn't work on
trim

570
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:22,560
to the US indian like really joke right
accusing P MOV

571
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,770
hosting pirated songs all zip songs are
listed in

572
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:30,970
like actually so many boards with his
iTunes account so

573
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:35,060
you know is actually the case the trying
to go into the discovery process

574
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:38,810
you can ask evidence before going to
trial to study

575
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:44,589
and the US government refusing to give
it I think because in all the cases

576
00:36:44,589 --> 00:36:48,490
it's hearsay nothing going to do that
he's going to be a massive

577
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:52,450
basque because came he's not going to
just swing

578
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:56,290
speaks wean them exams going to make
them pay

579
00:36:56,290 --> 00:37:00,000
would know him he's is mission

580
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,710
an Siemens really such as I was there
last week

581
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:07,549
you know that yesterday the prime
minister is getting so much

582
00:37:07,549 --> 00:37:10,839
he casick

583
00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:14,380
goals that they disrespected

584
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:20,810
and these media circus in the US they
did in

585
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:25,500
going to be interesting use the
extradition case because if you don't

586
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,430
want that to happen

587
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:29,690
before the election yes so the whose

588
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:33,310
extradition hearing next March keep

589
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:36,440
wanted goes there his ass a US

590
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:40,280
need for extradition I'm coming just
legal expenses

591
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,480
living expenses I'm coming they refuse

592
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,170
and the roof is a brief very simple
because this can of the media circus has

593
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:49,950
been to stop this

594
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:53,670
uses been some political corruption in
the United States

595
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:57,630
case has been something that has been
traded between

596
00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:01,220
private organizations in PA and public
organizations like the Department of

597
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,470
Justice

598
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:06,680
doesn't look good States we going to
expose

599
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:10,190
very visible

600
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:14,810
used to make them they want to take down
someone's business

601
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:21,810
this thing twice

602
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,330
well obviously

603
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:31,619
if is a bust and the arrest and all that
is declared illegal then

604
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:38,619
we will sue for damages which is the US
government's

605
00:38:43,349 --> 00:38:45,829
I'm yeah kim is a reason museum

606
00:38:45,829 --> 00:38:48,890
he doesn't want to make the situation
worse for them

607
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:52,859
he knows that the Kiwis have been
physically bullied

608
00:38:52,859 --> 00:38:55,969
the US's in like 20 been presented a
false picture

609
00:38:55,969 --> 00:38:59,019
you know the FBI busy

610
00:38:59,019 --> 00:39:04,420
force them operation in my opinion
securities are more

611
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:08,049
victims in that story than they are with
participants

612
00:39:08,049 --> 00:39:12,809
so know the eighties to make the US
government pays because this is where it

613
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:13,459
started

614
00:39:13,459 --> 00:39:18,130
great

615
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:25,130
back

616
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:28,269
it's happening this coming to New the
making

617
00:39:28,269 --> 00:39:31,829
alleyways in the in the US was the legal
process it is happening

618
00:39:31,829 --> 00:39:35,240
you know they are launching in is going
to be a big but

619
