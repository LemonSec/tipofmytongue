1
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:09,250
for this

2
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:16,250
space

3
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,190
on basically the things that

4
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:31,970
I'm good to talk about here this is like
a joint research between me in phnom

5
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,480
a friend of mine in Russia I'll let the
american arm

6
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:42,480
limit works for up a big company where
he manages to seem like a lot of traffic

7
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:46,309
are not not an ISP but the also

8
00:00:46,309 --> 00:00:49,730
up we get like a lot of visibility

9
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:54,160
a on russian cybercrime basically
through the looks he captures

10
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,960
plus saw we get some traffic for ordered
from

11
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,400
Russia and I'll explain it

12
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,489
in a little bit what but anyway arm

13
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:08,310
I roughly have like three sections and
representation

14
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,920
arm the point representation basically

15
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,140
is I'll to show like what the situation
was cybercrime

16
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,880
like or like unlawful or like

17
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,240
and ethical interactivity is in like

18
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,310
ex-soviet union area is as of like this
year

19
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:31,780
arm to liken pregnant talking about
stuff someone

20
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,290
I'm trying not to cover two things that
appealing

21
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:38,900
talking about before and arm have a
couple

22
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,250
text running are basically systems that
rebuilding

23
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:46,080
I'm still are trying to graduate
basically a my

24
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,409
PhD student in are in the newer steamed
I once I need like

25
00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:54,140
interesting topics to write papers on so
are we have like

26
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:58,040
up basically are have two projects which
we

27
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,799
are working on I'll

28
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,900
was the objective on eradicating like

29
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:09,479
some of the problems that we seeing so
nooo just walk through this project

30
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,820
um are if you've seen

31
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,310
I'll this morning sold by our

32
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,920
full week she arm than up

33
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,950
this point like this part would be likes
roughly a related to what he was talking

34
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,570
about cuz we also do like

35
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:28,829
in this traffic analysis and stuff and
anyway

36
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:32,140
arm a brief like

37
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,810
I'll introduction what's going on in
russia

38
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:41,300
like some to certain extent its spreads
sought to the west as well

39
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,800
but there are certain limitations like
the reason why for example we're not

40
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,959
seeing much of this kind of acuity

41
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,020
if you connect the same site I liked the
same you're all the same web sites

42
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:56,890
are from Russia a is because a lot of
criminalist due to happen through the

43
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,379
by their networks like advertisement
that works and buy another as they

44
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:01,270
waited

45
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:06,780
re: ghost so I'll we not even being
redirected to the malicious advertisers

46
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,370
if we are with it particular

47
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:14,099
our resources from like taiwan is hong
kong like Malaysian IP addresses

48
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:17,580
so on what we do we have like be pinched

49
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,920
are was in points in up in russia

50
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,340
like proxies so in order to connect some

51
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,500
some other statistics arm but I'll

52
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,019
still basically like what missus like
big thing and

53
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:35,370
arm in particular was like botnets lol
arm

54
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:39,370
there was some outbreak of like p2p is
like based algorithms for the

55
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:43,069
apartments I'll nothing like a year ago

56
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:46,160
but what we're seeing a lot this year is
basically

57
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:51,890
up on like that what what does that make
you look at what that is basically like

58
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:53,260
a piece of software

59
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,300
which somehow ends up on our arm

60
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,599
a bunch of computers and this somehow
could be like can exploit

61
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:04,319
or could be a social engineering tricks
no-show couple 3d is where you can see

62
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,909
I'll were will see that like it

63
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:11,220
other and exploitation of target system
like

64
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,940
technical exploding on ability is now is
not the only means and

65
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,340
actually is not one of the most common
way so far

66
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,419
getting to control but basically solely
a

67
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:25,620
you end up having like banja I'll are so
for instance running on

68
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,760
up those computers and they basically
called back

69
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,599
so in order to like so that the person
who orchestrated the whole thing would

70
00:04:32,599 --> 00:04:33,640
be able to

71
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,960
I'll are conduct the machines so

72
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,110
other communication between the a
machine and

73
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:43,690
the arm like so-called like C&C

74
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:47,580
going to control books is like one of
the essential components so

75
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,440
was getting big this year's are arguing
the main

76
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,659
are what that control channels and

77
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:58,810
the resource that we doing is basically
up aiming at detecting did

78
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:02,110
part of things infrastructure I'll well

79
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:06,370
should be more details in a bit arm one
of the reasons why

80
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:09,580
like other kind of like crime missed you

81
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,289
I'll keeps the kennel promised you like

82
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:16,490
where originally bases not because

83
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:20,310
its more difficult to compromise
machines in the US or like

84
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:23,810
more difficult to compromise machines
and i won and actually like

85
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:27,460
when you compromised machines as a part
of the botnet like that for at least two

86
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,460
happens

87
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:31,510
but one of the reasons is because once
you

88
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,729
arm infected machines unit you like me

89
00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:37,789
the reason why people do this is like
for money

90
00:05:37,789 --> 00:05:41,960
and once you in Fig machines you have to
like me monetize it somehow

91
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,580
and the limitation is basically the in
manipulation schemes

92
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:51,080
and was in russia's like Wat user like
if you have someone for number

93
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,159
it's way easier to make people to
transfer money to you or next to money

94
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:58,180
by just saw either infecting the are the
mobile phone

95
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,789
or using other schemes that in wolf
mobile for

96
00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:05,550
select mobile phone is basically getting
one of the main

97
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,560
medium so fund transfer

98
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,330
but I'll like driver download is like
not only like don't like

99
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,390
I can people like our notion this year
quite a bit

100
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:19,050
is I'll like more its look like I wanna
go like

101
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:24,020
targeted email spam but it's more like
of for example

102
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:28,070
are website I which is

103
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:31,430
among accountants gets compromised and
then

104
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:36,330
arm the database of the

105
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:40,409
users wasn't that website's get dumped
and then there's that up

106
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:43,659
%uh this list of email addresses gets
spammed

107
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:48,120
was an XE file and contend that is
specific to the accountants

108
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,060
it would be like an account in
conference so like which in this league

109
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,710
outbreak and basically

110
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:58,180
arm once email gets executed like the
panel it could be like

111
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:02,649
are wary but I what we've seen months
ago basically they would be inevitable

112
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:07,229
that just get %ah starts running I look
for all the like PowerPoint

113
00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:10,740
PDF I were documents uploaded to the FTP
site

114
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,339
and this affectionate like this attacks
cuming

115
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:17,630
is very similar to what we've seen I
think your health like

116
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:22,669
problem was two years you go one the
same see nothing was sent to like

117
00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:26,339
by 25 use government the official
dresses

118
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:31,959
was a cop are congratulations it was
like I'm on Christmas so there was like

119
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:35,589
congratulations from Obama that you
needed a good work for the country

120
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:38,729
please see this postcard an executable
so I think like

121
00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:42,849
the only problem was like use it is like
to use a dumb whatever you send them

122
00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:46,649
if they reckon is likely to meet if it
comes from like Obama or if it comes

123
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:47,380
from a

124
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:51,099
account what side they gonna run it so I
think say is like

125
00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:55,320
with all this legal business and stuff
it's not even the point of fixing

126
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,380
like technical flaws because like the
problem is like fixing

127
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:03,229
the like mind over videos and home

128
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:07,159
yet people still the hot stuff and
basically the tendency that we see this

129
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:08,610
your dad like mobile platform

130
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:11,890
is like becomes a lucrative target

131
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:15,500
we haven't seen much of the exploitation
going on are the worse

132
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,250
are mobile phones & what is a mobile
phones want to see this year's most

133
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,800
Android platforms are and I think like
that there is it

134
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,630
a reason for his kids like it's more
like open its easier to

135
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:29,789
sneak a pic Asian arm

136
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:33,510
Google is doing some are analysis on the
on the supplications but

137
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:38,529
motion paper I think by Terry Miller as
well on

138
00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:41,560
are like there are so many ways to
basically up by

139
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,459
bypass on books on it is a hundred
applications and

140
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:48,570
others just like budget like fake
applications that are

141
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:52,290
was getting installed on our mobile
phone either subscribe the user to

142
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,670
particular there was an L

143
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:57,139
also like one of the examples here or to
simply start like

144
00:08:57,139 --> 00:09:00,519
thinking offered which is the Primus
missus like this thing is

145
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:04,670
likes sort of getting duplicated because
like many platforms that equally

146
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,810
confirmation

147
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:09,329
our vision for like all old versions of
mobile phones though the league games

148
00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:10,230
which like

149
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,759
get union would have licked licking okay
like so you play the game

150
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:16,839
and as you start playing the game that
was Arbys are sending is missus

151
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:21,410
but we don't see that up this kind of
games this much in Android platforms

152
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:24,660
so that like there are other rectors

153
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:30,240
so all on this is like a screenshot from
%ah blackballed Chu

154
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,519
up they can like be with 23 days ago
also like this I think pretty fresh

155
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:39,470
just to give you a visibility on are was
what gets exploited in their own it and

156
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,180
how

157
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:44,040
so this is like a 36 from mom off from

158
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,709
an exploit pic and you can see that like
eyebrows arched you like being most

159
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:49,470
popular

160
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:52,500
so what we do here is like browsers

161
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,490
number of like browsers loaded on on our

162
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:00,230
on this exploit pic number of like
unique IP addresses

163
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:03,440
and once exploit is successful

164
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,190
it features an executable in executable
calls back like

165
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:11,089
yeah I'm I got executed so this is like
number of like

166
00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:14,560
successful call back so you can see like
that I used to like

167
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,790
holding the first place there's like
Firefox there's opera

168
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:21,399
this from their Safari and what he will
not is that like most other brother gets

169
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:22,089
exploited

170
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:27,120
like regardless of are the security
features but if you start looking at the

171
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,730
what exploits were used in the attack I
think this like opportune for me that

172
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,100
this was like Joe a

173
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,100
and Oracle a bit a big favor are

174
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,139
i think im I'll months ago when it took
him quite a bit you %ah

175
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:44,480
fix publicly up released on ability so
you can see like most other stuff

176
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,750
and I think this like Joey just like
very convenient

177
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,279
like multiplatform I'll to browser milem
I'll do whatever

178
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,449
like there's still some mom PDF stuff
happening but like

179
00:10:54,449 --> 00:10:57,649
that's about it then in terms of like
platforms you can see that like

180
00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:01,089
it's mostly I'm Windows machines

181
00:11:01,089 --> 00:11:05,870
so I'll the main components that like

182
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:10,279
this is basically the crime so the main
companies a are

183
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:14,209
people haveing in order to orchestrate
dislike this kind of like malicious

184
00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:15,060
attacks

185
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,199
you'll see a is a C&C or like

186
00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:22,810
the machine that usually it would be a
CNC plus an explosion machine

187
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:25,519
and usually it's close to the same
infrastructure it would have different

188
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,620
domain names

189
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,730
because domain names get blacklisted and
up

190
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:33,250
and the domain name they would be using
to connect to see if she would bill

191
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,779
I picked a different from the the main
in the cervix put back

192
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:40,759
but I pity it's the same infrastructure
so one of the things that we want to be

193
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:41,509
able to find

194
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:44,970
automatically alexei mathematically is
like where all this like to see

195
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:49,040
seems user and be arm one of the leak

196
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,350
movie mechanisms of awe

197
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:55,860
and the growing economies extra traffic
so if people

198
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:59,149
i'm not respecting those web sites with
expert picks

199
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:02,199
nothing happens but let's don't don't
get built on

200
00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:05,509
they don't get infrastructure the don't
get

201
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:08,910
are stolen credentials for them get
quick cars the don't

202
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:13,000
show stuff to users user don't be money
and I'll economy doesn't work

203
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,160
so I think the KU the K like working for
some the whole thing is

204
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,800
is traffic so you can see you'll see arm

205
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,800
the a lot of arm online abuse like from
the spam

206
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,139
you like %uh search engine optimization
like

207
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:31,670
black-and-white happens with a single
point of getting

208
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:34,999
traffic to particular web sites and

209
00:12:34,999 --> 00:12:38,009
10 the like what a common things is arm

210
00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:44,050
flick how many people in this from run
for president bill ok

211
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:48,680
one to you well apparently not so
popular but

212
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,240
if you if you took if you take in a
virtual up

213
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,350
user who wants to be known through the
internet

214
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:58,050
like I think it's like 90 percent of
them would they would probably be

215
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,350
running WordPress just because

216
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:02,980
like its a it's like one of the default
options when you

217
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:07,129
when you buy hosting be just so easy to
run

218
00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:10,180
and its wanna be like most compromise
publications

219
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:14,339
so on what was basically happening is

220
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:17,579
arm bustle web sites like artwork Press

221
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:21,810
West commerce opts open X is actually
pretty

222
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:24,889
particular interesting thing because its

223
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:28,529
arm up next is I'll I'll if you want to
run your own

224
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:32,269
like me by noon serving at work was in
your

225
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:35,410
arm are your website

226
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:39,189
you get Google run like open XO and then
you can interconnect was a

227
00:13:39,189 --> 00:13:43,100
other are by their networks but the
thing is open next

228
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:47,129
used to have like someone you up bed all
abilities were you can like

229
00:13:47,129 --> 00:13:50,370
you can have admin control the thing and
then once you have control over the

230
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,370
database you can basically stark

231
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:55,930
injecting malicious scripts into the
thing be you can compromise the

232
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:59,350
open next year we're told and let's
order soon as well

233
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:02,560
and either you like are Lord

234
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,930
in about your moto which like this thing
gets likely difficult to find

235
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:09,350
his no files no files on the filesystem
get changed

236
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:12,559
except for lookin additional Apache
models being

237
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:15,910
loaded into arm Apache web server

238
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:20,779
and every time the like the text group
has been served its Bing search was a

239
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:21,839
pending

240
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,329
are JavaScript that a are

241
00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:28,759
redirects stuff to the infrastructure
and when I'm

242
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:33,220
talking about infrastructure it will not
be mystery and exploit back right away

243
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,540
because

244
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,819
arm in Dresden like this the situation
is like a bit more

245
00:14:37,819 --> 00:14:41,160
complicated up the people who

246
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,680
a paid to bring traffic to particular
sources they pay to bring traffic to are

247
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,620
two TDs

248
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,670
traffic distribution systems and people
who build what minutes they buying

249
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:54,209
I'll stop from the tedious but anyway up

250
00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:58,339
so basically compromised machines is is
one of the like

251
00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:02,490
arm key components are in bringing
traffic

252
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:07,189
so we want to be able to I'll rapidly
quickly

253
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:11,920
I'll at large-scale identify which
machines could be compromised

254
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,910
like maybe I in a scriptable way and
thats also like that one of the

255
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:20,959
prerequisites for like in %uh one on the
project which I'll be showing here

256
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,329
up by their networks like I think this
like very difficult

257
00:15:24,329 --> 00:15:27,689
Hillis starting from the point arm the
better look at

258
00:15:27,689 --> 00:15:31,189
asthma network itself is very
complicated and it's very dynamic

259
00:15:31,189 --> 00:15:35,259
so the the way and it has been rendered
depends on your IP address on your

260
00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:38,889
could be could depend on your cookie on
your time zone a

261
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:42,809
are which are is disclosed by up

262
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:47,350
while web browser heaters and even if
you thought the same

263
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:50,740
your old twice you it's like you cannot
entered the same

264
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:54,529
the same river twice like the thing
always moves and because there's like

265
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:55,129
this

266
00:15:55,129 --> 00:15:59,329
they namic beating arm it's very
difficult basically to trace malicious

267
00:15:59,329 --> 00:15:59,939
conduct

268
00:15:59,939 --> 00:16:03,079
content in binder networks and I'll be
showing what want to be due to my

269
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:04,360
examples were

270
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,129
up we can see are one of the things

271
00:16:08,129 --> 00:16:11,569
I'll like by their network like money
should monitor connection

272
00:16:11,569 --> 00:16:17,230
another thing is up dependency that we
see happening in russia that there are

273
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:20,910
shouldn't buy new networks like guys
went agencies which like

274
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:24,300
on the legal side that you taking offers
for advertisements

275
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,860
and looking for publishers to place
their banners but the sole purpose of

276
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,089
those companies

277
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:32,189
optics East is to distribute Mauer

278
00:16:32,189 --> 00:16:35,730
and the weighted op the whole thing
would be happening like

279
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:40,439
on the first round of the page are
you'll be sure from exploit back

280
00:16:40,439 --> 00:16:43,759
are every Asian of exploit back

281
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,850
all and all on the all the consequential
are in there so the same page like based

282
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:48,839
on the cookie

283
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,889
are you Bashar regularly call up and
with that

284
00:16:51,889 --> 00:16:55,259
advertising and up content and

285
00:16:55,259 --> 00:17:00,629
the what what is like getting difficult
for its like injury company

286
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:04,480
but the thing is they distributing our
book if you start

287
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,569
E if you basically start up trying to
persecute them

288
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,660
on it's not worth the effort because
like

289
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:15,530
are there were like certain cases wanted
to say I'll our machines were compromise

290
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:16,439
and there's like

291
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:21,400
no proof that the redirection to exploit
back

292
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,610
have actually any links I'll

293
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,919
with this company was exception of
statistics 0

294
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,620
when when we run ascend books Lake

295
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:35,340
100 times and roll was it like fresh in
our own with the first AP

296
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:39,039
we we get get my word sure every time

297
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,850
but other than this and this been going
on for like a year

298
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:46,140
but other than this kind of like
statistics there is no

299
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,890
like obvious proof and like this this
kind of statistical proof doesn't work

300
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:50,860
well in court

301
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:55,980
and this also like the reason why I
disco politics

302
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:00,760
so arm arm what I've been doing like
before

303
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,429
are we were like building like our
behavior-based are

304
00:18:04,429 --> 00:18:09,950
analysis platform for Mauer so been
looking into this thing for maybe like

305
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:13,159
couple of years right now but what's
good different like this year

306
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:16,720
is up they said those guys this for
another

307
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,549
effort on ARM on preventing automated
detection

308
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:23,690
and well the point when things get
difficult is

309
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:27,520
when malicious behavior only exhibit
itself

310
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,210
in like behavior analysis model are only
when

311
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:35,539
there is a human interaction like this
is like one of the simple example

312
00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:39,340
but we've seen they would be like arm
the JavaScript

313
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:42,840
other the direction of only happen when
there is like a mouth moment

314
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,880
and this kind of thing like if you if
you know the like doing this kind of

315
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,549
stuff

316
00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:49,159
this kind of thing is like real easy to
simulate important you can just like

317
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:50,399
community must warn

318
00:18:50,399 --> 00:18:55,140
but arm like their critique creativity
doesn't stop here

319
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,419
what are the things that you'll
frequently see is up

320
00:18:58,419 --> 00:19:01,559
like a pop a boner done was like did
JavaScript

321
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:04,600
inches was a click click here and

322
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,059
if you don't have like what's your
recognition system

323
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:11,620
that would recognize that like user is
mature waited to click here

324
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:15,390
then you will not be able to be able to
you

325
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:18,450
%ah make the like particular website too

326
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:23,059
exhibit malicious behavior and hes like
most other like internet monitoring

327
00:19:23,059 --> 00:19:27,730
arm systems are working like what we did
it my previous company but

328
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:31,000
I don't like other companies which like
they did basically the same way

329
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,049
you wish you could have like a sandbox
farm the continually kroll slick

330
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:35,940
internet

331
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:39,640
renders it in in real brother and then
you'd like have Petters

332
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,779
on detecting malicious behavior but like
this kind of thing doesn't like always

333
00:19:43,779 --> 00:19:44,470
work

334
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:47,950
so arm in this case I think the the best
option is

335
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:51,730
to have some sort of like many touring
mortal in the browser

336
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:54,929
which would notify arm

337
00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:58,210
headquarters when they were like part
are whenever

338
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:01,380
malicious behavior was detected but then
you have to make

339
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,440
users to agree to split gonna stop and
so on

340
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,679
but like nothing that arm would you like
a love this year

341
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:12,649
arm when it is it like the matches
monetization scheme

342
00:20:12,649 --> 00:20:16,789
are there used to be like a prime SMS is
full like used a lot

343
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:19,809
are Bob years before but like

344
00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:23,620
as a this year like you don't see this
kind of stuff that much but subscription

345
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,049
to you

346
00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:27,620
a complaint pro like content is like 10

347
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:32,140
the are big thing to know I'll be shown
in the video that like

348
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:35,480
there so in like social engineering
tricks which being used

349
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,090
are to get people to subscribe to
particular content are other thing

350
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:43,019
arm know also that this thing on DVD as
well like just where to direct

351
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:46,419
arm your computer has been locked

352
00:20:46,419 --> 00:20:50,390
I hear the phone number send me like
2,000 rubles

353
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:53,769
I'll send you a lot caught your you
would be able to use the San all should

354
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:57,539
in a moment but the thing is in Russia
in order to have like

355
00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:00,960
mobile phone the only thing that you
need is a popular passport

356
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,059
which is also available for like five
dollars per copy

357
00:21:05,059 --> 00:21:08,970
and in one hand so that technically if
you want to have absolutely anonymous

358
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:11,390
phone number li that's where it would be
possible

359
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:14,669
and then what you do you have like a
phone number you make people like

360
00:21:14,669 --> 00:21:15,740
sending you money

361
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:19,330
and periodically you got Utah the telco
and you can

362
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:22,880
are you can say I don't want this number
anymore I one catch or you can like

363
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,730
transfer your balance

364
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:27,840
other number and click can work together
but their ways of converting your phone

365
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,440
number Bella do cash arm

366
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,860
nothing that we see up as well like did

367
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,049
distinguished taken directly from %ah
arm

368
00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:41,460
an Android application were up

369
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,710
on there is a called the Gateway were
together

370
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:48,350
arm numbers are SummerSlam

371
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:52,429
were to get the numbers to sent this
message do but

372
00:21:52,429 --> 00:21:56,220
that's like one other thing that we see
as well

373
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,309
like mobile scams like with what to look
for a couple occasions

374
00:21:59,309 --> 00:22:03,159
I think this year like it's a big one
this like one of the examples like

375
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:06,460
Opera Mini which is are

376
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:09,679
arm it used to be like on law

377
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,080
up market is wall are you can also
download directly from like %ah

378
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,610
this particular website like some song
blocked 325

379
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:24,659
are you which support to be an
application distribution worked for up

380
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:28,440
arm I'll for some some like mobile
phones

381
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,500
but if you start looking into the cause
like Arctic

382
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,789
a unicorn you one thing which will
notice like is

383
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:39,029
most of the arm joke what is like skated
like if you see

384
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:43,070
arm like we could be compiled the stuff
on if you see it like most of the

385
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,679
classes they basically

386
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:48,059
are being loaded dynamically so doing
likes thick

387
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:51,669
analysis on this gonna publications I
would say would be very difficult

388
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:55,080
and I think that we've seen are on
Android application is basically

389
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,730
there's like multi-stage lot so arm
application that gets

390
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:02,830
loaded through the app market right away
is some

391
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:05,970
cleanup ligation with doesn't have any
malicious function was

392
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:09,039
X exception for that it a Lowes

393
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:13,279
user to install updates and the
malicious payload would be like

394
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:17,559
wasn't update and the thing is like out
with this kind of model we like so

395
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:18,350
difficult

396
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:22,070
if you'd like to hear are not as good
you have to be able to simulate

397
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:25,490
real user using the application in order
to trigger

398
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:28,490
update mechanism and then yeah gets
difficult

399
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:32,559
but then nothing which is interesting is
actually haldeman is a sure thing is

400
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:33,630
happening here

401
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:37,200
so basically um

402
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,620
E in russia like there's a way to become
a content provider so anyone can become

403
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,929
a content provider

404
00:23:42,929 --> 00:23:46,100
if I have particular content I can go to
telecom I can

405
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:50,019
arm arm I get and I D

406
00:23:50,019 --> 00:23:53,850
and arm document for the API and the way
it works

407
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:57,940
through this API I sent a mobile phone
number to the telecom

408
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:02,549
and I can also specify right like the
content of the estimates which will get

409
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:06,240
sent to the up disarm of mobile phone

410
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,620
owner and then arm the pellicle will
send a confirmation code

411
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:16,639
to this mobile phone owner so a son the
mobile phone or near provides me with

412
00:24:16,639 --> 00:24:17,840
the

413
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,260
arm the confirmation code number I
through the API I can send this

414
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,190
confirmation go to the telecom

415
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:28,950
and I if the confirmation code is
correct I can subscribe user

416
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:33,210
on content which technically means I can
build issues are like

417
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:36,220
in this particular case like 300

418
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:39,539
rubles which is like so didn't get per
months

419
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:42,820
arm I'm on

420
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:46,919
on a limited period of time so unless
user discover that skews been subscribed

421
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:47,850
to the content

422
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:51,870
and apps apps unsubscribe like I'll be
like new key

423
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:55,279
and this kind of abuses like very
widespread

424
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,980
arm telecoms I think telecoms in this
situation dick

425
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,760
they sort of like on on both sites on
one side there's like

426
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:06,200
supposed to be protecting their users
but on the other side

427
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,690
more users pay Mo Money telecoms gets
all they make

428
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:13,419
like they have bit in order to show user
that they actually

429
00:25:13,419 --> 00:25:17,380
like good guys they have requirement in
the API specification that

430
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:22,600
whenever someone installs an application
which of Christ you look at the content

431
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,860
there should be a statement saying that
you will be built

432
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:29,600
and the amount of money an actual I can
do for you particular application there

433
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,600
is a statement

434
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,760
arm if you look at into the applications
through Android phone

435
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,179
just like some HTML content the dish
shows to the user

436
00:25:38,179 --> 00:25:41,779
and just what it basically say that
though the application is still

437
00:25:41,779 --> 00:25:44,830
but if you start looking to HTML code
arm

438
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:48,740
there is there is actually a notice
saying that itself up

439
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:52,740
paid for our content and that's how much
your you gonna be built

440
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:55,970
and what you will notice your is up

441
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:59,889
that dick this content is being
displayed displayed was a

442
00:25:59,889 --> 00:26:03,210
on style on so it's not for being shown

443
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:06,600
arm when the application is actually
being installed

444
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:11,360
and that is how like the malicious
applications find disc

445
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,549
this balance 0 on one hand that you
provided information

446
00:26:14,549 --> 00:26:17,649
on the other hand the user who saw the
application doesn't see but the

447
00:26:17,649 --> 00:26:18,370
requirement

448
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:21,830
is that by the telecom is that they
should be the statement

449
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:25,169
the requirement doesn't say that should
be visible to the end user

450
00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:28,539
and dynamic lot of stuff like this

451
00:26:28,539 --> 00:26:31,929
so arm I think like a creeper couple of
reduce

452
00:26:31,929 --> 00:26:35,029
I'll last week at to russia so are

453
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:39,000
we just recorded like arm read if you
experiment so

454
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,039
one thing which we did we went to the
young bucks office

455
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:45,299
and Yandex is basically a Russian Google
sort of thing it's like

456
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:48,419
biggest %uh search engine to do are

457
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:51,880
mal were not as though the basically
whatever Google Docs gender doesn't hold

458
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,679
it does have Google Maps

459
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,289
arm so we did a couple experiments arm

460
00:26:57,289 --> 00:27:01,580
a arm look at least of our

461
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:04,840
up binder networks which we know that

462
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,200
are they serve malicious content and arm

463
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,539
everywhere I'll we were running like
arson books

464
00:27:11,539 --> 00:27:14,580
environment soda i can text that works
even

465
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:17,970
would get infected and under like

466
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:21,279
ninety-nine percent of like occasions we
would not be served

467
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:24,419
any malicious content and there is a
reason for this and

468
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:27,519
the reason is that all the young the
tape addresses that was in the Black

469
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:28,200
Keys

470
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:35,200
arm I'll probably start the video so we
can

471
00:27:57,239 --> 00:28:02,780
I'm not very good

472
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:07,210
so basically arm what also others to our

473
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:10,289
of things that like you will notice

474
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:14,820
that the guys up arm like to stay with
the guys that they can in order to

475
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,460
provide

476
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:19,159
31 automated analysis so what are the
things is on

477
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:22,490
you know there's a particular euro and
are

478
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:25,539
it will also malicious content through
the banner

479
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:29,650
what are the things that up we got it
just think that you're a new diaper

480
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:30,880
directly to the browser

481
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,450
you will not be sure my work I think
it's

482
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:40,250
that again yet but

483
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:44,970
are so basically you have to to find
that web site through search engine and

484
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:46,080
that's what we are

485
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,140
up gonna do here I'll

486
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:56,140
star DVD a and also like I'll

487
00:29:16,029 --> 00:29:19,610
okay

488
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:26,610
will

489
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:31,210
so basically pretension on on ARM on the
process lives here

490
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:36,280
so you'll feel like up what arm yeah
I'll probably go back so good

491
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:43,280
some other you

492
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:58,730
up

493
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:12,430
a look

494
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:40,150
so basically up pay attention on this
thing so this is likely for the

495
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:41,260
processes we just saw

496
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:44,940
up last are like though proxy

497
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,970
and like a the process monitor so you
can see what's happening

498
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:53,850
and on so on

499
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:58,960
what this website is basically all and
mom like medicine

500
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,880
trading like website so long sure will
order the

501
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,060
in search engine like we young pics here
because

502
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:09,770
up like that so Russian search engine
but like pretty much

503
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:13,150
don't text Google being like any search
engine

504
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:17,430
as a sinus the search engine is in the
river the malicious content will be

505
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:22,070
serve and what will happen here like we
basically just click on

506
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:25,100
arm like online medicine

507
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,310
website so the trick happen and start
paying attention on

508
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:34,720
on the process least hopes so

509
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,460
are what we see here already like this
is also like a blackhole exploit back

510
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:43,080
it launches the Java exploit you can see
Joe is being loaded

511
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,310
arm operate is being executed

512
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:50,180
the good thing about are up

513
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:53,730
this particular job on an ability that
it's a where the reliable

514
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:57,750
home there's like and there is no impact
on the

515
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:01,540
VM what you will see it at this point so
at this point these guys already

516
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,260
compromised

517
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:05,320
so you consider executable being started

518
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:08,400
and in this particular are like

519
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,400
the type of it I'm basically people who

520
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,860
corn exploit pics in people who run who

521
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:18,400
up all the executable some usually like
two different

522
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:22,140
group of people so up and the way it
works

523
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:25,940
arm the share was are people call

524
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:30,230
who ride I'll this executables dictated
by cher was from the

525
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:33,350
are like exploit back owners or

526
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:37,440
addiction expert like itself is also
like paid for sure was

527
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,490
so you can basically say I want to
disturb it is binary through this

528
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:41,340
exploit back

529
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:45,080
and through this up %ah tedious traffic

530
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:48,370
and like did this particular website

531
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:51,980
are either he's compromised or I

532
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:55,500
YouTube on your network that so are the
also

533
00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:01,220
traffic too tedious so um was the binary
is being executed

534
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:04,260
are this guy basically like continue
shopping but

535
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:08,470
arm %uh there's particular delay here
before

536
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:11,630
his machine gets locked and arm

537
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:15,700
I was showing it'll in a slight drizzle
are

538
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:22,700
yesil let's get to the delays in like
technically nothing happens because like

539
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,680
this like the guys basically just like
candy is browsing and

540
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,000
there's just are a particular style

541
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,730
sleep time before the machine gets
locked so

542
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:40,170
what happens at this point are the
machine gets locked

543
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:43,170
and in order to get the unlock code you
have to like

544
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:46,980
are the balance transfer to this phone
number that the the thing which was

545
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,520
showing

546
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,630
and on the probability of like

547
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:54,780
catching this is like up

548
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:59,210
extremely high cuz like up the key word
that we were using for to

549
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:03,300
search engine is is just online like
shock for me to sing like

550
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:06,750
up one of the like popular key works

551
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:10,560
and like this is just like an example
above said they're like

552
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,150
a bunch of them cuz what the thing it
here is that the conflict is not being

553
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:14,900
served

554
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:18,580
through this website the content is
being sure through the banner network

555
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:18,920
that

556
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,960
uses this website as a advertisement but
for

557
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:28,960
and I'll show

558
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,440
arm another example where they actually
has

559
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,900
we were running the whole thing on om
their job auction in this example

560
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:43,530
and arm just and other

561
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:47,620
are arm opener online like worry

562
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:50,850
also like this kind of content if you

563
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:54,980
like we did experiments were rendered
full like Hong Kong Taiwan IP addresses

564
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:58,250
you not being said served a malicious
content and

565
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:01,640
are that's also the reason why like in
young dicks or

566
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,910
in Google or in being you will not see
this content

567
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:08,460
arm being marked as like malicious
because

568
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:12,130
day limit distribution like the target
distribution

569
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:15,700
only to the IP addresses which they
believe they can cash in and

570
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:20,590
are also dodi's only particular time of
the day so for example

571
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:24,750
in Russia people start surfing web
during the lunch break

572
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:27,880
when they can go online and start
reading news and arm

573
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:32,180
so this up on your network which you um

574
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:37,690
let's get to the website

575
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:42,280
so on

576
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,530
forget I'll basically get to the library
arm

577
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:49,270
and are better so on like the cold like

578
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:54,080
I desert ok are it's about a network
which will display advertisements here

579
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:58,050
so um aidid the teaser don't buy network

580
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:01,360
like technically I'm I'll believe that

581
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,620
the sole purpose of setting up this I
don't Eisman company

582
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,940
or dip on your network ease to
distribute mahler

583
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:11,460
but the reason why this to you can
protect your like

584
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,830
as the running Lidgerwood businesses
because a malicious content

585
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:18,370
only showed once per IP op per cookie

586
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:22,290
be the content the malicious content is
only sure do in particular time of the

587
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:22,830
day

588
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:26,360
so I don't like nighttime with a body
like and these people are sleeping

589
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,530
or and other the rest of the world is
not

590
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:33,720
relevant because saw don't distribute
the content to particular IP addresses

591
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:37,010
and be up lunch

592
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:42,150
so and what you'll see here use like
very similar thing it's also like

593
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:46,700
arm Joe exploit you can see the like Joe
adjustable was started

594
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:50,460
then up does the whole process of

595
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,600
dropping an executable actually happens
in two steps

596
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:57,310
so the Java exploit will fix the loader
the purpose of the law order is to be

597
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:59,770
able to execute on multiple number of
platforms

598
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:03,330
so Windows XP Windows 2k our windows

599
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:06,930
8 up and then the laudable fish the
actual

600
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:10,810
payload was a use a full content

601
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:13,900
and are in this particular case arm

602
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:17,450
their job but binary had go you can see
the

603
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:21,310
arm there is a binary star Dirk

604
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:25,930
here the Pioneer had dog your
fertilization addiction salon

605
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:29,790
executed like on all nope court which

606
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:32,810
other VirtualBox generated saw crash

607
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:36,210
and this is basically the whole thing
just like to print ultimate analysis

608
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:39,760
but nothing which I want to show here is
you want go

609
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,480
arm this thing is over the money issues

610
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,850
because he was sure through this website
automatically executed in our machine

611
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:50,890
start arm if you like due to

612
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:55,940
antivirus scan for this thing I'll
probably just skip directly to the

613
00:37:55,940 --> 00:38:00,460
and you are

614
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:04,230
so basically what we do every we went to
our struggle right away

615
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:09,150
got the binary up a little I'll refer to
website

616
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:12,410
and you can see like are right now we
like

617
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:15,620
on that is a scan

618
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:18,830
happening like in it takes some time

619
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:22,260
and you can see the dick detection rate
of the the binary like

620
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:25,780
was your out of luck with you 41
underwater singer

621
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:29,010
and that's basically the like the
reality order

622
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:33,040
cybercrime thing happening in russia
like on most dangerous is that like

623
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,970
people have installed on their computers

624
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:38,870
that like technically useless arm

625
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:42,230
another thing which I want to show you
on

626
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:45,690
i think im overspending my time one

627
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:48,710
this thing instead of west lies with
like I'll just

628
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:53,160
briefly show our another video

629
00:38:53,160 --> 00:39:00,160
on demonization think

630
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:03,540
and this thing like we basically just
recorded like yesterday

631
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:06,560
us to projective it's the same thing on

632
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,800
you go to like live so you fight it
through the search engine but in this

633
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,750
case

634
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:14,940
are they not bother like trying to
install any by noon you

635
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:19,800
what I will see here you so

636
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,570
I'll just keep directed to the content I
think

637
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:27,930
so one thing like there's an offer to
download updates

638
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:32,020
to an offer don't put on what update for
up

639
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:35,600
was your brother and that's like the
whole thing is obviously fake

640
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,950
but up how this thing gets monetized

641
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:42,550
one flaw there's an offer to you like up

642
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:46,320
download an update arm you start alarm

643
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,310
the whole like the whole process is
stimulated with JavaScript in your

644
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:50,070
browser

645
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:53,210
and that there is a pop-up window are in
order to like

646
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:56,840
complete update please do was up the
phone number and

647
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,960
like information got and what will
happen in this case

648
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:03,400
is there's like there is no malicious
payload there is no executable

649
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,820
it just the whole thing just like pure
social engineering so what will happen

650
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,030
in this case

651
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:12,570
your entered and up the phone number SMS
will get get sent

652
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:15,570
are to this number are the user enters
the

653
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:18,630
up subscription code like

654
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:22,140
the durations like it you can see one is
like the update another one isn't your

655
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:22,940
thing

656
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:27,170
but basically the mechanism the same you
entered the code to get subscribe to the

657
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:30,260
arm to the content

658
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:34,220
so that's basically like on like

659
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:37,570
if you like ok arm the common thread
that you'll you'll see was the like

660
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:40,610
cybercrime are in Russia in

661
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:44,790
I'll just go back to my size and I'll
show you I'll

662
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:50,420
what else we doing with this stuff

663
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:53,440
so on what we basically trying to arm

664
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,040
built here is arm two projects

665
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:01,170
one is are we trying to be I'll ultimate
detection of the C&C

666
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:05,480
once machines get infected and and
nothing that we do we tried to

667
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,620
ultimate detection of Rick targets

668
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:12,340
and have some automated notification
mechanism

669
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:16,740
for the Rick target owners before of
questions get compromised

670
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:20,720
so basically we're trying to pay are
killed infrastructure

671
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,280
and be killed up like the week

672
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:29,820
week about the rebel targets for the so
one other thing that we do is up

673
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:33,450
are we do %uh C&C are

674
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:37,680
arm 16 CR other difficult issue

675
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,680
for the I'll DNS traffic analysis

676
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,770
this morning there was like a tow
compressive DNS if you were the doctor

677
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:45,620
probably know what preceded missus

678
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:49,000
if not in short we have an ISP that
sense

679
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,400
up every get us back at the troll
through that it is over

680
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,470
descent a copy of the picket Ross are
and

681
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:59,880
on we do %uh processing of that stuff so
our

682
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:04,340
input is basically Guinness packets one
thing which on

683
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:07,790
are technically you don't have to
actually a

684
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:10,970
have your aunt Eunice connectors was I
see the dorky

685
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:15,120
you can get access to draw traffic but
I'll one thing which

686
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:19,300
you'll be missing their is in order to
do notebook that correlation you also

687
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,340
want to see

688
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:24,130
are IP addresses of the machines which
looked up this particular the mains

689
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:28,110
in addition to like what the mainstay
looked up what was the result of the

690
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:32,090
look up and so on and up um

691
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:36,550
I see they have this %ah our privacy
policy so they're not giving up

692
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:41,380
away the IP addresses of are the
machines which I were looking up to

693
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:44,610
the domain names and that's one of the
reasons why we decided to build

694
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:48,450
are on basic do nothing arm

695
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:52,240
and was a spike over are generated the
mains that's like

696
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,230
one of the common ways for the botnets
you are call back and find their

697
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:59,250
control center but that's not the only
one

698
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:05,660
I don't think anyone recognize what's on
on this growing in an hour

699
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:09,380
it's like a twitter-like social network
very popular in

700
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:13,480
asia-pacific but like that like another
way like we've seen

701
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:16,810
this year as well arm basically they're
like

702
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:20,120
in court up posts on like teacher like
playing

703
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:23,270
which is basically all a reference to a
sincere

704
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:26,660
address but we're not looking into this
thing

705
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:29,990
so on if you start looking a bit road
traffic

706
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:33,470
no traffic goodwill will look like this
I will have like a bunch of are doing

707
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:33,920
this

708
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,920
Aquarius was al- up

709
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,130
our responses which other would-be up

710
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:44,590
nonexistent the main which like orkut
2009

711
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:48,640
get aspect or our names there were frail
which will be like three

712
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,620
and then only a few are the main through
wasn't a

713
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:57,110
similar group would return like
successfully returned IP address

714
00:43:57,110 --> 00:44:01,600
and our detection mechanism is basically
all based on this principle so

715
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:05,180
ever tried to identified this kind of
nice

716
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:09,410
and grew by that the brain similarity
from the dog in this traffic

717
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:13,180
be up we're trying to identify

718
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:16,890
arm like 813 identified the group like
the cluster

719
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:20,050
be were trying to identify IP addresses
which my

720
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:23,560
your so we have like links for the
infrastructure and

721
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,810
us since we have like preserved are are
preserved in is that are based

722
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:30,630
we can do up back in force look up on a
vacancy

723
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:34,940
so for this IP address I what were the
minute you seem like

724
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:38,090
week ago or like so far for our which

725
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:41,300
ever pointed to this IP address and then
we can basically start

726
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:45,500
recourse if a recursive mining of the
infrastructure this way

727
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:49,210
and arm I'll just show like a couple of
our

728
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:53,630
screech of are one of the like but thats
which was like popular this year

729
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:56,810
September almost like cock Arbor arm

730
00:44:56,810 --> 00:45:00,750
typical distribution is like drive-by
arm

731
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:04,110
I have their growing waistlines like but
I think it's like

732
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:07,830
well up where'er

733
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:13,470
on komen for for like the stuff that I
was shoving on the media that basically

734
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:17,670
of one of the few examples and I'll just
give directly to the

735
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:21,870
to the detection saw roughly like work
arc

736
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:25,040
architecture looks like we have and ISP
in Russia

737
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:29,460
which agreed to send us all there DNS
traffic we have a collector

738
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:32,880
at the collector point we do some
filtering do some

739
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,880
one of the things we shoot which you
will notice when you get are a lot of

740
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,060
DNS traffic

741
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:40,780
there's a lot of real we are interested
really likes to the starting point it's

742
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:41,920
failed craters

743
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,220
but there's a lot of for it quarters for
like in other other

744
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:48,770
RP look up quick reverse lookups there
are also a lot of

745
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:52,230
like Phil quarters for some of
hard-coded

746
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:55,430
domain names for like either particular
software wonders

747
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:59,490
or like chrome you just saw randomly
generated domain names

748
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:03,090
and on the collector point we basically
doing this fifteen

749
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:06,840
so we can minimize the vote on the rest
of the infrastructure

750
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:10,030
arm the rest of the infrastructure is
basically built on

751
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:14,160
three russians sleep like it's not like
Big Data sort of Leon is is but

752
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,810
and we clustered it would like to
integrate data by

753
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:21,780
the POC so we have a definition that
like for example are ready for his like

754
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:26,080
2-3 days and then we on with which to in
your arm

755
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:29,680
read his file and then we week arm also
do

756
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:33,750
historical indexing so we can see we can
sit have quitters like

757
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:38,120
foot show me which domain names ever
were pointing to this particular IP

758
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:38,750
address

759
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:42,070
and like that kind of stuff is being
done in arm

760
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:45,120
analyzer so what do we do on indexing
for

761
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:48,820
all I real time porque indexing reuse

762
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:52,640
I read this up for all historical

763
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,960
are breakers were you seen and machine
is basically running as a

764
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:01,380
arm like plus away so we have like
several policy asshole or not

765
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:05,840
and wish our data between them and
analyzer basically is capable of doing

766
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:09,150
are request into both things and I think
that we

767
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:12,820
arm that we are capable of

768
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:16,780
up what that we have in our arm system
is

769
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:21,180
lets you quise lookup because one of the
things we which we notice this year

770
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:24,290
a up by mining patterns through

771
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:27,520
who he's dating you arm you can

772
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,740
there's basically way so far like aural
exciters

773
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:33,820
that you can apply to identify
potentially malicious domain names

774
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:36,810
even before the being used so like what
are the types of things that we know it

775
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:37,370
is a

776
00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:40,830
the mood for gestational but I prickly
one-year arm

777
00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:44,090
only particular registers are often
being used by

778
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:48,040
arm botnet musters so we have like to
set of senator that we may have to

779
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:48,920
bequeath

780
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:51,940
there is also a problem with the co I
was quitting quiz data

781
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:55,160
a because it's %uh human readable text
so

782
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:58,280
in art there's like it so difficult to
do automatic parsing

783
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:01,760
so we just have like regular expressions
for whose data another problem with

784
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,290
wheeze data is

785
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:06,890
arm like for DNS traffic we just click
Post to press release

786
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:10,370
so there is no limitation on the

787
00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:13,750
on the bottom but was the quiz data I'll

788
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:17,780
the biggest problem is if you if you do
ball clock up on the quiz you can just

789
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:18,590
get blocked

790
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:22,950
so the solution at three we have so far
we have like round-robin quiz proxy so

791
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:23,430
we can

792
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:26,500
arm balance are like we've

793
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:29,890
look up so deformations and be um

794
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:33,010
our quiz lookup is like lazy are with

795
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:36,690
we've done it in the lazy form so are
what we do is

796
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:40,140
if you wanna the main we were trying to
do who is look up arm

797
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:44,580
component the quiz logo lookup confident
control the threshold of

798
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:49,500
are how many we saw requests per second
we can do without being blocked

799
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,960
and then official whose information and
reported into

800
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,980
arm are ready stock component as well

801
00:48:55,980 --> 00:49:00,190
and one other things was that like the
one of the reasons why

802
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:03,680
we believe it's necessary if you do like
a real time our

803
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:07,660
malicious the main analysis is to fish
with information because

804
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:11,650
the behavior that we noticed this year
and I'll I have some date on this

805
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:16,200
is some other quiz data is life only for
like 30 minutes

806
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:19,820
and the reason for this I'll like fall
for the bad guy

807
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:22,980
that's where like handy feature because

808
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:26,720
like the main Texas on the internet
space for 30 minutes

809
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,270
was the winner of it like disappears
from the internet

810
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:34,170
so if you didn't catch it at the moment
when the main was in use

811
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:37,640
you don't have any information you don't
you don't you know which reduced our

812
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:40,730
the main was the biggest through up

813
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:46,670
you don't have any black you don't have
any leads to the actual identity

814
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:49,900
so other sure like a quick arm

815
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:53,160
walkthrough like this spring this whole
process automated

816
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:56,510
but if you were doing it step by step
arm you can just

817
00:49:56,510 --> 00:49:59,770
directly connect or like Greg you saw
indexer

818
00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:04,150
and you quoted the domain names
whichever similar arm

819
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:08,130
distribution was in the EPL so any
you'll notice that like

820
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:11,570
this particular group the maze with
particular pattern and where similar

821
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:12,790
distribution here

822
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:16,950
and in this case we have the main switch
our name servers are frail

823
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:20,910
which means like most other the main
aims where registered at one point of

824
00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:21,430
time

825
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:25,190
so they were already used by Mauer and
either the good scene called

826
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:30,100
or are disabled or like abuse complaint
was filled in

827
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:34,530
but the more interesting thing is you
can also get the distribution for a

828
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:35,830
domain names

829
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:39,340
which are a nonexistent and the reason
why I think

830
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:43,180
like this is where useful beautiful
information

831
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:47,130
is if you want to take over the botnet
all you have to do is

832
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:50,190
you take like 11 USD

833
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:54,090
go to like the cheapest register
available regard to start is the main

834
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:54,830
aim

835
00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:58,510
install the shoes the software on the
machine and the bookstore connecting to

836
00:50:58,510 --> 00:50:59,000
you

837
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,650
and like that's like super cheap

838
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:08,530
legal and effortless so anyway like what
once you get the better of like

839
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:11,700
arm either like non-existent domain for
failed the mains

840
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:15,130
what we do we arm as the wind s

841
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:18,430
DNS pickets come in once we done all the
children begin to rate

842
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:22,710
we tried to cluster the way similarity
so once were up

843
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:26,020
once we index the cluster domain names
we have like

844
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:29,450
group of group for the movies which we
can start looking up by

845
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:33,120
by cluster number looks so I want to see
the main aim Group

846
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:37,300
which matches this group so um

847
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:41,140
and in Vegas we basically broken into
like three fields

848
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:45,200
so you have the man in question id: and
are Erica so we can

849
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,980
like look up things quickly so then we
will pick up like the cluster

850
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:53,510
on arm bill are like close are you to
that

851
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:56,520
we believe might belong to the botnet

852
00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:00,160
and we get the Holy starved of matching
that the mains included

853
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:04,100
the main switch either like fail
pictures that and current

854
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:07,680
and also dislike big fish you actually
get to see

855
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:11,870
on shouldn't arm DNS packets which were
60

856
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:15,070
which at the moment when your morning
during are

857
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:18,200
which were successful and return IP
addresses from

858
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:21,500
and that's what I'm sure you here and
from this point you can actually start

859
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:21,840
doing

860
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:25,150
recourse if look up for the whole thing

861
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:29,100
and what we notices you want to like the
main aims were fresh

862
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:32,920
some other the right the miners did were
not registered on the winners were

863
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:33,590
failed

864
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:36,600
but if you google for this domain names
you'll find nothing

865
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:41,920
are they not in any triggers but if you
start looking by IP address which

866
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:45,560
these words are true belongs to you will
see other autonomous system or

867
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:49,850
in this particular case used up IP
address directly or what makes them

868
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:53,400
multiple triggers something this like
from semantic this is from the party

869
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,180
will trigger

870
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:57,650
and the same IP address foot like their
penises

871
00:52:57,650 --> 00:53:01,270
as you should which cost in for starter
the don't change much but like the

872
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:02,330
domain names

873
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:06,050
of fluctuate a lot and from this point
because we were able to provide the

874
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:06,570
least

875
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:10,450
of the domain names which may
potentially be used by attacker

876
00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:15,190
we can generate like a up on-the-fly
senators for the traffic monitoring

877
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:18,720
and we can like want them when the way
look up a successful

878
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:22,090
there would be a lot of like up ship
record for this euros which is

879
00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:27,370
basically go back to the seen ceasing

880
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:30,900
and and nothing which which comes handy
when you

881
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:34,320
do this kind of like a corset lookup you
start was like

882
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:38,360
picking up randomly give you a domain
name is based on similarity and

883
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:42,300
and the noise at the CRI India's traffic
but you can also find a

884
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:45,430
at one point of time there were like
some the main switch which look what did

885
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:46,310
you read

886
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:49,940
all for example style of god yes that's
like just a Russian work

887
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:53,070
and there is no way if you are just like
analyzing the maze like this

888
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:56,850
there's no way you would pick this one
out or like LeBron closer look net

889
00:53:56,850 --> 00:53:59,960
or legume Rd my Ltd which was showing
here

890
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:03,370
again you can see it one other
interesting things that like from

891
00:54:03,370 --> 00:54:07,290
are like this do not you can see the
lifetime for each particular the main is

892
00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:11,800
only like up to five minutes so the
mains have greater schork

893
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:17,050
life span and unless you like are able
to do like real time detection

894
00:54:17,050 --> 00:54:21,580
there is no way you can do like if you
pick it up from the box and start like

895
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:24,380
writing your like final booking looks in
the evening

896
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:28,080
by the time domain is not in use anymore
and that's but also the reason why we

897
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:28,870
have so many

898
00:54:28,870 --> 00:54:32,630
arm failed names are a family cap so

899
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:35,770
once the means were disposed there are
two ways a

900
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:39,080
I will should like the restricted the
main just disappears

901
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:43,910
and be out the name servers will be
pointing to like lou back or

902
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:47,800
are in case if if that the way to a sink
all that will be pointing to

903
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:51,080
like cop Conficker sync all I Peters

904
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:55,330
and sought so wants you to the
automation Richard able to do like

905
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:59,450
this is basically the gruff but Tom
withdrew from the outperform like our

906
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:00,710
automation script

907
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:04,410
and if you do in bed with you hollick
it'll be interesting closer would look

908
00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:05,590
like so you have like

909
00:55:05,590 --> 00:55:08,720
a bunch of the main aims ritually
basically pointing to

910
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:12,250
more or less all up either the same IP
address ok it could be dangerous with

911
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:12,900
the same

912
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:16,790
chic sick last summer and that's like an
hour detections group we can

913
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:20,550
like have all the slick ball that we can
whether we want to be fixed for

914
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:21,880
particular IP address

915
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:25,850
because it's still like try and there
are sort of thing in some cases are

916
00:55:25,850 --> 00:55:29,490
in some for some IP ranges the whole
c-class could be malicious

917
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:32,620
and me up in this group would you that
we

918
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:36,820
we want to look up for all the domain
names that point to the same c-class

919
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:42,010
in some cases will be a single IP is
showed a screenshot

920
00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:45,090
so are and I think through like we're
playing around

921
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:48,210
Russian business network apprentice to
active like

922
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:52,120
the traffic that we get start collecting
traffic from last year jewel now

923
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:55,830
so and you still see the up IP addresses
like if u

924
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:59,560
look into your ok where there's a
reference to it that belongs to

925
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:04,570
on like but was local RBN

926
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:08,530
in terms of law like for it's a a small

927
00:56:08,530 --> 00:56:11,980
well reducing disp in arm

928
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:16,030
in Russia whole and in terms of what we
only get like around

929
00:56:16,030 --> 00:56:19,430
2000 packets per second like not that
much so

930
00:56:19,430 --> 00:56:23,070
um the initial collector we only have
like 30 to Dec so from

931
00:56:23,070 --> 00:56:27,050
and be able to like and older

932
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:30,180
all so this like roughly like how much

933
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:33,830
biggest for dairy receive arm good

934
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:37,090
a model the like militias the main its

935
00:56:37,090 --> 00:56:40,870
roughly like well all those were the
ones who are like

936
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:45,820
love them but but other things all since
it's like an irregular means we can see

937
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:48,910
actually the tendency of like recurring
I'll

938
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:52,490
look up so for your particular domains
there would be up to like

939
00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:56,000
saw 100 lookups like we're currently so

940
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,050
if you want to my like unique aw

941
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:03,590
demands for mean it like that de verge
we get

942
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:06,880
and how can you use like this data
obvious like you can runtime: you know

943
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,560
it but was that you can book on
firewalls

944
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:13,550
yeah thing a ma I'm running of time so I
want to finish this

945
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:17,500
are nothing you can let's start doing
like a book that's in Corning taking

946
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,160
over the botnets

947
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:22,970
arm like other stuff as well

948
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:26,140
this isn't like one of the interesting
things like for sale I'll ask you a

949
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:27,900
question there may be a up

950
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:31,230
I'll explain 10 things which we start
like noticing this year

951
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:36,420
is there's a number of the main switch
jobs also used as a CNC for the botnets

952
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:40,150
and the way they look like you just put
a concatenated works

953
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:43,620
but what's special about this domain is
not like you in the zone where the

954
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:45,240
register but

955
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:49,350
I'll if the main is currently being in
use for you can actually see 289 DNS

956
00:57:49,350 --> 00:57:50,090
traffic

957
00:57:50,090 --> 00:57:53,200
you look it up you get the dinners data
but if like

958
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:57,610
if you start looking up like an hour are
after the the main aim is a

959
00:57:57,610 --> 00:58:01,170
like not appearing in DNS traffic
anymore just get up

960
00:58:01,170 --> 00:58:05,550
the mayor on like we've not found how is
this possible

961
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:10,160
like good for us we'll initiative we
didn't have like a clear answer to this

962
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:14,160
later we talk to one of the biggest
erson he pointed us to one of the

963
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:17,820
lick possible ways but like we believe
probably like 10 the registers was

964
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:18,880
compromised

965
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:22,890
but I'll nothing but like what are the
biggest your cell attract attention on

966
00:58:22,890 --> 00:58:26,700
is a you can actually have like if you
buy are shoes in the shop right so you

967
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:27,380
can

968
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:30,460
take the shoes you can try them on if
you don't have it wasn't like seven days

969
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:31,830
you can return the shoes

970
00:58:31,830 --> 00:58:35,110
the same thing you're going to do with
domain names and that's what

971
00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:38,850
I think that's the future the guys
figure out what particular registers

972
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:43,190
so you can take the men on trial you can
use it for 30 minutes

973
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:46,960
and then you can you can cancel the
order and want to cancel the order

974
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:51,380
are the information like one other
things like how to pick up the went on

975
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:52,390
trial is

976
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:56,380
but the money will be like up in Queens
up with a would-be

977
00:58:56,380 --> 00:59:00,690
in ut period which means the mean was
just purchased

978
00:59:00,690 --> 00:59:04,310
and then was in the trial period of time
they can return to the main

979
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:07,460
like automatically with the script this
this whole thing is done like were

980
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:08,620
descriptive like

981
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:11,740
was in the day that could be like over
300 domain names and I don't think it's

982
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:13,140
possible to you

983
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:16,920
like do the whole thing min early you
can cancel the transaction

984
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:20,180
it's gonna cost you roughly like if
you'd the win in court like eleven

985
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:20,990
dollars

986
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:24,420
you bitch to charge like roughly a
dollar but for a dollar you get

987
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:26,120
disposable domain name

988
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:29,440
which leaves no trace from the internet
so if you didn't catch this thing

989
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:35,230
when the main was active there is
nothing

990
00:59:35,230 --> 00:59:39,090
saw this is basically on the Guinness
face detection

991
00:59:39,090 --> 00:59:42,380
arm nothing that we do we also do like
proactive

992
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:46,260
network scanning per region very similar
QR

993
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:50,070
what up and I was showing our last year

994
00:59:50,070 --> 00:59:53,700
arm our basic risk any particular
religious

995
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:58,290
of IP addresses for server sis and soft
or running the dispersions and indexing

996
00:59:58,290 --> 00:59:59,070
this

997
00:59:59,070 --> 01:00:02,850
we like also used for producing and very
sticky like

998
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:06,800
you can scan the whole wheat bread like
this like some 36 from a paper was in

999
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:07,430
like

1000
01:00:07,430 --> 01:00:11,240
100 they say it's technically possible
to have it database

1001
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:14,630
but was in arm 100 days H

1002
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:19,010
can index like share with us on all
Internet for us we don't we don't

1003
01:00:19,010 --> 01:00:22,390
we're not he doesn't in the internet per
se but yet more interesting

1004
01:00:22,390 --> 01:00:25,500
graphically focused IP range just like

1005
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:29,250
was can't I want to risk in China arm

1006
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:32,500
was tore all the data on info database

1007
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:36,230
and one of the things like bill bill
items which are universities

1008
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:39,910
SN with the owner of dinner of the
network or the IP address

1009
01:00:39,910 --> 01:00:44,150
which country belongs to are you think
your IP location right now which is not

1010
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:45,200
very precise but

1011
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:49,610
we also lookup up get the location of
particular IP address

1012
01:00:49,610 --> 01:00:53,720
and we do some application
fingerprinting for if there is a web

1013
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:57,290
we are some replication fingerprinting
too so we can up

1014
01:00:57,290 --> 01:01:00,920
basically fire equator saying I wants
you

1015
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:04,080
all the people running arm

1016
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:07,760
all oil skimmers of particular worsen
was in Taipei City

1017
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:11,030
and like with this verified database
like that's where

1018
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:14,490
possible well just like rough air
architecture

1019
01:01:14,490 --> 01:01:17,810
arm like we have a UI but would like we
don't really use it

1020
01:01:17,810 --> 01:01:21,800
you I just if you wanna see from your
data is entered

1021
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:25,450
but basically you can are we have also
API that were conscripted

1022
01:01:25,450 --> 01:01:29,200
on lovers for repair work in query

1023
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:33,050
IP addresses way any combination of like
software regex

1024
01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:37,540
are like I so far been a regex at and
get a graphical occasion

1025
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:42,430
and ass and and and this happens like
immediately so if you want you know like

1026
01:01:42,430 --> 01:01:46,690
people running arm volatile weather
channel 4

1027
01:01:46,690 --> 01:01:51,000
op de la Cruz in Taipei City like it's
like really like less than a second you

1028
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,590
have that is the day progresses

1029
01:01:52,590 --> 01:01:56,240
and then this guy whole thing you can
basically like one of the you just like

1030
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:59,980
you can automate your script of like
once a new warm is been announced for

1031
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:00,650
like

1032
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:04,020
particular well plication your car you
can automate you screw that will

1033
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:07,340
just Fitch all the people running this
particular version of honorable thing

1034
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:11,650
and said automated up warning messages
but there's like a lot of other things

1035
01:02:11,650 --> 01:02:12,400
if you doing

1036
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:16,060
been testing you can say show me alder

1037
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:19,300
although vulnerable boss commercial
installations

1038
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:23,890
that belonged to malaysian telecom and
it's like a second query

1039
01:02:23,890 --> 01:02:27,360
saw nothing I'm roughly out of time so

1040
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:30,590
but if you have time for questions but
if you do

1041
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:36,850
yeah like to have some

1042
01:02:36,850 --> 01:02:40,770
weekend extended we could coffee break
right now

1043
01:02:40,770 --> 01:02:45,120
if you have questions we weekend doing
that during the coffee break

1044
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:48,800
but I do have to say we are starting at
4 o'clock with the next presentation so

1045
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:55,460
or if you brought like Rotten Tomatoes
shoes you can start rolling them as well

1046
01:02:55,460 --> 01:03:01,040
any questions any tomatoes

1047
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:04,390
so you know they have questions we can
have coffee alright well

1048
01:03:04,390 --> 01:03:08,780
what you want farm if you have questions
later

1049
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:11,900
that's hard to find me thanks

1050
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:18,900
thank you very much cuter

1051
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:22,340
ok

1052
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:24,100
this

1053
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:31,100
sleep
