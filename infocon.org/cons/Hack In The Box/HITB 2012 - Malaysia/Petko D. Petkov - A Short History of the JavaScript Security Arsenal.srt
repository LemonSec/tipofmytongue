1
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:08,630
be face

2
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:14,980
space

3
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:21,980
skills

4
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,580
we will have

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:30,640
that book Petkov which is the founder of
new citizen I don't need to

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,120
I need your let's introduce improperly
which

7
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,050
will the the tell us about a brief
history of JavaScript the

8
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,470
security arsenal go ahead

9
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:48,860
can you switch on the microphone

10
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,879
is Mike from this

11
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:56,520
is work okay

12
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,160
well first of all thank you for coming
actually a come see anybody

13
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:07,090
just the slightest too bright for me
well first will be 4i

14
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:11,009
before starting the the actual talk I
want to start with this

15
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:14,330
and basically this is a collection of
old movie posters

16
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:18,340
all the horror movies and now since you
already know what

17
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,740
talks going to be avail is you know
that's going to be about else could be

18
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,690
much rethinking

19
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:26,149
well they may be related somehow to the
fact that tells

20
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:29,819
it was a formal language and now and
that's why put all this stuff

21
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:34,459
well although this is true this talk is
not about

22
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:37,709
ahora voy this and all the security
stories

23
00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:40,869
concerns around JavaScript we all of

24
00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:43,890
fear-mongering is actually about that
all this

25
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,530
a movie star with the crates first and
is going to be very in Weiss

26
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:51,580
I'll for me if I start this talk without
giving the proper credits to everybody

27
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:56,640
who deserves that unfortunately when we
talk about history any to give credits

28
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,869
to a whole lot of people which are
called include

29
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:02,069
in a single slide therefore I use this
clever machinery

30
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:05,209
call 25 to hash some stuff

31
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:10,509
and without discredits I am and is
basically includes all kinds of people

32
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:14,230
which I work with and which contributed
to this great field

33
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:19,040
of Technology security now sees this is
a history talk

34
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,940
and there will be some demos so it's not
going to be that boring

35
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:26,319
a we need to start with first the ball

36
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,819
going through some of the mainly
harassments in the weather occasions

37
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:31,080
cutie space and where

38
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,840
what with applications in general so
first of all

39
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,550
a in the nineties we start from there
because this is when

40
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:42,430
this is the age me like most the
innovation that we still use today

41
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,460
we've got like shit teaming browsers
some

42
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,770
who actually recognize the first one
some

43
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,240
somebody how many of you recognize the
first browser

44
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,080
the first first I can I'm a few

45
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,630
a few so basically this is the very
first web browser it's got most like

46
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:04,250
and then lady not the case we have in
San Explorer Netscape Navigator

47
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:09,610
Netscape Navigator is actually based on
most like Isabel's about doing this area

48
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:13,080
era nineties we have the main really
innovation

49
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,510
I themselves browser technology we have
to competing browsers Internet Explorer

50
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:18,120
Netscape

51
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,490
they pretty much develop also the
technologies that we use today

52
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:24,920
now whether this is good or bad a lot of
people speculate about this

53
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,440
you can really tell I but this is the
time when JavaScript was even this is

54
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,270
the time when

55
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:33,420
session management cemented cookies us

56
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:39,520
story it's the h2b stack opry much
mature to the steinways actually usable

57
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,640
and a lot of Love Actually innovation
now if we compare the

58
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,220
this technology's 90s with what the
college's

59
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,569
today it's actually very different
picture because instead of having just

60
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:52,770
two competing browsers

61
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:56,050
which innovate we actually have 52 from
riles

62
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:59,210
and they all competing with each other
we don't have

63
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:04,510
only one specifications be actually
reach html5 specification JavaScript

64
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,210
actually has matured quite a bit

65
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:10,130
now we actually the rating like version
I don't know what we actually had to

66
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,780
step back a few versions even

67
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,860
because have some design decisions

68
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:19,100
we actually have representatives from
all while mobile workspace

69
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,880
by two main operating system and rate I
S

70
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,699
go client-side and server-side
technologies to a reached return

71
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:28,810
applications

72
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,900
the service tag represented by all kinds
of databases or call whatever

73
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,850
my sequel and also no sequel databases
which I should start to be right now

74
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:40,630
represent is all the more you controller
and Java

75
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:45,699
what north and of course Angry Birds
because is everywhere now

76
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:49,270
as you can see this is pretty much outs
to a lot of noise

77
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:54,400
in terms of up applications application
security and just with the case all

78
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,319
together these actions

79
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:58,370
too many decisions to take and actually

80
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:02,270
this is enhanced by the fact that it's
not just about the cause that we put on

81
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:02,919
the server

82
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:05,830
and the clock it's also about the
technology actually links all these

83
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,800
things together

84
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,159
and this is pretty much the fabrics have
the web I mean pretty much the %ah

85
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:11,340
services

86
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,360
right to a now I'll their

87
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,759
dot without which we cannot go any
further

88
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,020
they just basically so integrated into
the the your

89
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,770
daily lights and and the fabrics have
the internet week we can just remove it

90
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:28,319
it just becomes audit and is going to be
part of it

91
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,710
pretty much forever as long as we use
this novel technologies

92
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:36,870
but also because so hopeless on

93
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,240
the wet general as mature it from the

94
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,699
simple stack I've technology provided by
too many browsers

95
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:47,759
to whole industry a farm

96
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,809
of of Technology which actually is
pretty serious

97
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:54,919
about the stuff they develop on today
you can actually

98
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:58,370
you know today maybe someone is creating
service which actually will

99
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:02,569
be evaluated billions of dollars in the
very near future

100
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:06,379
so it is important eating the poor all
sink their security and that's why

101
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:07,340
security actually

102
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:11,960
in a bit has become a little bit of a
fashion so this is actually my own

103
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,639
all some photoshop skills as you can see
other actually created

104
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:20,009
cover a fashion magazine to show how

105
00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:23,719
sellable he will be if we actually start
talking about security

106
00:06:23,719 --> 00:06:27,430
in in the fashion world because russian
security

107
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:31,460
a quiet similar somewhere everything you
I'll be consoled

108
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:35,069
everything all becomes new again so
while today we look at the mall security

109
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:35,919
space

110
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,089
and it's very hot topic its gonna fade
away in the next five six years maybe

111
00:06:40,089 --> 00:06:43,370
maybe even longer else while you know

112
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,550
deep that you it will be

113
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:50,400
we can go back examining the same stuff
we're talking about today

114
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,120
or even five years ago

115
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,960
a very good picture to illustrate what
is happening in the web a big issue

116
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,949
security space

117
00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:02,949
is the talk with hacking techniques
which Jeremiah Grossman was actually

118
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:04,650
responsible kinda putting together

119
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:08,539
but is actually the work of everybody
during the

120
00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:12,020
the last the fight for use by 6/ CS

121
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:16,439
and I think if you started from 2007 on
icon find any other reference

122
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:20,129
but they actually about 50-60 even
seventy or

123
00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:24,059
issues every year which are aggregated
in circulation out this collection we

124
00:07:24,059 --> 00:07:24,939
actually

125
00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:29,339
the community big stole 10 which are the
most interesting or the most

126
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:32,849
has the most impact so I'm not gonna go
through

127
00:07:32,849 --> 00:07:36,819
all them individually one by one but is
actually very interesting less

128
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:40,499
because when you go to some of this
stuff you'll find out

129
00:07:40,499 --> 00:07:45,059
know all the issues on that list are
actually result

130
00:07:45,059 --> 00:07:48,240
and we actually researching for new
vulnerabilities

131
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,189
exploring new things while still lagging
behind with old stuff that has been

132
00:07:52,189 --> 00:07:52,809
reported

133
00:07:52,809 --> 00:07:56,669
and hasn't been fixed yet saw

134
00:07:56,669 --> 00:07:59,999
I'm gonna quickly go through some of
them like 2007

135
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:04,400
we've got a bunch of them I guess the
month most mime

136
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,469
every design to DNA spinning gmail

137
00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:13,099
hijacking technique 2008 the farce

138
00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:16,259
some kinda all kinds of stuff op

139
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:21,219
clickjacking actually appeared at that
time 2009

140
00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:24,319
we've got even more issues

141
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,289
HPP which a steep Armida pollution which
is actually something that

142
00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:32,890
even today actually is a it's a good bit
concerned hasn't been explored March

143
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:36,440
2010 Eva kooky

144
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:41,099
and all kinds of stuff 2011 we've got
more issues and of course because we are

145
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:42,279
now in 2012

146
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:44,620
can actually give you the full list
because I don't think it's actually

147
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,220
ready yet is it

148
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:49,220
no it's not so at the end of the year we
can have a new list

149
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,250
but what is peculiar about this list is
that

150
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:56,089
we've got this some this topic a graph
now this is actually pretty simple

151
00:08:56,089 --> 00:08:59,280
small sample from 2007 to 2011

152
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,840
but the Cure enough I it almost seems
that is gonna drop

153
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,220
now this is actually here speculation in
on the above all abilities has been

154
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:07,680
actually

155
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,790
accounted for right number attacking
picnics actually

156
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:15,630
accounted for so my speculation is gonna
go even further down

157
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:19,280
and I think the reason for this day my
victories is the first reason this

158
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:24,690
maybe where security has a mature than
out so we actually fix all the issues

159
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,730
and I this is a good sign is going down
or maybe the second

160
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:32,280
second reason is perhaps because

161
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,800
this is serious business just like the
Internet and now

162
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,100
with web on abilities these days
actually cost a lot of money

163
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,140
see if you find a genetic way to exploit
some casa

164
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:47,530
issues you maxine not be so keen to
share this with the whole world because

165
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:51,460
up this a technique you can potentially
fine

166
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:55,610
a lot of exploits for will be worked for
a bounty program

167
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:59,490
watch the net you like you know 500 here
five hundred and maybe even a couple

168
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,770
thousand

169
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:04,850
in different places and there for me a
lot of money

170
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:08,590
but if we with you actually skipped this
for now

171
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:11,770
as a speculation always the for
everybody

172
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:15,700
this is a no brainer that the mercies
actually not safe

173
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:19,740
in a web browser he's been actually
repeated over and over again on

174
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,470
all kinda slights now since this is a
talk about shell script

175
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:27,060
let's talk about girls group well

176
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,330
no actually Ajax

177
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,660
just the JavaScript the way it is when
you talk about JavaScript

178
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,240
a lot of people associate gel skin
attacks with wanna tackle me

179
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,290
and that these attack have across a
scripting

180
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:44,240
which is actually trivial attack I

181
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,580
you basically find a injection flowing a
website or something else the senator

182
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:53,110
victim by some kind of a fishing camping
or something else or just for the victim

183
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,340
to click on something

184
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,580
and it gets executed you still the
session of people actually associated

185
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,620
with the

186
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,100
excesses attack with the alert one
attack which is

187
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,350
pretty good name for it because it is
actually quite simplistic

188
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:08,890
but what is really really good about
alert one attack is that always so

189
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,130
simplistic

190
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:13,190
that's actually what's cool about it
because it's all simple

191
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:16,580
but at same time is so devastating if
he's actually using the right hands in

192
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:16,990
the right

193
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:20,090
picnic and if you look at some of the
major outbreaks stop

194
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:23,790
all ability from 2005 to 2009 to all

195
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:28,580
we've got actually different kinds of
all breaks warms which actually quite

196
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:32,470
although pretty simple no you know it
doesn't think actually

197
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:36,820
been used to read the code I understand
what he does or even actually create one

198
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:40,360
they are pretty successful with the way
the actual exploited

199
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,040
all the social networks on which they
will spread

200
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:48,250
you also have excess gonna beat switch
action on explore website's

201
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,510
actually exploit your client because as
it turns out

202
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:55,320
web technologies op very reusable you
know people use them

203
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,630
for all kinds of stuff like for example
instant messaging guys you know

204
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:02,040
I means that I've actually reading on
this my new faces and things like that

205
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,480
in some kind of a

206
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,220
custom rendering engine why not use an
HTML

207
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:12,150
render you know which is web browser so
anyone ability within these HTML render

208
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:16,260
will potentially have a huge impact on
the application that was the case with

209
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:16,510
the

210
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:21,020
with the message in accessissue which
was actually pretty cool

211
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:25,290
we go also pretty much leader we got a
patchy actually being compromised by

212
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:26,510
Alexis AC issue

213
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:30,010
which is pretty interesting actually was
an exit the issue in the jeera

214
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:34,570
a vacation they were using on somebody
actually for the administrator to visit

215
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,190
the page which was already infected

216
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:40,020
still session management sessions
session tokens from the user

217
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:43,620
you know looking as a user propagate
father the actually started with

218
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:47,480
excess we ought to have a bomb axis as
an actual

219
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,020
this is quite interesting because in
2011 there was a

220
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,580
an entry of ago from home so I'm sorry
I'm not crediting the person

221
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,950
specifically but

222
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,960
it was an entry about how someone who
dat one

223
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,140
the poem to own contests which I think
somebody

224
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:05,920
actually nadaa sixty thousand dollars
this morning

225
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,150
with a simple ecstasy right somebody
actually found a way to exploit

226
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:14,740
she takin accessissue 2 compromising
device

227
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:20,140
and and 2012 he actually got more pic
shemale store excess and stuff like this

228
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:23,440
now this is just basically an
administration that although I say see

229
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,200
she's a pretty simple

230
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,570
they actually quite prolific with the
impact not everywhere

231
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:34,200
because what is speaking about them this
simple to find simple to exploit

232
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,700
heart come up with the with a good
strategy to

233
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,030
abuse them right and used in the right
way

234
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:44,770
this is actually where action this
additional knowledge is required

235
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:47,830
now for this stock when we talk about

236
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,910
exits as we also talk about what can we
do it and one

237
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:54,440
thing is example we can potentially seal
session

238
00:13:54,440 --> 00:14:00,040
management we could actually Cherie or
arms we could do all kinds of stuff

239
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,720
but the inspiration for this stock in
particular came from three main sources

240
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,350
and I'll start with them

241
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:09,040
one by one Firstsource was subject oh

242
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,760
how many of you have heard object o

243
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,430
no no one just one person I'm pretty
sure to

244
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:19,950
not counting my so that's an object or

245
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:23,370
the snow of this guy's nickname is not
checked or

246
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:27,260
although BP corning nickname that's a
bit Hoffman

247
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:31,600
and he came up with something called
optical which comes from Nick talk

248
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,270
but written in JavaScript he was
actually very very basic to

249
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:38,310
which works in exact same way as the

250
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,810
is the Nick to a scanner but actually
only using

251
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:45,600
inside the gorgeous I works by for
example

252
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,610
victim arrives on on some kind of a
compromise page

253
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,850
and then you can launch other attacks
against other service

254
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:56,740
pretty simple so use them as a proxy the
second inspiration

255
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:01,560
for this presentation came from this
handsome fella

256
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,190
I he's actually to call the doc API
which

257
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:10,520
I develop I am attack API is basically a
collection

258
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,890
of different techniques which we can use
a of the

259
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:17,910
exporting process critical ability so
for example not only we can just

260
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,360
hijacked the session right

261
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,820
some cases we might not be able to do
that depending on for example what

262
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,970
restrictions we have on the session
management

263
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:29,670
but maybe we can we can encapsulate the
user within the same boundaries

264
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:32,980
the currently explore the session so
even though the actual navigate

265
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:37,040
it right now to get away from the
current page the actual Stacy the page

266
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,440
so you'd actually within the same the
main we can simulate some kinda Ajax

267
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,350
behavior within the application

268
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:46,720
to the page itself does not refresh and
everything they do will be monitored

269
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,910
I C can come up with all kinds of other
techniques like keylogging

270
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:53,050
whatever you know whatever they do on
the page can be read thanks to record it

271
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:57,529
and I'm of course replaced or whatever

272
00:15:57,529 --> 00:16:02,010
and the last inspiration for this was
the myspace one

273
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:05,960
for this particular presentation and
MySpace warm

274
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,850
for those of you who know it is basic
for those of you who don't know this

275
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:14,760
is basically across 51 which actually
hit

276
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,510
the Internet now what myspace network in
2005

277
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:22,160
and basically show the world that is
actually quite simple to take

278
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,510
this typable ability and I make them
actually quite quite

279
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:28,680
quite evil in some ways

280
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:33,020
what was actually cooler the myspace
warm was Facebook warm which actually

281
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:33,610
hit

282
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:37,790
Facebook after myspace I'm is that if

283
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:42,830
do you actually know what's the result
of this warm what exactly that

284
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:46,290
you get snow what exactly the myspace
want in on the myspace that work

285
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:49,480
apart from actually propagating across
all the profiles

286
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,260
it was actually quite simple to use who
was making this guy Sammy

287
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:57,020
on who wrote it he was making

288
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:00,340
he was on himself to the fans this I
believe and then he will you know you

289
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,550
could actually make him

290
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:05,929
here or something like this: I don't use
myspace O'Donnell

291
00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:09,620
but especially at some point I believe
he had actually more friends than the

292
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,919
guy who made myspace

293
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:15,720
like Tom so that was pretty cool but
actually what was cooler

294
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,529
after this myspace one there was another
warm on Facebook which actually covered

295
00:17:19,529 --> 00:17:20,860
it all the Facebook pages

296
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:25,380
into MySpace pages which is you from
barry no cuz actually there will be

297
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,950
spelled as MySpace pages

298
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:32,010
now from the city's rations a kind ever

299
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:36,120
over the years I came up with that the
evil plans

300
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:40,580
and daily straight different methods of
attack using client-side technologies

301
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,660
and for many using javascript itself

302
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:49,880
now first evil plan worst use the victim
browser to attack other with targets

303
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:54,559
it's pretty simple technology we've got
the attack a the sack attack the victim

304
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,850
some way and then the victim is used as
a proxy to attack

305
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:02,309
other other targets other notes on may
be the same network or maybe on other

306
00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:04,030
networks

307
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:07,110
I'll a good illustration of this type of
attack is

308
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:10,670
I'll is the check to as I talked earlier

309
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:14,550
I it's only one the second evil plan

310
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:18,620
which is basically evil plan 02 is to
use the victim's browser to cope for

311
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,160
mice

312
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,710
the local network not actually attacking
other targets such as web

313
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:26,820
work targets like up traditional what's
kind of some sort

314
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:30,530
but actually attacking other network
resources within the network where the

315
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:34,760
victim s now this is actually my
favorite 10 that's why spend most of the

316
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,410
time

317
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:38,450
researching things I'm from this evil
plan

318
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:42,210
there were a bunch of attacks which were
design over the years I don't think he's

319
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:43,090
actually

320
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:46,150
as export should be so there is actually
for

321
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:49,680
there's a father from room for
improvement

322
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,120
room from he actually we start with some
very basic stuff such as

323
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,550
there was a port scanner you could
actually right ports gun at some point

324
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,500
in the courtroom it's still possible

325
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,030
you can actually write something that
will allow you to brute-force

326
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:06,360
for example credentials basic will the
basic authentication credentials

327
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,360
that you may store within the browser

328
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,740
%uh and my favorite actually is a tacky
UPnP

329
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:18,420
which I'm not sure how many view UPnP
before

330
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:22,960
you want so UPnP says this for Universal
Plug & Play

331
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,780
actually to technology which is that
basically everywhere you got it

332
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:30,150
if you have the home router you got it
is running their

333
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:34,490
and the purpose if you PM peaceful
devices to talk to each other

334
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:37,780
but up we using some sort of a column
for a call

335
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:41,930
and in fact the common for causes a
stack of five different

336
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:45,140
technologist starting with

337
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:49,770
wit with technology base on

338
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:53,230
multi casting looked aghast networks and

339
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:56,610
ending with the a soap so basically SOAP
messages are

340
00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:02,400
HTTP or TCP or http yupp most commonly
do you say should be via TCP

341
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,340
so it's very simple particle use and
they what request to the server and you

342
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,300
can actually make that serve it to stop

343
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:12,320
usually you can be used for us such as
when you actually need to use BitTorrent

344
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,300
or use

345
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,940
you to use Ammachi skype does this but
maybe this

346
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:21,850
but anything that requires for the
program to have a public effacing port

347
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:25,550
now nobody will ask you to go and
actually open ports manually on your

348
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,140
router

349
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:29,570
because not what most people would be
able to do that to do port forwarding on

350
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:32,600
the router so they actually use UPnP to
do this stuff for you

351
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:37,140
so it's a it's a it's a it's a something
trust ban which actually happens in the

352
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:37,390
knee

353
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,920
the open torrent for example bit torrent
it or the open for example some ports

354
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,440
on your router cited traffic in the
forward from the external facing cited

355
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,710
internal because the whole network is
actually not

356
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:52,170
therefore there's no there's no direct
connection

357
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:55,880
%uh there's all that a you could
actually Fourche

358
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,780
a a UPnP requests to most routers

359
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:03,230
I and you can actually make them do some
crazy things such as he can basically

360
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:03,830
say

361
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:06,980
I want to change the credentials there
are a so reset the admin credentials

362
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:07,809
from

363
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:10,980
whatever they were to whatever you
actually choose to be right

364
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:15,050
I actually don't any authentication to
do that because UPnP by design

365
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:18,850
does not require authentication because
again that they have likely to take more

366
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:19,940
just talking to each other

367
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:23,510
I to to different device talking to each
other deduction don't know

368
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:28,030
about anything about it occasion the
other thing you could do he said expose

369
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:30,970
the route on the external facing site
actually done this report will be

370
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:32,490
actually externally enable

371
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:36,140
so what someone changes your credentials
mobiles be able also to locking

372
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,900
into your router and depending on your
article abilities they might be able to

373
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,070
do other things

374
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:44,270
also you could change the DNS settings
on the router which is actually the most

375
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:47,800
horrible thing because this is almost
like a process the back door nobody has

376
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:52,110
everyman nobody yet has invented
something like antivirus for files

377
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:56,000
a sort for our hours right nobody
actually has the such a thing you know

378
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,150
see somebody comprise a compromise your
router you pretty much

379
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:02,770
it's it's game over you know you don't
know you don't know how it works

380
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:06,650
and there's no trace of it unless
actually you supported by

381
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:10,980
when somebody's actually you know
messing around your DNS traffic

382
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:15,929
you might be able to spot it then
actually is completely invisible

383
00:22:15,929 --> 00:22:19,840
um forget about okay so let's move on
they we have the CSR

384
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,490
I'll indication are generous attacking
me seize cameras

385
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:27,280
like outtake IP cameras in fact actually
over honorable to all kinds of you

386
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,900
attacks over the network using the
browser itself so you can actually

387
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,920
take a simple session a user who already
has a Linksys camera or something like

388
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,350
this:

389
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:39,200
and IP camera inside the network because
all this top

390
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,200
HTTP you can actually compromise all
these devices

391
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,630
and attacking other embedded devices
there's a lot of embedded devices doxie

392
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:49,280
have

393
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,710
better is to be service I this is a good
reason

394
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:55,710
why we have this because I'm

395
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:59,360
is that if is that if the vendor
providing with the software to

396
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,330
to mess around with the device he just
basically you to visit the web pages

397
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:03,360
just

398
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:08,280
it's much simpler fortunately this web
page is a very very insecure

399
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,300
and the evil plan 03 which is

400
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,679
basically using the social networking I

401
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:18,280
mechanics Ave have a social network or

402
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,650
other system which actually the greats
like this mechanics into

403
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:25,290
itself to a you know if

404
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:29,059
effective victim or if you are part of
the social networking affect your cell

405
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:33,080
and that spread an attack across all the
notes about at work

406
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,940
now just because this has been proven to
work for social networks like Facebook

407
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,820
and MySpace

408
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:42,360
it does not necessarily mean that this
are the only markets in fact they are

409
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:47,750
a lot more targets in this actually you
know Facebook and Google+ and all these

410
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:51,450
social networks up they're not the only
one

411
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:54,790
actually have the sort of networking
capabilities pretty much any large

412
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:55,530
enterprise

413
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:58,700
has some kind of a softer that is free
networked

414
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:02,210
such as maybe you've seen assess SAP
systems

415
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:05,280
or or solve the Oracle on demand systems
down

416
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,670
they actually socially oriented so any

417
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:13,210
typeof attacked applies for a social
network work really really well that

418
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:16,740
and in fact even on network devices they
were also

419
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:22,110
because you can us is just for example
you have a close to IP cameras

420
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:26,809
with with work abilities back would also
be patient you see some kind of a social

421
00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:31,549
sort of a social networking war because
they only we to each other

422
00:24:31,549 --> 00:24:35,460
so the results of evil plan 03 isn't yes
we can

423
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:39,330
and we've proven that overtime every
single social network has been

424
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:40,590
compromised

425
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:44,320
and some point by social has been warm
and in the future there will be even

426
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:44,770
more

427
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:49,040
this I imagine but these days actually
this big eyes they pay money saw

428
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,160
economy in a way in in a good hands

429
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:56,200
so on that many people willing just to
disclose the viability they can just get

430
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,720
paid for it

431
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,710
but there is also this the bombs evil
plan

432
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:05,500
which is the same to use the victim's
browser to compromise the system itself

433
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:09,679
and actually this bonus evil plan
actually came from talk to a hat

434
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,600
a discussion hats with someone who works
for a

435
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,299
devised and so we were talking about

436
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:20,860
my way through mystics is this is
basically I'll

437
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:24,049
the technology that we are betting on
that works to do a better

438
00:25:24,049 --> 00:25:27,179
detection my way in the future and the
way my our

439
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:31,650
her six works is a is you know in a very
simple words is

440
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:35,320
its core scorecard basically so if you
take a piece if

441
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,830
my way the more malicious thinks it does
the higher score

442
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:43,500
he won't get and based on that score we
can determine whether it's malicious or

443
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,049
not

444
00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:48,290
peters out that only works this thing
works only for a

445
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:53,360
on a process by process bases sometimes
the anti virus does not have any idea

446
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,960
about the whole system altogether defeat
a glitzy amal attack

447
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,870
we break it down to smaller tax
executing from different origins have an

448
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:02,840
operating system such as for example

449
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:06,460
maybe a mile away is one component which
is looking very much hours

450
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:09,679
let's say does on jello injecting
explore

451
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,750
for something like this which could be
potentially say okay that's malicious

452
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,470
although

453
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:16,890
lot of normal software does that sort of
stuff

454
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:21,410
especially HP a software I maybe that
point actually

455
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:25,070
a javascript easy is a cutie from
Internet Explore to actually perform the

456
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:25,790
second stage

457
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:28,950
over something like an infection or
something else by actually breaking the

458
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:31,190
attack into smaller components

459
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:35,110
it becomes very very difficult to do
heuristics because altogether

460
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:39,960
all this components up the operating
system will score very little

461
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,790
but all when you combine and together
they are actually reach very high score

462
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:43,290
which is

463
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:46,549
definitely seems to be some kinda I'm
our activity

464
00:26:46,549 --> 00:26:50,000
but actually very difficult to detect
for that actually need the system which

465
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,370
want is everything keeps history ABC

466
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:57,690
event on your computer and as you can
imagine this will become very very slow

467
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:01,820
on this Allis WI maybe a couple years
time when

468
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:06,400
moral all richest states where we can
run whatever virtualization we want and

469
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,559
is not to take any

470
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:12,420
any anytime then at that point this
technology will become more

471
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:16,179
sensible saw uses some examples

472
00:27:16,179 --> 00:27:19,210
this policy will plan attacking browsers
the browser Chrome

473
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:22,920
I'm betting for example I malicious
extensions

474
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,740
into to the into modern browsers

475
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:30,670
or invading some kinda other I am
extension component

476
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:33,740
are you be surprised how many
implications actually use JavaScript

477
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,390
thinks

478
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:38,820
I and you never heard it before like
it's not just the browser itself

479
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:44,620
it's also on PDF readers is also like
use the messaging clients

480
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:48,419
it's also stuff like Photoshop itself
actually conscripted with JavaScript

481
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:51,840
I'll they're actually all kinds of
things that these days is pure

482
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,790
javascript

483
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:55,919
and the reason for this especially on
Windows is because we discuss with one

484
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,559
component which actually a key to all
this and is coach a script

485
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:02,950
and chase group is very very similar to
JavaScript is almost identical with some

486
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,090
kind of a semantic

487
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:07,530
differences some areas but typically can
write

488
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:11,169
JavaScript code any which cue the same
way as a chase group called

489
00:28:11,169 --> 00:28:14,330
and descrip- essentially via the W
Scripting Host

490
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:17,929
the wheel Scripting Host you can
actually do anything on the system

491
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:21,970
so wheels for example exports primitive
such as that .gs false actually is

492
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:22,760
curable

493
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:26,280
don't HT a filesystem of occasions are
also executed for

494
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:30,809
St applications effectively HTML pages
but is that a single HTML

495
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:34,910
did you say STA it's a it's a very
simple the only problem is that HD

496
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:36,130
executes with very

497
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:40,080
with a lot more privileges than HTML
occasions a step occasion can actually

498
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,169
do whatever

499
00:28:41,169 --> 00:28:44,220
on the system and

500
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:47,840
a and so on saw talking about tools

501
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,630
I'll when I started this journey
researching some of this

502
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:56,000
clan site issues I am I was thinking
about them about tools but actually the

503
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,280
browser technology was not mature enough
to allow you to write

504
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:02,820
very very I interesting tools and

505
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:07,640
I am in fact today for client-side
exportation

506
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,850
their om a couple of tools I'll which I
want to mention

507
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:15,030
the first one is called beef which is
probably

508
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:18,150
a on the best representative I'll

509
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:21,160
what client-side equitation to

510
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,240
kit should look like bout to me is like
a over

511
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,970
over engineered in some ways beef is a
simple framework which allows you to

512
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:33,140
kinda but a conviction excess issues the
problem with this is because

513
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:37,080
E almost acts the same way as Metasploit
the economy create sessions

514
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,470
on to to for example let the

515
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:43,960
you find an XSS attack and then you you
know you the victim

516
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,240
business that page at that time you
might be able to execute some stuff

517
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,580
right

518
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:52,270
Robbie allows you to actually set this
stuff I so

519
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:55,340
so it's actually quite easy to come up
with some kind of generic attack or

520
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,750
something like this:

521
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:01,790
and he has like an hour interactive sort
of session system way he can

522
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:05,110
keep exploiting the same user it
actually comes to a different page in

523
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,080
stuff like this but

524
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,950
generally its are no are funny that easy
to work with

525
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:14,330
a course we got Metasploit which is has
a %uh in all of the whole range of

526
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,910
client-side exports

527
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:19,040
but all this exploits are actually
browser bucks

528
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:23,020
sold actually proper but we actually you
can get some kinda remote code execution

529
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:26,510
browse and download saying that about I
me thank the Alstom

530
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:30,440
you know I mean this exploit watched it
a couple of other than any other stuff

531
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,220
that I was talking about earlier

532
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:35,429
but then what if the system

533
00:30:35,429 --> 00:30:38,830
is is pretty secure right what if you
have something like that Google Chrome

534
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:41,419
web browser which is actually pretty
decent web browser right

535
00:30:41,419 --> 00:30:45,440
and browse it's actually catch about to
become better

536
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,640
play some respect and there's also this
tools that just like

537
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:53,910
sete which is the social engineering
toolkit

538
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:57,210
some other tools which are kind of a
very very similar I

539
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:00,610
ex SF XSS with ploy a song so for

540
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:05,820
and they are essentially what is known
is a XSS attack proxies

541
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:10,130
but I got on another idea and eighties
actually to use the web browser

542
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:14,010
itself and capabilities that provide a
web browser about to do

543
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:18,860
security testing for offensive and
defensive purposes

544
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:21,950
now all grown a little bit the offensive
side of things

545
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:25,030
on the chin up thinking in terms more
the fencing

546
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:28,919
but it there's another all these
browsers actually have enough technology

547
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:31,120
packed into itself to be able to create

548
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,510
baby they advance applications

549
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:38,120
which will allow you to do things not
possible

550
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:41,500
couple years ago there is also

551
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:45,640
another thing which I wanted to do is to
actually put a complete

552
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:49,590
toolkit up security tools weed out
actually rooting

553
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:52,650
on the box on that Google Notebook

554
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:56,140
and as you some of you may know who
chrome notebook

555
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:59,309
runs just the Chrome Web browser war has
a operating system

556
00:31:59,309 --> 00:32:03,660
need it selects so you can actually
modified if you

557
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:07,150
it's it's not it's not a problem but
it's actually designed to run as just

558
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:11,289
a withdrawals right so what if we want
to integrate

559
00:32:11,289 --> 00:32:14,600
like a proper security up to now of
tools

560
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:18,760
which not only attack with applications
but also any kind of a pic /a same age

561
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,150
like

562
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:22,690
your entire framework of tools including
Metasploit

563
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:26,250
running from a web browser interpreted
by telescope technology

564
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:30,580
by using some of this evil plans or evil
like this that we

565
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:33,820
we discussed earlier saw

566
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:37,039
I came up with the this sort of a
concept a

567
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,970
which is he took actually fiery four
years to develop

568
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:44,210
I and basically I it's a it's a it's a
setup

569
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:47,830
a different technologies which when you
combine them

570
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:51,600
you get get my career advice to get

571
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,120
and now this is pretty much the
evolution of this technology I started

572
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,260
something with the

573
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:59,760
the gel skin port scanner which is a
very very simple to

574
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,230
I was just to find ports on a on on the
box

575
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:07,880
by using just tells if technology a that
he moved on to attack a PR

576
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:11,380
which owns explain was just a collection
of different now techniques

577
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:14,440
you can use post across scripting
exportation

578
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:18,429
we've got something called now the sweet
which is basically a set of tools

579
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:21,660
only concentrating on the web
application security

580
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:25,929
but they allow it to do all kinds of
cool stuff and that we moving to work

581
00:33:25,929 --> 00:33:26,820
something called

582
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:31,650
a another technology which it's partly
open source article: weaponry

583
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:35,490
which is basically all the security
tools that you know today

584
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:38,730
we can actually put them and we can
execute them we

585
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:42,660
the with face with high degree of
certainty the work

586
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,740
18 a withdrawals so basically

587
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:49,610
you will neva need or have have the need
to

588
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:53,000
actually run anything else but just to
visit the website which allows you to

589
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,630
actually execute

590
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:57,340
all these tools

591
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:00,460
saw in other way

592
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:04,270
what we want to do is basically from

593
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:07,480
monkeys to have some kind of a

594
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:12,530
nuclear explosion and reach the stage
where we are some kinda

595
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:17,359
you too thing so

596
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:21,069
at this stage we've got up basically
working

597
00:34:21,069 --> 00:34:25,220
a security scanner and a client-side
some sup on-site security tools

598
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:28,450
which I'll demonstrate our show you how
they work a

599
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:32,569
but before I move on to this i wanna
talk about the better the architecture

600
00:34:32,569 --> 00:34:33,659
some of the challenges

601
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:37,460
actually creating such a system know the
first thing about Elsevier

602
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:41,129
is not is actually pretty bad language
so everybody who actually decides to

603
00:34:41,129 --> 00:34:42,149
write something

604
00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:46,109
that is fairly complex so just maybe a
security scanner or

605
00:34:46,109 --> 00:34:49,320
some kind ever jin et security tool I

606
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,500
you find very very quickly that the
language itself

607
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:56,168
although allows you to do a lot of
things is actually pretty poor

608
00:34:56,169 --> 00:35:00,990
because we talking about a problem with
a lot of complexities

609
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:06,810
and and you end up with bucks which
you've never anticipated have

610
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:09,810
so you know to tackle this on

611
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:12,810
will first we'll that's why just because
actually called the

612
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:16,119
work the the assembly language the web
because

613
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:20,420
it is flexible but also allows you to
watch to square up pretty badly

614
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:23,730
also in the security circles is also
known as the show called up the web you

615
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:24,000
know

616
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,369
because love this with the taxes they
said base on

617
00:35:27,369 --> 00:35:30,390
injecting some which I'll skip some page

618
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:33,470
now in order to tackle this problem up

619
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:37,200
just you being pretty about weak growth
we had to develop

620
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,550
a bit architecture actually up

621
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:43,780
running whatever we want a new running
in within the browser

622
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:47,950
so we needed to create some kind of a
compiler essentially

623
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:51,250
so the current stock the quarter starts
with the cold where the code is written

624
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:53,310
in some kind of the generic language

625
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:57,200
a which is very similar to the sea
typeof languages

626
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,920
a guest or compiler a composite gets the
language in a spit out chels

627
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,320
difficult in fact you can actually spit
out also objective-c code

628
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,540
and some other types of stuff like like

629
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:12,500
like hell fights and groovy for example

630
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:16,490
and then obviously .co then will secure
on the targets or

631
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:19,500
the good thing about this thing is that
instead of being dependent

632
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:23,560
on like one single language like Ruby
and importing for example Ruby

633
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,750
to some kind of embedded system which is
actually a very big challenge because

634
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:29,599
would-be self serve a general-purpose
language in May

635
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:33,609
include a large in our focus primitives
is that have doing that

636
00:36:33,609 --> 00:36:36,760
you gold you go Ave generic Apple

637
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:40,450
language and the havoc upon actual
composite onto the target so if you

638
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:42,150
decide for example I wanna put this

639
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:45,369
toolkit on something like I don't know
embed at

640
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:49,320
system some sort you know i needs to be
compartment certain way with subtle are

641
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,540
present thanks let up

642
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:54,030
you can actually do this with actually
going through the pain about reporting

643
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:56,109
something like common runtime:

644
00:36:56,109 --> 00:37:00,740
I could be for example or piping or
something like this:

645
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:03,900
I but the challenges that

646
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:08,340
also in order to do some other things
are within the browser

647
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:11,510
you've got also security controls which
are actually applied by the browser

648
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:12,490
itself

649
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:16,800
soul someone just got through security
controls are the same origin policy is

650
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,430
so on this reached the stage where the
browser itself and we may hear to be

651
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:21,480
reached this stage

652
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:25,050
where for example application was to
gain a certain sort over

653
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:28,550
sis to other web sites so to be able to
send across

654
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:31,640
origin requests and stuff like this such
as I think there is a

655
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,800
moment some kind of a standard 30+
similar to this

656
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,490
maybe is cool with intense and supply
this maybe that will be the few

657
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:41,960
the answer to this but essentially we
need to be able to do

658
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,150
requests and we want to do all kinds of
other things cross

659
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:48,630
origin like between different origins
between different sites

660
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:52,380
up unless we have this we still need to
rely on browser plug-ins

661
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:55,650
by the browser plugin itself is actually
quite small shell

662
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:59,300
which just allow certain ability to
happen so you need to

663
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:03,240
you know to execute this like a very
complex piece of coke which is compile

664
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:07,230
and put on the client you still need
some kind of a support the state's with

665
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:11,140
it there's all that overtime I think
this support will disappear

666
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:14,390
uninor longer horny this browser

667
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:17,859
extension to help you with this saw

668
00:38:17,859 --> 00:38:21,880
now talking about this on a show you a
set of

669
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,190
a sort of different kinda examples

670
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:28,380
just illustrate what is actually
possible today we

671
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:31,950
are just a generic compiler the gel
script

672
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:35,700
and engine written entirely in this is
custom language

673
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:42,700
that is compiled to JavaScript

674
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:53,270
so basically this is the setup tools on

675
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:58,550
on the show you some of them now the
first one which is actually my favorite

676
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:02,220
which use require is in the

677
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:05,640
is basically simulate something similar
to a

678
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:09,600
with proxy web proxy will do but the
fact without actually having a proxy

679
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,069
still

680
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:13,980
so we'll just told us is basically
capturing just

681
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:17,450
traffic I just displaying it to the user
I soul

682
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:20,590
now we've got this to running in one
frame right

683
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:23,820
and if I open another one I'm just
typing some stuff

684
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:30,820
I'm

685
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,330
what you see on this side of the window

686
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:39,070
we actually can see a what is actually
happening on the other tops

687
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:42,990
I love the same up the above the same
browser

688
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:46,730
we don't actually need these to to run a
proxy

689
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:49,780
now these are actually all the requests
which are actually capture

690
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:54,270
by when I was typing Google and in order
to execute this

691
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:58,470
I actually in order to do this it is it
is kinda based on two things

692
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:04,110
festival its muscle the coat is actually
it's a

693
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:11,110
is basically tells group

694
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:30,339
group what is this

695
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:38,120
so most is actually compile to da scrip
is actually as you can see it's a huge

696
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:38,930
piece of cool

697
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:45,930
like a lot of stuff on like and then we
have like a very very lightweight

698
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:47,820
extension

699
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:51,350
which enables the collection of

700
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:58,350
for example just the requests themself
right

701
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,810
now what we also can do with this are

702
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:07,350
type of tools is to run 84 scanner
example

703
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:14,350
to actually scan for all abilities now
this is actually going to the subject to

704
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:15,130
area

705
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:18,400
where we actually run a scan I guess the
system I

706
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,740
now obviously this is the alpha fantasy
purposes but nothing stops from

707
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:27,070
an attack that sucks do something
similar within a browser so for example

708
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:28,420
if I just start it's gone

709
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:31,680
it will start identifying

710
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,710
issues and all the stuff actually
executing within the browser itself so

711
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:38,590
the browser is actually fast enough to

712
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:41,620
detect I for example are

713
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:45,870
all kinds a interesting one abilities
including stuff like sequin gestion

714
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:49,340
including stuff like local fine klutz
which are pretty

715
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:53,890
free devastating attacks they can all be
executed by just

716
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:58,660
some just keep on the web page cross and
scripting

717
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:04,610
and in fact is actually quite accurate
in that respect would you also can do

718
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:07,770
since we can actually manipulate
requests and thinks that we can actually

719
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:08,550
also

720
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:13,480
a mess around with us requests so for
example apologists

721
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:17,330
basically mess around with this I can
just basically get it

722
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:20,610
and executed I'm pretty much everybody
who s

723
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:25,010
any any experience with on attack proxy
like this out

724
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:28,950
or or for you you will be familiar with
that in space

725
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:32,080
so we can actually take requests we can
modify

726
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:36,160
we can set and server we get response
back and then we can do all kinds of

727
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:36,590
things

728
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:40,570
the only pro the only advantage here is
that while this proxies

729
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:43,920
arm are pretty cool I mean the average
name because

730
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,190
not only can capture the traffic from
web browsers you can also captured

731
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:51,250
traffic from other applications although
they're pretty food actually like the

732
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:52,020
context

733
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:55,080
each request they don't know for example
why

734
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:58,230
a certain request happened and wait
actual genetic

735
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:01,840
originated from he just knows that there
is a request from the browser

736
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:05,270
and you just boxes the request and you
lose all this meta

737
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:08,730
data which is a socially request such as
you don't know if this is

738
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:12,740
unless you expecting the head issue much
do not know the basics in our spirit

739
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:13,120
quest

740
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:16,470
you may for example see some kind of a
WebSocket

741
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:20,270
yes you will know what is this for on
what's the process will be able to tell

742
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:21,420
what is a WebSocket

743
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:25,790
in this case because we are running
within the browser we actually have all

744
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:26,780
this matter dating

745
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:30,560
on a bus already so we know why each
request happen we know where it came

746
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,140
from

747
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:34,590
on why happen the did happen because the
user press the button

748
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:38,820
it happened because maybe there's a
WebSocket is a part of the game or

749
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:39,390
something

750
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:43,030
see actually has Laura made it there
which actually can help us during a pen

751
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:45,490
test and

752
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:48,970
are last but not least I wanna show you

753
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:54,110
for example that we can on you can hunt
down for

754
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:57,570
arsonists not loss example this is
another one we can actually

755
00:43:57,570 --> 00:44:01,410
come down for individual issues so for
example if you're looking for one

756
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:02,000
specific

757
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,900
own ability on a Web site or or as part
of some kind of publication

758
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:10,790
we can actually use good very very fast
this like and they go

759
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:14,220
you know it doesn't take longer than you
know most the time

760
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:17,360
for example if you want to use this type
of attack whether it's a client-side

761
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,910
boxy compromising like this is something
like this

762
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:23,060
or maybe is a part of a at this it
doesn't take longer than a couple

763
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:26,460
seconds to actually be able to figure
out if something is winnable

764
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:31,190
on such as for example this

765
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:34,240
which is pretty cool example

766
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:41,240
if take

767
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:48,269
now this is actually more the last
example in just a demo if

768
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:55,269
sake

769
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:02,150
this avocation if I scan very quickly

770
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:05,930
I'll be able to tell that there is
actually a whole ability

771
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:09,589
on that application and with one single
click a button

772
00:45:09,589 --> 00:45:12,640
we can actually have something similar
to what miss blast right

773
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:16,569
which is an interactive show so
basically or ap us within the browser

774
00:45:16,569 --> 00:45:17,359
itself

775
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:21,359
not only not only we can just so look
for all abilities

776
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:24,710
but we can also actively exploit them
and take

777
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:28,710
advantage of them in fact the septic
want possible to take

778
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:32,539
a to like Metasploit I'm Unported

779
00:45:32,539 --> 00:45:35,660
I'm you we wouldn't be able to take
Metasploit soccer's is written in Ruby

780
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:37,549
in this year I some kinda Ruby

781
00:45:37,549 --> 00:45:41,440
virtual machine in Johns Creek which is
actually possible we will slow

782
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:45,730
but it is actually possible to rewrite

783
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:49,049
some of the core principles a Metasploit

784
00:45:49,049 --> 00:45:52,180
and actually create them and executed
from the stop

785
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:56,150
varma and so this is as a huge advantage

786
00:45:56,150 --> 00:46:01,019
on on the intensive let's see if you
look at it from

787
00:46:01,019 --> 00:46:04,309
exploitation for me but also from and
that's the point of view it's actually

788
00:46:04,309 --> 00:46:04,710
quite

789
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:09,420
quite big deal some other stuff that we
can do

790
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:12,480
basically week-and-a-half

791
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,970
more advance typeof up by actually
forget about this one

792
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:19,710
we can actually have I'll more advanced
types of

793
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:26,650
exploits

794
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:30,670
I actually like on the on on clouds like
technology so for example this is

795
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:35,109
this is just a simple example how we can
take something like

796
00:46:35,109 --> 00:46:38,430
an excess issue we can convert it to
something more powerful

797
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:42,309
the Sturgis collecting session and 80
fires and things like that

798
00:46:42,309 --> 00:46:45,759
we can potentially execute all kinds a
interactive attacks

799
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:49,130
we with X is this issue now

800
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:52,489
the way this thing works is just starts
with injecting

801
00:46:52,489 --> 00:46:56,410
some kind of a on

802
00:46:56,410 --> 00:46:59,749
payload which aim is to be injected into
the victim session

803
00:46:59,749 --> 00:47:02,970
saw this case I can take

804
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:09,970
are just helping out tough because it's
just simpler

805
00:47:15,369 --> 00:47:22,369
but I'm not going to use a real on every
detail just injected straight into cool

806
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:29,570
but let's say this wanna be choosing
activites assess

807
00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:33,350
or maybe store XSS on a social network
by some kind ever

808
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:38,420
store ability but dispatch you got
similar sort of mechanism

809
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:41,940
which be house but slightly more

810
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:45,110
advance some ways because from here

811
00:47:45,110 --> 00:47:48,670
we have actually the typical sort of
show you Marmont where we can have all

812
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:49,470
kinds of tools

813
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:53,030
so if we do something like for example
it's a

814
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:56,620
known use the comps nothing is happening
but if I

815
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:59,640
say this the face

816
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:02,950
and it just you can basically Jake

817
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:07,840
other for incall into that other
occasion up

818
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:10,830
the good thing is that we also can
inject whatever want because we have

819
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:11,600
interactive

820
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:15,770
sort of %um sheets syntax highlighting
editor

821
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:19,300
so if you want to do something like you
know whatever

822
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:26,300
and just saying pushed out

823
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:33,950
and you got it like running so we can
actually develop all kinds of stuff

824
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:38,000
and actually send them to this a
distinct point sessions

825
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,140
now obviously now this quite simple

826
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:46,320
but if we combine this though with the
power all the other tools which I showed

827
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:46,570
you

828
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:50,200
which weekend I O now we can design Vadi
Vadi

829
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:53,210
complex types of attacks and

830
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:57,950
sometimes in some cases this up attacks
actually going required to stop a

831
00:48:57,950 --> 00:49:01,400
special relationship within the browser
extension in order to work

832
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:06,030
sometimes just possible to do them
blindly which is that that's why

833
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:09,610
it is another to hear which actually
allow you

834
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:12,690
to compose request for trees

835
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:16,590
but the the the interesting thing about
this too is that

836
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:21,020
you will be able to create all kinds a
variance of cross the quiz forgeries

837
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:24,120
so for example if you wanna upload a
file that is not

838
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:27,260
really dark way of doing that in in

839
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:30,520
by using forms because the user has to
go on click on a file

840
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:34,230
so when you talk to construct the file
in memory sort of so to speak

841
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:38,170
right you might be able to the week's
most request but they also say more to

842
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:39,610
policies which apply to this

843
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:43,930
but as a solution you can also
constructed stuff

844
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:48,220
a sports soul for example this to can
actually take

845
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:52,410
any of those requests and convert them
to the proper browser control

846
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:56,380
which you can actually use to deliver
those up attacks to a victim

847
00:49:56,380 --> 00:50:00,500
so for example attacking it's a home
router you want to actually send a

848
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:03,090
specific type of request the home router
to work

849
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:08,000
anything called your request also pretty
much like a form

850
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,540
and then submit the request as a form
because otherwise you won't work

851
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:15,100
know you can use like it's nice to be
request like this so this too is

852
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:16,470
basically a demonstration

853
00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:19,530
that that is absolutely possible

854
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:26,530
and I'm not sure if I have anything else
to show but

855
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:32,280
this

856
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:35,510
this one is essentially showing you how
you can just take

857
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:40,910
like a lot of

858
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:44,990
complex type payloads maybe called him
the code and stuff like this is

859
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:45,920
basically like

860
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:49,050
the same stuff you might see burp or as
a proxy

861
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:52,170
but the difference is that is that of
having

862
00:50:52,170 --> 00:50:56,920
unless the fuck commands that you can
execute on a payload you actually have a

863
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:57,620
whole

864
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:00,720
programming environment which is

865
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,760
a lot more powerful because

866
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:10,760
we can do all kinds of crazy things

867
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:16,009
you know weekend just gone create all
kinds of crazy payloads

868
00:51:16,009 --> 00:51:19,220
you can create like Jason payloads which
encoded

869
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:23,819
with tactic to the side and then
encapsulating Bay 64 encrypt and

870
00:51:23,819 --> 00:51:24,289
whatever

871
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:27,619
the whole ston are you how you want to
do this

872
00:51:27,619 --> 00:51:31,069
can be just recreate it and then you can
just executed every time you need

873
00:51:31,069 --> 00:51:31,880
something like this

874
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:36,329
so really the point of this is that the
JavaScript

875
00:51:36,329 --> 00:51:39,489
itself not only it's not clear language

876
00:51:39,489 --> 00:51:42,579
I mean is pretty stupid language with a
lot of stupid both

877
00:51:42,579 --> 00:51:46,480
on stupid things that he does but
actually it's not a language

878
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:50,359
and you can take it and you can create
Vadi Vadi advanced tools

879
00:51:50,359 --> 00:51:54,380
are not only that affect or can be used

880
00:51:54,380 --> 00:52:00,059
contest 10 for web on abilities also can
do all kinds of other stuff networking

881
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:05,519
as well just to finish

882
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:12,470
the slights com I just need to send some
credits to people who actually help me

883
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:14,069
out with us some of the

884
00:52:14,069 --> 00:52:18,140
collecting solve the research which
represented earlier and also some of the

885
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:20,069
pictures which are included on those
lights

886
00:52:20,069 --> 00:52:23,380
and of course in 2008 while

887
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:27,839
after conference in Poland we started
the us

888
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:31,460
me and some up some people from my group
we started doing something called human

889
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:32,119
exploits

890
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:36,180
which is pictures from people from the
conference

891
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:40,019
I'll just show you this fantasy in
action and

892
00:52:40,019 --> 00:52:44,170
without I wanna rock the presentation
and ask for questions

893
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:51,170
if anyone has any questions

894
00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:02,680
I think it just looks very cool %uh you
mentioned earlier that

895
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,860
some of the interaction requires a
plugin but then you demonstrate an

896
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:07,010
extension or they

897
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:11,730
day the distinction being extension
certainly JavaScript runs in the browser

898
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:15,370
a.m. is actually that parts at this that
require a

899
00:53:15,370 --> 00:53:18,760
plugin on the order of like Flash or
Java

900
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:23,970
mmm well we can now thing is that this
is a very very

901
00:53:23,970 --> 00:53:27,360
inlet just provide just exposes some
capabilities

902
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:32,270
it turns out that for example what flash
can do JavaScript may not be able to do

903
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:35,850
and vice versa you also have the same
thing with Java

904
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:39,530
as well another client side technologies
and as I said before

905
00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:42,570
in some cases for example you might have
a target doubt

906
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:46,670
allows it to the cross origin requests
by definition you know maybe has across

907
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:47,850
the main XML file

908
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:51,870
which actually with the white open
domain specifications which is no

909
00:53:51,870 --> 00:53:54,980
actually unlikely to happen you might
have other things

910
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:58,170
you know that help you out on but this
is actually they

911
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:01,540
raped in their which we can very quickly
create

912
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:05,590
a this helper utility switcher faith you
by the way

913
00:54:05,590 --> 00:54:09,700
just like 100 lines of code right not
will be able to take

914
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:12,810
any genetic happen requests and
translate it to whatever

915
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:16,410
medium you want to be translated to now

916
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:20,310
in in this case because more so these
tools are designed for

917
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:24,550
at this thing I made a simple browser
extensions which is actually written in

918
00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:25,110
JavaScript

919
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:28,490
itself and it's all simple and the chief

920
00:54:28,490 --> 00:54:35,490
you will too show you let me see it's
actually ridiculously simple

921
00:55:05,099 --> 00:55:12,099
I guess not a good

922
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:22,190
is actually not not very difficult
extensions a right to know

923
00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:25,589
its fuel isoko that is actually very
well structure

924
00:55:25,589 --> 00:55:29,190
call you know so it just provides some
helper met its

925
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:33,739
and in fact it just provides only one
just a light to cross the main

926
00:55:33,739 --> 00:55:37,880
requests that's all we can do you can do
whatever I really

927
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:42,150
also talking about the

928
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:46,489
the mall where espada a delivery system
that can be also used

929
00:55:46,489 --> 00:55:50,279
imagine I don't know if that's going to
be a sensible approach

930
00:55:50,279 --> 00:55:54,180
to actually have a model which actually
drop stuff into your Firefox

931
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:57,390
or flash to actually be weaken itself be
no

932
00:55:57,390 --> 00:56:00,559
so we can allow other tools to execute
within the environment

933
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:03,839
would actually being detected as being
malicious because it's a trust that

934
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:08,640
component this action

935
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:13,769
I'm yes was runnin how would like
unusual uses Principe compromise so

936
00:56:13,769 --> 00:56:17,220
for example would be if they just need
to run the beef ok on the hook to thank

937
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:19,019
you some javascript I'm

938
00:56:19,019 --> 00:56:22,410
as a torn because you two-month
extension with the use an eater

939
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:26,109
install the extension the extension is
only

940
00:56:26,109 --> 00:56:30,259
designed to some of the tools so for
example the scanner itself by running

941
00:56:30,259 --> 00:56:31,299
from I'll machine

942
00:56:31,299 --> 00:56:34,400
you won't be able to scan all up some
web-sites

943
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:38,900
the reason being is because comes from a
webpage and that with HS

944
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:43,210
security policies apply to it right so
you wouldn't be able to execute that's

945
00:56:43,210 --> 00:56:44,119
why you need this help

946
00:56:44,119 --> 00:56:47,249
extension to be able to do that now if
you talking about

947
00:56:47,249 --> 00:56:50,630
them so far an actual attack that you
want to construct attacking

948
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:54,369
someone dan you could take thing
framework

949
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:57,390
to construct a tax I can be as complex
as it can

950
00:56:57,390 --> 00:57:01,670
get right so if you think about
something like aboard the state's top

951
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:04,089
attack right where you actually want to
compromise

952
00:57:04,089 --> 00:57:07,739
survive some kind ever a vulnerability I

953
00:57:07,739 --> 00:57:11,430
IQ a buffer overflow and install
something else on the top of this Anne

954
00:57:11,430 --> 00:57:14,799
you actually have the sort of staging
environment you don't need to go or

955
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:17,989
launch Metasploit and actually create
all this like network

956
00:57:17,989 --> 00:57:21,230
stuff you know to be able to work you
can just execute the whole thing

957
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:25,239
farmer web browser on all we need is
just a delivery mechanism to send a

958
00:57:25,239 --> 00:57:27,059
request from point A to point B

959
00:57:27,059 --> 00:57:30,779
now you do any controls a this allowed
to do that such as the same origin

960
00:57:30,779 --> 00:57:31,499
policy is

961
00:57:31,499 --> 00:57:34,700
you can still do it blindly by a former
or something like this you know

962
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:38,109
which is known as as a CSR so

963
00:57:38,109 --> 00:57:42,109
I'm not sure if this answers your
question I'm

964
00:57:42,109 --> 00:57:45,809
almost I think there's more I'm sorry if
I'm

965
00:57:45,809 --> 00:57:49,019
for movie on music has been targeted I

966
00:57:49,019 --> 00:57:52,960
how would you sum much my bros as I
would be fit smartest me right in the

967
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:53,609
face book

968
00:57:53,609 --> 00:57:56,730
running like a one liner jokes for I'm
on compliance

969
00:57:56,730 --> 00:57:59,779
how would you compromises diseases
neater

970
00:57:59,779 --> 00:58:03,210
run apiece your job groups to talk
things a actually installing or

971
00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:04,069
sanctions or

972
00:58:04,069 --> 00:58:07,390
up compromising your browser will be its

973
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:10,420
will be kind of other related something
a browser vulnerability

974
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:14,660
you know so I mean if somebody wants to
compromise your browser or the couple

975
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:18,249
compromising your browser that's a whole
new different story you don't need to go

976
00:58:18,249 --> 00:58:19,239
to this extent

977
00:58:19,239 --> 00:58:22,739
a doing things if you want to use the
Valtteri

978
00:58:22,739 --> 00:58:26,239
your browser itself to compromise let's
say your network right

979
00:58:26,239 --> 00:58:30,039
then in that case no one needs to
compromise your browser they can just

980
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:30,970
keep the stage

981
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:34,789
you know it's actually a lot of hard
work you know actually compromise your

982
00:58:34,789 --> 00:58:35,670
browser these days

983
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:39,480
more if you doing all the things right
not saying that you know

984
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:43,819
browse is really safe it's not but you
know for someone who is educated

985
00:58:43,819 --> 00:58:46,859
they can actually make a very good
decisions and you know keep the

986
00:58:46,859 --> 00:58:51,319
browsers relative to say but if somebody
wants to take

987
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:55,609
the party to use the Website or be
exploited by says you shouldn't think

988
00:58:55,609 --> 00:58:56,690
this thing father

989
00:58:56,690 --> 00:59:00,480
toxic compromising a very very weird
ways let's say for example your router

990
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:04,700
they might want to compromise this
because you never know then

991
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:08,539
that's certainly possible we are to
compromise your browser on

992
00:59:08,539 --> 00:59:11,999
as I said this type of attack which
could be very simple we can actually

993
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:13,950
make it very complex and very

994
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:17,220
elaborate almost to text and

995
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:20,960
you see with to pick on my way spreading
you know she can make it like

996
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,819
very quotable attack thank you

997
00:59:24,819 --> 00:59:27,999
more questions

998
00:59:27,999 --> 00:59:32,359
well then thanks a lot

999
00:59:32,359 --> 00:59:39,359
thank you thank you

1000
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:50,410
this

1001
00:59:50,410 --> 00:59:57,410
sleep
