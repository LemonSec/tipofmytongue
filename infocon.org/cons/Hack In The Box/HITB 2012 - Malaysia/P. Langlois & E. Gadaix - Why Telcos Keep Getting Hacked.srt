1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:11,060
be face

2
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,130
a

3
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:12,860
this

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,840
school

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:21,840
schools

6
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,650
woo magic box okay so anyone who can
hike this

7
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:33,070
RF transmitter or has a frequency meter
I'm quite sure you can switch

8
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:37,290
my it slides instead of me this is
definitely the kind of technology

9
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,370
I wouldn't bet anything concrete doing
there

10
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:43,590
okay so it thank you for lunch

11
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,850
thank you for not leaving Matthew easy
through and the

12
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:50,250
letters and starts with basically a
little

13
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,079
story of want to know why telecom I've
been

14
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,370
hacked fossil so who

15
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:00,739
in this room I'll may have known some
friend

16
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:06,210
we did this kind of stuff okay a good
government share

17
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,550
okay great I so of course we've seen

18
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:12,770
I love people being back in the old days
great tales

19
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,960
about beach boxing and about doing these
kind of

20
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,929
really low level what is that thing the
blue boxing we going to

21
00:01:20,929 --> 00:01:24,569
leave all the details to Captain Crunch
sitting over here of course

22
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:28,399
kudos to him and is the one who created

23
00:01:28,399 --> 00:01:32,050
virtually the whole industry so we are
not going to talk about it today but

24
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:35,069
let's just say that it was the way to
abuse early

25
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:38,950
in band signalling systems before out
I've been singing systems were

26
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:39,709
introduced

27
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:42,920
was that people didn't believe in telcos
at

28
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,369
someone would actually play crazy tools
in this phone

29
00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:50,179
those were really a kiss them as I stood
you to have a detailed stuff like that

30
00:01:50,179 --> 00:01:54,500
but woods MD but people and basically is
our focus was

31
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,670
maybe at the wrong place so that to
change

32
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:02,130
sings and this is the bottom line about
cellco securities they always assume

33
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,869
that the network is secure and no one
else is playing there

34
00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:08,489
so same thing for payphone you know the
US red box right

35
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:11,910
simulating tones that's you you say you
have some money

36
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,230
into the PayPal are you entered but in
France people got

37
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,810
Walt got like oh man since people gets

38
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,280
into the phone and rubs a payphone and

39
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,680
also we call trust money is we're going
to sell

40
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,420
the cuff this kind of New York on the
two inserts into

41
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,019
as a pay phone and you just pay and 18 X
bar or whatever

42
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:36,280
well how to be charging so they were
sending

43
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,819
Neil tones the same way but reversed the
dunes were going to so-called thing

44
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:43,980
okay you have one less credit okay you
have one less credit

45
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:49,010
you can identify these kind of sick it
go ahead

46
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:52,640
guys owns the talent wat okay low-pass
filter

47
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,200
to you just need to put that on the line
and who certainly not

48
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,650
these nineteen cured stone is flowing in
to

49
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,689
gets that the cops decree dated okay so
this was a

50
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:07,170
French got the walls all what school

51
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:10,439
which is a our equivalent of the red box
once again

52
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:14,299
nobody in to go with us humans and that
would be a no snipers

53
00:03:14,299 --> 00:03:19,499
same for the PBX is a PBX issues have
basically private extension to revert to

54
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:20,319
an exchange

55
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,870
and they are used by corporations to
basically have to look online for the

56
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:25,469
company's

57
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:30,549
and the vendors of PBX they didn't get
too much about security however the

58
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:31,879
hackers and the free cuz

59
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:36,409
we're very interested in dial out
capabilities and

60
00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:40,109
being able to basically make free calls
on behalf of the corporation the web

61
00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:40,689
using

62
00:03:40,689 --> 00:03:44,819
and as usual was the communication
technologies a vendor's didn't want to

63
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:46,819
take responsibility for security

64
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:50,519
and therefore to their clients were
exposed

65
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:53,810
yep know what's funny is that is at the
same behavior saying

66
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:57,109
hey man this is a customer problem its

67
00:03:57,109 --> 00:04:01,280
he's equipment his customer PMI's
installed it we don't care about that

68
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,870
yen of course there was huge deal in
dispute and stuff like that its

69
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,060
exactly the same thing when you hear but
net

70
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,560
ours the problem of our subscriber not
hours

71
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,049
and ito's okay

72
00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:19,810
you know these things kudos to on Hauser
with recovering from

73
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:23,010
I think ha night last night for

74
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,440
putting on this kind of a software
basically tell cool where

75
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,150
the first victim on this kind of thing
because they were the first user

76
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,610
network and of course

77
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:37,349
of course there were also a lot of
remote maintenance terminals in all the

78
00:04:37,349 --> 00:04:40,900
tell week whitman and this is still
available today you could make for some

79
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,000
strange plot strange that addresses
sometimes from owe them

80
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,110
X 25 and basically you reach a
maintenance terminal that allows you to

81
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:51,840
control the network element that's
critical to tell infrastructure

82
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,080
the things we saw in 20-30 years ago and
we still see

83
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,240
today okay anyone comes down to the
default login password for this

84
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,509
narrow you can see you

85
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:09,509
okay now you can say nobody is the all

86
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:15,879
okay tell us about some or a call log in
the TUF

87
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:19,300
well in Houston find most exposed on the
internet with very

88
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,889
stupid the full pass was like Oracle
Oracle for telco boxes

89
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:26,569
I mean we're talking about value-added
services platform running in the heart

90
00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:27,759
of the network

91
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,169
and the exposed to the internet with
login from

92
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:35,030
and Oracle user with Oracle that's what
this shouldn't be seen even

93
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,190
in 20 years ago and was still seeing it
today okay so some people still believe

94
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,750
they are intended to be the world

95
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:44,780
well thats the naive stupidity kind of

96
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:48,560
problems at you we see up okay

97
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,729
then says also force

98
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:55,639
dynamic that say's okay what accused
have when you have

99
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:59,590
millions of students who so the only get
cheap

100
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:03,310
access to something you can enable them
to chat

101
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:06,430
with some other people well let me tell

102
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:10,530
which was miss you could be a great the
invention in France

103
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:14,840
which basically with heated pools of
people to get free access to that

104
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,090
chap servers and that created a

105
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:22,050
quite a lot of people got into

106
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,110
and Elaine packing X 25 yeah

107
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:28,930
and role we use use light because it's
quite a cool one

108
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,990
the iran tactics 25 network we just
wanted to

109
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:35,759
briefly mention X 25 because most %uh
view here probably don't know what it is

110
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,379
but in the early

111
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:41,949
a early days of acting when the internet
access was not prevail in the next 25

112
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:44,610
was a week ago and was a way to access

113
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:48,530
I love systems because X 25
interconnected every country in the

114
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:49,520
world

115
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,090
and even those lines were not free and
Nexus was not

116
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:56,569
readily available that was a great way
to explore telecom systems including

117
00:06:56,569 --> 00:06:59,289
with countries like this one

118
00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:03,190
was ready available need thats wasn't

119
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:07,389
so now we get out of a priest 3 we get
to match her

120
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:10,539
kind of Golden Age of as a

121
00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:13,949
taken security smoke E

122
00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:17,470
I fine thanks to Captain Crunch

123
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:21,870
and lots of friends and he's where
roaming the International

124
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:26,229
networks with rubles I the tech industry
said a

125
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:30,599
disgusting lol thus a lot of money and
on top of that we can't raise a course

126
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:33,689
so let's do something about boobs so the

127
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:38,139
invented s s7 which is signaling system
7

128
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:41,770
the success of C 85 go figure

129
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:44,900
where does jumping for ipv4 to ipv6 was
actually there was a

130
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,330
v6 version but it was never put light
like

131
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:51,599
history repeats the ticket here what you
have is

132
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,020
just beginning of any calls at even you
do right now

133
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,639
when you're taking your phone and you
make in court George the eighteen

134
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,580
I initial address message onto this is
something that work

135
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:06,650
now just just so you understand there's
a huge difference between the

136
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:10,990
to come signaling in Captain Crunch de
suite was in band which means you had

137
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,840
access to it

138
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,550
as a user with ss7 all this signaling
network is out-of-band

139
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:20,159
you don't have access to it at all it's
completely close

140
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:23,889
and this is why all the freaking time
however as we going to show you

141
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:27,710
it created his own set of problems
everything is a.m.

142
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:30,840
with this this said okay teams we had
but people

143
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,039
we don't want people let's make close
network

144
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:37,849
of ss7 operators me interest each other

145
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:41,530
that's the model called the were gone
well into what governs us

146
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:45,450
only nice people right so the thing is

147
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:49,570
in these days protocol didn't need any
kind of

148
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,030
onto spoofing or any kind of
cryptographic security

149
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:56,150
it's like a bit AP in the nineteen
eighties

150
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:59,750
exit fix things changed I P what we know
to do

151
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:03,980
is to evil intercom well that's a bit
the difference because

152
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,170
right now 99 person on the Internet

153
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:10,680
elsa sorry ss7 and click on traffic

154
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,090
in the world is still going through
these so you can

155
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:18,000
easy do the year of service by
requesting

156
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,240
maybe one hundred million calls to

157
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,480
100 million numbers in america

158
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,930
to 100 million members inference

159
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,960
you just occupies will address and say
okay fitted up

160
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,470
provision some capacity between these
two countries

161
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:38,820
and of course with a crash so basically
all the denial of services that were

162
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,510
discovered with IP haven't really been
studied with this is seven and this is

163
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,400
why the still apply today

164
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,600
because no real review by the vendors
all the players has been

165
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,320
there hasn't been any serious attacks at
least not widespread once

166
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,380
so here letting any it's like okay

167
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,720
I want for $10 million euros per day

168
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,600
the magnificent lack of occur mindset
this people don't think

169
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,450
that and the attack on the system
knowledge is not to realize that their

170
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:10,670
but people doing something because group
that for crash what doesn't work crash

171
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:14,620
and net for corporate my network
operator crash cost per day

172
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:18,410
I recall Ste image et cetera to miss you
can easy

173
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:23,600
didn't think ahead and didn't adapt fast
enough to change

174
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,990
nope same way I'll things evolve and
your

175
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:30,720
all benefiting from the factual roaming
from your own country

176
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,130
in too many jobs and I am them

177
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:38,300
solely you need to use prepaid and one
things that happen is that

178
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:43,450
seems as no perimeter defense all in
eighty-three percent of the keys

179
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:47,040
you all expert in to come ss7 network

180
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,470
this no filtering adds a very literal
level as a boundary level

181
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:56,140
so basically you can inject an easy and
you can spoof for example your message

182
00:10:56,140 --> 00:11:00,980
which is good map will be application
part inset subscriber they top

183
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,200
you insert subscriber data into small
bites which thing

184
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,270
opens with his guy with growing into a
network

185
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:11,760
is not really I a prepaid usery's
apostate user

186
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,010
so subtly I turn might subscription

187
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:19,750
from a prepaid needs to be validated
Cooper call

188
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,800
into a postpaid which well you can

189
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,010
consume as much as you want is
generating review

190
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:30,520
to here and because there is a lack of
authentication access control with this

191
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,430
is seven in that you can basically spoof
messages

192
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:37,370
from one network to another you can also
send normal messages like location

193
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,620
update maker

194
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,620
network believe that a certain
subscriber is

195
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,900
in another country for example which
will disconnected

196
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,280
from his home network so you can do
basically remote denial of service on

197
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,120
any user on any network just by sending
a few messages

198
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,580
so I was in India talking to
collaborator CQ

199
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,740
and the Isaiah here on this thing

200
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:01,520
your not history anything your printer
your

201
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,870
interconnections is bringing 100 percent
of your

202
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:08,290
international roaming review you're not
getting anything it turns the school

203
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,350
network engineering

204
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:12,690
goes like this: what we can do 50 our

205
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,920
ss7 Walter which is all this TP

206
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,190
and the guy didn't even know you could
do featuring right

207
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:22,460
has not even about treaty like the
separation of rounding and

208
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:26,240
firewalls it still same box and as a
person most of the time they don't even

209
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,460
know the name filtering

210
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:32,680
well that was a kid so then we get into
the Morgans countries

211
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,600
and times of 2000's and where we see a

212
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:43,360
use development of one kind of security

213
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,220
it so here we go into change the topic a
little bit and talk about another aspect

214
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,490
of security which is a bit worrying

215
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:52,730
as we're showing you in this
presentation will be issuing that there

216
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,850
is a cap

217
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:58,710
in the infrastructure operator security
is a gap between what the vendor say's

218
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:03,040
what the operators implement and what
the hackers can do is this a huge

219
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,450
gap which means that most network
operators are not secure

220
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:09,510
however this is a worrying trend from

221
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:13,240
authorities intelligence agencies law
enforcement to develop security

222
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,360
techniques

223
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,800
that I'm not really meant to protect you
network %ah basically meant to

224
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,710
well to check what you doing to
intercept a communication and we're

225
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:24,320
going to talk a little bit about this

226
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,800
so up go back to one slight this was
just too

227
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,860
basically explain what kind of parties
are involving into interception

228
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:38,030
as as you know there are two types of
interceptions as a lawful interception

229
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:40,940
and it feels a kind of an interception
is the one that is done by the

230
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,150
authorities and we're going to talk
about that

231
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:46,310
it basically involve a court orders
warrants

232
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:50,130
and also all the technical capabilities
of the operators as well as interface

233
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:53,170
with law enforcement authorities now
this kind of

234
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:56,710
telecom interception is not new I think
it basically existed

235
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:01,690
since telephone was invented people
wanted to know what you've been talking

236
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:04,230
to each other s playing is not the

237
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:07,790
knowing your profession bob is a second
oldest profession

238
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:11,210
so how is it done in practice in
practice

239
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:14,610
nowadays you have interception system
that a fully integrated

240
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:19,380
in the in the vendor equipment that is
located at the operators vendors provide

241
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,830
facility which is cool lawful
interception gateway

242
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:27,030
which is basically a platform
interconnected to switch cheese and the

243
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,410
network elements

244
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:31,540
and that yessir all the events in real
time

245
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,660
and send them to law enforcement
agencies

246
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:38,070
now ideally those actions by law
enforcement

247
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:41,880
are under the supervision of legal
authority like good

248
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:46,040
judge in court orders warrants subpoenas
are required for interception

249
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,190
but as you can imagine it's not always
the case

250
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:53,350
up to technical interfaces themselves
are not that complicated you need a

251
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,730
certain benefits because you mean

252
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:57,950
sifting voice traffic in real-time
several channels

253
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:03,060
a you can basically intercept absolutely
everything and we're going to talk about

254
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:03,970
that

255
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:08,030
up they're not only intercepting your
phone calls they also intercepting at

256
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,600
the fiber optic levels

257
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,800
now you can imagine that to intercept a
phone call a judge would say yes

258
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,620
sees the probable cause and we going to
intercept that subscribe

259
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,780
when you into the fiber optics where

260
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:24,720
a single fiber can carry tens of
thousands of some things called

261
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,920
you have no such luxury this is massive
interceptions on the

262
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,980
tactical level I am we also have

263
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,270
all sorts of a VoIP intersection
interception

264
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:39,070
don't think that because you making a
phone call over Voice over IP Skype

265
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:43,420
Citra up now they have platforms
methodologies

266
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:47,980
and technologies to intercept very
conveniently all you avoid or AP traffic

267
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,210
including when it jumps from country to
country

268
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:55,280
include several providers a complicated
routing in Sitra

269
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,290
as a development up the interception
technologies

270
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:02,430
fast-growing and nothing as

271
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:06,280
escaped Big Brother including I M S
which is

272
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,980
next-generation infrastructure for
telcos that

273
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:13,370
also works with Voice over IP seep

274
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:18,330
et cetera so every time a new telecom
technologies introduce

275
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:21,650
this a new interception technology to
basically says

276
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:25,140
was some civilians and what it's doing
his way that was

277
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:28,920
exactly's securities was abused by back
door into every exxon

278
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,030
axe switches increase in Athens when
this

279
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:36,020
newborn something like one hundred key
government official from grease

280
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:40,330
92 section is not only done as the
carrier operator level it sometime

281
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:43,460
dawn at the hands that level for example
he sees

282
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,530
a part of the brochure for an Italian
company that's a

283
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:50,100
sales what they call remote system

284
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,900
itself that government and intelligence
is and what it is is basically a

285
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,870
sophisticated fortune that they put

286
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:58,990
on your computer and on your phone and
intercepts

287
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:02,920
everything and send it back to normal
quickly as our friendly showing

288
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,539
not or italians I like that

289
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:13,439
abuse the but they seem to be very
successful in selling the product year

290
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,870
yes on then we

291
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:20,629
we got to the highest level which is
that the critical interception basically

292
00:17:20,629 --> 00:17:21,509
reception

293
00:17:21,509 --> 00:17:25,809
is what the military's doing a

294
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:30,409
the the basically fixes interception
game to a whole new level

295
00:17:30,409 --> 00:17:34,639
with a candid intercepted two country
level at the city level they can

296
00:17:34,639 --> 00:17:37,779
block anti area in into the traffic

297
00:17:37,779 --> 00:17:40,799
jam a replaying to save

298
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:45,580
all sorts of things and the up very
sophisticated platform they can also all

299
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:48,269
sorts of even correlation with other

300
00:17:48,269 --> 00:17:52,259
not only you'll take an interception but
as we will see

301
00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:55,820
also means like your you social feature
email

302
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:59,870
check messages it's it's everything can
be correlated to build the profile

303
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:03,710
this is just a picture of a a passive
interception system

304
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:07,720
passive means it doesn't me it doesn't
need the cooperation of the mobile

305
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,059
operator

306
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:13,889
in practice it means you can intercept
what you want without asking anyone

307
00:18:13,889 --> 00:18:17,539
so as I said there are two types of
interceptions lawful intercept which is

308
00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:18,169
Don's

309
00:18:18,169 --> 00:18:21,929
facilities provided by the operator or

310
00:18:21,929 --> 00:18:26,679
through your own equipment without the
permission of anyone

311
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:30,320
source this kind of interception systems
at the ploy over cities but they can

312
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,259
also be deployed in

313
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:34,289
in mobile units to improve the precision
winded

314
00:18:34,289 --> 00:18:38,889
the the full it I get the f2 deploy
since passive systems in

315
00:18:38,889 --> 00:18:42,820
was your area of interest as a weakness
for festive interception system is that

316
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:45,710
it needs to be located in the area of
interception

317
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:51,299
as opposed to lawful intercept gate with
intercept anything from anywhere

318
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:55,080
up one of the challenges that law
enforcement is facing and it's not only

319
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:55,649
with

320
00:18:55,649 --> 00:19:00,350
a more by phone calls and prepaid card
it situates also is

321
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:04,759
all also sings that identify you as a
person

322
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:07,759
but you using usually multiple
identities on the Internet

323
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:11,360
so if there's a platform that can be
correlate with identities

324
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,710
data mining and and painted

325
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:18,169
very precise picture of the individuals
be between

326
00:19:18,169 --> 00:19:21,350
behind sorry since virtually identities
up

327
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:24,690
everything is intercepted in real time
including

328
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:29,509
a I'm at Pau of course the webmail as
well

329
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:33,759
the chat system thing to see if this was
a real screenshots of real interception

330
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,379
systems

331
00:19:34,379 --> 00:19:38,539
so you can see that it's very
user-friendly you consume Kylie

332
00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:42,340
correlates rumors uses archives

333
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:45,559
yes so I mean

334
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:48,850
I understand from the government
perspective they want to they want to

335
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:52,110
solve problems and the problems of
interception

336
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:55,559
of course the justified by saying we are
tracking on the

337
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:58,850
terrorist and pedophile and walls but
guys

338
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:01,669
but as we all know it's stuff like that
and then it's used to intercept

339
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:03,000
everything

340
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,490
everywhere the now

341
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:10,059
government always trying to solve
problems and law enforcement is no

342
00:20:10,059 --> 00:20:10,730
exception

343
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:14,940
this is occurring 10 challenges that
their faces at the moment

344
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,240
and I'm sure that ones they've sold
those changes I'll find

345
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,499
next than once and every time

346
00:20:21,499 --> 00:20:24,620
you lose a little bit of your privacy
use it will be too few

347
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:27,720
right to be left alone on the Internet
and

348
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,970
this is only increasing

349
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:35,309
technically speaking they are up to
sings are intercepted about your

350
00:20:35,309 --> 00:20:36,509
communications

351
00:20:36,509 --> 00:20:39,889
what what you were thinking probably you
think about the voice contention when

352
00:20:39,889 --> 00:20:40,570
you speak

353
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:44,249
your call is recorded it safer but it's
actually less frequent and

354
00:20:44,249 --> 00:20:47,759
what we call the I write which is in two
separate information which is a lot more

355
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:49,440
valuable for enforcement

356
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,460
is basically all the events that your
phone generates location update so we

357
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,830
can know where you are

358
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:58,820
SMS is that you send and receive as a
call records that indicate

359
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:03,320
whom you die and when even when the
person doesn't pick up the phone

360
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,240
alls events are recorded by the telcos
and they never deleted

361
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,730
so the provide huge data mining

362
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:14,990
for law enforcement love discussion
about

363
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:19,899
is a metadata traffic places on it is
really an infringement of privacy

364
00:21:19,899 --> 00:21:23,190
needs to be sanctioned on right that's a
lot of

365
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:26,509
debate in this area

366
00:21:26,509 --> 00:21:29,710
so and basically the problem means
they're is of course

367
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:33,370
many this privacy issue maybe some
government using

368
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:36,759
going to Ascension gateways the wrong
way but

369
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:40,980
for us as good as its security
professional the real problem

370
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:44,029
is that when you ask some telco
operators

371
00:21:44,029 --> 00:21:47,029
are you doing security on your network

372
00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:51,450
there going to see absolutely yes and
they have plenty of securities

373
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:55,769
full management have revenue assurance
IT security

374
00:21:55,769 --> 00:21:59,499
they've got all that interception
security but he's a cat

375
00:21:59,499 --> 00:22:02,870
yeah because if you ask what he's doing
interception

376
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:06,769
security reprieve in some people from
injecting packets into your

377
00:22:06,769 --> 00:22:09,840
network of nothing so the thing is

378
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,950
the just creating successfully a one
billion dollar market

379
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:17,120
for some companies to provide services
to government right

380
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,169
and now the real problem is that the
keys excusing

381
00:22:20,169 --> 00:22:24,559
we all things work investing insecurity
so how can we be insecure

382
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:29,279
and that's where actually alza no more
important security question go

383
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:30,080
unanswered

384
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,149
can I inject content is my systems and
friends to come

385
00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:37,740
network really resistance robust has
been fastest

386
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:41,940
it is a cute way on security onto the
sacrament all these questions

387
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:45,419
well basically go unanswered it's the
focus

388
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:49,610
as an attachment the I think you too
subtly

389
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:53,330
you get the mmm operator I'll

390
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:57,850
23 astonished to see the sustained two
to three days

391
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:03,200
dear service which pre- vent part of
total communication during the attack

392
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,299
with their network and those goodies
have nothing

393
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:10,519
to protect it I'm not speaking of Kings
equivalent of

394
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:14,169
harm or networks kind of BGP no roading

395
00:23:14,169 --> 00:23:17,409
of stuff like that undertaken level no
i'm just thinking

396
00:23:17,409 --> 00:23:20,490
do you have something to confuse to
resist fake and let

397
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:23,889
other traffic goes through they don't so

398
00:23:23,889 --> 00:23:27,509
that's what happened in France well
mobile network operator got

399
00:23:27,509 --> 00:23:30,620
US like simple equivalent of being minus

400
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:34,350
F ping fluid on on the network

401
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:37,659
this is that a network and basically
where they can define

402
00:23:37,659 --> 00:23:41,480
this situation if he'll eighty-three
percent

403
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,820
%uh ss7 network and seek to network and
now

404
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:48,450
evolution MSN its which are being idle

405
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:51,590
to this kind of thing so

406
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:55,320
then we start to see the progress some
people who are

407
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,539
actually asking themself does some kind
of

408
00:23:58,539 --> 00:24:03,409
each issue is this stuff can be useful
cyberattack

409
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:07,919
it has impact on the economy so what can
I do

410
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:12,860
this thing is that it's not requiring
anymore to have these be good

411
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:16,430
SSN access awesome for how to get by the
way

412
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:20,460
plenty of these Axwell done by hacking
into less-developed countries

413
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,030
ask who's the web interface on the
operator

414
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:28,350
and then from remote country ends in
from the gym thing to this ad and

415
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,140
content note

416
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:32,820
now as much easier the marketing
department

417
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:37,240
just pushed for the femtocell deployment
into plenty of countries

418
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,440
which does the network and here's is a
total heresy

419
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,050
because the saying packs much more
critical information

420
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:48,600
and his direct access through VPN to

421
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,400
the network to the college because the
operator once again the operator goes

422
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:52,840
like this:

423
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:57,130
this VPN Virtual Private Network

424
00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:00,610
protecting my country tis you like yet

425
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:04,140
was the keys to his network well it
seems that fanned those

426
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:07,140
okay and of course until she gets
compromised

427
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:11,730
here it was early next with them quite
like a 2003 for dummies

428
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:14,810
FPGA access viewed

429
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:17,980
boots the thought of through insecure
the

430
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:21,000
mechanism was a fun where unit so

431
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,580
not seeing you you'd say okay people are
taking

432
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:27,950
consciousness is that and since they are
are going to

433
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:31,640
try to evolve and try to change another
problem

434
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,890
in this industry as a change is not past
fast into the

435
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:39,150
mindset security management San into the
attackers

436
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:42,710
the for example you all know that void
catastrophes

437
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:46,350
like injecting VoIP sniffing for a
delusional

438
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:49,810
sniffing Voice et cetera okay now

439
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:53,250
we still causes a specifics you want
Italian community

440
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:56,730
and isn't with the smothers ability you
have see

441
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:00,050
plus ss7 which enable you to inject

442
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:04,500
role packets in to see directly into
that they come calling it work

443
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:08,640
so of course there is nothing they can
do anything the same kind of attack I

444
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,120
said

445
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,350
but who can do see on the Internet is a
telco

446
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:15,950
now it's everyone on the Internet the
citric

447
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:19,340
easy discoverable okay 0

448
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:22,670
doesn't we're getting into new era the

449
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:25,970
I ralph cyberwar ready to cyber sir

450
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:29,480
and basically good

451
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,750
we're going to see what that Texas well

452
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:38,360
yet this is a this is not a boring like
this is a very important site this is

453
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:43,310
taken from one as the very successful

454
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,710
silicon vendor that the moment I don't
know if you if you see it's probably a

455
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:47,570
little bit

456
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:51,230
small but he's busy is this security
documentation and this security

457
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:53,300
documentation is extremely detail

458
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,730
it's very sore o it covers every area of

459
00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:01,650
up the network systems users operating
system auditing in Sitra

460
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:05,070
a you can see they've done their
homework they

461
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:08,580
really have covered everything they
could cover

462
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:14,010
and Yazd that seal this doesn't mean the
networks are secure

463
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:17,500
as a problem is that the primaries

464
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:21,490
the vendors are going to specify a
certain set of security rules but the

465
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:23,280
operators are not going to follow them

466
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,330
or if they do they're going to fall on
the of them because of operational

467
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:27,530
constraints

468
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:31,980
because of marketing imperatives
decision because of the management that

469
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:35,950
pics the business as bigger priorities
in security

470
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:39,760
and it's also difficult to find the
right skill sets to implement a dick on

471
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,530
security

472
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:45,210
most people are familiar with IT
security but when it comes to take 'em

473
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:46,180
security with

474
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:49,340
every vendor implementing its all
proprietary interface

475
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:53,200
very different ways of managing network
element its

476
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,890
it's actually quite difficult and is a
skill sets required to do that

477
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:01,370
it's not widely available so the
operators have trouble finding the right

478
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:01,800
guy

479
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,040
secure the network and most of the time
they're more interested

480
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,300
in pushing new services and pushing you
security

481
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,620
systems now let's

482
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:14,690
let's look at a few examples and see how
so

483
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:17,780
compromising network infrastructure as
as

484
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:21,130
wide-ranging implications that this is
just a little over a few

485
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:24,540
to choose a call network the core
network ease

486
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:28,960
wears a switching takes places where we
have elements like them a seasonal but

487
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,660
switching

488
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:32,980
center with its Jess n which is part of
the thing for structure

489
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:37,050
we've got the media gateway with the
virus interfaces we've got the AP

490
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:37,670
backbone

491
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:42,820
this is the heart of the network now
this is a very dangerous areas for

492
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:43,530
hackers

493
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:46,750
and that people like to be roaming on

494
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:50,790
however they are all controlled if you
see you a book you see that

495
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:55,500
or s s operation support system every
time they come in the world is managed

496
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,490
by and with this

497
00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:00,670
and SOS eighth here this is just a
functional

498
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:03,780
view full the interface is that they're
managing with this

499
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:08,450
is connected to absolutely everything
it's usually running a large UNIX

500
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:09,580
clusters

501
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:12,770
and its into Rick Cohen connected with
every network element

502
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:16,800
every single one of them and as such it
can control of them

503
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:22,090
a this is just an example of the fuse it
has access to every pie and meter every

504
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:24,630
value everything can be changed

505
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:28,030
so what what do you what do you see

506
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:32,050
you've got a very complex infrastructure
critical infrastructure

507
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:35,670
that's managed by hundreds of people by
a very complex teams

508
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:38,890
but you've got one system that can rule
them all

509
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:42,450
the Oasis in rules originate work as we
see here with the region it with

510
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:44,830
controllers a base stations

511
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:50,180
it can controls switching environment
can controls at databases

512
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:54,510
XHR basically can see

513
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:57,840
everything in the network every other
arm

514
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,750
there is nothing that is not controlled
by the

515
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:05,550
base USS it would be a great way to
detect security fence because as you can

516
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,420
see

517
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:09,900
as with this which is basically
presenting allowances

518
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:13,980
monitored 24 hours a day and is but they
are very strict procedures in network

519
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,320
operators to resolve faults

520
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,340
the problem is that security is not
considered as a fault so it

521
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:23,530
you never shows up on on screens

522
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:27,990
and what does it mean when you've got
access to a system that can control

523
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:31,110
everything it means you can go
everywhere on the network

524
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:34,160
and make your own changes Kiwi we're

525
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:40,000
looking at an example of interception
that leads to financial compromise

526
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,180
once you have the Nexus two the network
operator once you've penetrated

527
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:47,480
infrastructure it's very unlikely that
you would be detected because they are

528
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,420
usually in the heart of the network
tunnel

529
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:54,030
real security controls so you you able
to sniff traffic at will

530
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:57,550
now the vendor of that particular
solution in this example is a very

531
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:59,540
well-known vendor for mobile money

532
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:03,540
and the brochure say that the solution
is an cryptid into and

533
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:06,580
it but many different elements in that
in that system

534
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:10,260
that at beezys application servers tom
cat Citra

535
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:14,510
anything crafted into and I think it fit
into NY is it

536
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:17,640
I'm able to get the PN apps mobile money
users

537
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:22,040
it's very simple because we are sniffing
sick trent are the network with

538
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:26,570
me things as a seven traffic the vendor
never conceded that the vendor conceded

539
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:27,660
that

540
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:31,690
ss7 traffic is secure or whatever they
sing

541
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:36,240
a but we do think this is a the traffic
was light uses uses the traffic you know

542
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,290
when you send a school to your phone

543
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:42,120
well we can simply follows a ticket from
sections reconstruct the traffic

544
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:46,050
and basically intercept the PIN code
which then we can use to

545
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:49,430
conduct move on your parisians empty
people's accounts

546
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:54,090
and steal their money so its its it's a
shining example of why

547
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:57,430
a secure solution once deployed in a
tent come

548
00:31:57,430 --> 00:32:01,300
a infrastructure can be made insecure
because of this is seven

549
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:04,340
traffic that can be intercepted

550
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:08,160
when we stop thinking into that mobile
money service

551
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,380
we also know is that we get access to

552
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:14,750
love very confidential information for
example the sea member

553
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:19,250
and the key I which you know I'm not
going to have to talk to feel

554
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:23,700
GSM again but this is what you need
she's a busy bees secret key in this

555
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:27,720
in the same number you can use that to
crewmen seems

556
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:31,520
when you plan seems you going to use the
clone subscriber account

557
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:35,780
we find credit card numbers of course we
find peeing on booking code before a key

558
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,210
I

559
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:40,390
ethics encrypt it all those databases
that contain all this info critical

560
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:41,560
information

561
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,750
and one thing the a season when you talk
to kato take

562
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:47,830
operators it oh yeah it's secure on the
brochure it say's

563
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:51,360
on the completed form of the key I will
be displayed to the user

564
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,680
here that yes exactly that is we have
both so

565
00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:00,510
I'm same every time they do banking f2
for those who regulations for examples

566
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:03,740
is a key way see which is in know your
customer

567
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:07,400
requires operators to generate reports
those ripples

568
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:11,570
will contain names with clinton ID
numbers with printing

569
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:16,020
Mobile Money account members so the
privacy implications of an operator

570
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,610
getting compromise a are huge

571
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:22,650
all your personal information he stalled
databases

572
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:26,720
and sometime even the vendors themselves
I'm not secure

573
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,380
this is an example this is still the
same Mobile Money vendor and have

574
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:33,590
in their name to shame them but they

575
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:38,320
even each of the client software
repository to update infrastructure

576
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,150
well the clients we were working on is
mask out but

577
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:45,780
all the others we had access to them we
wait

578
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:50,150
we had access to sell come see me bang
the bank to the for nichols'

579
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:53,880
very important banking and telecom
operators

580
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,810
we could basically going then modify the
software repository and

581
00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:00,810
back to all the systems in to settle
their money

582
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:04,290
so it's unbelievable for

583
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:08,910
financial companies that is deploying
Life Financial Services to an operator

584
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:12,040
make mistakes like that and we see that
all the time

585
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,230
and of course once you have compromised

586
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:18,330
Mobile Money System it becomes a a
simple it's

587
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:22,270
your query to at yourself money you
basically you can

588
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:26,070
you can no generate as much money as you
want in your phone then you can using to

589
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,140
pay stuff transfer

590
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:30,770
et cetera I'll although information

591
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:34,180
are in those telecom system when they
have an end yes

592
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:37,630
location based server then you can

593
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:41,899
basically spy on everyone's location
well as a as a mobile operators always

594
00:34:41,899 --> 00:34:42,880
know your location

595
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:46,190
but not always as precisely as you would
think

596
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:49,680
because the only kept said I into the
kitchen area code and the accuracy of

597
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,000
that

598
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,480
in a urban area is about a hundred
meters however when you

599
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,720
start to the triangulation you timing
advance in the mix

600
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,600
then there's the accuracies greatly
improved and now it is of course with

601
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,740
GPS

602
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:05,720
in your handset even more precision but
this as

603
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,720
very sensitive national security and
privacy implications when you can be

604
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:13,640
track where people are in real time

605
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:17,230
when when you compromise of Isis
template for example he we

606
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:21,330
compromising I N voucher system are you
able to come to feet

607
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:25,950
money I N is a platform that runs a
prepaid the PP's

608
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:29,950
you know the phone you've got in your
pocket was that credit that you recharge

609
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:34,260
well that credit comes from captures
those factors can be adjusted

610
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:38,080
or you can even print your own batch
which is equivalent of printing money

611
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:41,370
you could print you know millions about
shoes

612
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:44,540
they would be recognized by the system
and

613
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:47,570
telecom would find out six months later
what happened is

614
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:51,180
ever there was a problem about this is
that they were used to that because

615
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:54,240
all the employees will rotini checked

616
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,000
and some were caught doings action now
the problem is that

617
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,320
we sings the stuff getting act remote
key

618
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,400
and then popping up on some underground
for um to sell my

619
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,860
thousands of times this is a very
important point if it was all internal

620
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:10,050
fraud now we sing external attacks

621
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:13,680
the them eco-system attackers

622
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,000
I've matured into some some ecosystem
that

623
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,830
benefit not only from fraud but the from
63 T

624
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:24,190
attacks which is different fraud we're
going to meet a gated

625
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:27,410
becomes too big this kind of attack it
happens once

626
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:30,900
you're dead you don't know which
cultures or which H&R

627
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:34,160
subscriber working from but system is as
you know

628
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,920
a very often this image to use with
one-time passwords a a

629
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,270
secure identification you connect to a
bank

630
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:44,770
and they send you an SMS was a pin code
or whatever that use to log in and using

631
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:46,300
its secure because he is

632
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:51,240
season out-of-band network at the same
channel as my old indication Victor

633
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,700
it's gonna be secure right I mean it's
encrypt it was years

634
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,750
take we secure but no actually you know
once you're in that that

635
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:02,900
infrastructures SMSC which is stored for
what platform which means SMS will be

636
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,990
stored in a database at some stage

637
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:08,220
they can be easily intercepted in with
I'm so

638
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:11,930
all and I think you would have to do is
basically intercept your PIN code in

639
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:14,220
your in your one-time password
transaction

640
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:17,660
and use it before you do to compromise
or chain of

641
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:21,500
that so-called to effective security

642
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:25,400
with its Google secure I'll

643
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,700
doing the beginning with spoke about a
remote maintenance terminal

644
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:32,600
and they are still all overs a place in
telecom infrastructure

645
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,000
they are many ways to access network
elements most common ways with because

646
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,500
when them operation and maintenance
Texas but they are other axis

647
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,950
like remote maintenance terminal that

648
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:46,480
can be connected to remotely that have
default username and password

649
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,670
I'm not free documented but that gives
you access to

650
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:52,700
all that the school's a memory basically
for privilege over

651
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:58,560
a critical network element just placing
a little town that come in

652
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,640
yeah was a inside sort of thing that

653
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:05,040
because a legacy some which is that a

654
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:09,760
or technology has to be and for what
halted to new lighting it for Exeter

655
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,930
socio we had this morning access well

656
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:16,270
its have serial converter 280 and then

657
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:20,180
you get access to some things that
didn't even require login passwords

658
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:23,780
and now are connected directly to AP and
something knots

659
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:28,070
really well segmented maybe always and
the segmentation problem

660
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:31,400
goes sometime to very

661
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,270
incredible they mention bicycles this
one

662
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:40,540
we were able to connect through a single
you is be little more by date

663
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:44,220
mind and sand from the whoops

664
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:47,830
zeese IP address was of course

665
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:51,240
as a has been changed was pot

666
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:55,350
on RFC 1918 net words that were part of

667
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:58,760
an we're able to connect to its okay so

668
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:03,130
a class a network is still be changed to
scan even with those

669
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:06,530
the downscale 3G connection

670
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:09,970
but is totally doable and base their
solely call

671
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:13,750
what can we get 2905 on the CTP

672
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:17,340
that means ss7 in Sri you a connection

673
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:21,600
and with that where able to do
connection to this event on it work

674
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,210
from more by connection from C

675
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:29,140
operator itself you can check your
messages just with Sis

676
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:32,680
so as a consequence of it is that you
can do

677
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,700
West once you have these kind of access
there's no limit

678
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:39,030
on what you can do by injecting messages
okay and this is

679
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:42,250
you on technology but you can access
here through

680
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:45,670
as these new access with to just a
simple lack of filtering

681
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:50,220
that this problem now that only thing
that was really meeting our

682
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:54,360
attack is that this kind of network
required timing window

683
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,360
so that if you don't receive in that
mean it's like an

684
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,840
respond to that message sends the
messages Council

685
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:04,960
let since we had some time lousy
connection that pic was not going to

686
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,290
but here basically that was not the
secret mechanism

687
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:12,540
that was preventing you from doing that
with like invaded your efficiency

688
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:16,550
mckinney's non-interest and estimate the
ability to inject your own this is seven

689
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:19,530
messages because as we explained during
his speech

690
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:23,080
helpfully authenticated for the exits
controlled and

691
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:27,850
there are techniques whereby we can shut
down critical elements like an H&R

692
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:33,080
using a few 7 packets it means it would
shut down the entire network

693
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:36,300
and you would be able to maintain that
the data service condition

694
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:41,610
knife you able to ship down all the
networks of country you've got issues

695
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:45,030
serious problem its strategy it's very
sensitive

696
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:48,350
about and it can be talking to me a few
packets using your mobile phone

697
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:51,720
so this is a big question for society's
everybody's NES

698
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:55,720
how do you get access its varied very
hard here we so

699
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:59,190
the PT's is a simple use yes 3G modem

700
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:03,240
you could get access denied now since
you can get access to it

701
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:07,480
summit you can also get it easy by
packing other countries which are less

702
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,100
protected as your own country

703
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:12,370
and jumping to Zack on network and then
to some traffic

704
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:15,380
here one interesting kind of try things
that you can spoof

705
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:18,930
is a not message which is for 1x a
signaling

706
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:22,720
and the spot message is that I guess is
that the message that say

707
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,800
I'm saying use row packet treat it

708
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:30,730
as its chief I think if it was coming
from Zarate your side

709
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:33,970
so as a radio sides I think that you can
insect

710
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:38,120
any kind of signaling that comes from
was a radio equipment

711
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,240
a means that you can do radio attacks
without even being

712
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,359
into the country okay

713
00:41:44,359 --> 00:41:48,440
I am all the stuff which is really funny
that sometime

714
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:52,070
some equipment manufacturer expose I
Commons

715
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:56,450
and say yeah I was issue can do some run
some testing

716
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:59,720
okay on this one is unauthenticated

717
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,170
so your neck okay if it's just testing
what's the point

718
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:06,810
and what is it exactly it's an a Soo Do

719
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:10,670
message with you own pattern

720
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:15,010
onto was a why you and this case that's
on innocuous right

721
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:18,730
though what happens is actually you can
spoof any kind of message by

722
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:22,060
injecting rule arbitrarily choose in

723
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:25,420
bite sick ones that you sent so here its

724
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:29,030
the war against it was just most common
ocean me know

725
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:33,630
they don't think he's attackers
perspective though

726
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:36,640
even when the are confronted with some
stuff like

727
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,910
no cannot exist so in this case /url
2010

728
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:44,410
causes the Caribbean operators at not is
that is

729
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:48,420
outgoing traffic to the Internet is
greater

730
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:52,630
that incoming traffic from its on
subscriber

731
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:56,710
mmm fish and then discovered that
basically

732
00:42:56,710 --> 00:43:00,320
the normal customer traffic on the
customer was throwing

733
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:03,780
to wasn't but at the same time there was
a copy on the traffic

734
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:07,430
and picked it sent to a new Nike

735
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:10,530
so is this kind of thing means basically
defeated back doors

736
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:14,200
and the confirmed into the excitement so
we've got to see that

737
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:18,220
even this summer a very big compromise
into zones

738
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:21,400
as an effort compromise from the
equipment vendor

739
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:25,030
possibly or compromise from external
attackers

740
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:29,040
here that was really is a turning point
in 2009

741
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,990
there was a I'm as giddy and he knows it
was attacked and that tank

742
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:36,280
appease a child at the knees so
everything you need to create can't

743
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,030
clone

744
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:40,500
what's old on the Internet into
underground forums

745
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:43,920
though that means me now there's some
people actively

746
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,040
remotely attacking and exit well

747
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,340
this you could say okay a.m.

748
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:54,140
the stuff is quite critical so we really
need to

749
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:58,790
have some rubber stuff so the kind of
software we're talking about here

750
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:02,940
is Nokia Siemens network HR wasn't hard
at work

751
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:06,370
and the stuff is basically usually Sun
Microsystems

752
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:09,650
a front an was used at an egg backhands
and

753
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:14,130
each of them is like you like one-timer
going to that hasn't on sale

754
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:17,420
a look at what we were successfully
rooted the SAA it's like

755
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:20,880
these practices the service fee you can
see

756
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,109
City what like examined stupid is that
no

757
00:44:24,109 --> 00:44:28,140
its this track this wall rack and the
war aid on it

758
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:31,930
and zoo zoom zoo series of right behind

759
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:35,380
is a hot spare right these things are
huge

760
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:38,490
and yet they didn't even do some fast
this thing

761
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:42,090
on to the southwest back in order to see
if it was real business

762
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:46,140
to random just sound random

763
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:49,530
and this was crushing the mission okay

764
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:52,650
so they need to

765
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:56,330
believe that nasty things can be down

766
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:59,500
and we'll be down on the net for it it's
not if it's when

767
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:02,570
some people is going to for example sent
some GDP

768
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:05,950
creation of GDP total

769
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:09,640
so that's every time you going back to
back on that are

770
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,600
that the station with your with more by
York rings is GDP total but you're not

771
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,760
supposed to be doing it

772
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:18,490
yourself its equipment fracture so

773
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:21,620
what happens is that we from on one

774
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:25,370
operator that it was easy to create

775
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:29,500
like its them was secured a location
that was St possible

776
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:33,640
and you could connect as anyone to any
kind of conic

777
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:37,100
a of that for connected to the operator
and in there

778
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:40,310
there was one network which seen funny
which was

779
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:43,810
actually the geolocation and twin

780
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:47,490
network for police for these little
ballads

781
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:51,230
the department as a course that on GPS
committee was yours

782
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:54,320
and then we collect eggs into one of the
machines that was supposed to be

783
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,330
receiving a lot of

784
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:59,410
a lot of traffic and because it was a
Windows Server

785
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:03,130
that actually where collecting all the
location of was a suspect

786
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:07,570
with these little GPS tracker and does a
car and then from there

787
00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:12,250
hacked into it is here insecure Windows
machine and saw all the location

788
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:15,800
of all the different suspect that were
being tracked by this national produced

789
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,890
so here well like wall

790
00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:22,540
this is be than next thing we tested can
we do it is normal

791
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:26,710
full and actually we could actually what
was even funnier

792
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:30,240
is that when you too can seize illegal
GPS tracker

793
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,270
you could have I see the

794
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:36,960
technical settings eight yen and stuff
like that onto this

795
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:41,510
disease-causing so you take out this the
put it into you USB modem

796
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:45,410
and connect straight to the network has
been good he's a person being tracked so

797
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:48,970
as a suspect I could see always use a
suspect okay

798
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:52,050
went up direct implication

799
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:55,560
of basically work but indeed on a
suddenly

800
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,600
you need is kinda feel seeing to make
the management

801
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:01,670
John because as well as I get sticky I'd
care and

802
00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:05,920
one thing that was interesting is that
we could do many type of different

803
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,290
really bad stuff his GP

804
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:10,550
GDP technology purists tunnel but that
got them

805
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:14,200
really scared what you can spoof fake
charges

806
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:17,310
you can pretend that someone consume
some CDs

807
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:20,310
didn't and didn't care even about

808
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:23,500
your said is that you don't understand
that but recharging

809
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:28,220
my god this is important okay money the
only thing that will keep them moving

810
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,260
into telcos

811
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:32,490
only investigate when it was money
competitors that

812
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:35,859
a we have GS and Europe so this attack

813
00:47:35,859 --> 00:47:40,270
with this you can say okay I send you
here so this packet

814
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:43,700
basically this packet is very nice
packet it say's

815
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:46,800
I you should go down

816
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,020
because I think you're not going to
handle the traffic

817
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:53,460
well and the judges ago right than

818
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:57,510
I would go down ok should I'll and
that's one packet an authenticated

819
00:47:57,510 --> 00:48:01,570
you created your typical you can do that
so management was not

820
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:06,550
really interested by that then we we had
to go to the next level

821
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:11,170
SGSN a peer into the setback was
actually sending the same kind of

822
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:13,119
packets but to use it or

823
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:16,520
when the City two with Jason but then
what you do is not

824
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:19,859
your Sony someone network is the Euro
said he's gone

825
00:48:19,859 --> 00:48:23,260
one part of the country because with
this

826
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:26,470
you basically are sending a pic and
that's a isn't

827
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:30,570
SGSN which they are all west part of
Paris

828
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:34,210
is going down okay and they started to

829
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:37,720
understand that there was a problem
problem also

830
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:41,490
is a problem scope the SGSN GGSN

831
00:48:41,490 --> 00:48:44,850
apart of one very obscure network was
heard

832
00:48:44,850 --> 00:48:48,820
in this room about GRX one person

833
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:52,940
where to purchase those okay so GRX is
basically what

834
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:56,450
interconnect or GPRS networks

835
00:48:56,450 --> 00:48:59,570
this is what you charge so much when
your room that's why is this

836
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:02,910
even an option on your Android phone
saying don't connect to

837
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:05,980
that I move my data when I'm growing
okay and

838
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:09,609
these GRX network interconnect was it
cynical operator

839
00:49:09,609 --> 00:49:13,730
as applicable at a kennel well with this
packet that we have

840
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:17,280
since we've seen so many and featured
access

841
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,690
on to the telecom operator

842
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:23,990
incoming connection 20 X then

843
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:27,369
you could send this to worldwide amount
of

844
00:49:27,369 --> 00:49:30,730
is GSN and basically dos were up

845
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:34,000
right so we're not talking about some
theoretical

846
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,290
attack these things really go down and
their media and featured

847
00:49:37,290 --> 00:49:40,940
you can actually tested with not much
difficulty of course you

848
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:45,220
normally don't do that shown that with
right

849
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:48,380
so send you're like yeah but that was a
past

850
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:51,750
now we are going to and your long term
evolution

851
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:56,100
we're going to have much more I your
young team coming off a of networks

852
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:59,330
well what happens is that Lt

853
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:02,369
are actually very good technology's much
more

854
00:50:02,369 --> 00:50:05,520
eighty oriented with a a lot of lessons
learned

855
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:09,760
that's a problem is that we still are
into the walled garden approach

856
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:14,760
so just FYI a separate zone separating
the main

857
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:18,040
which he's steel a only allude to

858
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:22,330
network operators and of course well
this time where you can actually

859
00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:26,190
leach and I get access to action he's a

860
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:29,710
Evolved Packet core which is the you
icon at work

861
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:32,710
up to was your favorite by the way

862
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:37,180
zzzz network still have a Solaris 2.6
box with default password

863
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:41,540
and popper exposed okay

864
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:44,900
so what we see here is that

865
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:48,030
of course um those big

866
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:51,440
and COO security problem of

867
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,800
all these mindset of want the other

868
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,670
approach it should be secure because the
investment ascension

869
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:01,670
and blind trust him to surrender or

870
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:05,820
you overconfidence in 20 security like a
no difference in death

871
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:09,190
people won't be able to do GDP to my
creation

872
00:51:09,190 --> 00:51:13,700
I the problem also is that these
organizations are very massive

873
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:16,790
not really changing fast okay

874
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:19,900
text and yours to come up with

875
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:23,030
sings and they also confident that

876
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:26,230
their own solutions a solution with a
network vendor

877
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:30,130
is great the war peace and even to the
you guys to the

878
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:33,760
deal researcher with in the

879
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,910
for and of the Germany and

880
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:40,710
then the phone something anything on
something the don't do something

881
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:43,750
okay and some time after two years the
like oh yeah

882
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:47,020
maybe we should isn't it those at your
problem is that

883
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:51,170
if you're not open to innovation and two
is independent security research

884
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:55,050
there's a huge problem because you're
not going to get early-warning

885
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:58,910
about zzzz kinda of issue and you not
going to be able to turn around his

886
00:51:58,910 --> 00:51:59,560
bitchy

887
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:02,900
fast enough on one thing which is

888
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:06,990
quite important is that says

889
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:10,920
technology Sun which which is even going
worse because we are still keeping them

890
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:11,660
back

891
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:16,740
the want technologies and going to new
network technologies we talk just

892
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:17,870
accumulating

893
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:20,910
lay you all on layer of technology so
you're just

894
00:52:20,910 --> 00:52:23,920
increasing your attacks of its

895
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,100
now what we can do is we have

896
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:31,000
fight the huge gap in between what is
perceived that

897
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,859
being secretive the operator like the
operator there's a lot of

898
00:52:34,859 --> 00:52:39,570
fraud management a you ask to a person
the phone management

899
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:43,030
usually which is called fraud and review
assurance team

900
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:46,440
and as they say okay for you yes'm okay

901
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:50,060
explain to me what he's spoofing or what
is a buffalo

902
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:53,510
and again we've got like writing because
the job

903
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:57,710
is to look at graphs that are generated
from the financial data

904
00:52:57,710 --> 00:53:00,990
don't look and the rule signaling
Seattle I

905
00:53:00,990 --> 00:53:04,330
yes he's and uzis job of detecting
packets

906
00:53:04,330 --> 00:53:07,510
actually sees two years ago we didn't
exist

907
00:53:07,510 --> 00:53:11,080
there was no I yes by seven okay

908
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:14,990
this huge gap we have to fix it this
also a.m.

909
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:18,000
use gap into on the ways that

910
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,180
the investment is driven the investment
is driven by some marketing department

911
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:25,270
have some network equipment vendor at:
yet

912
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:28,550
intersection we get you secure hello

913
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:32,800
it's actually the opposite interception
is a getting an attack to confidentially

914
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:33,180
T

915
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:37,440
of some a of some communication even if
it's for the good guy

916
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,520
it's given that pack so this

917
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:44,670
even also a problem is that this you
over if he discovers a problems on

918
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:49,240
definitely not stupid people's and
secure to like just musing formed

919
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:52,880
exist security experts intercom security

920
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,810
are very often up too few

921
00:53:56,810 --> 00:54:00,970
and not know to talk about policing so
in security we don't have a really

922
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:04,030
intercom security we don't have really
conferences exist

923
00:54:04,030 --> 00:54:07,930
where just constant flow of information
with vendors

924
00:54:07,930 --> 00:54:11,490
just starting to get this and that's
what we are trying to

925
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:15,760
to push I'm the swing formation is also

926
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,820
related to lack of tool we are not

927
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:22,330
having enough tools because they are not
investing

928
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:25,600
into the sink that are not well
marketing marketed

929
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:29,390
as a marketing power of new Callaway is
going to be

930
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:33,080
anyway so huge that any legal stop that
comment say

931
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:36,230
okay we have the Securities Inc if
Weiwei in Nokia

932
00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:40,630
and Ericsson didn't talk about it it
doesn't exist rings a bell

933
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:45,280
the

934
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:49,580
so I'll we have some still some some
good improvement

935
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:53,150
one thing is that they'll some open so
that gets into these two main

936
00:54:53,150 --> 00:54:56,220
so we'll defeat the for example single
out

937
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:59,480
a small com group is 102 NC I'm you know

938
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:02,550
all these people are going awesome job
into opening

939
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:07,850
zzzz sees the me I and this is helping
in order to first get it and going to

940
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:08,750
change

941
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:12,540
but also get Road a top rupee a rule
traces

942
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:16,330
information about easy secure on up also

943
00:55:16,330 --> 00:55:19,970
the internet like ATF all just another

944
00:55:19,970 --> 00:55:23,270
they's Asian buddies of the internet
side I've quite

945
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:27,080
Wong just another position war and 3gpp
and

946
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:30,660
atur aligning to use his new

947
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:33,870
protocols so thats also positive step

948
00:55:33,870 --> 00:55:37,109
because we benefits then from was a
mindset of

949
00:55:37,109 --> 00:55:41,670
security aryan teed attacker or you want
it kind of protocol development

950
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:45,040
what's better because East we have some
people who are

951
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:48,860
you no about a the

952
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:52,610
the rules of the security problem I'll

953
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:55,820
buzz words also are helping when you
hear critical

954
00:55:55,820 --> 00:56:00,590
infrastructure problems and attacks as a
global scale of course and

955
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:04,650
as well as an bush's and to some extent
the operators are realizing that the

956
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:06,990
infrastructure is critical and should be
protected

957
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:10,480
it doesn't happen everywhere the same
time but we see some operators are

958
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,010
really making the right moves

959
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:15,350
because that actually Eagles and the
like I heard

960
00:56:15,350 --> 00:56:19,280
words and really hurt my here's so
actually ZZZ you helping

961
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:22,600
and then Indian with have a few

962
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:25,700
early adopters in the second world are
really getting for it

963
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:28,760
so is take operator wasn't meant as
these groups

964
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:32,650
okay we have a default password Weezer
remote routers and

965
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:36,450
a compromise on these kind of things and
some others

966
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:39,850
all super tough to early adopters are
the driving the market

967
00:56:39,850 --> 00:56:43,480
and I believe that these people are
going to survive in the better

968
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:47,480
on the computer so these are really
ended things with modern

969
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:50,690
to come as a weather in the security
intercom

970
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:54,100
and showing the way that's hope and push
that

971
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:57,490
this is the same case everywhere and

972
00:56:57,490 --> 00:57:00,590
I hope to maybe meet you too

973
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:06,940
to discuss that prisoners questions

974
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:12,430
exxon captain

975
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:15,560
can get a Mac yeah I think going

976
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:18,850
okay

977
00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:22,600
I'm we all know that Skype is not very
secure as far as personal communication

978
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:23,020
goes

979
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:29,210
arm so a we did you say you said we
called okay

980
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:33,040
that this guy is not very secure
especially since Microsoft bought it

981
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:33,630
yeah

982
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:37,020
that's for sure there goes the
neighborhood arm

983
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:40,500
so let's say I give myself an SSH

984
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:45,350
connection to a SOCKS proxy SSH tunnel

985
00:57:45,350 --> 00:57:48,810
and now my IP address is somewhere in
the USA

986
00:57:48,810 --> 00:57:53,700
and all my traffic goes to the SSH
protocol which is secure house

987
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:56,720
how safe is that and often wondered that

988
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:00,860
yes microUSB racing or your
communication gathering at forty an SSH

989
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:01,820
tunnel proxy

990
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:06,350
yes as you you're achieving your origin
if you have another code into your

991
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:10,320
will not only am i silly my origin but
I'm also and I also in creating my

992
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,460
data the well said only safe

993
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:16,480
what would you want to to protect
yourself from

994
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:20,230
you want to protect yourself from are
you going to section and yes that could

995
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:20,740
help

996
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:23,699
if you want to protect from like
intelligence

997
00:58:23,699 --> 00:58:26,619
collection hands and no because goal is
to

998
00:58:26,619 --> 00:58:30,699
to collect as many backbone date as you
and if you use a VPN provider to

999
00:58:30,699 --> 00:58:31,719
outgoing

1000
00:58:31,719 --> 00:58:35,059
disconnection do you trust your provider
as you make a wish

1001
00:58:35,059 --> 00:58:38,089
yourself all these across urban issues
yes of course

1002
00:58:38,089 --> 00:58:41,219
if I was in the same first thing that I
do is a

1003
00:58:41,219 --> 00:58:44,309
definitely create a company which is
providing free or cheap

1004
00:58:44,309 --> 00:58:49,880
VPN termination and but it's a very good
point in cryptography easy answers to

1005
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:50,619
many of the

1006
00:58:50,619 --> 00:58:54,670
privacy interception problems and works
with AP the same way

1007
00:58:54,670 --> 00:58:58,910
work static on the menu I was telling
you that SMS is an easy to be extracted

1008
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:02,709
and intercepted but if you don't want
your SMS to be read you can encrypt them

1009
00:59:02,709 --> 00:59:07,979
for example using pics secure an Android
I from looks good

1010
00:59:07,979 --> 00:59:12,499
this is a few applications like that
voice VoIP traffic can be included as

1011
00:59:12,499 --> 00:59:12,839
well

1012
00:59:12,839 --> 00:59:16,259
so yes crypto graffiti is always part of
the solution

1013
00:59:16,259 --> 00:59:20,749
it's not a hundred percent foolproof
solution because you have many things to

1014
00:59:20,749 --> 00:59:22,539
consider but it's definitely

1015
00:59:22,539 --> 00:59:26,249
like this a lot so to keep people honest
yes

1016
00:59:26,249 --> 00:59:31,589
so don't forget to watch a

1017
00:59:31,589 --> 00:59:36,289
Captain Crunch presentation John Draper
tomorrow is it was its afternoon right

1018
00:59:36,289 --> 00:59:40,469
this afternoon yet he's going to get if
you look more detail

1019
00:59:40,469 --> 00:59:45,440
you on the freaking and early to the
phone hacking and I'm shooting

1020
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:48,459
like the two innocent questionnaire yet

1021
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:52,430
hoops and this is it really so much the
questions he was

1022
00:59:52,430 --> 00:59:55,869
I was watching a talk and up I've
decided that I've I've written a

1023
00:59:55,869 --> 00:59:58,190
three-point evil marketing plan

1024
00:59:58,190 --> 01:00:01,459
for at telco security yeah I'll

1025
01:00:01,459 --> 01:00:04,519
this is it they showed us up well so

1026
01:00:04,519 --> 01:00:07,809
I what we do he sees me find the country
that

1027
01:00:07,809 --> 01:00:11,529
he sa nominally a US enemy we

1028
01:00:11,529 --> 01:00:15,469
deos the entire infrastructure of the
country all the Westin operators then

1029
01:00:15,469 --> 01:00:16,789
subsequently panic

1030
01:00:16,789 --> 01:00:20,509
and yet let the money for everybody okay
you'll be surprised that you'd be

1031
01:00:20,509 --> 01:00:22,489
surprised how close we are to the
situation

1032
01:00:22,489 --> 01:00:27,069
rate I just because you don't need to do
that because some people I actually

1033
01:00:27,069 --> 01:00:30,119
doing Addax and the thing is

1034
01:00:30,119 --> 01:00:34,150
in this industry people don't talk it's
not like it does not give the full

1035
01:00:34,150 --> 01:00:34,940
disclosure

1036
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:38,779
if any i'd this coming year you never
hear about these

1037
01:00:38,779 --> 01:00:45,779
first meet up yeah I think so

1038
01:00:46,209 --> 01:00:49,660
known as well the wrong because uneasy
know about that

1039
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:54,299
the No about GS GSM Association is
communicating these facts

1040
01:00:54,299 --> 01:00:58,150
to all the operator is all part of the
security group but this thing really is

1041
01:00:58,150 --> 01:00:58,900
I heard them

1042
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:03,130
is if it gets the press and they're
controlling the evens it doesn't go to

1043
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:03,640
the press

1044
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:07,380
nothing happened the preferred to get
$100 billion loss

1045
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:11,440
100 USD $100 million USD is the

1046
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:15,039
loss a and not having go to the public

1047
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:18,969
risers and cutting bait you a maybe
findings already naw

1048
01:01:18,969 --> 01:01:20,090
ongoing

1049
01:01:20,090 --> 01:01:23,700
me think this nation but he to the
public they want to stay to see that

1050
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:24,540
sexual

1051
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:28,370
yet but it is changing as we said they
are some of your favorite is a maturing

1052
01:01:28,370 --> 01:01:31,540
and some of the attacks are getting them
away candy

1053
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:34,960
yes yep

1054
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:38,330
the same it and that's what we changing
remembering

1055
01:01:38,330 --> 01:01:41,400
from a fraud kinda for programs

1056
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:44,430
which are still manageable hopes I got
ten million

1057
01:01:44,430 --> 01:01:48,140
of my money if you manageable falls in

1058
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:51,530
to meet problems when you have to renew
your on Tiger

1059
01:01:51,530 --> 01:01:55,210
seen call Park you know the will to

1060
01:01:55,210 --> 01:01:59,830
you that buckets it's like was a piano
in the beginning the most companies

1061
01:01:59,830 --> 01:02:02,050
didn't think they need it if I will than
once

1062
01:02:02,050 --> 01:02:06,490
been out of service attacks and global
hacker attacks but publicized in like 20

1063
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:08,640
years ago when it started then people

1064
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:12,830
the awareness rose for those products
and it's going to be the same tough

1065
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:18,040
shift okay CuZn

1066
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:22,940
a any last minute questions okay thank
you very much

1067
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:29,940
you guys thank you for your alright

1068
01:02:36,369 --> 01:02:38,160
this

1069
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:45,160
sleep
