1
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:11,320
for this

2
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,200
space

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,080
yes

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:22,080
sleuth

5
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,919
today I want to talk hear about

6
00:00:29,919 --> 00:00:33,620
new issues unpublished stuff and ipv6

7
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:39,150
um yep my name is Mark I've been around
for some thanks 17 18 19 years so I'm

8
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:39,769
one of the

9
00:00:39,769 --> 00:00:44,900
all all blogs um I believe

10
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:49,150
its hackers doing security research

11
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:54,760
writing towards publishing Warner
abilities

12
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:00,580
this critical for the security of
systems and also to protect privacy data

13
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:04,629
so it was always very important for me
to look at stuff

14
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:08,770
important for infrastructure is
important forty-two to be protected

15
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:12,650
so over the years again and again

16
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:15,830
this has been ipv6 for me it's more
stuff I do use

17
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:18,990
but some stuff i Kant talk about because
it's for customers

18
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,910
um but it seems that nobody else is
really doing ipv6

19
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:28,140
and that this kind this Sat because
that's what we will

20
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,010
all half in the next five years and if
there's really

21
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:35,570
nobody looking at that and looking for
vulnerabilities and

22
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:39,150
pushing and kicking the vendors to do
better because they're really not doing

23
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:39,850
well

24
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:43,100
that we will have a very bad state

25
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:47,590
so that why for me ipv6 is so important
also I'm doing it for that long time

26
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,190
already its

27
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,370
boring as well butts yeah

28
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:56,350
your a.m. with my third insulation a
completely new stuff for ipv6

29
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:00,050
um initially

30
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:03,479
I didn't want to do a third installment
but Dylan

31
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:07,000
really press is okay please come back in
the Barclays percent

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,040
I don't care what you do but piece to
talk about your stuff

33
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,780
yet I'm to

34
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,930
a minute a I wouldn't just a rehash old
stuff

35
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,090
so everything in this talk is completely
new

36
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:27,319
I think a lot of people are not looking
into ipv6 because they think

37
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:30,620
how everything and ipv6 was

38
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,290
already found it discovered and there's
just very little things and

39
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,620
there is not true not more you can do
for research

40
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,640
so in that 30 instill installment now

41
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,770
should show again the terrace

42
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:47,890
still lots of stuff to research and ipv6
and it is really necessary

43
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:51,959
so this talk it's really

44
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,810
popurri of things there's nothing like a
red threats

45
00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:00,060
um we'll be talking about for abilities

46
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,880
we'll be talking about problems of
installations which

47
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:08,620
are the air so back configuration stuff
and I will also show you about

48
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,680
penetration testing how to do

49
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,880
remote penetration testing and its if
there is still time

50
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,700
I will talk about the let's say not so
much security but

51
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:24,120
the issues with ipv6 why it is very
difficult to deploy at the moment

52
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:30,110
though first I want to show you
something about the current situation so

53
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:33,550
why should you all hot wife should we
care

54
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,690
um once upon a time that forced

55
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,270
long long long time ago ipv6 was designs

56
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:44,580
was a the first entered the first RC
unpublished

57
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,819
was 1995 thats

58
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:51,780
long long time ago so on

59
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,980
and read was seen okay the ipv4
addresses shortly deep leading in the

60
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,080
far future

61
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,660
that's when already right organizations

62
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:05,160
ATF and others and even governments

63
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,300
we're trying to push ipv6 slowly

64
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,550
and and stronger and stronger and
stronger um

65
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:14,890
and it was hoped that it would look like
doubt

66
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,319
course the ipv4 full-size would go

67
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:22,049
would become mp3 Lee people

68
00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:25,590
woods adopts and

69
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:29,620
start deploying ipv6 early so not to run
into any trouble

70
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:34,210
that was was everybody was thinking what
would happen in with every everybody

71
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:34,809
hoped

72
00:04:34,809 --> 00:04:37,839
but the reality now

73
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:42,559
today is this the ipv4 pool size

74
00:04:42,559 --> 00:04:46,589
is in a critical state but the ipv6
deployment

75
00:04:46,589 --> 00:04:49,969
is made a

76
00:04:49,969 --> 00:04:55,539
at so this is really big problem for
infrastructure now

77
00:04:55,539 --> 00:04:58,569
three weeks ago of for weeks ago already
I'm

78
00:04:58,569 --> 00:05:02,699
ripe that's the European regal
registration for

79
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:07,279
for everything ipv4 everything I could
be 16s and stuff

80
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:10,439
they announced that they only have one
class a network

81
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:14,120
left to hand out ipv4 addresses

82
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,520
and with that a special protocol kicks
in

83
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,789
nobody can get new ipv4 addresses

84
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:24,180
unless they prove that they have already

85
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,409
started to be ploy ipv6 so without
proving that you are

86
00:05:28,409 --> 00:05:31,539
deploying ipv6 at the moment you will
not

87
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:36,379
get more ipv4 addresses and actually
there

88
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:40,119
you could say one class a network that's
a lot

89
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:43,710
just one month before they were
expecting that the rest of the ipv4

90
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,169
addresses in Europe

91
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:49,589
well they hit this last level want extra
a month

92
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:53,740
and was just several weeks and it looks
similar in all the other

93
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,369
as if it's Asia it if its US the North
America

94
00:05:57,369 --> 00:06:02,169
Africa South America it's all the same
it's just Europe which was hit first

95
00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:05,300
but all those who follow very fast so in
other words

96
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:10,279
the end is very near so that's why you
really half

97
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:13,960
to scramble now and start deploying ipv6
because otherwise

98
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:18,360
there is no growth possible on the
Internet and will hit a limit

99
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,180
and this will be bad for business it
will be bad for everybody

100
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:27,259
everybody oppose as not one more but one
device one laptop but maybe

101
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:30,939
you now you have few or smart phone and
you have furor

102
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:35,270
tablets also yeah you need more more IP
addresses

103
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,619
so even get a comp in your growth if we
don't go ipv6

104
00:06:39,619 --> 00:06:42,930
so that could not it got

105
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:46,589
all could be very nice if it would not
be that the

106
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:51,119
security issues and ipv6 wouldn't be so

107
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:57,009
ship with that nicely wouldn't be so bad
so fucking bad

108
00:06:57,009 --> 00:07:00,740
if you look at the and registered

109
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,809
vulnerabilities for ipv6 over the years

110
00:07:04,809 --> 00:07:09,300
you'll see this is getting more and more

111
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,809
why is it getting more and more because
in the beginning there was

112
00:07:12,809 --> 00:07:17,990
not much implementation of ipv6 they
were not many people looking into a 360

113
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:21,809
there was not much to be found but as
more and more

114
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:26,849
systems get ipv6 implemented get more
features a 56 implemented

115
00:07:26,849 --> 00:07:31,279
what people look at it of course while
the bitty one abilities are found

116
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:34,309
a business not showing showing the full
pages just

117
00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:37,849
the core statement these numbers are
actually I think two weeks

118
00:07:37,849 --> 00:07:42,110
two weeks old now three weeks old now um

119
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:46,559
so how this works is now I have to slide
in every presentation I do about ipv6 so

120
00:07:46,559 --> 00:07:48,409
it's constantly updated

121
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:53,689
um there are we r in also already in
beginning of October

122
00:07:53,689 --> 00:07:57,729
we're just about hoff what will still be
published

123
00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:02,179
with that 2012 CV he entry because if
you find a vulnerability

124
00:08:02,179 --> 00:08:08,129
usually restore it to inform the vendor
be in not publishing your CV number

125
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:12,270
until there's a fix and if you work with
companies like Oracle

126
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:15,529
this can take some years so even

127
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:19,969
to date there a box which are not been
published for 2011 it's not just

128
00:08:19,969 --> 00:08:23,770
to as it looks like you're its in ready
to you way more

129
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:28,110
and if you say while this guy is pretty
optimistic pessimistic depending on how

130
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,159
you look at that

131
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:32,950
that this many vulnerabilities will come
well

132
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:37,890
this presentation own will show you six
new vulnerabilities in ipv6

133
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:41,589
will actually pick up how cities are
counted actually it will be rather like

134
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:43,339
89 10

135
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:47,290
because they do with per implementation
in operating systems

136
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:51,890
and also I think one or two weeks ago
I'd I saw that someone was

137
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:56,150
releasing vulnerability information he
found in DHCP version 6

138
00:08:56,150 --> 00:09:00,370
implementations so someone wrote a
father tested implementations and it was

139
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:01,910
breaking left and right

140
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,930
so that was another four see the entry
so

141
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:08,570
that all alone already gives you 12 more

142
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:12,560
so all we already here

143
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,500
so this is not through and it will be
way more

144
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,530
for for 2012 so

145
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:23,560
what are some vulnerabilities and first

146
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:28,210
I want up sorry I forgot that on you
might say okay we have ipv6 what about I

147
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:32,100
think before I B four is also vulnerable
and they're a box and stuff and that so

148
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,300
where's the difference the difference is
that out that the

149
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,010
also there's more ipv4 deployed an ipv4
also house

150
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:43,170
white coverage and people look at it I
before the numbers of vulnerabilities

151
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,310
found in ipv4

152
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:47,620
is just of the numbers also there's

153
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,900
less ipv6 in the system then

154
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,209
there is i three before so you see their
is

155
00:09:54,210 --> 00:10:00,380
a difference in maturity when it comes
to security and ipv6 implementations

156
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,780
so um some

157
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:07,980
vulnerabilities i categorize in a bid
the first are I call

158
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:12,370
flooding surprises so people not
expecting something

159
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:16,310
could come from that kind of direction

160
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:19,860
the first one is actually just a
reminder

161
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:24,240
years ago I was but I did the second
insulation on

162
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,820
stuff in ipv6 you should care about

163
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:31,430
I announced the vulnerability which will
cause router advertisement flooding

164
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:35,380
where of there's a feature an ipv6 and
%um you might notice I'm not doing

165
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,220
introduction to ipv6

166
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,490
so if you don't know ipv6 already I'm

167
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:44,130
look at my life first and second
installments all the talk civil fine

168
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,250
introduction stare

169
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:49,160
I don't have enough time because of too
much to cover here so I left that out

170
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,390
um autoconfiguration is feature which

171
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:56,780
is trying to replace DHCP it runs

172
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,810
on the network level to ICMP based

173
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:03,290
arm and this of a confirmation future
means yep

174
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:06,400
systems configured as celebrant take
himself I P

175
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,840
and ipv6 address automatically so if you

176
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,490
swamp the networks with router
advertisements which forced

177
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:16,790
the system's daughter configuration they
tried to calm himself

178
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:20,350
1 million ipv6 addresses of course
this.com

179
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:24,420
work and you're all systems crash so
that was two years ago

180
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:28,260
it affected all Windows systems amid
effected Cisco it's a

181
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:32,910
except on Juniper Netscreen FreeBSD
NetBSD old Linux

182
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:36,370
arm and most people fixed up except

183
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:40,350
Microsoft so you can crash

184
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:43,460
any win systems even the you when those
8

185
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:46,670
in Windows 2012 server you can crash

186
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:50,760
if you're on the local on so here at the
conference

187
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:55,070
ipv6 would be working here to try to
make it work but there is a buck in the

188
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:56,630
arm

189
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:00,400
in the ipv6 control that's why they have
to disable ipv6 again

190
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,830
so it to packet type is not coming
through um

191
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:07,630
if that would have if the book would not
have been I would have showed that to

192
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,470
you

193
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:12,190
and then all your system would be
unusable forcing you to complete a

194
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,350
reboot

195
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:18,020
and that's a book Microsoft is not
fixing for two years

196
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:21,690
over two years now

197
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:25,520
um

198
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:29,950
last year I did some or other
advertisers of course is so

199
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:34,680
it's a love you can do lots of stuff
without advertisement

200
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,830
and I found another denial of service
you can do not wire

201
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:43,230
arm of a conflagration but what can also
do in rotor it was fun to say okay

202
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:46,830
these are routes you should put into
your routing tables because I'm also

203
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:49,480
responsible for these network
destinations

204
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,710
um and you can put as many as you like
in a row threat with parchment

205
00:12:53,710 --> 00:13:00,710
packard and if you do that the systems
all have to update a routing tables

206
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:04,560
and that's what i do if you send out
memory consumption

207
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,860
100 percent CPU 100 percent and you
might be surprised

208
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,500
that's basically the same systems so

209
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,570
two years ago very similar box okay

210
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:18,900
I i understand is a problem i fix it

211
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:23,140
the same issue pretty much still there

212
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,020
which shows that they're not really
thinking about what could go wrong and

213
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:26,760
ipv6

214
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:33,640
is very similar to totally similar bach
is still there

215
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,810
so um the package is already online

216
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:40,200
sadly as I said I did square King an
all-conference network

217
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,340
otherwise you could stuff lotsa fun um

218
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:46,400
this is a toll the you see how easy it
is to use

219
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,620
if you're on that everything be is the
base every window system is

220
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:54,570
just gone on the Beastie systems

221
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:59,240
recover when you stop the attack windows
cracked is nothing to do

222
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,220
but and the Beastie systems recover they
seem to have recovered

223
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:07,210
whoever ipv6 is not working afterwards

224
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:10,890
you still have ipv6 addresses still have
ipv6 routing answers but if you try to

225
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:11,960
do anything I V six

226
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:17,490
it just doesn't work so weird back which
that forgives

227
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:22,170
another flooding issue is what I call
neighbor solicitation flooding

228
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:25,220
it was on this station in ipv6 is

229
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:28,480
replacing are its resolution protocol
what we have

230
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,880
IP four because it was deemed are up

231
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:35,060
is ugly

232
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:38,790
we're trying to solve night before
problem with that axe report to call it

233
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,080
is not I P

234
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,470
but are that's why I P six

235
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:47,170
address resolution so mecca dressed
right to be six address relation

236
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:51,200
is done by ICMP arm and the

237
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,340
mechanism for this his neighbor
solicitation so when you need

238
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:59,150
the mac address one ipv6 address you
sent a packet on the network

239
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:02,960
saying hey I need this I P I want to
connect it is I P views expressed

240
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,690
what's the Mac who has the mac address
what up and the system

241
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:10,930
or anybody could answer but usually on
the nice network with nice people

242
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:14,490
only the the real system or has ipv6
address will answer

243
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:18,870
with the neighbor advertisement and
saying hey yet it's me and this is the

244
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,360
mac address we should use

245
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,470
this is how it works um

246
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:27,600
whoever another as I said flooding
surprises surprises coming from

247
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,710
direction haven't

248
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:32,790
thought about um if you're start
flooding the destination with neighbors

249
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,540
or solicitation

250
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,630
packets what happens is that the corner
is

251
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:40,200
busy because this is done all in kernel

252
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,400
data system is so busy sending a bit
more time and you can't do

253
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,520
anything else with the system um

254
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,920
yeah I thought okay when I thought about
okayed it could be an issue let stride

255
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,380
again I was surprised who is affected
its windows

256
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:59,490
it is a lower risk its I was exit
FreeBSD NetBSD

257
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:02,760
lots of system such I mean come on

258
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:08,670
is dis elite hacker work this massive
super-secret complicated

259
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:12,660
vulnerability like for example my prick
the previous speakers here shortly with

260
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,900
I O S six how to exploit that

261
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:18,350
come on this is baby were compared to
that yeah so

262
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:23,860
it's a shame that this stuff works but
that's a state of security and ipv6

263
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,600
we're still in a medieval H ipv6

264
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,850
also it should be a very more than your
protocol

265
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:34,210
which were you know will need to depend
on the next 20 years

266
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:37,890
a bill that ipv6 pace runs out and we
need baby I the eight or something like

267
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:38,680
that

268
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,540
which will have to same problems I'm
sure um

269
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:46,000
so another thing fragmentation surprises

270
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,160
um of course i think is six also its
fragmentation of packets Assaf night

271
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:50,920
before

272
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:55,320
there's a different thought in ipv4
routers fragment packets

273
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,800
this is not allowed an ipv6 96 for
various design reasons and philosophies

274
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,100
but

275
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:05,569
stuff only the system's themself may
fragment packets

276
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:10,100
um there's a lot of stuff that can go
wrong from that direction so

277
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:14,459
stuff which is surprising for people
implementing ipv6

278
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:18,279
arm this is one of the two sites where
you actually see something from ipv6

279
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:19,619
protocol

280
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:23,439
so this is done by extension header so
when I V for you have

281
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,850
options to the ipv4 header and ipv6 you
have a fixed ipv6 header which just

282
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:30,350
contains what is really essential in the
packard

283
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:33,610
and everything else was kind of show or
nice to have a feature

284
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:36,909
these are extension headers which were
in between until you get to the

285
00:17:36,909 --> 00:17:39,619
transport layer which ST's PUD the ICMP

286
00:17:39,619 --> 00:17:44,350
so 10 viewed extension had justices
so-called fragmentation header

287
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:47,669
well as it is a chain

288
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:52,379
it specifies what the next header would
be which could be TCP you to be ICMP

289
00:17:52,379 --> 00:17:56,649
um always has a length of eight bytes

290
00:17:56,649 --> 00:18:00,009
it has a fragmentation of said despues
defies where

291
00:18:00,009 --> 00:18:03,309
this fragment should be when the Packers
assembled

292
00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:06,669
where the data should be placed for the
first fragment

293
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:12,320
of course always is fragment
fragmentation offset :0

294
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,600
and then there's a researcher for it and
it is getting more fragmented

295
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,320
if the more fragmented to set it means
more fragment

296
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,460
fragmented packets which belonged to a
diss fragment chain

297
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,580
are coming one suspect has not said he
knows okay

298
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:32,049
the destinations this is okay now I can
reassemble the full pockets

299
00:18:32,049 --> 00:18:35,049
and work with it and so you can fuck

300
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:39,749
and because and I can forget the IP ID
field which is not an ipv6 anymore

301
00:18:39,749 --> 00:18:44,169
on Toofan to know which fragment chains
belong together

302
00:18:44,169 --> 00:18:47,350
you have a fragmentation ID so at

303
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:50,850
fragment from afford if for different
larger pocket has a different

304
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:51,879
fragmentation I D

305
00:18:51,879 --> 00:18:55,070
and so this is as though what belongs
together and

306
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:58,669
how to build together so stuff that can

307
00:18:58,669 --> 00:19:01,950
go wrong in

308
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:06,279
so you create a large packet and you
start sending

309
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:09,480
standing at in fragments so the first

310
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,029
will start at offset :0 you set the more
fragments bit

311
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:16,909
and for example you sent one kilobyte of
the packet

312
00:19:16,909 --> 00:19:19,999
united with the next to the fragment of
that is 1000

313
00:19:19,999 --> 00:19:23,269
1,024 because it's and want to buy the
stator

314
00:19:23,269 --> 00:19:27,169
you said the more fragmented and so on
until you get at sixty four thousand

315
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:29,460
bites 512

316
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:36,220
um again setting the more fragmented and
you said 1000 16 bytes of data

317
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:39,499
why that because that sets the
fermentation

318
00:19:39,499 --> 00:19:44,090
of the to the maximum value possible

319
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:47,450
and in the last fragment you say you

320
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:51,610
you set the more fragments but to see a
row and put the max

321
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:56,240
and put the maximum bytes of data in
there

322
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,480
what happens that this packets now

323
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,350
packages now reassembled to a very very
very large package with

324
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:06,840
illegal because it's larger than 64
kilobytes

325
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:11,169
so together with the forty bite i think
is 600 this

326
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:14,769
packet is now reassembled 67

327
00:20:14,769 --> 00:20:17,809
thousand its march

328
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:21,129
and if you didn't think about that

329
00:20:21,129 --> 00:20:27,610
yeah bad things could happen

330
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:31,049
all the box actually going you here now
um

331
00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:35,480
I didn't look for them they just happen
to me

332
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,070
3 lots of stuff we use them just
interesting hey I have to study is like

333
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:39,940
ordered

334
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:43,529
um and here was playing the let's do

335
00:20:43,529 --> 00:20:46,409
let's check if I can do just kinda
fragment effect this how the system

336
00:20:46,409 --> 00:20:47,409
reacted

337
00:20:47,409 --> 00:20:51,679
just drop the packets whatsoever and my
sis was constantly blue screening

338
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,429
I was safe what the fuck actually didn't
care care a lot so

339
00:20:55,429 --> 00:20:58,499
after a year of concept my system looks
great said out

340
00:20:58,499 --> 00:21:02,149
okay lazy bastard get down look what the
problem is

341
00:21:02,149 --> 00:21:05,639
and after release some lucky debugging
testing stuff I found a oh it's a

342
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:06,480
personal firewall

343
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,440
I was running on my machine yes severe
personal firewall

344
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,470
if the pocket posses the final so it's
not block dis

345
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:18,269
is what happens nice blue screen it was
just

346
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:22,330
fixed last week so be up here a personal
firewall which is available for download

347
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:23,669
offer operate

348
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:27,070
2013 has fixed this back now

349
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:31,350
um if you'd not updated 02/02/2013
various thing was 2012 which will be the

350
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,149
case for

351
00:21:32,149 --> 00:21:35,499
well businesses will who have a Europe
fireball

352
00:21:35,499 --> 00:21:40,480
arm deployed day we'll have to wait for
another few months until the fix is

353
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,279
there for them

354
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:46,929
because they had to change in lots of
the stuff internal

355
00:21:46,929 --> 00:21:51,629
so it was not easy for them actually to
fix that

356
00:21:51,629 --> 00:21:55,049
yep more stuff what fragmentation
surprises

357
00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:58,210
dis is as 60 sidewall firewall

358
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:01,619
again I was not looking for that Bach
now

359
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:05,009
I'm and is pretty we reach arm

360
00:22:05,009 --> 00:22:08,789
let's say you have a sorrow so I will
firewall and you allow it from

361
00:22:08,789 --> 00:22:13,070
the external site to access the SSH port
of a system

362
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:17,249
now this time this isn't evil accurate
excess ink that system

363
00:22:17,249 --> 00:22:21,759
before somehow is trying possible lookin
password guessing or house

364
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:26,330
a valid login password pair so the
administrator gets panic it's a okay I

365
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:29,649
lock 30 itself through so

366
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:34,419
the admin changes the rules in this I
won't say no no I blocked this

367
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:38,049
i block everything to dismiss sheen
everything

368
00:22:38,049 --> 00:22:42,519
pasa nothing can happen anymore and
through

369
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:45,960
if the attacker what wants to continue
to connect to the machine

370
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:51,239
this is blocked by the firewall rules
unless

371
00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:55,090
you put a fragmentation header before
that

372
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:59,169
its exactly the same you're trying to
established a new connection

373
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:02,980
but this I will that that packet past
because to say

374
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:06,749
yeah originally in history have his rule

375
00:23:06,749 --> 00:23:10,850
so that might still be established
connections and that's why I have to

376
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:14,559
let this POS but does not establish
connection it's a new connections the

377
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:14,999
sink

378
00:23:14,999 --> 00:23:18,110
it's a sin packet so it's not an
established national because

379
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:21,110
everything which is fragmented must for

380
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:27,369
for their logic be and establish
connection let it pass the firewall

381
00:23:27,369 --> 00:23:30,999
and okay I mean things can happen

382
00:23:30,999 --> 00:23:34,210
I mean surprise surprise okay pox happen

383
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:37,929
I can totally understand that whoever

384
00:23:37,929 --> 00:23:41,860
they don't consider it is a Bach so you
change the firewall rule

385
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:45,619
to block something it's working

386
00:23:45,619 --> 00:23:49,690
unless you do a little trick but it's
not a security issue

387
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:53,860
so you're not fixing that

388
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:57,940
the third thing i'm for fragmentation
surprise to really show you how simple

389
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,399
something again

390
00:23:59,399 --> 00:24:04,309
up this this is an um of power a
firewall

391
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:08,769
and in my test it was just a is a by
Standard it was just hits

392
00:24:08,769 --> 00:24:12,190
so what I did was very very simple um I
was

393
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:16,549
actually testing some yeah customer
equipment

394
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:21,080
specific stuff I'm and that was just on
the pop

395
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:25,070
um so I I this real destination I if

396
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:29,379
I flooded with fragmentation fragment
fragment that packard

397
00:24:29,379 --> 00:24:33,029
so a fragment ID read my the chain
eighty

398
00:24:33,029 --> 00:24:37,929
I sent an offset its ear of the descent
20,000 offset at 60,000

399
00:24:37,929 --> 00:24:41,109
and wall

400
00:24:41,109 --> 00:24:45,190
if in implementation is bad the already
tried to

401
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:49,190
I locate the whole memory require

402
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:53,779
to reassemble the pocket even if there's
a large gap in between

403
00:24:53,779 --> 00:24:57,249
so by just sending a few of these

404
00:24:57,249 --> 00:25:00,369
of these packets all the memory of that
firewall

405
00:25:00,369 --> 00:25:05,090
is consumed and its just dat

406
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:09,580
again come home this is such is simple
attack

407
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:13,529
I just goes it might affect all the
other fire was on the mark I just know

408
00:25:13,529 --> 00:25:14,249
as i sat

409
00:25:14,249 --> 00:25:17,830
I'm not really looking for its tough
date just

410
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:23,700
when I look at stuff Plaza said innocent
bystander

411
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,559
so and it's just gone um

412
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:32,700
the people from mostar already told me
yet that was actually snort

413
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,159
which pulled the system down and let it
crash

414
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,210
um I talk to those people at snorting
controlled okay just as much as cases

415
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:41,059
the tools Kenny

416
00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:44,470
these tests at the new version is it's
working and they said not

417
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:48,109
they don't see the problem so they tried
it but they're not affect either it's

418
00:25:48,109 --> 00:25:48,809
some special

419
00:25:48,809 --> 00:25:53,669
think they have get an old version de
estar file or it was not snorters rather

420
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:56,989
putting the blame some whales I don't
know I care um

421
00:25:56,989 --> 00:26:00,440
yeah but it was happens um

422
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,460
than router or at sick

423
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:07,489
what is rotor Lord um rotor tort is

424
00:26:07,489 --> 00:26:10,989
and option in the hop by hop extension
header what is it haha

425
00:26:10,989 --> 00:26:15,220
extension header its an extension header

426
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:19,700
which stays if this is present every
router on the pop

427
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:23,850
must X must have a look at this header
and looks if there's important

428
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:25,419
information

429
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:29,009
for him for that router so every order
of the pop

430
00:26:29,009 --> 00:26:34,070
has to look at the extension header if
there's a hop on hop extension header

431
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:38,820
um there are various options you can
happen this extension header pipe

432
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:41,889
one is the so-called router a word of
caution

433
00:26:41,889 --> 00:26:45,100
iraq to Lord options specie fis

434
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:49,690
payroll true I half information on the
upper layer protocol

435
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:54,679
ICMP you TP TCP which is important
information for you

436
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:59,739
so you have to look at the contents of
the transport layer

437
00:26:59,739 --> 00:27:03,409
I'm and here's the ValueType and just to
specify

438
00:27:03,409 --> 00:27:08,399
what kind of transport it actually is 0
is for example more to class because the

439
00:27:08,399 --> 00:27:09,869
statics discovery

440
00:27:09,869 --> 00:27:14,070
get more for our rendezvous points and
stuff like that so

441
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:18,090
just it's false report um

442
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:22,850
yeah I was surprised when the following
happens:

443
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:27,789
um but let's go directly to what's the
issue here

444
00:27:27,789 --> 00:27:31,379
if you're paying a router and add router
has

445
00:27:31,379 --> 00:27:34,629
ACL which forbids receiving

446
00:27:34,629 --> 00:27:37,629
ICMP from anybody how

447
00:27:37,629 --> 00:27:41,210
then yeah nothing would happen the
packet filter Don

448
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:44,799
up the router is protected by the ACL

449
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:51,080
whoever if you sent let's say a pink but
any ICMP packet works

450
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:55,019
for destination behind a router and set
the extension header

451
00:27:55,019 --> 00:28:00,200
hop by hop with the router or adoption
surprise surprise

452
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,960
it reacts fully to that pocket so if you
sent a ping

453
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:08,049
two completely different system that
router will send the reply

454
00:28:08,049 --> 00:28:11,320
and it works for or ICMP types

455
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:15,059
so you can bypass ICMP ACLs

456
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:18,350
for Cisco router not all IRS versions
are

457
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:21,830
effected but and that was why dis was
important for me

458
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:25,269
to get fixed my eyes P was the fact it

459
00:28:25,269 --> 00:28:29,229
and I want to have his back fixed you
might say

460
00:28:29,229 --> 00:28:33,029
come on why do you want to have this
book fixed

461
00:28:33,029 --> 00:28:36,899
because of some other magic I found off
before this book was introduced in the

462
00:28:36,899 --> 00:28:38,049
US

463
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:42,999
and this is I thought there could be in
nice to not have service possible I mean

464
00:28:42,999 --> 00:28:46,840
if you send your daughter good packet in
specie fight hey look at the Transfer

465
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,809
Protocol

466
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:51,559
what happens that the router must score
from ASIC

467
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:55,529
so from hopper processing of the pockets
to CPU processing

468
00:28:55,529 --> 00:28:58,539
of the packet because now it must copy

469
00:28:58,539 --> 00:29:02,580
the packet to the memory the CPU must
have a look at the Packard

470
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:06,590
work with the pocket yeah and that slows
the machine down

471
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:11,450
so I was thinking if I do go through put
a lot router alerts

472
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:15,559
in pockets it will slow down the CPU of
the rotors on the powerful the park this

473
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:18,899
will be slow all packets through the
rotors will be slower

474
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:22,889
um yeah nice denial of service maybe

475
00:29:22,889 --> 00:29:27,190
to my surprise completely opposite
happens

476
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:31,749
my packets where becoming unbelievable
fast

477
00:29:31,749 --> 00:29:35,299
unbelievable fast for example in my
tests

478
00:29:35,299 --> 00:29:38,769
because I couldn't believe that stuff
what was what I was seeing

479
00:29:38,769 --> 00:29:42,859
I send the packet will far away ipv6
over in Japan

480
00:29:42,859 --> 00:29:46,850
so the the round trip time was

481
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:51,289
one-dot 8 seconds pretty pretty simple

482
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:55,259
responsiveness over the or or the whole
internet to get a jump on a trip back to

483
00:29:55,259 --> 00:29:56,840
Germany

484
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:01,979
with the router adoption drop down to
two hundred milliseconds

485
00:30:01,979 --> 00:30:05,409
if you're into first-person shooters and
stuff

486
00:30:05,409 --> 00:30:09,899
speeding latency it's really really good

487
00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:13,519
ants Derek for food something for the
ice pick eyes peas in Germany

488
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:17,299
de let you pay that tax rate if you want
to latency on your on you and your cell

489
00:30:17,299 --> 00:30:19,149
connection

490
00:30:19,149 --> 00:30:22,789
and in the beginning I was thinking oh
this must be bach what I see as a result

491
00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:23,639
here

492
00:30:23,639 --> 00:30:27,509
that Scott be true added de must be some
back in some system and that's on

493
00:30:27,509 --> 00:30:28,159
soaring

494
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,309
so with Felipe my good friend from I'm
from France

495
00:30:32,309 --> 00:30:36,239
he he has a server which side B 26 never
in France so I was

496
00:30:36,239 --> 00:30:39,859
doing this to his server he sniffed with
TCP down

497
00:30:39,859 --> 00:30:42,889
seeing that reading the packet arrived
at this machine it is

498
00:30:42,889 --> 00:30:47,629
machine sent the reply back to me I only
received one reply

499
00:30:47,629 --> 00:30:51,940
really is a case it can really get to
peak peak speed increase

500
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:55,080
if you set it all true art extension
header

501
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,090
in packets I don't know why

502
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:02,460
for me doesn't make sense the only
explanation I have for that is

503
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,529
that if there's a road to lurch it gets
a meanie

504
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:08,909
picked up put into CPU seen

505
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:11,909
is nothing I really have to care about
put back

506
00:31:11,909 --> 00:31:15,720
too hard for but jumping the packet
queue in between

507
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,389
and that's why it gets so fast that's my
fear I don't know

508
00:31:19,389 --> 00:31:22,470
if that is true but that's why I want to
get

509
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:27,590
this mobility fix because my eyes be
upgraded his router to this

510
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:30,590
I US which was the fact it's ok now just
doesn't work for me anymore

511
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:33,859
that's why I want to have to fix

512
00:31:33,859 --> 00:31:39,460
um other topic said pop free of
different things that was will abilities

513
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:42,960
we have endorsed fuck up but it's not
just the vendors fucking up when it

514
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,190
comes to ipv6 security

515
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:50,149
people seem to think for whatever
reasons that on ipv6

516
00:31:50,149 --> 00:31:53,919
nothing bad can happen um

517
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:58,289
I did lots of ipv6 cunning and if you've
done I before scanning on the Internet

518
00:31:58,289 --> 00:31:59,570
you know you get into

519
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:03,849
lots of trouble very fast so get lots of
the mental abuse teams rice PHD

520
00:32:03,849 --> 00:32:06,970
I've used team is kicking USAA what you
doing what you're doing what you're

521
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:07,720
doing

522
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:12,359
on ipv6 nobody seems to care so I did
lot of ipv6 getting

523
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:17,679
over time I scanned over five I found
over 500,000 life systems on ipv6

524
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,679
so I have good statistic data but here
did something special

525
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,960
it was just um a few months ago so for
this presentation I'd its

526
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:30,080
axe for statistical research new
research on

527
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,529
I selected the 2500

528
00:32:33,529 --> 00:32:39,129
largest companies domains which half
ipv6

529
00:32:39,129 --> 00:32:42,940
um and what I did for these domains I'd
checked the names

530
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:46,999
the name server records 2 mail exchange
to male records

531
00:32:46,999 --> 00:32:50,029
hiked its domain name at put

532
00:32:50,029 --> 00:32:53,070
thing for example for wept aaww

533
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:57,519
FTP SMTP various service names and every
time

534
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,809
and IP four and ipv6 address was
returned

535
00:33:01,809 --> 00:33:06,019
for an entry I put these into a list

536
00:33:06,019 --> 00:33:09,359
after I dot dot ice against these
addresses

537
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:12,549
again nobody complained about that it's
very nice I'm

538
00:33:12,549 --> 00:33:16,369
and I want to know how is there a
difference and protection on these of

539
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,309
these servers

540
00:33:17,309 --> 00:33:23,190
on on the ipv6 Internet and what is the
price or no surprise to pending

541
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:27,229
how much you know about ipv6 there is a
big difference

542
00:33:27,229 --> 00:33:32,590
so I look for everything which is remote
administration of server so be in CRT

543
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:36,429
pssh telnet ftp

544
00:33:36,429 --> 00:33:40,970
and year for example for SSH 5 percent
of all the service for

545
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:45,009
on ipv6 are reachable 40 for SSH

546
00:33:45,009 --> 00:33:49,119
but only three percent on ipv4 in all
the other numbers also Dr

547
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:53,409
slow wheel or ipv6 and the other areas

548
00:33:53,409 --> 00:33:56,710
as something like 10 to 15 to 20 times

549
00:33:56,710 --> 00:34:01,049
more open admissible services to you

550
00:34:01,049 --> 00:34:04,759
down on ipv4 so people not thinking
about

551
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:07,789
that something bad can happen people
seem to think

552
00:34:07,789 --> 00:34:11,450
hackers don't like the v6

553
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:14,530
then I'd its what I did next was now it
helps

554
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:17,730
ipv6 enabled servers all over the world

555
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:22,190
I didn't trace route to all of them and
collected the IPA formation of

556
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:25,440
all the routers on the pop so the

557
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,250
all the ISP's all over the world and I
did the same thing

558
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:32,800
connected to SS Asian tell Nancy

559
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,409
are different other I spews protecting
their older equipment and surprise

560
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:37,090
surprise

561
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:40,490
noope even tell that

562
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:44,520
come on pounded on ipv6 router

563
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:48,159
how that was something like seven eight
percent of all the routers

564
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:53,610
on the ipv6 networks are connectable on
the teleport come on its 2012 that

565
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:55,050
should not happen

566
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:58,510
I'm SSH of course way more but

567
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:02,590
look at the different 6 percent
reachable on typing for on SSH

568
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:06,340
seventeen-percent on ipv6

569
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:09,490
people think ipv6 is still

570
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:13,240
a nice place maybe it is

571
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:17,000
but you wanna go for that risk so people
think

572
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,230
ipv6 it's not really a problem if it's
the bend or

573
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:24,610
if it's people having to actually
implemented for structures

574
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:28,690
everybody seems to think I view 6
security all

575
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:32,450
what could happen what could possibly go
wrong

576
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:37,760
yeah so another different topic

577
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,530
how do you remove pan test ipv6

578
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:45,530
um and IP four dis topic is covered in
cum covered

579
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:49,690
um in my loft insulation of the talk to
them the second run

580
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:53,980
I showed how you could find because of
the large address space you have an

581
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,420
obvious how you could find

582
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:58,780
systems if they have a common address
configured

583
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:02,680
arm if you want to know nor bro 29 more
about it just go on YouTube you'll find

584
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,780
the talk there

585
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:07,600
which gives you all that information
what is

586
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,830
what's happened guys im course you'd is
just one side with the commander how to

587
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:12,120
do that

588
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:16,290
um but so far there's no documentation
on how'd you would do

589
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:20,490
remote and testing of an ipv6 network
the big problem was

590
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:23,970
scanning ipv6 networks is that you have

591
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:28,020
defaults up that Moscow slashed 64

592
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:32,660
which means if the network I think the
ipv6 address thanks is 128 bits

593
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,830
that every so often that every so often
that in the world

594
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:39,440
every small stuff that you can hear is
for

595
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,750
billion times the whole internet

596
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:45,760
four billion times the whole internet is
the size of

597
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,420
every supplement and ipv6 there is no
way you can do in a pinch getting on

598
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,670
this address space course

599
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:56,300
even your grandchildren will not be life
anymore with to scan for

600
00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:00,320
this up finished ap not possible

601
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,750
so this is a big issue if from ask me

602
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:08,220
your consultant and you perform more
penetration testing for customers

603
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:12,160
so that's why this is so I kinda for me
an important topic to teach

604
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:17,490
other people it is feasible also not s
easy as an IP four

605
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:20,690
so how do we do pant remote pen testing
of ipv6

606
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:24,230
so how do we find the target because
that's the essential part

607
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:28,100
once your phone all the live system on
the real on the remote I V six metre

608
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:31,810
everything stays the same like and I
before then you do and the port scanning

609
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:35,690
then you enumerate the services then you
try to fight for miss conflagrations

610
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:39,740
weak passwords and so on and so on but
you must first get here

611
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:44,320
you first must find the systems that are
a life on the remote network

612
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,500
so how do we do that if the networks
that

613
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,760
supplements are so large that you can
scan them because there's nothing like a

614
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,780
broadcast address you can just ping when
you pick up some systems

615
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:57,450
there's that's not possible in ipv6 so

616
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:01,030
thank you right the course I wanted to
do this really

617
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:04,200
hands-on real-world and

618
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,240
dispose the organ is organization I
found where

619
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:11,160
every kind of what you can do to do this

620
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,800
works on so ever I will show you

621
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,180
now if you want to try this again it
works at the ripe

622
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:22,070
some stuff doesn't work on some
company's other threats and others

623
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:25,350
doesn't work there but your everything
works so

624
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:28,830
it's an ideal candidate to show this is
what could possibly go wrong

625
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:32,270
it might not be happy with me showing
that but its own legal the country

626
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:32,950
anything about it

627
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:36,010
except securing their systems

628
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:39,920
so think you're right um

629
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:44,540
if you look into for example ripe what
is in the registered address space for a

630
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,750
target

631
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:49,400
the address space the half is usually
very large and I use

632
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:53,130
ends they might have many address space
actually just said

633
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:57,440
but not everything that is registered as
ipv6 address space for target is

634
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,450
actually used

635
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:04,950
so if the targets locks enough to have
an autonomous systems all

636
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:08,890
having to ice-t_ connections running BGP
what you can do

637
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:12,220
it's just look for the autonomous
systems which are registered

638
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:16,620
to your target this is how you can do
that for example for IP can win it for

639
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,670
any other registry authority and

640
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:23,070
North America Asia whatsoever um

641
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:26,390
get the list of autonomous systems
they're running

642
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:29,710
and then they are not lot of services
which

643
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:33,020
wake which can use from one is I'm from
Oregon Electric

644
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:36,050
for example I'm you can just come

645
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:39,520
what ipv6 address spaces are actually

646
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,400
announcing so this is the address space
right

647
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,820
is announcing and that this was this
reaching dear sis

648
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:50,160
so their networks everything else to
have to register

649
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:54,540
it will not reach them because it down
it's not announce on on BCP

650
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:59,050
so this is the best way to find out
which is the actually use ipv6

651
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:03,680
address space of the target company

652
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:08,400
so we see here 1as the first yes has 1
address based at 48

653
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,610
you have another footnote on different
as: and the third on

654
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:18,420
has snow ipv6 prefix not of course I
before prefixes but not known

655
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:23,740
no ipv6 prefix the fourth have lots of
ipv6 prefixes

656
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:27,780
and if you'll see the all-star 48 so
it's something like

657
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:32,690
20 it's less 48 networks this is an
address based at is

658
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:36,470
very very very large so

659
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:40,290
we come up with such many large networks

660
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:44,070
again very hard to cope with that
because the address space is very very

661
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:44,630
large

662
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:48,040
and you will not have millions of alive
systems just some

663
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:52,070
and findings in such a large address
space so their ways

664
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:55,440
we can handled out um the first is

665
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,780
we must find out which networks are
actually use from these large

666
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:03,690
possible network address space um

667
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:07,710
in my research you can see that also
from my second installment

668
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:12,090
um their ipv4 ipv6 addresses which are
more commonly used

669
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:15,090
and others so in

670
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:18,550
sixty-three percent of all networks

671
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:22,360
I reviewed and businesses status is
based on 8,000

672
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:26,130
200 networks I'm the call on call on one
ipv6

673
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:29,940
host address is configured

674
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:33,670
and you can ping it so you can reach it

675
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:38,270
this is usually the first so the main
router in that network

676
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:42,430
then 6 is 7 as 7 seventy-six percent

677
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:46,250
half Oracle on one or call on call onto

678
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:49,600
accessible so paying TZ Peterson San

679
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,010
TCP packet a port 22 for example stuff
like that

680
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:56,280
and 79% of the net for a sick and he
talked

681
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:02,620
if you scan Siro one or two it's the
whole part of the network address

682
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:06,690
so what we can do now we just scan

683
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:12,050
the host hearts 022 which are used over
seventy percent

684
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:16,270
read so in over seventy percent of the
net was there are reachable

685
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:20,280
and scanned the slash 48 net for a
prefix

686
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,670
every metric prefixes find

687
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:27,390
so in just 30 seconds we can do this for
every stage 48

688
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:31,760
prefix which is pretty fast gives us
over seventy percent

689
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,100
statistical average um use

690
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:38,160
networks and the switch came up for
example for

691
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:42,890
this prefix here and then we know okay

692
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:47,110
this network issues this network is used
and is that from so fried networks of

693
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:47,790
this

694
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:51,200
ipv6 prefix address space is being is in
use

695
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,820
may be a more and we didn't find it
because you're only looking

696
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:59,410
for these ipv6 addresses host addresses

697
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:04,040
yeah butts in ipv6 you must be lucky if
you find something

698
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:08,760
again this is what I found not give you
the best coverage

699
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:12,510
the next source of information is
actually DNS because i think is six

700
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:14,180
addresses are so long

701
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:17,220
real yes so long um

702
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:20,550
the IP nobody can memorize ipv6
addresses so

703
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:24,630
all the information to connect to
administrators can connector systems

704
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:27,980
are in the DNS for DNS is the is a

705
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:31,080
vast resource for you as an attacker

706
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:34,580
so getting any everything up everything
possible out of DNS

707
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:38,350
is essential sadly the reverse

708
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:41,680
DNS entries are usually

709
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,750
not house vast ass

710
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:49,100
the host right v6 address resolution
whoever you can find lots of stuff in

711
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:49,940
there

712
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:54,210
um there's I would call I would call it
a feature

713
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:57,230
in the DNS standard houdini s

714
00:43:57,230 --> 00:44:01,620
works did you can ask for Dean s

715
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:06,280
um entry so this is just part of an ipv6
host entry

716
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,580
and then from this we at sOooo taught

717
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:13,430
1.2 dot F taught and if this sub-domain

718
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:18,280
excess are not Texas you get a different
kind of terror from the DNS server

719
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:22,300
so if there's nothing like serious
thought 8

720
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:25,380
whatever ipv6 address you get an extra
main or

721
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:30,190
if there something underneath dis leave
you getting no era result

722
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:33,860
so you can walk the whole address space
for the target

723
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:37,420
down until you come to the for PTR and
free

724
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:42,080
for for the reverse lookup of an iPad
for of an ipv6 address

725
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:45,380
and this works in seconds

726
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:49,400
so thankfully this is how it works for
ripe

727
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,620
um you just of the main DNS server hey

728
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:56,670
give me everything from let's say this

729
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:59,820
I'm from this network address space
which are your sponsor before and then

730
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:06,100
you see year thank you very much

731
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:10,310
and this gives you IP caesar's which up
very likely in use

732
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:13,800
if you can reach them because they might
be if I want in between that's

733
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,340
the furthest up but now you're in OK
these are possible addresses

734
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:20,470
and also very important for later you
see

735
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:23,650
their host numbering scheme

736
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:28,160
for example you can see the all for
these types cutie always have C-one

737
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:28,960
hundred

738
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,330
and then the county up what's the
address space food is

739
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:36,430
if we see the hot we can use this
information

740
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:42,640
before the enumerated their numbering
scheme to find more systems later

741
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,380
for the other team as information stuff
you can do sewn transfer

742
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:49,920
is always gets the full picture was in
the US but okay sadly

743
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,980
this really works um if they have TNS
sick

744
00:45:54,980 --> 00:46:00,400
you can and is did use not using and 63
Dan it's way more complicated

745
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,800
um course and you have to get hasher's
you have the correct the hasher's

746
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:07,040
as possible but pain in the ass if they
have

747
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:10,240
begin secure n sec deployed kitchen can
just

748
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:13,790
walk every entry and yes to just let you
to run

749
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:17,850
it dumps all entries in the DNS for you
if they have in Essex with

750
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:22,290
and second and 63 if this does not work
because they don't have the NSA

751
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:25,290
you can still do DNS brute forcing so

752
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:29,560
that stood at all with right because yes
surprise surprise

753
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:33,340
right allows also on transfers of the
DNS

754
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:36,730
again something very sick ok it's not
1985 anymore

755
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:41,750
guys please everything does intro naming
scheme their dress scheme

756
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:45,520
you see everything in there um

757
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,610
the NSA walk you're using the NSA of
course

758
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:52,730
the A one of the driving forces for DNS
sec but why did you buy the in

759
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:56,540
insecure and sec implementation instead
of the more secure

760
00:46:56,540 --> 00:47:00,340
while still stuff you could too but the
more secure and 631

761
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:03,390
I don't know maybe because they want me
to do this presentation they want to

762
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:05,230
support me maybe I hope so

763
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:08,340
um so this is how you can through

764
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:12,830
get every information I love you and as
through the NSX walking

765
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:16,190
and if this fails to attend the only
possibility left but thats

766
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:20,100
that always works you just guess
possible host names and

767
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:23,700
the tool which is part all the to all
the tools you see here are in the

768
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:27,520
in the ipv6 attack sweet um which is out
there for

769
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:31,660
seven years already and the newest
update is available already on the TC

770
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:33,150
website

771
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:37,150
so all these tools already now available
for you

772
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:41,100
and this already comes with the
dictionaries which is over 3,000

773
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:44,870
and freeze large real-world statistic
data

774
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:48,800
based on the entry stairs with Israel
ineffective list

775
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:53,960
and again you see peace up the hostnames
and deputy 6 addresses behind that

776
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:58,050
this gives you all in all lots of lots
of

777
00:47:58,050 --> 00:48:01,340
possible life addresses so you have

778
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:05,650
from the DNS you have from the arm
prefix scanning

779
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:09,170
you half networks and hosts which could
possible

780
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:13,060
possibly reachable could possible be
life on the network

781
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:18,450
so with it all live six you can now
check if their life its

782
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:22,530
kinda ping scanning tool but has more
alive checking techniques with

783
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:25,880
TCP um of let's go with

784
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:29,160
I'm that's how you would use that so I
really trying to help you step-by-step

785
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:31,200
through if you ever want to do that

786
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,490
on you should put all you all the
systems if on all the networks the phone

787
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:38,510
21 fall and then just put say put this
as a

788
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:42,000
input file for days that I've scanning
tool

789
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,330
with the capsule the permit test you
scan for common addresses in

790
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:48,530
each net for his phone so if you have
twenty your phone

791
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:51,830
20 possible ipv6 addresses in three
different networks

792
00:48:51,830 --> 00:48:56,670
with the three networks common often use
ipv6 host addresses

793
00:48:56,670 --> 00:49:01,390
are being enumerated intestate capital m
means there's think

794
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:04,240
I all reported with there's something
like of the country for on

795
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,490
autoconfiguration

796
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:09,250
of a conflagration is often done based
on the mac address

797
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:12,860
so if you found one system that in the
DVDs which house disorder corporation

798
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:14,020
based on the mac Address

799
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:18,240
you can enumerate the rest of the vendor
id: address peso it for example that you

800
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:22,260
at one Dell server doing
autoconfiguration in the DNS

801
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:26,360
on and they might have more Dell servers
this option does that automatically for

802
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,110
you

803
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:31,110
capital F is pliable piercing what
normally the two

804
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:34,190
just sense ping packets

805
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:38,030
with the final piercing mode it sends
his peace in Pakistan various sports you

806
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:42,420
you to be packing to port 53 it is the
Act PPACA to some high port

807
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:46,360
I'm and ICMP our package which can also
generate a result

808
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:49,730
so tries to get through firewall to but
you can also find bring work with more

809
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:52,510
command line options you just send it
and then

810
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:56,950
yeah if you do it for all the addresses
iPhone four right

811
00:49:56,950 --> 00:50:00,480
and again they have a firewall s I saw
with some stuff

812
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,390
never complained that seem to be happy
to be a leading example on

813
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:08,820
how not to do things you'll see that
from the internet

814
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:13,480
over 6 670 systems are reachable

815
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:17,300
in the right network I don't think this
is

816
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:21,100
secure sounding number

817
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:25,740
so the next step after you know katie's
are reachable ipv6 addresses is standard

818
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:29,250
contesting port scanning service in
operation attacking the services

819
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:30,870
etcetera etcetera

820
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:34,730
but this is how you do pen testing ipv6
networks

821
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:37,780
as I set the first time ever

822
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:41,600
it is shown how it is actually has to be
done it's not rocket science but its

823
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:45,110
it takes quite some stuff to get it all
together

824
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:48,580
um for local host discovery so if you
are attacking

825
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:51,720
intro million the internal system
central networks

826
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:56,570
is already partially documented on the
ipv6 hackers meaning this because of

827
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:59,760
time restrictions here um I have put it
in the slights

828
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:03,570
there already for the local discovery of
systems are already and map

829
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:07,090
what you wish for death and as he models
and it would be very nice

830
00:51:07,090 --> 00:51:10,590
if someone would put everything together
like Mike

831
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:14,170
life stall up their stuff I have here

832
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:18,260
um if someone would write and met models
with his as well

833
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:25,260
because I love to have one tool which
does everything

834
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:29,350
so you can even look nice network maps I
don't know if right is happy to

835
00:51:29,350 --> 00:51:32,310
so people business how the net for the
structure so you see all the networks

836
00:51:32,310 --> 00:51:33,540
and caught they are connected

837
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:38,540
does the stuff you can do if you have
that information

838
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:45,540
so um okay eight minutes left wonderful

839
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:50,560
I want to talk a little bit about the
problems we have in ipv6

840
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:55,940
why it is so I say first

841
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:59,540
I don't think actually from a security
standpoint but commitment is

842
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:03,350
to excess standpoint

843
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:06,880
you might think deploying ipv6 is

844
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,980
actually it's not course I and I Q sixty

845
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:14,840
lot of political battles going on for
example

846
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:19,070
of the conflagration was designed from
network people

847
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:23,310
to get writ of DHCP why years to pee is
run

848
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:26,610
by usually the windows Server Team

849
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:30,740
but not by the net for people and is
also not nice to have

850
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:34,590
and couple they were protocol so UP
protocol

851
00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:37,720
being responsible for low-level network
stuff

852
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:40,960
house so dats why

853
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:46,500
of a conflagration was designed to get
rid of DHCP

854
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:50,840
the problem is asked a found out way too
late they forgot to implement

855
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:56,050
the future to set the DNS server without
a DNS server

856
00:52:56,050 --> 00:52:59,430
what do you do you needed used to peace
over otherwise

857
00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:03,320
you took on config your a DNS server on
the machine

858
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,820
unless you want to manual config reform
machines or

859
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:10,110
good luck with that um

860
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:14,130
after quite many I think it put took
them seven eight nine years to realize

861
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:14,900
it and done

862
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:19,120
come up with an RFC now it's a proper
nobody is implementing this r/c

863
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:23,270
so basically of a confirmation which
could have been a very cool feature

864
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:26,270
is kind that that

865
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:29,860
on the other hand if you say okay to me
dude AC people six

866
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:33,640
we use and each used to keep pushing for
all ready for a long time we have the

867
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,010
experience

868
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:38,160
it works so let's today 2p person for

869
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:43,050
well when did you find all the coverage
we want to make sure nobody is using

870
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:44,640
DHCP version 6

871
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:48,480
sought intentionally team they put
trouble in their

872
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:52,380
Yukon config your default gateway by
DHCP version 6

873
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:56,430
you can configure wrote entries wide
each execution 6

874
00:53:56,430 --> 00:54:00,000
and if you do uninstalled c2

875
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,200
installations of system on ipv4 by at
least two people before so you know the

876
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,640
mac address of device

877
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:10,010
amid get special IP IP address special
configuration by DHCP sorry

878
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:13,350
automatically installed Sophie on the
first time the system is I'm

879
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:17,280
booted up it doesn't look good its
appearance it either because

880
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:20,740
this is not out the standard required to
use something like it something called

881
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:22,440
the GUID

882
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:26,980
this is value or unique ID for system

883
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:31,140
which is generated the first time is
putting up because it's also based on

884
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:32,110
the time

885
00:54:32,110 --> 00:54:36,260
the system was first put it up not have
coalitions and stuff like that

886
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:39,610
this means that some initial you just
run

887
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:42,660
you never put up the system in
automatically have system installed is

888
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:43,400
not possible

889
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:46,710
but the two people sex anymore so people
are not

890
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:49,760
happy without congressional people are
not happy with

891
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:53,190
you two people 26 and not every system

892
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:56,390
cons supports 22 people in six for
example there's

893
00:54:56,390 --> 00:55:01,700
no plan for Android on the road map to
have to use to people in sick support

894
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:05,520
now so pretty it pretty much if you're
in

895
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,930
environment which is very mixed you're
fucked

896
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:12,440
sorry my language if you lost to World
War Z trying to get grumpy with the

897
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:14,440
world

898
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:19,780
um so this is something which is really
troubling if you want to deploy ipv6

899
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:23,130
then there's other stuff you have lots
of security issues I should use some

900
00:55:23,130 --> 00:55:25,540
here

901
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:29,630
to there are security features and
switches and routers you can deploy to

902
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:31,020
somehow

903
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:34,980
reduce that risk the problem he is
whoever debt to get the

904
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:38,050
kinda even kinda the feature parity
parity

905
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:42,030
like DHCP snooping are prints pictures
and stuff like that before

906
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:45,450
for ipv6 you pay tries 24

907
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:48,590
times the price for the switches and
routers there is

908
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:51,700
some reason for that that is that ipv6

909
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:55,080
so way more complex protocols and if all

910
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:59,190
way more ways to bypass de protection
mechanisms as I show two years ago

911
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:03,550
um it needs more CPU power it is more am
so it's

912
00:56:03,550 --> 00:56:06,910
its higher class machines that's why
they are more important

913
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:11,120
more expensive but that means if you
want to have the same

914
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:15,690
same security haha but at least some
more security id: six or so

915
00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:19,920
at least get a little bit to the in
security of the ipv4 networks

916
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:24,670
that means that you have to wait paid me
more money

917
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:27,840
and we know it how much

918
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:33,220
this is something management like to do
throwing more money at network equipment

919
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:37,790
and then next thing is Wenders don't
seem to care

920
00:56:37,790 --> 00:56:42,140
if you ask me who has the worst ipv6
support from a security standpoint and

921
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:43,550
operating system

922
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:48,400
surprisingly it's not Apple with the 16
no actually I don't like Apple but

923
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:52,060
day getting better and better it's also
also lowers know it's owned by

924
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:56,510
article you might expect out Adobe it
could be dope if they would be response

925
00:56:56,510 --> 00:56:58,410
from operating system but no

926
00:56:58,410 --> 00:57:01,660
its Microsoft Windows day no abort

927
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:04,990
issues India ipv6 in Asians and

928
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:08,290
the businesses eighty

929
00:57:08,290 --> 00:57:15,290
get sick you six on your site

930
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:18,760
how does this work inbox

931
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,870
and saying go but if you don't want to
do something about it for

932
00:57:21,870 --> 00:57:26,140
you're fucked now so this is really
really bad behavior and Microsoft with

933
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:28,590
itself to be one of the drivers for ipv6

934
00:57:28,590 --> 00:57:31,640
so what Kansas is shame on Microsoft
what up

935
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:35,120
not fix in the box not being used not
taking responsibility and doing good

936
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:35,910
things for I

937
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:39,620
for ipv6 security so um

938
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:43,910
that's it herein are the tools maybe you
can get ipv6 support

939
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:47,680
enable again few for the network and you
can have a lot of our fun I can promise

940
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:48,690
you

941
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:53,490
um contact if you ever have a question
about ipv6

942
00:57:53,490 --> 00:57:57,220
the security-related just email me I
guarantee you getting on so if I can

943
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:58,660
read your email

944
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:03,270
yes sometimes I get the email to you
wouldn't believe arm

945
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:07,850
things for people who like me if out
stuff for free so I give my tools offer

946
00:58:07,850 --> 00:58:09,130
free for everybody

947
00:58:09,130 --> 00:58:13,670
people make very nice pictures make them
available for the internet for everybody

948
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:14,760
to use for free

949
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:18,350
thank you to these people thank you for
staying here because I know it's the

950
00:58:18,350 --> 00:58:19,750
last

951
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:23,170
last sessions on people are tired
information overload

952
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:26,500
I try to remove all that echoes of that
make a little bit more entertaining

953
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:30,470
opiates a fun an artist time for
questions

954
00:58:30,470 --> 00:58:33,830
yes dis people I have

955
00:58:33,830 --> 00:58:37,700
disc I have never seen before and

956
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:42,140
effects for the presentation I have one
remark in one question

957
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:45,480
do first is about the difference in in
filtering

958
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:48,930
between ipv6 and ipv4 that you should
and you

959
00:58:48,930 --> 00:58:53,240
basically see dead people on noted
during a PCs because the SFI

960
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:56,580
think it's a cue arm give the

961
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:59,810
that stupidities for more common than
evil

962
00:58:59,810 --> 00:59:03,250
don't you think that the small really to
people for Getty

963
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:06,750
to actually filtering the six which is
very common in

964
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:10,490
in Pitt St world we know that for use
that scan

965
00:59:10,490 --> 00:59:13,570
ipv6 is more efficient when it's

966
00:59:13,570 --> 00:59:17,430
I'll activated and the new question
about the right

967
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:22,660
so you'll you'll basically scare you
about 50,000 machines

968
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:25,830
and you find 0.1 percent

969
00:59:25,830 --> 00:59:29,660
on this machine so I'm sorry I'm not
finding point one machine

970
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:33,120
1 percent of of the machines I'm
scanning

971
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:37,710
a very large very small address space of
the whole possible address space

972
00:59:37,710 --> 00:59:41,670
know but because of the DNS information
I can pretty sure that I have discovered

973
00:59:41,670 --> 00:59:44,730
ninety-five percent of the real machines
that are there

974
00:59:44,730 --> 00:59:48,430
okie but from diff --git again take
address space that what is all about

975
00:59:48,430 --> 00:59:51,980
but do we understand the understood your
you slow it was

976
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:55,860
that's right 50,000 names

977
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:59,360
and you stand them and you get 6

978
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:02,830
700 replies but but my point is

979
01:00:02,830 --> 01:00:07,230
did you compare it with what was
accessible ipv4

980
01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:10,790
no see fuels come because meet the
visibility to me

981
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:15,070
reason for the seven hundred machines to
actually reachable

982
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:19,110
very likely I totally agree but that's
not why I put right here

983
01:00:19,110 --> 01:00:23,010
I don't want to say oh and I B four does
a Q&A forget ipv6 that's not the way I

984
01:00:23,010 --> 01:00:24,760
wanted to show you so please that's not

985
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:29,440
not what I want to tell what I want to
tell is this is how you do this for ipv6

986
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:33,150
and to see if this technique works this
is how it works

987
01:00:33,150 --> 01:00:38,030
and is it works right we didn't want to
say 20 I P 46 rubbing sticks in secure

988
01:00:38,030 --> 01:00:41,950
just if you want to try out these two
this these techniques

989
01:00:41,950 --> 01:00:45,540
this is how you did and you can try it
out for yourself

990
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:49,540
ants yes I thought more DNS entries and
I found alive system but it's

991
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:50,750
justifiable

992
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:54,970
if i waltz which prevent the existing
system I know it is very like a success

993
01:00:54,970 --> 01:00:59,950
but the fire will prevent me accessing
it so I can scan it

994
01:00:59,950 --> 01:01:03,000
so for me for pen testing it's important
to attack

995
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:07,130
these machines which I can reach icon to
technicians icon reach

996
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:11,940
obviously no I see I see your point but
I don't see the relationship with that

997
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:13,920
number beagle small

998
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:17,930
8286 nobility as you see reason to
dislike

999
01:01:17,930 --> 01:01:23,980
two's my point

1000
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:28,490
all I hope everybody else did sorry

1001
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:32,670
um one more thing when you set your
people forgets

1002
01:01:32,670 --> 01:01:36,040
so the differences between ipv4 and ipv6
protection on the routers and the

1003
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:36,740
servers

1004
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:40,310
actually it's two reasons one is very
correctly people

1005
01:01:40,310 --> 01:01:43,610
don't think about that ipv6 a different
network stack so it's

1006
01:01:43,610 --> 01:01:47,120
different kind of filter it so you IP
four federal deny all

1007
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:51,280
doesn't hit for ipv6 packets of people
forget that that's one reason

1008
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:55,820
the other reason is that the file a
safer place are not supporting ipv6

1009
01:01:55,820 --> 01:02:00,240
and I think they have problems with
management getting the budget for ipv6

1010
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:01,030
firewall

1011
01:02:01,030 --> 01:02:05,090
or to have deploy and the that say the
trouble to finally

1012
01:02:05,090 --> 01:02:08,880
get an ipv6 firewall I mean you know how
it is with our two companies

1013
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:13,050
takes a long time for ordering getting
it delivered and finally setting up in

1014
01:02:13,050 --> 01:02:17,190
in the data center takes long time and
until they already have ipv6

1015
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:22,430
I think that's the second reason all
there's this difference

1016
01:02:22,430 --> 01:02:27,500
any other question

1017
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:31,100
everybody seems to be too hard to sleep
in a coma

1018
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:35,450
did my job yes please

1019
01:02:35,450 --> 01:02:39,240
there's a microphone please thanks
haven't said when the eight seconds

1020
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:43,740
from zip and yeltsin's me to compare the
two ipv4 p

1021
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:47,300
LTZ no I did not I'm course

1022
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:50,920
let's say you do with the Nets resolving
foreign for hosting if

1023
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:54,700
get back and I before an ipv6 address
you never know it's the same system

1024
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:58,280
it could be on a comp completely
elsewhere in the world so

1025
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:01,570
unless you really have excesses system
you can check the

1026
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:06,110
the I address configuration you never
know it's the same system

1027
01:03:06,110 --> 01:03:09,570
so I didn't for me port was just go with
the roads are good I get that much

1028
01:03:09,570 --> 01:03:10,820
faster

1029
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:14,610
but if you compare the to channel

1030
01:03:14,610 --> 01:03:18,350
well for some systems you know it's the
same and if you do for example FTP to

1031
01:03:18,350 --> 01:03:20,550
the system's or pinging two systems

1032
01:03:20,550 --> 01:03:24,980
you will notice the more you work with
ipv6 that the ipv6 network is

1033
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:28,180
foster in the IP for network just
because

1034
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:32,150
less data is traveling on on the ipv6
network the hopper is new or

1035
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:37,030
um the routing and the form that the
router is better for ipv6 and ipv4

1036
01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:41,730
all so the maximum date up data you can
send an ipv6 packet is twenty fight

1037
01:03:41,730 --> 01:03:42,430
snowed in for

1038
01:03:42,430 --> 01:03:46,850
compared to 94 packet now so little bit
less updater back some data can be

1039
01:03:46,850 --> 01:03:47,619
transferred

1040
01:03:47,619 --> 01:03:50,700
by IP six per packet but latency

1041
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:54,360
travel speed and stuff like that is way
better ipv6 and ipv4

1042
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:59,330
so if you have a larger downloads to
them by ipv6

1043
01:03:59,330 --> 01:04:03,100
okay we already over time thank you very
much if you want to join me for a beer

1044
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:04,240
later

1045
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:11,240
yeah idea your rights

1046
01:04:22,030 --> 01:04:23,800
this

1047
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:30,800
sleep
