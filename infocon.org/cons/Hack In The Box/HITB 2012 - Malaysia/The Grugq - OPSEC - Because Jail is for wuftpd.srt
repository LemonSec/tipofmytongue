1
00:00:06,069 --> 00:00:10,450
for this

2
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:11,900
sir

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,840
space

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:20,840
sleep

5
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,130
hello everyone thank you for your
patience thank you for coming back into

6
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,470
the room in time for us to start time
Lee

7
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,360
without further ado I'm gonna Hanover

8
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:38,100
to you the grog with his presentation
for today please join me in welcoming

9
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,489
drug thank you

10
00:00:42,489 --> 00:00:47,120
i'd are so this is gonna be a talk about
OPSEC its actually not very techincal

11
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,489
almost the problems that people have a
cop sack are Mon technical in nature

12
00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:56,300
basically they say too much I it's
intended for our freedom fighters

13
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,820
so iraq freedom fighting all the
internets

14
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,520
this is useful for you are very briefly

15
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,940
we're going to go over an instruction on
what OPSEC actually is

16
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:10,789
a methodology for how to implement its
arm

17
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:14,170
then going to spend quite a bit of time
at the all second bite months to see

18
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:15,210
what they did wrong

19
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,920
and the OPSEC fails that they had are
then going to happen

20
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,330
go over techniques to help you of SAC

21
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:25,340
and then technology that you can you
specifically to make

22
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:29,459
OPSEC easier to do and then a brief
conclusion

23
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:33,220
so the problem that we're facing

24
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:37,610
is one that was expressed well on the
bar you only need to fuck 'em once

25
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:41,849
I one mistake is enough to be fatal arm

26
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:45,940
this one pretty awesome might see on
gonna fuck

27
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:50,750
once built like people slow just once
you can never ever

28
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:55,599
not be late obviously just once so we
need to plan

29
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:02,069
need to fucking for methods in place to
make it less likely that our mistakes

30
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:02,670
will be fatal

31
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,470
arm so briefly what the fuck

32
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:10,140
is OPSEC OPSEC in a nutshell

33
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:16,810
keep your mouth shut I don't say are the
less you say

34
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,420
the hard it is for people to figure out
what you doing you need to

35
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:24,909
Carter secrets you need to basically
operate on what we call a need to know

36
00:02:24,909 --> 00:02:25,659
basis

37
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:29,810
jim is picking no one needs to know arm

38
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:34,560
the less that you tell people the better
off you are and you need to work hard so

39
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,969
that you never get in a position where
people can blackmail you

40
00:02:36,969 --> 00:02:40,319
I'll this is reflected later on another
slide

41
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,610
you say one law at a time arm

42
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:47,670
basically you do not want to give people

43
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,730
an opportunity to take control of your
actions life

44
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:54,069
terrible idea

45
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:58,120
so in short shut the fuck up

46
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,409
I you don't say it

47
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:06,840
then you don't have to encrypt it or try
to protect arm

48
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,760
this is an actual excellent guide OPSEC
it specifically for

49
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,060
people who smoke weed om so they've got
a slightly different set of rules but

50
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:17,659
they're

51
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:20,879
mm basically the same thing so

52
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,359
need to be caffeine you to be conscious
of what you doing

53
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:27,439
and you need to keep your fucking house

54
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:30,499
I again

55
00:03:30,499 --> 00:03:34,249
the less you say the better off you are
for arm

56
00:03:34,249 --> 00:03:38,639
as always be paranoid to be proactively
paranoid

57
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:43,700
paranoid does not work retroactively

58
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,920
mistakes you make will come back to
haunt you are you wanna be tidy

59
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,389
so you wanna make sure that you don't
leave contraband lying around

60
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:54,579
an example of a freedom fighter

61
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:57,719
the soup with mostly mean things like

62
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:02,459
not leaving incriminating evidence on
your laptop making sure that you aren't

63
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:03,290
remaining evidence

64
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,840
stored in a jump box to be the first hop
you reach

65
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,849
before you start doing your freedom
fighting activities on the Internet I'll

66
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:14,499
make sure that it's always interested
has not left lying around that's not

67
00:04:14,499 --> 00:04:17,019
left in a state where people can access
it and copy it

68
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:20,299
I E make sure that its not on your

69
00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:23,810
conference laptop so that when you go to
conferences

70
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:27,850
people break into a hotel room and cop
your hard drive they get nothing

71
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,270
arm basically

72
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:34,380
you need to minimize the amount of stuff
that's left lying around and other

73
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,270
people confined

74
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:39,479
when you're talking to people in an
environment that might be monitored

75
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:39,949
which

76
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:43,250
is whenever you're talking to people arm

77
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,979
never be explicit so don't say that's
gone freedom fight the haudenosaunee

78
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:51,750
and also don't use code: I

79
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:57,250
the clever code word have the the clever
codes you can talk to talk about stuff

80
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,960
are terrible arm they're very very
easily broken

81
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,030
so this example of like I would like to
you green sweaters

82
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:08,130
and one mushroom pizza I

83
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:11,560
that is not a good code arm

84
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,139
on the other hand do use code words so
crypto names

85
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:20,289
are much better than being explicit so
if you're going to be discussing

86
00:05:20,289 --> 00:05:24,280
arm a particular freedom fighting
activity against a particular target

87
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,300
have acronym set up for that targets you
could say

88
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,810
we have freedom fighting evacuees not we
have redefined

89
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,970
Sony that way on

90
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:38,520
if it creates the additional layer of
security so that if

91
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,690
your composition is monitored logged

92
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:44,819
it is harder for people to understand
what's going on

93
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:48,060
and it is easier for your defense later
on

94
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,229
you could say Achilles was not Sony so
that was actually not

95
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:55,910
talk arm

96
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:59,129
I'm and says you 11 time

97
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:02,319
I so you need to provide less

98
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,180
ammunition for people to try and go
after you you want to make sure that you

99
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,340
are not break

100
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,770
large number of laws you get busted for
one and I finally

101
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,849
hacking kit that would be bad

102
00:06:13,849 --> 00:06:17,879
some the it's better off if you don't do
drugs because

103
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:21,090
for example we've got busted New York

104
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:24,190
they couldn't get a Manhattan charge
taken for drug possession

105
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:28,770
I so they will they will find a way to
get use to make it

106
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:32,120
harder for them regards and

107
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,690
internal camouflage is always good

108
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:40,210
so one methodology for I doing OPSEC

109
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:44,240
is basically you need to think about how
to put the bombing in first

110
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,270
so you need to set up your environment
OPSEC before you actually

111
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:51,979
start doing things you secure covered
entities before you start using them

112
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:56,620
arm so my recommendation would be that
you create a cover

113
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,470
I have covers basically an alias a fake
identity then you need to work on the

114
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,020
legend which is basically the

115
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,039
history the background and supporting
documentation

116
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,360
for that cover arm for example

117
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,889
one very very famous cover is the Tom

118
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:15,680
the case of the man who never was which
was guide Manya that was dumped

119
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,800
overboard

120
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,120
I G mobile to next to Spain fake
documents for the d-day invasion

121
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,330
arm and the idea was that when he found
the spec documents would be taken as

122
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,419
legitimate

123
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:30,539
hands would confuse with actors
disinformation

124
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:34,409
nazis at works he had forty two pieces

125
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:37,770
of identifying documentation right from

126
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:41,889
ticket stub for a movie to his driver's
license

127
00:07:41,889 --> 00:07:46,729
to his office or ID he had a huge
amounts of background documentation

128
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:50,990
to com act as bona fides make basically
make it appear that he was

129
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:55,020
we said he wants arm you need to do the
same thing

130
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,120
I kevin is simple gmail account is not
sufficient

131
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,770
it's better off if you create an entire
focus on fake Twitter

132
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:05,580
fake facebook and so on even better if
it gets

133
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,729
fake photographs which appear to be of
some other individual

134
00:08:09,729 --> 00:08:13,039
and create this entire persona and you
become that persona

135
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:17,090
first so you inhabit that before you
creates

136
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:21,210
you online in this online use names and
so on

137
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:25,490
and then when you do friedman fighting
activities from your online alias

138
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,900
when that gets compromised the

139
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:32,010
personal attacks he is your cover

140
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:35,430
someone who doesn't exist I and its

141
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:39,200
very very very critical that you never
contaminated so contamination

142
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,380
is when there's contact between to cover
identities are two aliases

143
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:47,860
or in this case between your real
identity and

144
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,910
your cover persona so be very very very
conscious

145
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:55,820
of contamination avoid it like the
plague

146
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:01,290
arm this is actually from the 10 crack
commandments but the smalls

147
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,930
he has excellent guides to how to

148
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:10,170
conduct an illegal business or illegal
activities without going to jail

149
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:14,280
arm never reveal operational details

150
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:19,020
dump it tell people how you do what you
do or what you're doing

151
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:22,900
never revealing a plan so don't let
people know what you plan on doing

152
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,560
what you intend to do om

153
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,000
never trust anyone I just

154
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,380
particularly goes for people that you're
operating they are not your friends they

155
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,610
are criminal codefendants

156
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:40,740
I you want to make sure that they are
not in a position

157
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:44,500
that they can do harm to you if they get
past and there's a high likelihood that

158
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,210
they will because the probably

159
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,510
dumb thats wide

160
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:54,460
arm you need to never confuse
recreational activity

161
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,840
and packing and freedom fighting
activities

162
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,290
I recreation is shit that you do for fun

163
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:04,440
freedom fun activities should be treated
like in business

164
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,370
operation you too plan are you going
after you need to you

165
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:11,780
pick your targets you need to select
it's actually invest some time and

166
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,800
effort into that

167
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,830
and then when you conduct your
operations you need to do that

168
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:20,190
in a systematic and logical fashion and
you need to be careful about how you go

169
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,200
about doing it

170
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,270
I V just going around up in boxes
because it's fun you will go to jail

171
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:29,990
and never operate from your own house so
for example

172
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:33,620
arm the iceman got pops

173
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,780
a while ago who was documented in

174
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:40,150
the kingpin book by Kevin

175
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:43,320
art announced last name arm

176
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,630
he would rent hotel rooms and

177
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:50,240
use those hotel rooms to operate from
with a huge WiFi antenna

178
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:56,460
to hack into neighboring arm businesses
and steal their bandwidth to use that

179
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,640
I'm so that wouldn't that would keep his
house

180
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:04,640
contamination free free of contraband

181
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,270
thats a bit extreme I if you have the
capability of doing that you should do

182
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,240
that

183
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,240
arm but at a bare minimum you have to
make sure that you are using

184
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,720
for before you go anywhere else toll
provides a level of anonymity

185
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,950
I'm however you are better off just not
use

186
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:26,680
house I you need to be practically
paradigm

187
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,120
said before I know I does not work
retroactively you need to plan in

188
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,440
advance to be

189
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,710
terrified of getting busted I need to
work with that in mind all the time

190
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:38,960
otherwise you make mistakes and go to
jail

191
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,840
om you need to keep your personal life

192
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,140
and your freedom fun activities
completely separated

193
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:50,410
you want to make sure thats arm the
people know about everything

194
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:54,530
fun activities do not know who you are
and

195
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:58,210
the people who know you personally
should not know that you're conducting

196
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:01,870
freedom fighting activities right it's
as dangerous for everyone

197
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:05,290
if you want friends go to the pub I'm
downtown

198
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:08,740
RCN had a chance to meet people I it's a
terrible idea

199
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:12,960
you will go to jail home

200
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,890
you want to keep your personal
environment contraband free Center you

201
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,210
want to make sure that

202
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:21,320
your own equipment is kept neat and tidy
you want to make sure that

203
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,370
love the evidence that you're generating
is not kept on your personal commitment

204
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,230
that has kept

205
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:29,660
on your first jump box Hawks

206
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:33,150
I it's not in a situation where if

207
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:37,810
you get Boston then it can be used
against you it's a situation where

208
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:42,160
if it gets busted it can also be used
against you shouldn't be

209
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,500
it shouldn't be on your person ever

210
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:50,120
arm obviously don't talk to the police
dumb idea

211
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:54,620
and never give anyone power which to
gain is the one more time

212
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:58,520
for certainly don't let people blackmail
you talkin to

213
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:02,710
a situation where the other people who
can control your actions

214
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:05,900
if there's someone else is in charge of
your actions

215
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:09,900
home then it's going to end for
everybody you have no ability to control

216
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,720
your life

217
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,170
point that's not where you want to be

218
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:17,270
so you might be thinking sounds hard

219
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:21,480
why do you need it recently it hurts to
get fucked

220
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,650
I'm you're better off going to the
effort now

221
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:29,190
and not going to the later or um with
the

222
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:34,150
army quotes more the more you sweat in
peace the less you bleed in war

223
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:38,550
I'm and it's important to remember that
no one is going to go to jail for you

224
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:41,980
if you're trusting people to keep them
out shot which

225
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:47,280
you should never do they want this is
why I V pins or not actually secure

226
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:51,940
om CBN's would only be secure if you
trusted that the operator of the VPN is

227
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,620
going to go to jail for you

228
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:57,350
home that's not going to happen

229
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:01,340
as these days found a would-be

230
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:05,650
Hammond hands donna is the other one

231
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:08,780
to other dudes I

232
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:13,470
no one is going to go to jail for you
when some who fucked up and got busted

233
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:17,410
you flip immediately same day and turned
everyone else in

234
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:20,480
your friends will betray you

235
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,740
you really cannot trust these people so

236
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:27,230
Hammond to actually had recently good

237
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:31,560
OPSEC activities ended up are being
bused because you revealed

238
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,700
a large amount of personal profile
information during chats

239
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,790
which were then used to incriminate him
later

240
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:40,800
om see so

241
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,390
here's the deal also connivance I
understand that this is all too small on

242
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,310
can actually read

243
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:54,310
so arm Hammond on points us to some who

244
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:58,880
he's been arrested for for weed the two
weeks in county jail

245
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,940
and then he says don't tell anyone
because a good compromise my identity

246
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,340
but I'm on probation

247
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:10,950
I if you have to say do not tell anyone
you shouldn't be telling that person

248
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:14,250
I if you know it's going to compromise
your identity why the fuck you telling a

249
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,820
10

250
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:19,250
never ever ever ever do this i'd

251
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:25,780
never trust anyone particularly your
conoco defendants

252
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:29,410
arm so in this case

253
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:32,910
which one okay on the seller's so

254
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:36,650
arm this dudes Mike Donna carro

255
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:39,880
on on China now some Gaelic name

256
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,840
arm he had been defacing I

257
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:48,810
political web sites for ARM Irish
political parties

258
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:51,940
I in order to get the defacement code to
put up

259
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:55,460
his friend used Facebook to senator

260
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:59,080
they sent a copy of the defenseman code

261
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,510
facebook Messenger like

262
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:06,360
don't do that that's terrible for idea

263
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,430
I so his facebook in his real name

264
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:13,300
is now linked directly to this I

265
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,650
you Pro Tem don't use a personal
Facebook account sends

266
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:19,960
defenseman go to freedom fighters

267
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:24,450
timbafunk idea om a game

268
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:28,570
when he was logged into IRC and talking
with people

269
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:33,620
arm his username like basically used in
that he used his computer

270
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:38,510
or as I actually find before he logged
in was his real first name

271
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:41,710
and then regardless %uh which

272
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,970
nickname used which which handle he had
on IRC

273
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:48,810
on his IP said the same his username
stayed the same

274
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:51,960
and you do things like slash neck in the
same channel

275
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,320
to you to swap from 192 the other I'd

276
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,680
it turns out that that's not very
effective I had that is not a good way

277
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,140
to hide your identity

278
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:05,949
I so yeah ago they're all from same IP
address

279
00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:09,640
very important said the same ugh I D
which was the dudes room

280
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,679
Thomas I so clearly

281
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,380
in this case you want to never provide
person I don't follow

282
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,399
viable information in your online name

283
00:17:20,399 --> 00:17:25,120
and you want to avoid contamination he
did not avoid contamination in this case

284
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,169
so each of those user names to those
online arsenic names

285
00:17:29,169 --> 00:17:33,720
was contaminated by the others

286
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,820
arm

287
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,419
he directly contacted in this case CW is

288
00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:44,759
some who the covert witness see

289
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:49,940
some who says to him who is this and as
long as polonium he says

290
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:53,620
this is palladium I'm

291
00:17:53,620 --> 00:18:00,620
gain don't contaminate you need to know
which identity you're using

292
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:08,009
I in this case Hammond was talking with
some brew and telling them about

293
00:18:08,009 --> 00:18:12,000
his lifestyle choices and how he
operates in particular you mentioned

294
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,269
this very unique thing that he is a
freakin gauntness

295
00:18:16,269 --> 00:18:19,940
so freedoms are people that dumpster
dive for food

296
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,919
so when he was under surveillance by the
FBI when I thought they had the right

297
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:23,799
guy

298
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:27,669
and the observed him dumpster diving for
food that

299
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:31,330
demonstrates that he's a freakin I could
link it back to the statement that it

300
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:32,289
made earlier

301
00:18:32,289 --> 00:18:35,990
so he provided profiling information

302
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:39,590
and as online chats and that was used

303
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:43,590
to Boston so as a good example of
keeping your personal life

304
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:47,120
completely separated from your freedom
fighting activity

305
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:54,120
is do not talk about things that are
personally identifiable to you

306
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:59,429
I'm arm this one's fucking genius our
back to

307
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:02,870
matter the due to use Facebook to send
us the basement codes

308
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:07,409
he also uses home IP address he uses
actual home computer to log into a

309
00:19:07,409 --> 00:19:09,070
compromise gmail accounts

310
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:13,690
access arm the wanna be the Irish police

311
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:17,970
on Gmail accounts like don't do that

312
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:21,490
like definitely do not operate from your
own home months incredibly fucking dumb

313
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:22,179
idea

314
00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:27,019
so then don't connect to target directly
from home IP address

315
00:19:27,019 --> 00:19:30,169
you would think that this would be
obvious pop

316
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,990
arm again never operate

317
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:38,570
home

318
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:41,750
Hammon had also are contaminated
previously

319
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:45,509
he had used his own home IP address when
he was hacking into some

320
00:19:45,509 --> 00:19:49,190
white supremacist sites he had been
busted for that

321
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:52,509
but he had been put on lists arm

322
00:19:52,509 --> 00:19:56,399
that's an important thing to do is avoid
getting put on lists

323
00:19:56,399 --> 00:20:00,200
so had like

324
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,320
they they used lists of people who were
known hackers from

325
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,879
previous activity and this was wanna the

326
00:20:06,879 --> 00:20:12,679
the use when they were narrowing down
with the potential suspects were

327
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:16,789
never operate from now on arm

328
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:20,590
accident some really really impressive
stuff they used wifi triangulation to

329
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,019
figure out which

330
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:26,110
our wifi signal coming from his house
was actually his

331
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:29,379
and I figured out that it was coming
from

332
00:20:29,379 --> 00:20:33,299
the rooms that he rented track that down
and then from there

333
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:37,240
they used arm I'm assuming that he had

334
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,970
some I find fiction Mike its he was
using open at work

335
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:44,029
but they hopped onto his network

336
00:20:44,029 --> 00:20:47,610
and then they use that arm to do a
pennant race

337
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:51,100
and I also linked the mac Address

338
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,840
of his computer against the statement
that he made earlier about how our Users

339
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,409
Apple products so they used the Mac

340
00:20:58,409 --> 00:21:02,059
address to show that he was using a Mac
it senator

341
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:05,460
uses a Mac so again this was used

342
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:09,730
to compromises and Sam poppin and that
is because

343
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:13,529
a game she revealed operational details

344
00:21:13,529 --> 00:21:16,740
what he was doing I so

345
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:23,740
don't reveal the operational details on
to people how you are doing things

346
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:32,340
this is another example of how he
revealed operational details he told

347
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,450
he complained frequently about how for
wasn't slow

348
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:38,850
aside how tall was slow how YouTube
didn't work and

349
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:42,470
how annoying what's your store when they
were monitoring his traffic

350
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:46,150
they were able to arm they were able to

351
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:49,350
show that of the traffic leaving his
house

352
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:53,070
was going directly to tor so that was
used as a piece of circumstantial

353
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:55,050
evidence against him as well

354
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:58,200
so by revealing operational details of
how he

355
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,800
conducted his activities and how he
operated it was possible to then

356
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,030
observe those particular operational
details action

357
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:11,980
and link them to him this is

358
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:15,680
an amazingly stupid activity arm so

359
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,910
here some who was supplied with an IP
address

360
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:23,290
from the Gmail logs arm when they come
to the Gmail logs

361
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:26,650
are arm access to that compromised are
lee side

362
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:30,420
the found some that were enormously
appear to originate from

363
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:34,340
Ireland's they said can you find out who
this is

364
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:38,620
we believe it's play DM's some who took

365
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:45,370
IP address and said to palladium do you
recognize as IP address

366
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:49,020
and palladium because he's a fucking
genius said yes that looks like the one

367
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,740
i connect from

368
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:53,490
I I

369
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:57,690
also are played him had stayed thats
uses

370
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:01,830
a particular VPN network on to connect
to

371
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:05,580
his targets the IP addresses from the
Gmail logs

372
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:09,960
were from this particular VPN network
arm

373
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,170
and gain some who asked him

374
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:17,230
to use the perfect privacy VPN and a
game

375
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:20,440
palladium answered yes I use that VPN

376
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,920
please send me to jail arm

377
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:27,820
so you that later on the show

378
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:31,320
gain all the comp my

379
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,670
all the access to the compromise gmail
accounts occurred from

380
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:37,780
the guys home address or the the one VPN

381
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:41,770
it stated that he uses so obviously is
going to jail

382
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:44,790
I so once again never reveal

383
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:48,160
operational details do not tell people
how you operate until the more you're

384
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:48,580
doing

385
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:55,580
arm in this case he was insufficiently
parent night so after he got busted

386
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:02,110
they to come to an interview and I
showed him

387
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:07,090
logs that they collected from some who
of the IRC channels where he was doing

388
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:07,810
all the stuff

389
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:12,420
and they said to him here we know
everything about you

390
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:17,360
we've got the logs as you can see and
they released him on bail

391
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,370
he gets back on these compromise IRC
channels and he says hey everyone

392
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:25,220
I know for a fact that the feds on
monitoring these towns

393
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:29,510
an some who says no way I don't believe
you

394
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:33,080
why would you think that I'm certainly
not a covert witness

395
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,990
to which on ames eyes

396
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:41,020
I was show them to remind derogation I'd
so

397
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:45,250
is now not only confirms for a fact that
his plan him

398
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,520
by verifying he was busted

399
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,660
has been interrogated in this way he's
now been in the same

400
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:55,440
channels are being logged been logged as
stating was just arrested and

401
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,030
interrogated

402
00:24:56,030 --> 00:25:00,410
like its shockingly dumb like arm

403
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:03,880
so than some boob starts

404
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,090
have quizzing him a game to make sure he
knows who this guy is

405
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:11,790
and you start saying shit like so some
who is acting like

406
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:16,270
proactively paranoid like I don't know
who you are who are you

407
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:19,860
your sanctions being logged notions
being logged arm

408
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:23,350
you just heard about a nowhere he says

409
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:27,570
yes like I don't tell you Who I am
because I don't want to be associated

410
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:28,840
with a compromise

411
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:32,800
handle and then

412
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,870
he points out that he was rated hands

413
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:40,240
a game verifies that he is who he says
he is

414
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,890
arm the beach and I should anywhere

415
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:47,390
some who says to him who is this he
responded with

416
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:50,850
the I use name of the individual walls

417
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:54,230
arrested so a game

418
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:58,870
you have to be practically paranoid he
was a huge warning sign

419
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:02,630
when he got raided and when they
interrogated him and ask him about

420
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:05,650
a large number of other people involved
which apt

421
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:10,000
but not about some who I because
obviously they don't ask about some who

422
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,710
they've already got him and he's acting
as a cover witness

423
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:17,540
so that should be a red warning sign if
out of your entire gang

424
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:21,330
one guy gets arrested hands

425
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:24,350
everyone else's his ass about
informational details

426
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:28,540
everyone else except for one person some
very very high likelihood that one

427
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:31,390
person has already been arrested in
compromise

428
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:35,580
so you need to be proactively paranoid
make sure that no one involved

429
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,970
I'll with you is going to be able to
compromise

430
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:43,230
and reveal information

431
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:46,320
here's a guy acceded good this is Baris

432
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,830
virus was in a chap with some who

433
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:54,330
and basically viruses not some accuse me
of being an informant

434
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:57,830
specially if you fuckin disappeared and
come back often to pay me for shit

435
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:01,880
that's fed tactics I'm and then your
friend fucking topiary the known as with

436
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,950
the fucki is

437
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:07,880
isn't being talks know knows who he is
he gets fucking bastard right

438
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,310
and some booze like what I never did
that who offer to pay you for

439
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:14,400
information

440
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:19,070
and my response i yes you offer me money
for docs

441
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:22,240
only informants ever offer up cash for
shit I'm

442
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,370
so again here's one sign if someone
disappears for a while then they come

443
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:29,400
back my stock offering to buy
information

444
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,490
about things caches wanna the

445
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:35,900
one of the things that feds were able to
throw out a problem right they might not

446
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,490
have

447
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:40,140
the intellectual resources but they have
the financial resources

448
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:43,380
so once a compromise someone they can
then so using money to get

449
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:47,440
other information arm if someone starts
offering up money for shit

450
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,100
he's from another hacker because hackers
don't have no fucking money

451
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:56,100
I'm elisa penetration testers and rich
investors don't do stupid shit

452
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,280
right so there's is actually a happy
ending

453
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:04,260
virus was smart and proactively paranoid
has not been busted

454
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:08,340
arm the sliders just for examination
drawn

455
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:11,520
arm it discusses various ways that's

456
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,550
are you can contaminate and identity so

457
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:17,900
lists a different activities at the the
feds can do

458
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:21,410
two-car mates between online handles

459
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:24,940
and use that's to figure out all these
handles are associated with one

460
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:25,780
individual

461
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:29,360
and they're trying to get to that one
individual is I'm

462
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,950
arm so never contaminate

463
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:36,390
I here is just the

464
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:39,450
information on how someone say believe
that

465
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:43,510
hammond's was the guy to go after they
start conducting surveillance

466
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:47,510
on his promises on on has comes out like
where he lived

467
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:50,560
they used that surveillance to link his

468
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,830
online activity of the sub G handle

469
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:58,180
to his presence in his home i'd so when
he was at home

470
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:01,980
they would call up so go and be like is
sup G online

471
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,300
and when he would leave their call up
and say is some John mine has just left

472
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,190
now

473
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:09,630
and the use that correlation between
online activity

474
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:14,580
and physical activity to arm for the
link

475
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:18,600
happens to the sub jeeps on a

476
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,000
on ever recognize these I

477
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,200
this was arm he

478
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,230
I Jay pag that was put upon a defaced
sites

479
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:32,590
by the fucking genius wermer who is now
in jail

480
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:36,190
arm he got busted because when he
uploaded

481
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:40,420
this picture which was sent to him by
his girlfriend in Australia

482
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:43,450
he never remove the excess meta-data
which include

483
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:46,530
the GPS tags for was taken

484
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:50,780
which was from her home which was then
licked to have a Facebook account

485
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:54,650
where her Facebook my friends was wermer

486
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:58,450
I this is incredibly bad OPSEC

487
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:02,810
arm he then after you've gotten busted
when and posted

488
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:07,050
a huge dump all far his reasonings

489
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:12,570
online has been and something out so he
has made the jump his public defender

490
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:14,650
incredibly difficult

491
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:20,040
I this is my name this is my online
handle

492
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:23,700
I was taken to the office I turned over
all the evidence I had

493
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,750
I'm not going to jail I hate myself I'm
a dumbass

494
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:30,550
arm he film for one of the

495
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:34,800
all districts in the book the FBI agents

496
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,490
basically said arm you have no skills
you're no good

497
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:41,490
like so I it's kind of like nagging

498
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:44,760
like this the arm the

499
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,770
guiding the interrogation wolpe little
the

500
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:50,890
abilities on the first they're
interrogating and the

501
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:55,140
largely give the person interrogating
will cause them to then

502
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:58,520
correct mistakes and demonstrate that
the actual

503
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:02,690
half the the skills are being demeaned
and in the process they confessed

504
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:03,640
everything

505
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:07,380
so here he points out in particular that
arm

506
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:11,910
me the DPS administration or the FBI
understand the complexity

507
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:16,290
SQL injections I

508
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:20,690
I I would guess that the FBI might
understand the complexity

509
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:24,240
of SQL injections particular
interviewing someone who

510
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,840
does not understand the complexity
access data

511
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,929
arm right so those those are some
examples

512
00:31:31,929 --> 00:31:36,560
of dumb ass fucking things you can do
and how to land you in jail

513
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,940
it turns out that it's pretty low
hanging fruit you need to go after

514
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:43,970
I'd it's very very difficult to be
sufficiently paranoid

515
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:47,690
but being more paranoid than these dudes
isn't that hard

516
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:51,679
I'll sue techniques basically you need
to put in the plumbing

517
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:56,830
upcoming is all of the stuff that you're
going to use to maintain

518
00:31:56,830 --> 00:32:01,510
you're covering entities and to keep
them separate from your actual identity

519
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:05,310
to create an environment where your
purse on as appear to be legitimate

520
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:08,770
and real actually in contact with who
you are

521
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:11,770
from his plumbing is fucking boring I'd

522
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:15,260
it's not exciting to go and create a
fake facebook account and

523
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:18,880
generate fake activity and make it
appear legitimate make sure that every

524
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,230
time you do this to do it from the
correct

525
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:25,929
I P e's from all this other stuff you
never make mistakes in

526
00:32:25,929 --> 00:32:30,160
on on on on its it's tiring and is
boring and it's really not fun

527
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:34,260
and my eyes by the way is used Gmail cuz
it is a pain in the ass

528
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:38,620
hotmail or ya that shit socks and ask
for money if you want more than 10 make

529
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:39,840
some space

530
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,200
gmail is actually fairly good for that
arm obviously it's all monitored

531
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,650
bar %ah the awesome thing about plumbing

532
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:51,200
is if you've done it correctly then
nothing happens

533
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,530
yeah arm

534
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:57,950
the important thing is of course you
have to put in place first

535
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:01,580
because online doesn't work
retroactively

536
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:05,130
really have to be proactively power you
have to worry about all the shit before

537
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:07,560
it happens

538
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,100
so if we talked briefly about personas I
you need to have

539
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:15,160
legitimate personas like ones are fine I
like big be believable

540
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:19,360
arm again awesome from the wire

541
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,550
in as my name my name is not my name

542
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:26,990
and to you to them you're only the Greek

543
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:30,530
and of course I'm not even Greek okay so

544
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:34,950
in this case have set up very very
legitimate personas

545
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:38,350
which provide a strong level of
protection so that even

546
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:42,820
if on the other colonel codefendants are
compromised

547
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:46,500
they will not be able to review all
information that is actually useful

548
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:51,800
against these two individuals so that's
why your handle should be something like

549
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:56,110
Jose rather than you know your name

550
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:59,470
i'd so the problem is basically you are
you

551
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:02,820
I you are a unique butterfly arm

552
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:06,650
you stick out in a crowd really what you
want to do is you want to be someone

553
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:07,690
else

554
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:10,850
right if you're someone else. people be
distracted one who you are

555
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:15,740
so as you'll notice is wearing a mask

556
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:19,190
I arm the primary danger that your face

557
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:22,859
when you're using an online persona is
contamination

558
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:27,050
contamination is when there's contact
between any covered entities

559
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:30,370
war on your real identity that
contamination

560
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:34,490
Walker when interacts and I can then be
used to trace from

561
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:38,149
one compromise identity through to the
other so it's always important to keep

562
00:34:38,149 --> 00:34:39,679
them completely separated

563
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:43,890
and never interact I they need to be in
isolation from each other

564
00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:48,280
you also need to do layers so simply
happen an initial coverage entity is not

565
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,090
sufficient

566
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:52,160
once you have one covered entity you
then arm

567
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:55,379
start creating some Baileys is from Max

568
00:34:55,379 --> 00:34:59,350
it's better to have multiple I'll cover
identity so that when you get paranoid

569
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:02,750
we believe once been compromised you can
phase out rapidly

570
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:06,730
and move another one into place arm

571
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:10,560
an important thing to realize with the
covering density is that's

572
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,570
%ah the time when is most compromised

573
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:17,450
is when it appears to be most effective
so once it's generated

574
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:20,640
a sufficient large history and legend

575
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,660
and it's it's good enough background of
contraction a whole bunch of other

576
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,580
people

577
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:28,100
it's at this point that you need to kill
it and role in a new one because it

578
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:31,520
is at this point that is generated arm
enough

579
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,430
so the contractions on to be dangerous
and it is going to be

580
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:39,280
the most compromised and the most
interest and other people

581
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,280
and that's the point that you want to
get rid of it and then move onto a new

582
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,170
one

583
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:48,190
arm you need to use technologies that
feel close to you need to make sure

584
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:49,450
thats

585
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:52,790
you do for example for before you do
anything else

586
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:57,080
toll will provide a level of anonymity
so that if your other

587
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:01,280
tekniska compromise a broken then at
least you have tort reform back on

588
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,500
as a final defense towards not foolproof

589
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:08,250
but that's why it's part of a layered
defense and as part of your last layer

590
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:11,310
so that there is a level of anonymity
around you

591
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:14,320
for against anything else

592
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,870
I you should have a backstop persona
which is your

593
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:21,150
use of primary come right XD and then
you have your some Baileys

594
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:25,450
London underneath that like you can have
I your primary come right into the set

595
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:27,340
up a secondary come right ft

596
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:31,230
and the use that secondary come right at
the to create your online handles

597
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:34,900
and have layers of defense in that
regard to your

598
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:39,460
this could become your primary cover
primary cover become a secondary cover

599
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,770
your second recover become

600
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:44,190
your online handles would then gonna do
for them fine activities

601
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:47,230
when their compromise is on layers that
need to be

602
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:50,800
unwrapped and if you've been diligence
in

603
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,840
avoiding contamination will be hard to
link back

604
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,930
through those multiple layers arm

605
00:36:56,930 --> 00:37:00,340
one where you can avoid that is to avoid
providing information

606
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:04,780
I'm so problem with profiling
information is when you provide

607
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:08,560
information about yourself for a bounce
out where you are

608
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,140
and this can reveal your location
geographically

609
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:16,750
it can reveal information about you that
can be used to I'm asking for God who

610
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:17,750
you are

611
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:22,530
arm so yeah like I've been having a
discussion some people

612
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:27,060
exactly how many weather events with
timestamps you would need to Carly

613
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,800
before he could figure out where someone
is geographically

614
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:34,320
I so if someone gets on our singles I
fucking hate how hard it is today

615
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,930
right if you've got a timestamp you can
start

616
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:41,710
eliminating places that are not hot that
point I'm

617
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:45,290
and some later on he starts complaining
about the rain

618
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:48,930
you can then use that time sent a car
made for all of the areas that were

619
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:49,950
previously hop

620
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:54,000
now also raining and so on from that you
can

621
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,190
probably track down someone's geographic
location

622
00:37:57,190 --> 00:38:00,870
its likely not going to be easy bot

623
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:04,950
again it's better off when it's raining
bitch about the heat

624
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:09,220
on the top it's about the cold and so on
you some disinformation

625
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:12,730
or just don't talk about it arm

626
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:15,790
the other important thing that you need
to realize is that

627
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:19,700
it appears very very easy to create a
cover identity an issue cover identity

628
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,920
hands do it without contamination

629
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:26,240
its actually something that requires
practice I

630
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,600
so what you need to do is you too do it
several times in situations which are

631
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,950
not likely to end up

632
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:33,970
with you going to jail need to practice
being someone else

633
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:37,640
needs to practice going the steps of
creating new coverage density

634
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,800
arm says amatures practice in silicon

635
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,160
rights professionals practice until they
can't get it wrong

636
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,660
you need to get really really deeply
ingrained thats when you are you're

637
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:50,190
covered entity you are you cover
identity

638
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:53,339
right not you are not pretending to be
you're covering

639
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:57,040
you actually on the person so don't fall
out of character

640
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,900
I arm briefly on logging

641
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:05,660
a game the wire has got mass amounts
respect for having some action upset

642
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:06,770
rules

643
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:09,970
what you doing robert's Rules orders as
winter minutes of the meeting these two

644
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:10,760
minutes

645
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,859
niggas you take notes on from a fucking
conspiracy

646
00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:18,120
I avoid locking useless information

647
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:21,850
so no logs no crime

648
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:25,460
I in particular the logs that you want
to have

649
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:29,310
are things like your scam marks or are

650
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:32,880
information people down secure password
lists and so on those are useful piece

651
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,760
of information that can be used

652
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,120
to conduct operations and future pieces

653
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:41,660
%uh information that are not useful are
things like syslog

654
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:47,130
right your jump box does not need to
know which times you've logged in

655
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:50,190
I that's not information is actually
useful to you and it could be used as

656
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,470
evidence against you

657
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:56,350
so kill syslog arm if you look at the
scripts that was released with the

658
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:59,510
Stuxnet CNC servers

659
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:03,050
that's very good in how to strip down
and

660
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:06,450
eliminate information abouts arm

661
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:09,990
what some activities you doing and
mitigating against the risks

662
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:13,760
of unnecessary the blog information arm

663
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,780
other interesting things that they do is
for example they don't call their botnet

664
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:21,089
Obama I they call I ads and use data

665
00:40:21,089 --> 00:40:24,589
they have a very very primitive
interface which appears to be

666
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:28,310
juvenile except that its simply making
it uninteresting

667
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:32,400
to the casual observer I so you

668
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,200
I there's a huge amount to be learned
from the operational activities

669
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,710
of the Stuxnet C&C administrators

670
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:43,260
arm in terms of staying anonymous

671
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:46,540
I'll briefly for governor some
guidelines you want to avoid revealing

672
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:48,750
personal information about yourself

673
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:51,750
any personal information you reveal can
be used to create a profile

674
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:54,780
profile can be linked to a subset of
people

675
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:57,970
on lists so if you're at this conference

676
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:03,410
you are already on lists I can guarantee
it arm

677
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:06,900
so anti profile guidelines these are all
you would think

678
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:11,450
amazing fucking obvious but the game as
you've seen you would be surprised

679
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:15,190
I so don't discuss any personal
information discuss where you're from

680
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:18,690
what's happening what's going on or who
you are I

681
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:21,970
not include personal information online
identities so

682
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:25,900
don't call yourself 5 foot 6 180 pounds

683
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:29,080
white guy 1988 I'd

684
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:32,450
that's a horrible fucking me unless you
actually you now

685
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:35,800
Nana five foot six hundred out like a
arm

686
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:41,670
so avoid avoid creating handles which
are obviously linked to you in some way

687
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:45,370
arm when you're discussing with people
and chats

688
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:49,580
be monitored which is the game all tatts
arm

689
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:53,730
don't reveal things which are personally
identifying such as

690
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:56,870
physical traits your gender tattoos or
piercings or

691
00:41:56,870 --> 00:42:00,460
with you only have one leg for example
home

692
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:03,450
this is why I never talk about my big
penis because it something that can be

693
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:05,730
used to identify me

694
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:10,000
Anna right now mind is the jokes kid

695
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,089
okay arm don't mention your profession
of Israel political activities

696
00:42:15,089 --> 00:42:19,319
again these are things that can be used
profile you and identify you later on

697
00:42:19,319 --> 00:42:22,650
for example these are things that happen
did when he said that I'm

698
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:26,060
he'd been arrested in action recently

699
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:30,040
which was the Republican National
Convention

700
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:33,730
and he was one of protesters got
arrested out of 120 people

701
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:37,270
it's like I look here's one has been
busted for hacking and one who says that

702
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:38,230
he was arrested

703
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:41,339
during this event maybe it's this dude
right

704
00:42:41,339 --> 00:42:44,910
so avoid mentioning things that you've
done identified

705
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:48,150
arm when you are conducting

706
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:53,330
anonymous operations don'ts postings to
clear text

707
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:58,210
right this was used Haveli by that HB
Gary guy

708
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:02,490
name yeah

709
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:06,490
who I he likes to carloads information
between

710
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:10,180
online activities from different
accounts and use that as a contamination

711
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:11,150
source

712
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:14,790
to figure out who was who arm

713
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:18,760
we don't know how actually affected
walls but again it is a source of

714
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,920
contamination

715
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,339
I when you're using an anonymous
activity with

716
00:43:23,339 --> 00:43:27,630
in on this activity arm never ever ever
posts

717
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:31,260
facebook pictures arm even if they are
gorgeous tits

718
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:34,890
you will go to jail on for example your

719
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:38,020
your Facebook link will contain your
personal ID

720
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:41,100
and I'll be linked to your Facebook
account with the fuck your

721
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:44,300
I I another one

722
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:49,310
I am there's a large amount to be said
for keeping very very irregular hours

723
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:53,350
the sole avoids I'll locating in a
particular time zone

724
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:57,260
arm which will gain mitigate against
some

725
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:00,520
geographic profiling arm

726
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:03,880
don't scum don't discuss your
environment such as the elections are

727
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,010
coming up

728
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:09,850
and I really hope thats some political
party wins

729
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:13,319
arm and if you're using a keyboard

730
00:44:13,319 --> 00:44:16,550
which is unique in any way for example

731
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:19,650
anything that is not a pure US

732
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:22,800
like 102 character keyboard don't use

733
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:29,800
special characters I'm a game that will
be used to geographically profile you

734
00:44:30,569 --> 00:44:33,569
and if you think you're awesome are I'm
basically

735
00:44:33,569 --> 00:44:36,660
the NSA was doing before flows in the
eighties

736
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:39,810
hide chances some you want even born yet
om

737
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:44,100
there's no way that you are more than
some

738
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:47,270
however for a long time

739
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:52,430
the end as I didn't really give a fuck
abouts being

740
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:55,550
the number one dog on the Internet
didn't actually matter

741
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:58,660
so like for quite a long time

742
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:01,870
as hackers we thought that we were the
apex predator

743
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:06,760
home and it's just basically that's the
nation states and give a fuck

744
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:10,430
I I'll we have seen that the position
apex predator

745
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:14,960
to Leo leo is law enforcement officials

746
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,290
actually more generally meant in this
case to mean

747
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:21,290
nation-states now give a fuck

748
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:25,040
we just simply do not have the resources
to compete nation-states

749
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,810
on they've got mass much money huge
mounds people and they don't face

750
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:32,150
going to jail the fuck up arm

751
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:35,800
so game

752
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:40,069
shut the fuck up on in terms of
technologies that you can use to help

753
00:45:40,069 --> 00:45:41,220
insure

754
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:44,550
that you maintain good cops ac

755
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:47,980
arm I

756
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:51,650
on the subject a VPN services to our a
lot of people

757
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:55,030
seem to have for that VPN provided

758
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:58,940
anonymity that's not the case you can
provide privacy

759
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:02,130
tour provides anonymity so the
differences

760
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:06,910
app privacy protect your data anonymity
protects you

761
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:10,280
I'm so if you are

762
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:14,520
using a VPN service you have to make
sure that you've gone through tor first

763
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:18,490
otherwise that VPN is simply a link from
the endpoints

764
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:21,600
to you yourself I'm so

765
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:24,700
torture VPN okay bpm to tor

766
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:28,240
go to jail arm

767
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,380
when you're purchasing a VPN the only
safe can see you can use is because

768
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:32,160
mines

769
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,270
Liberty Reserve is monitored by the FSB
I'll

770
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:39,000
where money is a sponsored by the FSB if
not administrated by the FSB

771
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,630
arm you might not care whether the FSB
knows who you are

772
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:45,910
but you probably would be better off
with out

773
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:49,200
them having that information I gain when
you

774
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,839
purchase but Klein's do that on the
overt or arm

775
00:46:52,839 --> 00:46:57,740
if you're looking for VP ends which do
not keep logs

776
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:02,300
check out the sling from arm freak again
I wouldn't actually trust in you those

777
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:04,569
begins said that they don't keep logs

778
00:47:04,569 --> 00:47:07,890
PRQ and more bad are the ones I would
recommend

779
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:10,970
arm the printer is okay except that it's

780
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:14,770
slow as hell arm some a bit more on

781
00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:18,589
the kinds you need to remember but coins
are anonymous but they're not private

782
00:47:18,589 --> 00:47:22,270
so all of the a bit connectivity can be
traced

783
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:25,530
and can be used to connect back between

784
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:28,810
different individuals so make sure that
when you are using

785
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:33,160
your bitcoins you do that in a way that
is not going to contaminate

786
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:36,800
between cover identities arm at

787
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,200
Cameron like use unique wallets

788
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:43,339
and also finish your flight before you
can give your talk

789
00:47:43,339 --> 00:47:46,620
so use mixers to

790
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:49,640
do anything family arm but

791
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:52,930
I don't actually have a good list of
pictures that you can use to make sure

792
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:54,870
that your bitcoins have been

793
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:58,250
mix thoroughly arm that's something I
need to address

794
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:01,760
future but I don't use VPN so it's not a

795
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,760
huge problem for me arm

796
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:08,950
the other thing is you need to make sure
that you feel close

797
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:13,760
so on the enforce a cartoon where he
forgets to enable tore

798
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,920
he gets fucked and the reason is if you
use tor button

799
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,350
or to a browser with these are
technologies that can fill open

800
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:24,640
I you do not actually have a good
backstop I'm

801
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:28,730
that's why I have developed formal I'll
portal is the personal

802
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:32,780
Onion Router to assure Liberty I

803
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:36,800
so got two examples this will be one of
them

804
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,880
this is arm tp-link

805
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:45,220
the are some no 3n I it's tiny it's
awesome

806
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:49,830
I'll this one is and Mr 11 you

807
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:53,560
and it has been chipped so it's been
shipped to have

808
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:58,420
more and more disk space and it also has
an on-board battery that can run

809
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:02,240
four to five hours arm

810
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,790
when you login you get Mike a really
awesome display mask skills

811
00:49:05,790 --> 00:49:09,030
and some and see colors which is pretty
fucking cool

812
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:12,339
arm no logs crime

813
00:49:12,339 --> 00:49:16,950
Obama so portal act as a router between

814
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:20,109
your operational laptop hands

815
00:49:20,109 --> 00:49:23,109
on your your operational console

816
00:49:23,109 --> 00:49:26,350
and arm your your online targets

817
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:29,600
it insures that of your traffic is was
going over to war

818
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:34,080
your are operational machines unable to
actually access

819
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:37,170
the rafter itself account conduct any
administration activities

820
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:40,850
it cannot om login or access and all

821
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:44,710
and any Chaffetz and always be routed
overt war

822
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:48,799
as a result if you're laptop gets
compromised

823
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:51,980
it cannot be used to connect back to
someone else a shell

824
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:55,280
and reveal your IP address arm

825
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,640
similarly when you use operation laptop
should be one that has no

826
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:02,780
radios so no wifi no bluetooth should
have no webcam

827
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:06,420
arm and it should also not have an
online battery

828
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:09,580
so that if the police to come down

829
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:13,150
knocked on the door you can pull the
power plug out and it shuts down

830
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:16,569
now that have to do with your encryption
rather than with

831
00:50:16,569 --> 00:50:19,780
trying to break your online passwords I

832
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:24,150
in this case I use mobile uplink in
thailand is very very easy to get

833
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:27,290
3G connections I can just walk into a
7-11

834
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:30,980
and by any number of SIM cards arm

835
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:34,940
obviously I don't actually do that i'd
semi made to come get them for me

836
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:38,470
are I have her again on a cycle guys
come by them and bring them to me

837
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:42,339
on its lot easier and means that I don't
end up on CCTV

838
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:46,240
purchasing particular SIM card arm

839
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:50,410
by using mobile uplink its safer than
going to coffee shops

840
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:54,359
arm and a coffee shop your wife I can be
monitored by

841
00:50:54,359 --> 00:50:58,970
people on the environment I'll and you
also have the problem

842
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:02,799
that's if your telephone if you've got
your phone with you

843
00:51:02,799 --> 00:51:06,580
and its on I haven't the battery out

844
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:10,710
when you're at a coffee shop if they are
able to backtrack

845
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:14,280
the attacks to that specific I P

846
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,520
during that time frame they will also be
able to correlate that with logs

847
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:21,670
of your phone being at that specific
location during that time frame

848
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:26,060
I'm so your mobile phone can be used to

849
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:31,600
on cover your geographic location if
your IP address can be used

850
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,830
om to all such an OK than those two can
be correlated

851
00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:37,960
you can go to jail arm with

852
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:42,350
portal we had to use some additional
tricks on the earlier versions to gets

853
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:45,990
enough disk space to install so the
unmodified

854
00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:49,810
rafters have only for megs of RAM as our
for maximum

855
00:51:49,810 --> 00:51:53,440
flash and it is not possible to insult
or

856
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:57,270
on for max cuz tort X 1.2 made by itself

857
00:51:57,270 --> 00:52:00,880
and the operating system takes 2.7 and
use

858
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:06,330
because you have no space so arm it's
not actually possible to get war on two

859
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:10,080
on modified router without using a micro
SD

860
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:13,100
my bong in 3G modem

861
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:16,870
you have the arm SD cards configured to
act as

862
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:19,910
overnight device which gets Union
mounted and you can have

863
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:23,960
between two and 32 gigs of disk space

864
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:27,040
which is excessive on a router

865
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:31,850
but om you know maybe you want to run
but aren't as well

866
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:35,650
the this is the harm in this country
supported the Mr 11 you

867
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:39,930
and the Mr 30-40 arm I recommend these

868
00:52:39,930 --> 00:52:43,069
are fairly small have a non on-board
battery

869
00:52:43,069 --> 00:52:46,280
arm the company carrying case

870
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:49,850
you can get the many carrying case like
this pretty awesome

871
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:55,170
%ah the Mr 3020 Sox it's basically the
703 bit bigger

872
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:58,930
arm was nothing else and the 703 is time

873
00:52:58,930 --> 00:53:02,220
which is awesome arm

874
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:05,230
they both have USB I you can hit

875
00:53:05,230 --> 00:53:08,819
out my get help put up some more
information about its

876
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:12,569
its not actually complete yet but it
will be soon

877
00:53:12,569 --> 00:53:16,370
so arm that would be the technology to
use

878
00:53:16,370 --> 00:53:20,230
fides initial our now working on another
project for our

879
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:23,400
developing and operational

880
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:27,069
an operation consul that would then use
when you're doing actual

881
00:53:27,069 --> 00:53:32,000
online operations I'm probably going to
use Raspberry Pi for that because

882
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:32,630
families

883
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:35,799
gets passing conclusion

884
00:53:35,799 --> 00:53:39,109
you can be you can be a criminal

885
00:53:39,109 --> 00:53:42,920
you can be famous but you cannot be a
famous criminal

886
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:46,680
shut the fuck up

887
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:50,319
other any questions

888
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:54,130
no I'm that awesome

889
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:57,240
cool I'm thank you

890
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:04,240
are by time FX

891
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:07,320
I would stick woods

892
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:10,930
the in in your estimation and the
average cost through

893
00:54:10,930 --> 00:54:14,060
persona arm in terms of time

894
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:17,640
you probably want to invest something
like six months to bring it up

895
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:22,020
on has been some discussion of creating
a marketplace for just

896
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:25,880
four personas because it is its

897
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:28,910
just really a massive pain in the ass
arm

898
00:54:28,910 --> 00:54:33,300
in times when I'm walk in terms of money
I would nine times I've

899
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:36,660
our time investment and I put into its
to creates a

900
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:39,920
bare-bones persona took me three days
right

901
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,170
i John who fucking Sox I

902
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:46,170
hot now is pain in the ass you cannot
believe

903
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:49,570
arm I've think that can probably be cut
down

904
00:54:49,570 --> 00:54:53,550
by at least one day because I had to do
a fair amount

905
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:56,700
of learning on the go but if you

906
00:54:56,700 --> 00:55:02,470
cuddling my time as Mike based on what I
would charge for doing that you looking

907
00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:04,070
at thousands of dollars per person

908
00:55:04,070 --> 00:55:07,470
i gets like the house love doing it

909
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:10,660
is pretty a pretty pretty epic arm

910
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:13,940
I don't know if for example the

911
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:17,100
like the sweatshops in India good at
like clicking on

912
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:21,770
captures and stuff like that could be
trained to create online personas

913
00:55:21,770 --> 00:55:25,400
basically more filled out spam accounts

914
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:28,750
arm they already have love the
infrastructure for that and if they can

915
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:30,530
be trained to do that and they might be

916
00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:34,260
such a volume all stuff that the

917
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:37,650
price goes down and the an anonymity
goes up because it's

918
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:41,430
again marketplace that's possible

919
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:44,580
I mean if you do it yourself you're
looking at several days work

920
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:48,250
and depending on how you'd thats money

921
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:55,160
for you that must be tens of thousands
of dollars add to list I'll there's one

922
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:55,880
more question a few

923
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:59,780
no yes

924
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:05,270
sorry to credit cards

925
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:08,470
a are prepared credit cards

926
00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:11,600
i'd don't really like them I'll the

927
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:14,820
so the question was was my opinion on
prepaid

928
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:19,110
credit cards so the the issue I have
with the prepaid credit card

929
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:23,290
is the acquisition is inherently unsafe

930
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:27,550
I can even if you just walk into like
local 7-11 to purchase one over the

931
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:28,160
counter

932
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:32,580
you going to be tied to that particular
card via CCTV

933
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:35,910
right so if they do trackback

934
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:40,870
have your picture which is not great and
they have your geographic location which

935
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:41,570
is a game

936
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:45,800
not great see you have to travel to make
sure that it's not from your hometown

937
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:46,700
have to like

938
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:50,120
wear a hat and a hoodie and look like
you're going to mug someone which

939
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:53,960
is going to draw attention is going to
make any more annoying arm

940
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:57,480
you also have the problem that's arm

941
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:01,140
when you use it is tracked and monitored
online

942
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:04,430
so who like I actually prefer

943
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:07,920
Liberty Reserve for those sorts of
things Liberty Reserve

944
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:12,030
like its mantra by the FSB but the FSB

945
00:57:12,030 --> 00:57:15,090
basically doesn't give a fuck as long as
you do not fuck with Russia

946
00:57:15,090 --> 00:57:18,700
right and if you Russian as long as you
fuck with other people

947
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:24,460
again don't give a fuck so they they
have a very very myopic view of things

948
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:25,850
and you can take advantage of

949
00:57:25,850 --> 00:57:29,300
are might not be completely foolproof
but it does

950
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:32,370
provide this level of like it's being
administered by the FSB

951
00:57:32,370 --> 00:57:36,320
FSB is not going to cooperate with
external entities because

952
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:40,500
that's just not what they do and arm as
long as you don't

953
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:44,330
some because in their ten they're not
going to care about you

954
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:48,240
I'm so you can fly under the radar now
on I'm

955
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:55,240
would not be very comfortable with
prepaid cards sign

956
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,330
on that could work so there would be two

957
00:58:05,330 --> 00:58:08,470
to have a mixer

958
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:12,580
or an online exchange for prepaid credit
cards I'm that's something that's ok

959
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:13,660
road could solve

960
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:17,320
as a problem by so if you if you
actually do want to purchase prepaid

961
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:18,940
credit cards that are anonymous

962
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:22,080
you can buy them with Liberty Reserve
from

963
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:25,110
a Russian web sites arm and

964
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:28,160
costs 20 percent more than the

965
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:31,590
online value like that's all cost their
prepaid amount

966
00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:34,690
but it is purchased through American
direction

967
00:58:34,690 --> 00:58:38,930
and it comes from criminals so was
probably not be monitored your day

968
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:43,650
and and South Fork up about your prepaid
credit card shoes

969
00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:46,830
my wife and i won

970
00:58:46,830 --> 00:58:49,880
I wanted to ask a question about

971
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:53,450
children I work a lot with children

972
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:57,440
and when I do I'm like to use a prepaid
credit card

973
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:00,700
what are your thoughts on proxy in
resources through

974
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:04,020
other countries for example and a small
child to get

975
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:08,380
account account on your behalf in
another country arm

976
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:12,140
so I'm basically

977
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:17,510
their is a lot of value to having an
understanding of the geopolitics

978
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:21,260
I'll so I had a friend

979
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:25,510
to got busted for a different tack but
arm

980
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:29,220
what he used to do was hacked the shit
out of Iran all the time

981
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:33,090
he loved he didn't even bother to bounce
'em for he went in there

982
00:59:33,090 --> 00:59:36,960
and his reasoning was there's no way in
hell that the US is going to extradite

983
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,170
someone to Iran for hacking

984
00:59:38,170 --> 00:59:43,310
it's never going to happen right so you
can pack as much as you fucking likes

985
00:59:43,310 --> 00:59:48,010
and no one would care arm if you do some
other things like that so for example if

986
00:59:48,010 --> 00:59:50,900
your Malaysian I'm pretty sure that you
can act should've Singapore

987
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:55,620
with impunity I don't think that you're
going to have to worry too much about

988
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:56,100
that

989
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:59,100
I would recommend doing it but a game
that is

990
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:03,560
that is on arm understands the
geopolitical environment

991
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:07,040
you can use to your benefit I in terms
of proxy

992
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:10,730
to multiple places again I G I recommend
using tor

993
01:00:10,730 --> 01:00:14,290
is sufficiently anonymous to keep you

994
01:00:14,290 --> 01:00:17,850
safe at that level arm if you want a lot
of proxies

995
01:00:17,850 --> 01:00:21,500
you can purchase them from the LD for
Obama

996
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:24,830
the only for bond has been set up I from

997
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:27,910
millions of pots across the world you
can buy

998
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:31,060
again using them to reserve you can buy

999
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:34,360
SOCKS proxies from the only four botnets

1000
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:38,670
from MW proxy dotnet have a and an
online site

1001
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:41,910
actually have a firefox plugin that we
use

1002
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:46,160
arm their proxies for you automatically
so you can just like lick refreshing and

1003
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:46,680
you

1004
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:49,940
proxy sent to you from the pocket pool

1005
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:53,510
arm if you use that as a final hop

1006
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:57,050
I you probably going to be safe because
the pots

1007
01:00:57,050 --> 01:01:00,080
are developed in such a way that no
connections or ever locked

1008
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:04,990
right so you'll be able to choose your
geographic location we're going to

1009
01:01:04,990 --> 01:01:05,430
accept

1010
01:01:05,430 --> 01:01:09,080
your time appoint I you can probably
choose down to

1011
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:12,420
s a particular state or a city in the US
I

1012
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:16,480
awesomely can probably choose a
particular country in Europe arm

1013
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:20,570
you can purchase from criminals who are
a game that will happen again

1014
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:24,530
their logs once they get busted butts
arm you should be doing it in such a

1015
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:26,480
manner that the logs that they can
provide

1016
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:29,560
not incriminates your actual identity

1017
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:33,310
don'ts allow you to go to jail I so

1018
01:01:33,310 --> 01:01:36,410
they have no are monitoring of the
endpoints

1019
01:01:36,410 --> 01:01:40,470
actual traffic goes back and forth a
controlled someone purchased stuff

1020
01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:46,940
your best said you

1021
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:49,890
security for as in Animas

1022
01:01:49,890 --> 01:01:53,340
really arm if you are into badge

1023
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:56,740
like how goodies to all going to be so

1024
01:01:56,740 --> 01:01:59,750
against state actors right so the
question is best be

1025
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:02,820
how secure is for against a

1026
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:07,540
motivated nation-states arm what happens

1027
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:10,790
with Tor is it's basically it's
completely effective against

1028
01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:14,130
a motivated policing agents against Leo

1029
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:18,110
its fine against the nation-state the
tourney at work as

1030
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:22,420
insufficient resources and has
sufficient bad actors

1031
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:25,500
thats um it is not actually

1032
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:29,390
secure so if you're going to have a shot
of the NSA if you do

1033
01:02:29,390 --> 01:02:32,880
really really bad arm plan

1034
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:37,580
and you you do not actually evaluate the
targets you're going after and you pick

1035
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:38,170
on

1036
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:41,350
a state actor that is going to come down
on you like a test

1037
01:02:41,350 --> 01:02:45,940
ton of bricks you will go to jail there
are problems with

1038
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:48,940
for and that's if someone controls

1039
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:52,640
a sufficient percentage of the network
they will be able to monitor

1040
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:55,800
exit nodes and entry points and

1041
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:59,400
that percentages Mike really really long

1042
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,400
I think there's always something like
three thousand nodes in the network

1043
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:07,930
at any one time are you I've heard that
you only need to control one percent of

1044
01:03:07,930 --> 01:03:08,290
them

1045
01:03:08,290 --> 01:03:12,630
to sadistically have a guarantee that
you'll be both engines no

1046
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:16,340
an exit node at some point in time and
you can use that to the mask so if you

1047
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:16,760
can

1048
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:21,490
control 300 boxes was a problem was a
lot more about this cuz

1049
01:03:21,490 --> 01:03:25,910
controls more than 300 X its was a nose

1050
01:03:25,910 --> 01:03:30,010
knows who you are but arm yet so if you
can

1051
01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:33,680
purchased say 300 bps accounts at five
dollars each

1052
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:36,850
then you can set up 1 percent of it or
not work

1053
01:03:36,850 --> 01:03:42,110
and statistically over a month you'll be
able to uncover a large number of users

1054
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:47,370
so towards actually knots superfecta for
what else you gonna do

1055
01:03:47,370 --> 01:03:50,410
you're better off selecting your targets

1056
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:55,780
so that there will not be state actors
now the questions

1057
01:03:55,780 --> 01:03:59,360
how cool

1058
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:06,360
thank you

1059
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:17,100
this

1060
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:24,100
sleep
