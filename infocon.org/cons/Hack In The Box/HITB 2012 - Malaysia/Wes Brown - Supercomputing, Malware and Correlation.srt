00:24:07,989 --> 00:24:13,229
had outbound communication and the DNS
traffic to you this project

331
00:24:13,229 --> 00:24:20,229
still got dish

332
00:24:21,499 --> 00:24:25,799
very interesting

333
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:28,849
I just put IP addresses connected to you
should

334
00:24:28,849 --> 00:24:32,489
HTTP because she all the domain

335
00:24:32,489 --> 00:24:36,039
published I would marry a test our IP
address a cough

336
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:40,479
all such show we collect domain go to
page on what

337
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:44,279
what domain to pass we are at week what

338
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:50,529
all the yuan all were made for that
particular IP address every call up

339
00:24:50,529 --> 00:24:56,619
all other session which of have talked
about IP address one way or another

340
00:24:56,619 --> 00:25:00,159
what rigidity enough top watters
connected

341
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,509
whatever show really hot IP address

342
00:25:03,509 --> 00:25:07,299
and to show which our database now are
you sure enough H

343
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:10,820
you able to see all the coalition

344
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:14,599
Aaron the kart wii general Wii U

345
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:18,019
our goal mister analyzed in heil

346
00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:21,089
war why output Mauer

347
00:25:21,089 --> 00:25:24,219
every day and put it in our data package

348
00:25:24,219 --> 00:25:27,779
we see every and pick up

349
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:31,839
that particular stay all if you should
give us up sharp

350
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:35,460
shot hash actually I'd wish what
demanding

351
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:39,119
or shorter behavior watch which you will
probably far I'm

whether it's what what what about IP
address its buy-out or not

355
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,479
and one most interesting things yeah we
were able to quality

356
00:25:54,479 --> 00:25:58,019
for what IP address booty

357
00:25:58,019 --> 00:26:01,210
depart my wanna reacts

358
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:04,969
but it to connect to restrain I P

359
00:26:04,969 --> 00:26:09,759
act which Arbor we relied you will never
find ish

360

00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,580
my hours for scope H but you cannot are

362
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:21,309
jewish and you got by right and all that
counted

363
00:26:21,309 --> 00:26:26,239
same IP address and then we were able to
make holy ocean

364
00:26:26,239 --> 00:26:30,289
based on the actor said okay 1st
district IP address bar should ish

died I spirit ship it by dark and will
menya

366

what in

369
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:00,740
the next request stream

370
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:04,510
with you poor condition Chamblee extreme
reassembly on on

371
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:07,990
and we are

372
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:12,610
just the star me 100 change then we
ought oh damn

you might what watchmaker switches to
change

379
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:48,510
and you want shortage for the registry
key in our database you can

380
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:52,100
show we are a top quality fish

381
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:55,250

now available she

385
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:12,610
and we how on a patch now

386
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:17,190
extracted from a dish which

387
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:20,350

she does

399
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,559
drop one single artefact were able to
quick

400
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:07,190
on this ago perhaps out she

schroeder Trojan ESP

483
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:51,730
so we

484

uploaded parish of ongoing

485
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:59,910
and analyzed in the sample show

486
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:03,599
our goal its whatever sample Rio some
retarded

487
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,150
you are reported up but very dark on
that sample with an

488
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:10,630
10 minutes I'm more important when
you're able

00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:06,950
and I have a question about the I can
keep up with this

552
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:10,680
the do analyzes so for example after
defecting taking the md5sum

553
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,830
the memory with source check to ensure
about the packing

554
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:16,960
after packing also who taking

555
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,020
samples what happened and later be able
to

556
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:22,660
compared this to the

557
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:25,620
beat the Oreo have like

558
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:29,430
I'll you want on a problem

559
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:32,980
which static an hour here you can't
compare

560
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:36,810
pack sample very easily show

561
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:40,530
our aspin armpit hair bood

562

call pack want me to pick dip

565
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:56,600
he you order for random number generator
Ueshiba Shane behavior

566
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:00,180
coiffed 10 sample able to quell your and

567
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:03,650
use the court thing we of saddam out
amendment

568
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:07,140
show by pumping out the memory

569
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:10,310
We Heart unpacked sample as well

570
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:15,820
and we watched what r artifact show if
you want to download the on

571
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:20,910
unpack sample you can just shopped or
just want it to our fam Paul

572
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:24,570
quick on download it and got your
unpacked at

573
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:27,860
to double and you got your behavior your
child well call

574
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:31,780
against off so I share that with you

575
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:36,380
but you have to actually he hashing I'm
every not only bar

576
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:39,460
we offer to but you have shin on p

577
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:44,110
such show every house up shop at at the
AAA

578
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:48,580
shell headers are going to be the
shining show part doing

579
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:52,520
party hashing both on actual suitable
holder

580
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:56,100
patch got top and doctor unpacking we
can do

581
00:43:56,100 --> 00:44:03,100
bought a coalition based on Oct

582
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:10,290
other

583
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:13,670
so arm give any thoughts about how this
could be

584
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:16,940
used on the in enjoyed platform

585
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:21,410
now ET all of Harlem Archer

586
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:28,410
est window operating system and after
all of Harlem Archer it

587
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:32,310
flame what Hogan a hypervisor Rd

588
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:36,580
barber shish shift push weak points in a
project remembering

589
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:39,680
reisch memory I don't like

590
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,570
memory and we should have extra of a
ship you you

591
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:48,500
re how that whole already every high
when in fact

592
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:51,690
action ish not in how I wonder specific

593
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:55,430
show it to you are Android emulator

594
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:58,480
hope pictured a high-profile issue of

595
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,590
need to be a high-profile of it would be
very interesting to bill or

596
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:06,790
cluster of arm church perhaps
high-profile church because I

597
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:12,040
more performance than actual and
Malaysian we are able to analyze

598
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:16,360
enjoy we just need to take the time to

599
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:20,820
take to at fifty our pick me up shop
point on other engineer to take

600
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:24,220
among orchard your back but then we are
able to take

601
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:29,790
is our faint technique we Windows and
put it in an exact same day dovish

602
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:33,740
show at the other end point now where I
can opt for IP address:

603
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:37,250
and have windows spyware that connects
to the same command control not want to

604
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:38,850
be able to call it based on

605
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:45,850
any other questions for us

606
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:52,869
year

607
00:45:52,869 --> 00:45:56,609
actually what will be the role of matter
analyst as a as a as a person you know

608
00:45:56,609 --> 00:46:00,369
after the system is doing all the things
you do shown as I mean I mean

609
00:46:00,369 --> 00:46:03,960
we be a hotel jobs he really I mean

610
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:07,010
I'm easy lemon when people can do it I'm

611
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:11,450
not only them our analysts to do much we
do not give that magic number

612
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:15,670
with I'm not I'm not intended to put you
are

613
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:18,930
job me no undersized not yeah

614
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:22,140
I'm are but issue is a very important
point

615
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:25,460
we do the rush because we have to

616
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:28,650
we have to analyse a quarter million two
million samples

617
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:31,660
I doubt but what's more important

618
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:34,730
if your wall I'm now a analyzed

619
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:38,420
needs to be looking up actual and power
church

620
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:41,550
become water and power just an alleged

621
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:45,280
they're trying to rush engineer II that
I'm out where

622
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:50,400
and Barack ultimately more beneficial to
whatever company you're working for

623
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,099
being reversed engineer we do all the
hard work

624
00:46:54,099 --> 00:47:01,099
she could be the most interesting thanks
I

625
00:47:02,109 --> 00:47:06,680
um how do you deal wit samples that
require your specific

626
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:09,960
user input a command line parameters

627
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,070
of some sort of user interaction before
they actually do anything

628
