1
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,230
ok face

2
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,160
I

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,000
school

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
space

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,529
according to my clock we still have
about

6
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:35,850
arm 2 minutes left but whoever comes in
late we'll just have to make up for it

7
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,080
arm

8
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,559
as you can see today stocks and title
honorably assure you it secure hack

9
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:45,489
in the Far East note before we get
started on that topic there's one thing

10
00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:46,650
we have to get out of the way

11
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:50,480
and in case you've hurt me its talking
before you know what's coming next

12
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,649
because unless I tell you while %um you
will not wanna really hear what up

13
00:00:54,649 --> 00:00:58,250
what I have to say but if I take too
long to tell you I am

14
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,950
you won't be interested and the way so
here's my introduction

15
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:06,880
in 60 seconds or less hello my name is

16
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:13,080
and I'll a professional that as
evidenced by all of this stuff

17
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,200
11 but I work and travel all over

18
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,909
where enjoy the massive English that
only easier can come up with

19
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:26,229
and i also massively enjoy always
finding

20
00:01:26,229 --> 00:01:29,979
you comparisons to describe the current
state of the security community

21
00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:36,049
if there's anything else would like to
know just ask after the speech over

22
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:38,890
lunch ready wonders if you a stalker is
you can check out

23
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:43,290
observed up to you which is where I keep
things the papers will serve the slides

24
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,450
I'm just in case you miss one so before
we begin when I

25
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:52,780
when ed designed his speech I did not
quite expect how the situation in

26
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,920
eastern Asia would evolve over the last
couple of weeks

27
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,560
so there's this weird thing going on
right now we're even though

28
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,659
Easter Asian countries share after
eighty percent of their culture and

29
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:04,090
their

30
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:07,450
writing and lots of their language years
lot of hate going on

31
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:12,110
over issues that we have nothing to do
with what they're supposed to be

32
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:16,310
now for foreigners perspective and I'm
are not going to take a stance on this

33
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,700
before forced perspective

34
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,049
it looks like everyone involved is going
crazy so

35
00:02:21,049 --> 00:02:24,340
whenever if there's anything and I don't
know who's

36
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,489
what country you're from if you're in
the room I know what country you're from

37
00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:28,599
a few watching

38
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:32,110
this on the video later on of you
reading about this or just looking at

39
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:32,780
the slides

40
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:37,180
if anything of have any other things I'm
going to say is going to offend you

41
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:41,970
then please be offended by that ignorant
white guy don't be offended by any

42
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,110
country you attribute

43
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,660
myself to so in a nutshell

44
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:50,010
please way less love this and way more
of that

45
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:54,900
because I think we can all agree that
that's really cool Asian stuff

46
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,769
well gonna start of year

47
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:01,950
with one of the basic concepts in the
eastern Asia

48
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,110
and I'm gonna call it by its Japanese
name

49
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:08,849
but there's a similar concept and
Confucianism arm

50
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:12,650
it's called the three wise monkeys what
do they do the pictures got up make

51
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,690
clear the three wise monkeys is a
philosophical approach

52
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:19,629
how we should live your life namely
should see no evil you should hear no

53
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:21,360
evil and should speak no evil

54
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,420
no even though the light is shining in
my face I can kinda see it so you're

55
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:29,790
wondering okay why the fuck is this guy
talking about philosophy unhappy talk

56
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:30,150
well

57
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,870
because it makes it kind of interesting
to hack into because people will do

58
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:34,980
whatever they can

59
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:40,010
to ignore you then they give you an
example

60
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:44,310
this is a picture I took a few weeks
back in a big public park in Tokyo

61
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,989
as you can see in the background

62
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:53,049
no one cares so even though there's five
guys dressed up as power rangers

63
00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:54,440
performing all the moves

64
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,430
people don't ask them what they're doing
people to go way people just pretend

65
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,170
they're not there

66
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,530
following the I don't see anything if I
don't tell anything or hear anything

67
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,129
it's going to go away on its own

68
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:09,189
so what are the results is that unless
you force people to acknowledge what

69
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:11,830
you're doing they're just trying to
going to try to ignore you

70
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:15,599
whether that is hacking your and testing
just being weird soak up love

71
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,930
years back as you may notice by lack of
beard took a friend decided we'd

72
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:24,280
try to find out just where the limit
through that phenomena is

73
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,789
so we really want to figure out how far
can we go in public in Japan

74
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:31,610
with hacking before someone would
intervene so

75
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,060
this is a Starbucks in Tokyo and

76
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:38,090
its normal laptop and my knowledge to
back then

77
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:42,479
um unfortunately you can't really sealed
monitor right now it was running wires

78
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:43,110
short

79
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,130
while the running through stuff not
because it was really important but

80
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:49,710
because that comes closest to what most
people see the Matrix movies

81
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:53,400
think packing is all about ride lot the
scary characters flashing

82
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:58,710
your screen so sitting in a public
affair running wires shari

83
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:02,470
probably won't get you any issues either
in Europe or in the states you too

84
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:07,380
but so would be to this and we kinda up
to the little notch

85
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:13,160
no I'm not sure how good the resolution
is the tee shirt says I read your email

86
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,139
still no one really reacted so we had at
the sunglasses

87
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:21,440
and since that didn't do it replace the
small black

88
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,570
think that with a huge sliver think that
with only sticker on it

89
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:29,729
and since that didn't getting rich
either with an added 23 decibel on the

90
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:33,509
directional antenna

91
00:05:33,509 --> 00:05:39,320
connected by a collects cable into a
PCMCIA card

92
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,860
now the more security savvy about you
may notice a couple

93
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:46,139
indicators that something bad is going
on this page you know like the

94
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:47,610
sunglasses shirt

95
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:52,419
laptop and the antenna but we kinda
figured okay this paper Japanese right

96
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:54,289
they may not be able to read the English

97
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:59,090
and we left them in maybe so the symbols
just don't work the same way around here

98
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:03,150
so luckily there's some really great
stores in Japan that will print whatever

99
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,979
you want and t-shirt

100
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:11,539
so we made this the says hackers
Japanese

101
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:14,970
and after we set they're wearing this is
think above pictures with this shirt on

102
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,419
about three minutes and

103
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:21,840
finally Starbucks staff employee walks
up to us and he goes if we translate in

104
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,550
English well

105
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:26,069
I humbly apologize but you know I must
ask you to come to leave

106
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:30,080
and we were thrilled right like done we
have found the border

107
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,620
we have found how far we can go in Japan
before they kick us out

108
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,639
yeah the only problem is the reason we
got kicked out had nothing to do with

109
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:40,650
all of this stuff that is shown you the
reason we got kicked out of Starbucks

110
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,690
I'm not making this up is

111
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:49,690
its not allowed to take pictures a
Starbucks

112
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,669
so I'm not sure where the boundary is
they haven't found it yet

113
00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:56,520
they've been working in Japan for a
really long time but there doesn't seem

114
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,919
to be one

115
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,160
now for every aluminium gonna point out
to you today after this we're gonna look

116
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,970
at an exploitation fax because that's
what makes it interesting

117
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:08,210
so for this particular exportation back
if you're going to you

118
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:12,250
them stored doing pens as in japan or
japanese companies or if you're black

119
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,610
hat guy just gonna run attacks in japan

120
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:18,990
you can base screw all of you convert
because no one is going to care anyway

121
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:23,090
just make sure you on camera but people
on the street are not going to interfere

122
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:27,789
fall make your you can have cable going
into the hotel's PBX system

123
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:31,050
the one stop you still

124
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,229
right so you're sitting there in people
will stop you but you still have this

125
00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:35,270
feeling that

126
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:39,900
they cancel kinda see you rights that's
uncomfortable

127
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:45,169
so it would be really nice if we had one
of these

128
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:50,020
and historical evidence abounds that
they used to be very popular in Japan

129
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,199
and all over Asia and ily there

130
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,220
even more popular today you can see the
movies apparently there's a huge market

131
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:02,800
around them because you can also buy
them on Amazon

132
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,310
for only 40 bucks do that sounds like a
good deal unfortunately yes

133
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:13,310
as for the review revealed they don't
seem to be very effective

134
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:20,270
so what if I told you that as long as
you stay within Japan

135
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:25,090
there is actually see a cloaking device
that will make you absolutely invisible

136
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:29,289
to ticket gate people please people who
may

137
00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:33,520
talk to you for social violations
auditors home security

138
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:38,110
there is one you can buy it you can buy
anywhere in the world

139
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:41,169
here's mine

140
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:45,180
if you put on a suit in Japan basically
become invisible when I see invisible

141
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,000
let me give you some numbers for this

142
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,540
so bad requirements corporate badges
going in anywhere conference badge is

143
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,760
anything like that

144
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,019
no one is going to ask you security will
not stop you if you're the guy wearing

145
00:08:56,019 --> 00:08:57,510
suit

146
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,519
if they do stop you come back thirty
minutes later poor the cell phone and

147
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:02,850
talk really loud in English

148
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:06,080
and suddenly you're too scary for anyone
to approach um

149
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,540
in my personal case and reduce the
number of run the police ID checks from

150
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,209
once a month

151
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:14,980
never so in Japan police actual out of
your foreigner to check for you for

152
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:18,330
under strange lady and it's usually
quick quick quick process let's look is

153
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,620
bothering you

154
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,620
Ahmed virtually that's a get away with
any bozos

155
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,580
violation you once if you ever wanted to
you know standard public place scream

156
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,779
loudly then

157
00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:32,990
wear suit this also works in South Korea
interestingly but kinda works

158
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,399
differently in South Korea

159
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:38,470
go to South Korea the suit will really
affect you as well

160
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:42,140
however I wouldn't really call the the
invisibility cloak I would call the arc

161
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,620
look

162
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:47,290
because what does is suddenly and this
is mostly for males for girls this

163
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:48,930
doesn't particularly work but

164
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:52,940
foreign girls lovely have an issue in
Korea to begin with um

165
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:56,320
people in restaurants will give start
giving you service was a service I mean

166
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,010
anything

167
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:01,260
that goes beyond whole and ho

168
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:05,269
it will also lead to the natives being
about truth prices meant as much willing

169
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:08,830
to try to communicate with you in any
language they may be able to speak

170
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:12,760
itself real screaming for the next
person come to the counter at Starbucks

171
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,620
strangers will take you two locations
and carry your stuff

172
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,970
this sounds scary but this has happened
to me literally every time I've

173
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:23,610
Korean the suit so what happens is if
you walk outside and you wear a t-shirt

174
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:26,350
go yeah I don't know where this is can
you help me

175
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:30,290
people have this tendency to do the
monkeys and just turn around and walk

176
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:32,120
away

177
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,910
if you were so they will take you there
because they can't explain it to you so

178
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:39,410
they just literally take your hand in
their walk you wherever it is

179
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:42,160
the other thing that happened repeatedly
is that you know you're standing at the

180
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,279
airport and yet these

181
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,779
you have a a stairway and have your
suitcase you leave one downstairs

182
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:49,290
because you can't really carry
everything at once and some random guy

183
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,269
with this walkout take your suitcase

184
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:54,540
carry it say you know and I stay in
walk-off

185
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:58,100
this never happened without a suit it
will happen with the suit the last thing

186
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,850
on second to last thing is that you can
actually get a taxi is a single for

187
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,510
white male

188
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:06,560
if you're not wearing a suit this may
take up to 20 minutes

189
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,870
and what's really weird is that the taxi
drivers will actually drop you off where

190
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,410
you wanna go

191
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:17,769
no some of your face are saying yeah but
that's going to the purpose of a taxi

192
00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:21,459
in South Korea at least so what happens
if you're foreigners they won't take you

193
00:11:21,459 --> 00:11:22,490
where you wanna go

194
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:26,040
they'll take you to a new intersection
that they see fit and they'll kick you

195
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,060
out

196
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:31,550
because and I quote I'm not racist but
your for dinner and I'm just not quite

197
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:35,959
sure what you're going to do

198
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:39,529
so insured a few hours whether or not
you were Sudan in korea

199
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:42,579
for as as a male it seems like you're in
a completely different

200
00:11:42,579 --> 00:11:45,990
country compare to not just wearing a
civil clothing

201
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:49,920
now we've seen that we have these weird
facts we go to Korea and Japan

202
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,290
suits but why is it so there's two
things in play you know once the swarm a

203
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:57,180
fact which basically set something

204
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:01,250
common every animal humans include which
means if something looks like me and if

205
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,860
I don't stand out at the group

206
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,790
I'm going to be integrated people just
don't forget about me and they're gonna

207
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,570
be nicer because I look like them

208
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:11,300
now here's what a typical morning
commute looks like in Japan

209
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,470
noticed a pattern and use the same thing
in korea

210
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:18,930
which is a church session against suits
so you were sued

211
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:21,889
showing off your integration you can't
really wear the traditional clothing

212
00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:23,910
because no one wears those anymore you
gonna stick on a

213
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,339
mormon fewer suit you look like everyone
else you not threatening

214
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:31,279
the more important thing is the class a
fact

215
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,029
now this is not as it may seem about
classes like

216
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:38,560
lower-class middle-class upper-class
yeah forget about that

217
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,940
for the from the perspective of Eastern
Asians from

218
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,970
1 I've seen there's three classes of
orders

219
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:49,200
there's military people its last one

220
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,380
know if you're group in military because
I'm anything you're a big guy you look

221
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:57,760
like a military guy you talk like a
military guy basically you're screwed

222
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,019
because military scary in all the
newspapers for some reason

223
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:06,180
gang up to say you know if if a military
guy in Roppongi Hills

224
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:10,160
froze up and beat someone you can be
sure it's going to be in the newspaper

225
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,170
the next day

226
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:15,889
so if your group in the military just
scare you kinda shady and no country in

227
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:17,810
the world really like the formative

228
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:21,839
on the matter what we pretend alameda
how practical it may be at the moment

229
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,480
the second category in a nutshell our
English teachers

230
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,440
it was English teachers that could be
any kind of for language you could be a

231
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,380
French teacher

232
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:35,160
France I'm the if you fall in there
you're not going to be scary you going

233
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,010
to be okay

234
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:40,089
the problem is that from the perspective
of latest your some dude

235
00:13:40,089 --> 00:13:43,820
and they're using their mitts with mid
to late 20's early 30's you some guy in

236
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,389
that age range

237
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:49,600
was only major life accomplishment up to
this point has been to master if

238
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:55,440
native tongue so you're not particularly
considered a good match for any specific

239
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,570
occasion

240
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,870
less the the three categories is
business know what I say business I

241
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,510
don't mean people actually do business

242
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:06,639
I mean people who is a skilled workers
or you know who have money or in any way

243
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,630
people were involved with actual work
that require some sort of skill or some

244
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,790
sort of investment

245
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:15,139
and you really want to fall into that
group why

246
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:19,250
well first off you're not really scary
there's not many negative stories told

247
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:23,029
about you there's no bankers care going
on East Asia at the moment

248
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:28,420
arm the other thing is that once you if
you're not negatively impacted by

249
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,370
stereotype

250
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:34,079
you're very like to be impacted
positively by Lotte on the stereotypes

251
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,630
are basically once you get the negative
stereotypes I love the way

252
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:39,779
you can access issue which pool of
positive stereotypes

253
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:42,920
especially if European because if or
American

254
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,170
is every movie that's out there I love
the movies all of the

255
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:49,630
cartoons all of these sitcoms that the
import

256
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:53,709
they have these cool white people going
around right so if you if you mash a

257
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:55,199
fall in their

258
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,490
you're good people will be really
friendly you also kinda fall into that

259
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:02,010
category over there

260
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:05,690
but with the suits triggered also works
in hong kong you just look like another

261
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:08,029
banker no one cares what you do because

262
00:15:08,029 --> 00:15:11,560
everywhere know how to exploit that

263
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:18,560
some it's actually kinda straightforward
to do it like this

264
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:22,430
and if even though he wearing the suit
you talkin loud English and Europe using

265
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,220
everything actually so for

266
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,250
all over that fails

267
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,410
then use the so called on former cart

268
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:34,269
here's how it works one explained to you
by example

269
00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:38,290
I took a trip down to Osaka couple of
years back with a buddy of mine

270
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:41,970
and we we took the sink on sandwiches a
super express train it's really really

271
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:44,509
expensive its like 20 bucks one way

272
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:48,079
and we got you get one ticket for going
into another ticket for coming back in

273
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,500
I was you know sleep a slight
inadvertently

274
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,670
delegated my at my return ticket so what
happened well

275
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:59,680
we figured that out we try to leave so I
got my body was a native Japanese person

276
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,209
walk up to the gate to the to the

277
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:05,259
no ticket counter and say yeah you see
my friend over here

278
00:16:05,259 --> 00:16:08,470
you sleepy so in value-added ticket

279
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:12,199
and now he can't use it anymore and
could you please give us a new one

280
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:15,959
and the answer was well we could do that
but it's going to take us about 24 hours

281
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:19,470
to verify what that's true right we're
gonna go to the gate we gonna see if

282
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,949
it's all to get this and that

283
00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:24,070
and so on and so on and so on

284
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:28,550
so we didn't have that time so week I
just asked to go to another one try

285
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,529
something else

286
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:33,959
so he walks up to a difference ticket
country goes well

287
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:37,800
yep this friend my friend is canvas for
nydia

288
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:42,800
and being the four nydia that he is he
just lost his return ticket

289
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:48,019
and they reply was yes no problem is a
new one

290
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:51,170
we're gonna come back to this in a bit
because it it's really

291
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:54,620
this is your last line of defense so
were gone

292
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:58,120
look at Max's home in security why that
while

293
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,380
I have this basic approach that if
anyone has access to your home

294
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:06,139
it work machine your server or your
fridge you screwed

295
00:17:06,139 --> 00:17:08,860
so if you look at home security is
pounding bass look at two different

296
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:12,389
categories of homes yet the apartment
category over here

297
00:17:12,389 --> 00:17:15,409
um and you have the mansion category now

298
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:19,079
apartment mentioned on really mean what
they mean to western people or even the

299
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,419
other Asian people

300
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:24,160
um an apartment is basically a cheap

301
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,410
in terms of rent and construction
apartment

302
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:31,559
mostly built out of wood and paper and
they're not guarantee to was strongest

303
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:34,679
withstand a strong airport am earthquake

304
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:39,140
um to the contrary you actually sign a
closet if an earthquake a boss

305
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:43,200
level or mega 26 should strike that you
acknowledge that this building will

306
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,530
actually collapse

307
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:48,669
so they're cheap form of living arm and

308
00:17:48,669 --> 00:17:53,010
if you wanna know about security there
there is no security

309
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:56,030
so this is how you windows locked

310
00:17:56,030 --> 00:18:00,299
which you know its isolated with rubber
so you can just put a coat hanger

311
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:02,570
through the red open it without damaging
it

312
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:05,640
but doesn't really matter because this
is the window and if you have a rock you

313
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,510
can just throw it in a second anyway

314
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:11,539
um if you look around well then there's
some hope over here

315
00:18:11,539 --> 00:18:15,580
so this Windows obviously closed off
with the rail

316
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,679
which which is very nice it brings up
the question

317
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:22,230
why they took the least accessible
smallest window in the entire apartment

318
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:26,030
to wired up instead of let's say this
big one

319
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:30,720
I figure it's so they won't ruin my view
of the other apartment that's five cent

320
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,580
50 centimeters away

321
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,000
but there's a bit much bigger problem
here so we've seen

322
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,660
the the wild wind now now let's take a
close look can anyone spot a flaw in the

323
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:45,260
security design

324
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:48,470
yes let me introduce you to my mind you
leave hacking tool

325
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:54,809
this one arm and yes you can take it off

326
00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:59,570
you'll you gonna door lock on that one
it's it's fairly static you like that it

327
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:00,039
takes

328
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:04,130
about a minute to pick not that I tried
because that would be legal

329
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:08,490
but wanting to give you some confidence
is that the rental agreement will always

330
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:09,900
have a class like this one which says

331
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,450
you know what to prevent crime we've
actually attacked the skis

332
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:16,450
and no locksmith lot make a copy

333
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:19,539
so if you look at you go while we know
that such kind of nice because now only

334
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:21,789
really hardcore criminals will have the

335
00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:25,270
exit technology to copy the keys now

336
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:30,600
unfortunately any of the stores I tried
non really cared

337
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,370
you just walk in and to go hey I would
like a copy of the ski and the guy at

338
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:37,860
the counter we'll ask you sir are you
aware that this key is copy protected

339
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:44,130
you say yes oh yes okay

340
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:47,940
now let's move on to the mansion time
the mansions I'm .1 you let me to send

341
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:48,190
it

342
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:52,049
at least one of your kidneys to afford
it and externally constructed their

343
00:19:52,049 --> 00:19:55,100
earthquake-resistant they're actually
based on the model of basically a giant

344
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,429
frying pan and the ground on which the
actual building stands

345
00:19:58,429 --> 00:20:02,340
um their sentry locking the of income
security services

346
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:06,620
now on the first view these a really
nice was a cutie perspective because for

347
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,299
example here's a key

348
00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:12,620
it's a bomb key my current place I'm not
gonna show you the full bomb

349
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:16,950
arm the other security system installed
is that you links to a central

350
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:20,179
I'm company that serves surveilled your
apartment a couple of sensors and

351
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:21,049
they'll come

352
00:20:21,049 --> 00:20:24,059
it also alarm buttons on their to call
directly

353
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:27,659
you have double locks on the doors
regimental foresee can easily take them

354
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:28,190
in

355
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:31,409
and yet the central lock down stairs and
no one can camp out that if you're

356
00:20:31,409 --> 00:20:32,130
either

357
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:36,110
and the slot actually a arm are you some
sort of Tennessee

358
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:39,150
aft ride to look into it today but we
couldn't get

359
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:42,770
reading out of them but either way
they're they're touching tale so

360
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:45,809
we're finally safe

361
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:50,260
well not quite because be I planned port
I'm not quite sure if you can see this

362
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,179
because the lights are kinda weird

363
00:20:52,179 --> 00:20:56,320
there's this fence to protect the back
entrance

364
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,750
you let me correct myself there's this
fence

365
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:03,230
to correct the back entrance to the
fence is this height

366
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:06,700
and there's is a stepping stone about
this height like next to it so you're

367
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,480
not going to have to jump

368
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,120
you can basically quite comfortably walk
over it

369
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,429
and then once you've walked over by the
way it has the same high security lock

370
00:21:15,429 --> 00:21:16,539
in there so you can just

371
00:21:16,539 --> 00:21:20,299
open it but you you know if you look
over it you take two steps to get to the

372
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:24,390
bicycle engines which does not happen to
be locked

373
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:29,049
so that was true again this is the home
security system itself this one is

374
00:21:29,049 --> 00:21:33,020
interesting because like everything in
Japan including the toilets

375
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:36,289
this thing can be programmed

376
00:21:36,289 --> 00:21:39,450
know if you're down for dinner like me
this can be quite the challenge and

377
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:40,559
here's what happened I'm

378
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,320
move into this apartment and I saw this
I was like wow this is really cool

379
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,030
I'll have something to play with
tomorrow I'm not know I'm not awake

380
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,700
enough to do today

381
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,429
a look at this thing tomorrow so why
didn't know is that the guy who lived in

382
00:21:52,429 --> 00:21:54,049
the apartment before me

383
00:21:54,049 --> 00:21:58,340
have program this thing and the
management company did not find the

384
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:02,070
you know required action to reset it
standard factory settings

385
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:06,150
so the guy lived there before me at this
really really brilliant idea

386
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:11,240
get this idea that if it's after 1 a.m.

387
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,140
and your lights have been out for more
than 20 minutes

388
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:19,100
and your doors are locked you're
obviously either asleep

389
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:23,919
or you're gone so if anyone at that
point to try to open the

390
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,159
yeah balkan the door that must obviously
being the men

391
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,429
you know an attacker or kidnapper a1m

392
00:22:31,429 --> 00:22:35,000
so the alarm system was set to base

393
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,669
dispatched to swat team to my apartment
without verification

394
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:44,090
if the door should be open after 1 a.m.
you know

395
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:47,130
and my life would have been out of work
for more than 20 minutes now

396
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:50,299
you know no normal person would do that
unless of course you're twentysomething

397
00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:53,850
white guy who just moved to Tokyo after
a couple of years and decided while it's

398
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,419
such a lovely night I wanna have a drink
out there

399
00:22:56,419 --> 00:23:00,549
overlooking the beautiful scenery open
the door the alarm system goes off the

400
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:02,700
men tackled Japanese was going

401
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:06,010
for intrusion prevention system
activated intrusion prevention system

402
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:09,780
activated 20 seconds later my cell phone
rings

403
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,539
and there's male voice going yes sir
someone is breaking into your apartment

404
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:13,640
we've just

405
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,789
this past the SWAT team

406
00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:19,850
okay so I tell you know do that was me
you know I'm

407
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:23,309
I miss that I open the door it's me you
can trust me goes no no no we can't do

408
00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:25,179
that because we know what one

409
00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:28,630
there's a kidnapper in your home in is
holding a gun to your head

410
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:33,539
right his force you to say this though
we have to come

411
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:36,700
you know and I appreciate that because
that's obviously right thing to do

412
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:40,330
deaths at 3 a.m. the morning after go to
work the next day and I don't really

413
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:41,690
feel like having a SWAT team

414
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:44,710
searching my apartment for hidden
shooter

415
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:49,480
so I bust out the dumb for dinner card
stuff trying to explain and like you

416
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,530
know why as low as go dude

417
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:56,360
ok luck and let me talk to you directly

418
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:00,500
I'm German I just

419
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:04,590
yeah I just didn't know with this
five-second pause after which the guy on

420
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,029
the other side of the telephone got

421
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:10,429
I welcome 3i will call them back so also
if you're kidnapper and

422
00:24:10,429 --> 00:24:16,090
ever want to get rid of them just
pretend to German apparently it works

423
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:18,740
and no matter if you live in an
apartment or mention one of the other

424
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:22,270
central parts you a little run into is
this thing it's it's male

425
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:26,260
its mailbox now the threat you gonna
call the road there babe

426
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:29,960
number combination locks the rotation
locks with 10 digits each

427
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,250
now we're going to look at how you can
basically if

428
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:36,980
reduced efficiency of a lot 20 in only
four steps

429
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:40,140
because if we look at the docking itself
right women and entropy about

430
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:43,400
the twenty by the potency of eight how
to come up with this number well we have

431
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,179
20

432
00:24:44,179 --> 00:24:47,559
numbers we can select right turn left
turn 10 digits

433
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:51,210
and an average person obviously can
remember phone number which is a digit

434
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:54,570
so this is a conservative gas of course
if you want you can remember much longer

435
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:56,169
combinations

436
00:24:56,169 --> 00:25:00,140
now here's what Japan ill 20 the potency
of a good luck

437
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:04,909
you know crack that lock your prior much
better chance just breaking it open

438
00:25:04,909 --> 00:25:08,419
so the country of Japan that's really
really smart decisions to chew to

439
00:25:08,419 --> 00:25:11,510
address the obvious problem of a secure
lock number one

440
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:15,150
is legally prohibited for any lock for
the rotation of the mailbox

441
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:18,980
more than three digits

442
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:22,330
I drove it was 11 and trippy aflame by
three

443
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:25,980
if number to legally force all locks to
open in a clockwise clockwise

444
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:29,710
counterclockwise pattern

445
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:33,830
all right we're so it's thousands and
number three was kind of kills it is

446
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:39,490
legally force the first two digits of
the combination to be the same

447
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:43,150
now those if you're a good with math may
have figured that

448
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:47,770
where at this point down to a hundred
combinations

449
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:50,779
now the fourth quarter that's not the
government's fault if the former people

450
00:25:50,779 --> 00:25:53,340
build these locks there's no crank that
you have to activate

451
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:56,760
look good no but the push so if you just
put on the block

452
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,230
try at some point mailbox just gonna pop
open if you play the right amount of

453
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,320
pressure

454
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:05,850
so Iran's attacks and to do a full
rotation takes about 1.5 seconds to try

455
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:06,730
combination

456
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:10,549
you do Forte should go to one digit so
if we do in math

457
00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:14,470
we end up with a 50 percent elections
and 75 seconds and 100 percent elections

458
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:17,909
and 150

459
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:22,340
but this is action not the worst part so
there's a fairly large

460
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:26,690
arm month the apartment rental company
in Tokyo which shall remain a name for

461
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:27,600
this purpose

462
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,039
the death had the pleasure of living
with twice several years apart

463
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:35,240
now on the would kind of person
remembers

464
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,770
Colts 44 old credit cards and phone
numbers that I use ten years ago so

465
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:43,450
I still remember my my my lucky for my
mailbox moved in there again early this

466
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:45,150
year for a couple of months

467
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:48,330
in the phone very curious that my
mailbox in a completely different area

468
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:49,490
of town

469
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:52,890
had the exact same coat so

470
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:55,370
but I figured you know there's only
other combinations so the collision

471
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:56,330
chance that you

472
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:59,529
quite rational so I asked the the land
while the the

473
00:26:59,529 --> 00:27:03,120
real estate agent lady and she told me
that well no that's that's not

474
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,440
coincidence

475
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:09,760
all of our mailbox have to think oh

476
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,510
when asked her if she doesn't consider
that that may be a bad idea ever answer

477
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:15,120
was in a quote

478
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,740
Yemen who would try that

479
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:24,710
not me that's for sure jumper Korea for
second so we're seeing

480
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:28,640
the the maalox in Japan to go take a
look at common locks and create for

481
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,299
second not necessarily male

482
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:34,690
they look like this to pin code locks
arm

483
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:38,740
there are sold at your door in of course
if you look at it

484
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,419
again assuming that a person can
remember phone number we get an entry

485
00:27:41,419 --> 00:27:43,860
fee of $10 by the pulitzer aid which is
really

486
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:48,419
hi problem is that even though it'll
almost be slightly take four digits if

487
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:50,909
you look at the benefactors most of them

488
00:27:50,909 --> 00:27:55,120
don't go by of that number so we can and
should be of 10,000

489
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,409
and the real problem is that the vast
majority of them are not wire

490
00:27:58,409 --> 00:28:01,370
to anything there's actually a small
battery inside that you can exchange

491
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:03,480
from inside your apartment

492
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,190
that powers the lock arm

493
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:10,409
and they also told really blocky out
after numerous attempts so it's very

494
00:28:10,409 --> 00:28:13,520
short block up because of course if the
lot looks down for an hour

495
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,750
and lot of kids in the neighborhood are
going to have a really good time

496
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,980
trawling you but just running around
punching

497
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:21,630
red numbers every dollar they find and
then when you come home you lock hells

498
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:25,279
yeah please try again to 48 hours

499
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:29,179
so obviously they can't do that so again
I ran some tests on the average

500
00:28:29,179 --> 00:28:34,070
am amount of time it takes to take out
one combination is about 0.85 seconds

501
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:37,419
overspend 120 so

502
00:28:37,419 --> 00:28:40,630
again if it is a master if it can unlock
chance for sixty on

503
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:44,390
in 66 minutes yeah percent elections a
little over two hours

504
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:47,190
now if this was a mailbox at say that
adequate but this is your apartment

505
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:51,500
right this week your passport as we keep
all the important stuff of attack

506
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:55,960
your money if you had if you store at
home so in that context two hours to

507
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,919
crack the lock

508
00:28:56,919 --> 00:29:00,409
without any sign it's not a good idea
now

509
00:29:00,409 --> 00:29:03,649
of course the fact that block the
battery case on the other side

510
00:29:03,649 --> 00:29:07,120
kind of gives an impression of just how
studio stores are so if you run out of

511
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,870
time just kickin

512
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:12,779
but there's actually a way more
interesting vectors year to to piss

513
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:14,460
people off if you're into that

514
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:18,380
which you can see a few I'm not sure the
slicer pretty bad

515
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:22,980
the recision but it says emergency power
DC nine volt

516
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:26,289
so obviously if your batteries inside
the apartment

517
00:29:26,289 --> 00:29:29,919
and your battery runs out of power you
won't be able to open your door even if

518
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,399
you know the code right so

519
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:35,620
this is brewing method that you can just
take a 9-volt battery by somewhere else

520
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:39,500
old after these two pins up there and
the local drop power from the battery

521
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:43,010
what that tells us however is that those
two pence go directly to the secretary

522
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,779
of that lock

523
00:29:44,779 --> 00:29:48,110
so if you wanna have a really good time
and make it really bad time for a lot of

524
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:50,679
people you got yourself a couple of the
slots

525
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:55,679
high amperage car battery just blow them
out

526
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,110
now the counter exploit that because no
exploitation obviously is

527
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:02,649
I just talked about so for counter
exploitation if you're

528
00:30:02,649 --> 00:30:06,179
having an apartment of these two
countries basically better assume that

529
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:06,470
if

530
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:10,830
so once again your apartment they will
know this is true for all over the world

531
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:11,529
right if you have enough

532
00:30:11,529 --> 00:30:14,640
resource in power you can get into an
apartment wherever you go but it's

533
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,669
particularly easy

534
00:30:15,669 --> 00:30:19,399
here gonna move onto

535
00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:22,710
truly one of the most fun part this at
least if you like

536
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:26,539
stories that make your here stand up
we're going to talk with corporate

537
00:30:26,539 --> 00:30:28,830
security

538
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:33,140
which means the reason white companies
that you work for that may consult for

539
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,029
the me test

540
00:30:34,029 --> 00:30:37,679
in either country are not really all add
up to speed

541
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,960
holes with security flaws look quite
sure how they could have happened

542
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,360
and any secure the flow yield you'll
find this is

543
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:48,090
also applicable to create about this
mostly for Japan anything you'll find

544
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,850
you have to look at 22 filters

545
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:54,710
to conceptual filters number one's
lifetime employment

546
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:58,409
one nurse left employment well it
basically means the company hire issue

547
00:30:58,409 --> 00:31:00,179
fresh out of university

548
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:04,159
and they guarantee you a mediocre way
it's not bad it's not really gets me up

549
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:05,860
to waste they guarantee you will ya

550
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:09,070
to raise anywhere between three and five
percent year

551
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:13,500
and you cannot be fired or laid off the
company's not legally allowed to

552
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:17,090
their legal instruments exist to connect
this contract your for example what you

553
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:18,669
can do it and

554
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:22,340
if you survive until your retirement
until you die they'll pay you 75 percent

555
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,019
last wage

556
00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:26,380
and if you died you your spouse gonna
get the same amount of money until they

557
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,179
die

558
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:30,590
so you know while it may not be an
appealing model to the hacker community

559
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,890
we do everything

560
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:35,370
ourselves wanna liberalized for people
just one run a family

561
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:38,380
this is an incredibly appealing Mon
people who run and

562
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:44,330
of forget this motivation them the other
concept to look at as bonuses

563
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:47,360
now in those countries are some from a
bonus but usually

564
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,529
either a couple of hundred dollars Wayne
month wage

565
00:31:50,529 --> 00:31:54,519
we have in Japan is that its up to 50
percent

566
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:59,019
a few and I'll annual wage less than 50
percent your boat is maybe twelve months

567
00:31:59,019 --> 00:32:01,130
a few wage

568
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:05,179
so if you get your bonus double if you
don't get your bones you may not be able

569
00:32:05,179 --> 00:32:06,649
to pay your bills

570
00:32:06,649 --> 00:32:10,279
officially this is made to reward good
work unofficially it usually depends on

571
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:10,840
who does most

572
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:14,210
overtime and its its really a tool to
keep employees

573
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:18,580
line because if you want to change
something right you always run thredUP

574
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:22,630
get your bonus because even though we
usually pays to people every year we

575
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:26,049
is not guaranteed to your e in the
contract am

576
00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:30,640
suit the entire thought process of an
average worker it doesn't matter often

577
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,620
if it's an engineer middle management
review upper management Japanese company

578
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:38,809
boils down to don't fuck up

579
00:32:38,809 --> 00:32:42,440
and less I don't fuck up for cop is a
dual worked

580
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,260
requires action as long as you remain
passive

581
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:50,309
you cannot be blamed this is the Suns
which minosos perspective so let's look

582
00:32:50,309 --> 00:32:51,679
at an example

583
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:55,049
if you make okay get your work on a
project right and you make a judgment

584
00:32:55,049 --> 00:32:55,890
call

585
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:59,500
because you see the situation is just
totally clear and there's a protocol in

586
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,190
place

587
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:03,360
but the protocols look perfectly well
defined was to find twenty years ago the

588
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,279
figure you out

589
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:07,159
if we just did this way we could change
is good you know we could save this

590
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:09,230
company millions

591
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:12,649
but something goes wrong something you
did predict you know maybe the country

592
00:33:12,649 --> 00:33:15,970
that tried to do business with had a
military punch something like that

593
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:20,419
as a company incurs small of West a
small loss this could be it

594
00:33:20,419 --> 00:33:25,510
you know ten box its it's enough yet you
screwed up your boat is gone

595
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:28,870
forget about you not gonna get you may
get fired for it because obviously had

596
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,279
the audacity Jack

597
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:34,070
company now on the other hand if you
could add this the prodigal even though

598
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:37,039
it's completely wrong it's completely
obvious that it's wrong

599
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,809
and the company loses millions over this
because you don't you know you refuse to

600
00:33:40,809 --> 00:33:42,779
budge because this is how you do it

601
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:45,990
no matter as long as the company doesn't
go bankrupt over it

602
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:49,049
this is kind of hard to do in Japan
because most companies are subsidized by

603
00:33:49,049 --> 00:33:50,080
the government

604
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:54,140
your promotion will be secured it
doesn't matter how badly you screw up

605
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,480
from a human perspective

606
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:59,330
as long as you don't do anything to
screw up you will get promoted

607
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:02,440
and you will get your your bones and
you'll get all your stuff handouts you

608
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,440
see again

609
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,529
so in a nutshell you don't know don't
work too fast the into 1 a.m.

610
00:34:07,529 --> 00:34:10,779
secured bonus or you can become a
contractor but then you can

611
00:34:10,779 --> 00:34:15,569
outcast let me give an example of how
that she plays out

612
00:34:15,569 --> 00:34:19,020
I'm an example I am going to run you
guys through a fictional penetration

613
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:22,510
test official company not that this had
ever happened to me in person

614
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:26,139
as we get your feedback how he would
react so you go in

615
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:30,750
you fire up and nap you run against the
customer's network and I am

616
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:34,470
you find the windows nt4 box

617
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:37,520
that runs IRC on

618
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,879
on port 3137 now

619
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:47,070
your sim in dollar question how would
you react

620
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:51,200
I know this may be presumptuous but I
would assume the frickin boxes olds

621
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,440
foreign-owned call it intuition so

622
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,550
I told The client that never worked for
um

623
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:01,650
the same thing and their response was
well okay will

624
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:05,170
second that seems like a very serious
issue with knowledge that

625
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:08,589
RC should not be running on a Windows
nt4 box in our corporate network

626
00:35:08,589 --> 00:35:11,730
this was on the Internet by the way in
taking dialing out

627
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:15,339
to other IT service to get commands I'm
will check into it

628
00:35:15,339 --> 00:35:19,320
in two weeks pass and nothing really
happened so

629
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,940
I decide to kind of poke them about it
and go so you know the tire see box

630
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:27,020
the windows nt4 box running whatever
happened to that one

631
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:30,510
here's the reply in verba term

632
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:35,290
with emotion added to express my feeling
at the point where I heard

633
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:38,810
we haven't we have decided against
shutting down or altering the effect

634
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:45,810
machine because the guy was set up no
longer works here

635
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:50,280
and we have no idea what it does

636
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:55,160
but it might be important so we'll just
leave it running

637
00:35:55,160 --> 00:36:02,070
no can any of you spot a flaw in this
approach

638
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:04,700
well as flawed as it may look from the
outside from it from attractive the

639
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,750
engineers are working

640
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:09,790
goes like okay I didn't touch it it's
not obviously horribly broken from a

641
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:11,210
middle-management you'll be okay

642
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:14,599
obviously horribly broken from middle
man spent fuel being means if not on

643
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:15,619
fire

644
00:36:15,619 --> 00:36:19,750
andress eighth of ironing if not
physically bird

645
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:23,369
we tested your application that works
perfectly your the locks for you so

646
00:36:23,369 --> 00:36:24,800
successful test run

647
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,180
we receive the data it was because he
did not

648
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:32,000
call the API within 24 hours

649
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,960
since just telling them wasn't enough we
set up a full-blown meeting with middle

650
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,650
management and we met them in

651
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:40,720
we talk it over and then they requested
the day have some time to talk about it

652
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,900
among each other which seem fair enough
um so

653
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:47,369
three days later the engineers reached
out to us to confirm that we're

654
00:36:47,369 --> 00:36:50,070
absolutely certain that it's not the
result certificate

655
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:54,070
and we confirm that two days later
middle-management results just to

656
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:56,970
confirm that we are absolutely certain
at this and we should be really certain

657
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:58,470
it's not the SL certificate

658
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:02,960
we confirm it and a few days later upper
management reach out to us to confirm

659
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,760
that absolutely certainly not the cells
that have a good weekend from

660
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,570
again make sure Id one important point
this company

661
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:12,810
um was not afraid it was owned by
different companies so even upper

662
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:15,690
management would be sticking their neck
out if they're doing something wrong

663
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:16,810
here

664
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:19,570
and after this the base the request for
more time to think it over among

665
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:24,180
themselves and then we never heard from
again

666
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:29,000
how do you solve this well i can tell
you I saw the two months in

667
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,770
months wrath and what we tried to reach
out to them repeatedly in

668
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:35,930
nothing really happened they didn't even
reply to it at some point the two months

669
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:38,310
and I suggested to developers that

670
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:43,010
just remove the freakin entry number 22
that says maybe your SSL certificate

671
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:46,890
and then call the company and tell them
yet we fix that

672
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:50,349
don't tell them what you did don't tell
them there was an air just say we fixed

673
00:37:50,349 --> 00:37:52,810
it

674
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:56,220
and what happened when the product was
launched the twenty-four hours after

675
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,050
that

676
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:01,770
so again if you look at it from a former
normal the place checklist makes perfect

677
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:02,670
sense again said

678
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:06,760
it says maybe to get so if I you know if
I say if not then we largest anything

679
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,900
else goes wrong I'm so gonna be
penalized for it

680
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,810
the don't put your neck out no one else
but they're not good either the entire

681
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:13,640
operation is

682
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:16,770
labor two months said Larry cost that
particular company thou hundreds of

683
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,130
thousands of dollars

684
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:21,570
until at some point decline which is too
personal the company's consulting for

685
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:22,839
took the responsibility by saying

686
00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:27,170
we fix it and the heir to the shop
anymore so whatever happens from now on

687
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:30,570
I got to keep my job Saudi we exploit
that if we run

688
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:36,520
and tests and in Japan love one can
assume that stuff will be fixed so

689
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:40,510
if you if you find it weird to find NT
four servers running

690
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:44,700
scripture verses then you've obviously
not done very many pen test in eastern

691
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,800
Asia because is extremely common

692
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,690
because what usually happens is someone
FitFlop and they were stuck working

693
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,000
somewhere else and

694
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,859
no one knows what the box doesn't no one
wants to touch it because something that

695
00:38:53,859 --> 00:38:55,250
may happen and then you did

696
00:38:55,250 --> 00:39:00,869
thing and number two is if you can
create a responsibility setting

697
00:39:00,869 --> 00:39:04,280
then no one will disturb you now
responsibility setting something like

698
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,339
this

699
00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:08,170
you know you running a pen to someone
walks up to you cause you know what are

700
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:09,240
you doing here in a while

701
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,540
here on behalf of and is this your until
you get it before

702
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:16,410
find the name of some middle manager
opera manager anyone who outranks anyone

703
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:20,500
building at the moment that cannot be
reached because you're on vacation

704
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,839
would you be responsible when he finds
out that the you disturb me I've never

705
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:29,079
been talked to after that sends

706
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:33,470
jump to wire for second so

707
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:36,790
have any of you can were driving
recently a European city on american

708
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:40,280
city and you've seen all those lovely
wpa2 security

709
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:44,450
hot spots and you remember the good old
days where would find open hot spots

710
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:45,140
everywhere

711
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:48,820
belonging to private people who couldn't
go through the router well

712
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:53,780
the good old days around a life in tokyo
this is the reason screenshot

713
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:58,599
so Iran in place we see that two of them
are open three of them are using WEP in

714
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:00,200
only two of them are using

715
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,670
WPA one EPA to this

716
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:07,579
is not really the worst party at the
worst part if you look at it

717
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:11,220
are these guys so these are the three
major Japanese mobile carrier

718
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:14,930
of bank I you back yet kid local

719
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:17,970
in these guys have serious issues with
air traffic

720
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:22,660
because data mobile traffic has just a
complete exploded over the last couple

721
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,619
of years

722
00:40:23,619 --> 00:40:26,710
so what they did is account with a
fairly interesting system where

723
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:31,930
they just set up wifi hotspot standard
802 booked on the 11 wifi hotspot

724
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:35,490
am and your cell phone if it runs by
with one of the serb with while these

725
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:36,250
companies

726
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:40,530
automatically detect the hot spots
nearby automatically sign you in

727
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:44,359
so if you walk by if you use a soft pink
phone and use in the cafe

728
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:47,980
that has a soft bang hot spot its most
more about all of them

729
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:51,960
your phone on 19 Aug and and then we'll
should all of your data over that

730
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,869
particular hotspot save the company

731
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:57,760
lots of of data traffic um

732
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,750
now this will actually allow you to
connect with computer well that will

733
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,670
allow you to connect but they won't
allow you to get through

734
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:08,940
the router and they fix they do that by
filtering

735
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:13,180
a a mac address and the user agent that
your machine sense was very first

736
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,390
connect through the

737
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:18,550
I'm to the router so as you can plainly
see

738
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:21,910
this is absolutely secure and no one
could ever really

739
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:25,329
break into that and since of Ben try to

740
00:41:25,329 --> 00:41:29,380
to sue the hellos if the last guy
revealed how exactly you breakin

741
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:32,950
I'm not gonna tell you if you have
sniffer set up it's going to take about

742
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:34,579
20 seconds

743
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:38,400
but evil a look at this in Japan really
takes a cake you because this is a

744
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:43,890
screenshot from last year in Korea

745
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:48,420
K one spot a problem

746
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:52,150
if you go to Korea and you do you like
using Skype you don't have to buy data

747
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:56,430
plan or four nights in a row me or
anything just log into one of bonds when

748
00:41:56,430 --> 00:42:00,089
of soul discovered by open of us would
like to some person

749
00:42:00,089 --> 00:42:03,500
now expectation that a yeah I I don't
really know what we could possibly do

750
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:03,849
with

751
00:42:03,849 --> 00:42:08,180
his public open Internet access I'll let
you guys figure that one out

752
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:12,220
but while we're talking about korea I
would like to

753
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:16,300
to ask a question room take or guest
this year

754
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:20,160
what's the browser market share for
Internet Explorer all versions of it in

755
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:20,750
korea

756
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:25,869
South Korea at this very moment

757
00:42:25,869 --> 00:42:31,480
83 you guys you guys are close you may
know something its action ninety-seven

758
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,630
percent

759
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:38,069
let me spell it out for you it's 97
percent

760
00:42:38,069 --> 00:42:41,700
use a graph unfortunately stops in 2010
I couldn't find your one

761
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:45,810
I'm the thing that really creeped me out
personally is if you look up here the

762
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:48,150
dark blue line is I E six

763
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:54,599
it's going up

764
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:57,690
now if you're anything like me you have
facebook probably look something like

765
00:42:57,690 --> 00:42:58,829
this:

766
00:42:58,829 --> 00:43:02,410
one on earth is going on in south korea
with browsers

767
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:05,640
any ideas

768
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,780
this is really funny because when the
state through the big book really

769
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:12,490
no one else ever looked into it am SS L
RTLS

770
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:17,390
what everyone look at it its universal
right we use in every country

771
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:21,010
let me show you this map of the adoption
of the SL standard

772
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:25,099
and do you see the red spot

773
00:43:25,099 --> 00:43:29,430
by the way green means they use SSL
though the red spot is called South

774
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:30,500
Korea

775
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:33,980
LePage do seats cedars and encryption
algorithm

776
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:38,119
developed in 1988 but agree deflect
Security Agency it's a 128 bit block

777
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:38,880
cipher

778
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,569
and to a specific its it wasn't
developed this process is an alternative

779
00:43:42,569 --> 00:43:43,500
Jess L

780
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:47,589
it was actually actually predates Els
public availability in many regions

781
00:43:47,589 --> 00:43:51,829
so what they did is the best he spun off
its entire new algorithm

782
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:55,359
and up to until this day is required for
online banking online shopping

783
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:57,520
government transactions paying your
taxes based

784
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:01,380
any any secure arlen communications
wanna do the Korean company you have to

785
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:02,829
use it

786
00:44:02,829 --> 00:44:06,760
now siege run as active X plugin

787
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:10,410
so unless you're using wooden some
version of Windows and some burst love

788
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:14,420
into exploring you cannot use eat and
your computer based get the grade for

789
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:16,260
toy to look at cats

790
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:19,650
because account building trip to channel
um so

791
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:23,280
Mozilla tried really hard to it to
implement see if they did that there's

792
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,310
still some companies are misled the
government refused to sign with their

793
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:27,490
own keys

794
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:31,250
arm so if you can create you will use
Internet Explorer

795
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:34,940
in this also explains why you six going
up because people were upgrading to to

796
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:37,640
Windows Vista Windows seven at some
later point

797
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:41,460
and had lots of complications because of
course ActiveX company and its kinda

798
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:45,690
30 cents to yet to the OSU running for
people to switch back to XP

799
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:48,520
and since you're a switch back to
figured you had better not upgrade that

800
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:52,079
browser because it may break it again

801
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:55,589
yours on the fact that she is selling
them number 12 said there's a really

802
00:44:55,589 --> 00:44:58,069
really slow dash in new windows witness
we've

803
00:44:58,069 --> 00:45:02,200
rece I'll to have brown the slow asses
are basically useless their perceived as

804
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,160
toys because you can't really do
anything

805
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:08,740
that really working with them am its
integrate with most cell phones as well

806
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,060
the cool thing so

807
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:14,140
if you know it yourself as a unique idea
to tell us your bank yourself was

808
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:16,420
actually able to log into your bank
account

809
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:19,589
and we'll do a two-factor authentication
um

810
00:45:19,589 --> 00:45:23,260
the two-factor authentication is
actually the kicker because

811
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:27,050
many of the of the complications that
seat does are two factors so

812
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:30,770
the the certificates user and are given
out by the government

813
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:34,200
so if you act if you access to see
protected site you become a hundred

814
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:38,329
percent rate it'll

815
00:45:38,329 --> 00:45:41,589
so since you're 100 percent reasonable

816
00:45:41,589 --> 00:45:45,099
people don't really see the need to
secure web applications

817
00:45:45,099 --> 00:45:50,180
because if you gonna hackett they're
gonna know who you are anyway

818
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:54,240
but we're going to talk about this in a
bit again home

819
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:58,069
in a nutshell it if you're if you're
talking with Korean security our future

820
00:45:58,069 --> 00:46:01,859
finds you can't just over there look
into the RC's for seed

821
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:05,069
they're they're very complex it's not a
bad other isn't all it's just

822
00:46:05,069 --> 00:46:08,349
an algorithm that no one ever uses
anywhere outside of Korea which

823
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:09,510
completely replace this

824
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:12,900
within the country is also means that if
you work with cream developer and their

825
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:16,599
writing something for you don't expect
them to know what works

826
00:46:16,599 --> 00:46:19,810
good simply not relevant to their lives

827
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:26,810
in this particular case howdy exploited
12 thought

828
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:31,660
next with a look at it this way I like
to call to near-field communication

829
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:32,869
which is

830
00:46:32,869 --> 00:46:37,460
I am confidence national topic because
if you look at these are just a couple

831
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:38,369
of

832
00:46:38,369 --> 00:46:41,690
near-field communication cards the
majority of those

833
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:45,290
shown you're actually based on the
console is fairly cop

834
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:48,960
model now the japanese have taken this
concept of

835
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,089
of near-field communications and they've
taken it to another

836
00:46:52,089 --> 00:46:55,690
completely different level and I would
like to introduce you to what I think

837
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:58,010
the worst idea in human history

838
00:46:58,010 --> 00:47:02,630
if the NFC enabled Visa cards

839
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:05,880
now this does not actually allowed to
charge your visa but your card has a

840
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:09,470
preset limit the tickets at whatever you
want to get set to tour a box

841
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:13,050
and whenever you card anti-civil
automatically charge no to a box future

842
00:47:13,050 --> 00:47:14,710
card and will be charted

843
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:19,450
did payment cards on in this case three
cards integrated

844
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:23,099
um know if if you try to convince anyone
anywhere else in the world to use a

845
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:26,730
credit card that has NFC enabled the
bills their attitude red carpet look at

846
00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:27,569
the good life

847
00:47:27,569 --> 00:47:31,310
knots the reason why this works in japan
is because

848
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:34,530
the same technologies Oregon around for
years and it's think in the great Indian

849
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:35,599
cell phones

850
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:39,030
so the cell phones has NFC technology
and it's something that would slowly

851
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:39,589
seeing

852
00:47:39,589 --> 00:47:43,599
in the other countries and you can pay
with them and whatever you pay with them

853
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:47,119
gets charged to your phone bill people
already really really

854
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:50,630
used to the concept of you I have this
on the bill that I can

855
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:54,880
no use & Associates is really practical
because I left to do is be

856
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:59,180
so why is this a problem

857
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:02,359
well for sis use virtually anywhere if
you're in Japan

858
00:48:02,359 --> 00:48:06,880
there's couple of stores we can't even
pay in cash what they'll Tennessee

859
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:11,119
popular example the trains if you wanna
get on the train yet to buy a ticket

860
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:14,740
many stations only 2-of-10 ticket gates
will have real tickets like everything

861
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:16,270
else only takes an a/c

862
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:19,940
so you're basically bound to carry this
week our feeling Kyle

863
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:23,170
this week %uh possible already Carter on
with you

864
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:29,559
yet this automatic recharging at six
except by lot all its stores by now

865
00:48:29,559 --> 00:48:32,410
and you need to get a reader like this
one it's a call to feel it carried out

866
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:32,770
the

867
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:36,480
can buy them about box become a driver's

868
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:40,470
release to install and what would weird
thing about the carts is that

869
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:44,690
on the chip they will store your last
twenty-something transactions now this

870
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:46,980
may be anything is maybe something bio
this maybe

871
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:50,079
you were trying to get on it may be
trying to get off so

872
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:53,160
if you would have those returning client
see and you put

873
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:56,809
you get anyone card and then new person
the other

874
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:59,930
you can extract if you like this

875
00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:03,140
um and this is actually not a hacker
tool

876
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:06,430
this tool comes with the reader

877
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:10,140
um so by now what we have we got some
incentive and a/c data is

878
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:14,329
this card or cell phone good location
tracking get purchase tracking

879
00:49:14,329 --> 00:49:19,079
I'm which obviously leads to some
problems down the road somewhere

880
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:22,960
um but what would really make some that
is that if you look at Amazon's AP

881
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,440
you can see that you can actually pay
with your cycle que te di Cortona all

882
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:29,160
you need is the exact same readers you
plug in the reader

883
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:32,339
you go to Amazon you say yeah I want to
buy this egg okay

884
00:49:32,339 --> 00:49:35,880
what do you wanna pay with I want they
wanna see cool will touch your car to

885
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,490
the receiver test your computer

886
00:49:37,490 --> 00:49:41,450
and you've paid now obviously

887
00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:44,589
what we can do with it is we can buy
stuff in other people's taps right so

888
00:49:44,589 --> 00:49:48,530
you open Amazon up on your laptop you
have some sort of sell your connection

889
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:52,450
you go to those to pay take you really
woke up to some guy a doobie

890
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:56,079
because his notification just paid for
it

891
00:49:56,079 --> 00:50:01,339
now I've taken a lot of crap for this
particular point because people always

892
00:50:01,339 --> 00:50:02,460
bring up the same

893
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:06,500
defense they say but Paul feel like a
standard particularly

894
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:09,369
specifies that to prevent this we're
only going to allow this across

895
00:50:09,369 --> 00:50:10,050
millimeters

896
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:13,430
private readers so they they can to
centimeters with with commercial

897
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:14,000
breeders

898
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,140
but individually can only get readers
that allow you to read these cards for

899
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:18,920
about two or three millimeters away

900
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:22,099
and you couldn't possibly get that close
to another person

901
00:50:22,099 --> 00:50:26,050
without him noticing it's just
ridiculous um

902
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:29,109
know anyone who believes this is
obviously never take the morning commute

903
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:31,890
re in Tokyo

904
00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:36,510
because this word looks like in this is
not stick

905
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:40,880
this is fairly common on the satellite
friends

906
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,160
rapidGator Express

907
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:46,670
it only comes every 20 minutes so if you
miss it will be late for work

908
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:53,670
in this so that make sure that everyone
gets on the train

909
00:50:54,030 --> 00:51:01,030
obviously the print the inside fresh
highs opposing

910
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:06,839
for anyone who wants to tell me that in
this setting I couldn't possibly get

911
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:13,839
within three millimeters of disguise
versus wallet

912
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:22,359
they were almost done

913
00:51:22,359 --> 00:51:26,059
issue 1 really should have emergency the
next morning

914
00:51:26,059 --> 00:51:33,059
every three suitcases fun

915
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:38,460
alright I think we've confirmed that
with this technology in a little bit of

916
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:41,660
evil spirit we can do look a stick we
can to purchase track

917
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:44,700
weakened by seven other people FAFSA but
simply abusing a rush hour in the

918
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:45,089
morning

919
00:51:45,089 --> 00:51:49,720
now we got eight minutes left I'm going
to use them

920
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:54,820
I'm should work perfectly through after
I've shown you all this cool stuff that

921
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,020
we can do in all these weird

922
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:59,119
factors because some up a little we
gonna look at the top what I like to

923
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:00,310
call it off three hitless

924
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:05,900
which is basically the top three things
i've seen in the last six years

925
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:09,710
seven years that maybe go

926
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:13,630
haha and then I'm allowed to disclose
because they're not under NDA anymore or

927
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,119
because they never were to begin with

928
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:18,859
number three is those harmless it's
called airport security

929
00:52:18,859 --> 00:52:22,099
now if you could not eat airport we
check in

930
00:52:22,099 --> 00:52:25,099
you have to put your passport on a
certain reader which reads the chip

931
00:52:25,099 --> 00:52:25,680
inside

932
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:28,760
is already chip enable password you'll
check whether your chip

933
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:32,220
way past was practice I know love the
stuff so this is the machine

934
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:35,460
it's it's very nice it also text you in
if it finds you

935
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:39,830
I'm so this thing handles of your
passport data right so

936
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:43,280
want when I find slightly under being
was watching it boot

937
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:49,470
because this came up well for more on
irving is that the very day I took that

938
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:50,170
picture

939
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:55,770
was the day where every and as your day
remote your day was published for XP sp2

940
00:52:55,770 --> 00:52:59,680
so we know that the box was hackable at
that particular

941
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:04,440
point number two is what I like to call
the ultra secure JavaScript

942
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:09,170
which is the technology of employed as
palestinians couple of times is just one

943
00:53:09,170 --> 00:53:09,790
example

944
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:14,000
so the the a router you to login to use
it

945
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,980
it sits down around her and was actually
use the pair outer in the cafe so they

946
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:18,440
said

947
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:21,630
know if you are using Internet please
and your credit card details here so

948
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:22,470
disfigured well

949
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:26,980
I'm kinda bored let's look at the source
for this your source

950
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:30,089
can anyone spot a flaw

951
00:53:30,089 --> 00:53:36,460
let me give you a hint if this part of
Dallas could that says bar passwords

952
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:39,820
it gets worse it's bar password if
password

953
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:44,560
Eagles this then call the function send
login so the entire

954
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:48,849
authentication was done in javascript
and this is a run-of-the-mill stand

955
00:53:48,849 --> 00:53:52,260
router produce place US-japanese
manufacture for hours

956
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:56,580
this is not a fluke this is there are
tens of thousands of these things

957
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:57,280
deployed

958
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:01,940
and we all know of a broader firmer skin
updated um

959
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:06,220
but this is nothing compared to the
grand finale the grand finale is

960
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:09,869
happened while working for Japanese
company consulting for them

961
00:54:09,869 --> 00:54:13,690
in in the mix of development security
efforts and

962
00:54:13,690 --> 00:54:18,480
they ask a green company forward to you
to provide them with us of course in a

963
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:21,560
green company would develop it so

964
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:24,940
no they gave them the contract and the
Greens looked at ago ok

965
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:28,339
we know how this works so they develop
it

966
00:54:28,339 --> 00:54:32,089
and they send it back to us no declined
remembers that I have a security

967
00:54:32,089 --> 00:54:34,500
background does he know what can it can
you test as you know

968
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:37,820
you know we know you're busy but just
taking a twenty minutes just

969
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:41,330
given iraq lock so what I do is

970
00:54:41,330 --> 00:54:45,270
some a good luck in from the hit shift
in the hit the number old one

971
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:49,060
the head entering the server comes back
with am sick will query

972
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:52,240
uproot up record cannot be found because
more from any query

973
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:57,020
okay there may be something wrong here
it turns out the thing

974
00:54:57,020 --> 00:55:00,180
is is an absolute catastrophe unless
Africa tester fee

975
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:03,760
the damn vulnerable web ap prototype kit
that you

976
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:06,930
practice the web attacks against would
be considered secure

977
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:10,609
against what would these guys delivered
so we had read

978
00:55:10,609 --> 00:55:13,690
everything with are I would alf I would
axes ass

979
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:16,780
we had sequence action in the main page
sequel was like

980
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:21,690
sickle course when filter at all but my
personal favorite was the fact that it's

981
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:22,950
toward red card numbers

982
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:27,460
in plain text database and you could
look at that from the admin interface

983
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:31,700
and the Afghan interface was secured
with JavaScript

984
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:35,230
and by that I mean there was JavaScript

985
00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:39,710
that would check a cookie on your
machine and if the cookie was not set

986
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:43,810
by the way they could get to be set one
if the cookie was not set it will call

987
00:55:43,810 --> 00:55:47,240
the JavaScript back function to send you
back to the previous page

988
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:50,910
so obviously if you just disable
freaking dollars fifty could look at the

989
00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:51,589
admin panel

990
00:55:51,589 --> 00:55:55,030
use it all you want because there was no
other authentication going on all the

991
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:56,960
login from for the app interface did
with

992
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:00,990
set this cookie 21 so obviously we have
some really really big

993
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:04,030
security issues with this thing so

994
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:07,630
the Japanese got this I'm not going to
reveal how I got them to accept that

995
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:10,599
there may be security issues but they
sent it back to the koreans the Koreas

996
00:56:10,599 --> 00:56:13,210
look at it and they figure out that

997
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:16,970
there are some issues of course explodes
with them

998
00:56:16,970 --> 00:56:20,050
one developer gets fired because he
should have known you were supposed to

999
00:56:20,050 --> 00:56:22,260
be the foreign technology guy

1000
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:26,220
another issue was that the NSL warning
because the certificate they were using

1001
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:28,750
simply did not match the main aim

1002
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:31,369
so they gotta they got a signed
certificate but was not the correct

1003
00:56:31,369 --> 00:56:32,500
maintenance of course

1004
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:36,220
huge warning for that but what happened
after this is that the communication

1005
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:39,099
between a green company and the Japanese
company's code as well

1006
00:56:39,099 --> 00:56:42,940
because the green cystic accused the
japanese up being rude and the Japanese

1007
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:43,740
accused the greens

1008
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:49,580
being lazy so we're back at where we are
right now basically

1009
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:53,890
and you know so to quiet down we got
another consultant was fluent in Korean

1010
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:56,200
and we set up this year's meeting

1011
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:59,490
um during the meeting

1012
00:56:59,490 --> 00:57:03,869
basically the the that they've worked
together to identify two sets of loss

1013
00:57:03,869 --> 00:57:06,010
they identify the critical flaw switch

1014
00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:09,880
had to be fixed before launching and
they identified then on critical flaws

1015
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,800
which had to be fixed now whenever

1016
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:15,910
at some point we were making money so
useless the critical flaws

1017
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:19,880
users I'm not able to login if names
contain special characters

1018
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:23,480
by the way that's because the special
characters would cost a single query to

1019
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:24,780
fail

1020
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:29,589
um the two quick sessions I was annoying
to potential users to increase from 10

1021
00:57:29,589 --> 00:57:30,440
to three

1022
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:34,940
the dislike the colors and this freaking
cell kind of annoyed you so that to be

1023
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:35,800
fix

1024
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:39,140
and of course the cracker numbers being
stored in plain text database that was

1025
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:39,830
bad

1026
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:42,710
no they didn't really care about the
security implications but there's a law

1027
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:44,119
in Japan prohibited

1028
00:57:44,119 --> 00:57:47,839
prohibiting that undervalues three
penalties cell you know that obviously

1029
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:48,790
it's be fakes

1030
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:54,530
here's a list of the non critical flaws
um sequins actual in-form

1031
00:57:54,530 --> 00:58:00,859
207 Council axis ass and the admin
console being secure but I was gripped

1032
00:58:00,859 --> 00:58:04,730
its use a quote I received from the from
the CEO the Japanese company goes with

1033
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:08,470
lunch with those no exact

1034
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:11,599
he went on to say that only weird people
like me will check that so

1035
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:14,890
anyway you can see this listing is still
life

1036
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:18,460
and the green companies deploy the same
for all talked about three dozen other

1037
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:20,060
clients

1038
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:23,589
but in the end Noah for what I've told
you guys

1039
00:58:23,589 --> 00:58:27,119
we can at least be proud the fix SL um

1040
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:32,280
unfortunately they didn't fix XSL they
fixed the error message which was what

1041
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,710
the critical flaw and they fixed the
error message by

1042
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:39,310
removing a cell altogether

1043
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:43,750
so with 2 minutes ago that the sum up
are we screwed

1044
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:50,750
yes we are there any questions

1045
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:59,000
sweet use attribution become a couple
