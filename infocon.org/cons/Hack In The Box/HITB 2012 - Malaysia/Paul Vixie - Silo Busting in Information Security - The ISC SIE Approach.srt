1
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:10,260
ok

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,059
space

3
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:13,990
school

4
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:20,990
skills

5
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:28,119
I'm going to introduce Baltic Sea

6
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:32,510
with squeeze I see president he will
talk about

7
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:35,530
segal busting information security the I
you see

8
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:42,530
SAE approach thank you I am NOT bringing
slides today because I have some

9
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,610
complicated things

10
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,879
to explain and don't want to distract
you by having you try to read and listen

11
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:52,890
at the same time

12
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,900
up there will be a demonstration so I'll
be using the projector but halfway

13
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,909
through I'll so silo busting

14
00:01:01,909 --> 00:01:07,490
in this case refers to the relationship
between people who run that works

15
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:10,840
and people who sort of soul security

16
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,330
I guess reputation services were threat
information

17
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,450
systems um let's

18
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:21,909
just estimate that somewhere around want
to try 22

19
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:25,130
trillion US dollars worth love

20
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:29,460
market capitalization have been created
in the last twenty years

21
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:35,299
in what used to be called the anti-virus
field in fact I think about every three

22
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:36,280
or four weeks

23
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,820
somewhere in the world there's a new
company that starts up

24
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,899
with the idea of selling into that
market

25
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:47,119
and perhaps they're gonna sell to you
and application that runs on your

26
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,840
smartphone or your laptop perhaps it'll
be a server-side

27
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,619
security for you that you might connect
to your mail server so that you can

28
00:01:54,619 --> 00:01:55,649
reject spam

29
00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:00,369
on or server side feat that you can plug
into your

30
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:03,819
anti-virus product on your MTA's that
you can

31
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:07,649
reject attachments that have bad check
sums whatever it is

32
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:11,130
arm we have really created a lot of
wealth

33
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,330
and a on a focus on that well for just a
moment

34
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:17,330
because being what I noted

35
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:20,610
five years ago when I began the work on
be describing the day

36
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:24,310
is that we've created a great deal of
wealth without making the problem

37
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,610
better now often if you create wealth

38
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:31,190
what you end up with as a result is a
working railroad

39
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:36,540
railroad system highway system %uh some
new fleet of commercial ships

40
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,660
a transatlantic cable you know you pay
some money to invest some money you

41
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,750
build something that is useful people
use that and the use

42
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:48,020
a bit then makes it valuable and then
you sell it or you sell futures in it or

43
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:48,860
something like that

44
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,970
so other words a speaking

45
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,660
capitalistic Lee when we make
investments and create

46
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:59,980
capital wealth it normally corresponds
to having done something

47
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,870
in the case love this trillion or more
dollars

48
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:07,930
love wealth we've created as far as the
market capitalization

49
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:13,590
of Trend Micro and I everybody else in
the AV field everybody who would like to

50
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,370
sell

51
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,550
security threat data were reputation
data

52
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:21,810
above problem is as bad as it ever was
might even be getting worse

53
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,800
it may be that the more we invest the
worse it gets which is kind of the

54
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,690
opposite of what you want capitalism

55
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:32,440
is not helping us here my way

56
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,920
the investigation into the reasons
showed

57
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,790
that we have a structural defect so

58
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:43,840
what a what's happening

59
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,180
is a new company will start up and it'll
be a couple guys who

60
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,540
all left some other company at the same
time where they were all went to college

61
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,230
together sure to dorm room I'll

62
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,500
and they will say hey I know what's
create a new security company and

63
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,720
a for you know some

64
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,910
annual fee we will sell to large
enterprise up the ability for them to

65
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,010
detect threats

66
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:10,280
against the infrastructure and keep
those threats

67
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,620
on the outside a and everybody says yeah
that's a great idea but

68
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:19,139
how do we know where the threats are how
do we what are the ingredients how do we

69
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:19,880
build

70
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,030
the thing that we want to sell and the
answer comes in the form above

71
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,729
well up let's give something away first

72
00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:31,189
and maybe it'll be a some kind of an
online reputation

73
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:34,349
service and from the querystring to

74
00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:38,499
our own online system 0 we will learn

75
00:04:38,499 --> 00:04:42,249
assertive what's happening up there
because people who are running

76
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:45,409
are free software using our free service
will

77
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:48,830
a be asking us questions on those
questions will

78
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:53,229
implicitly tell us what's going on so by
data mining rune querystring

79
00:04:53,229 --> 00:04:57,580
that's what I did with the originals
anti-spam company called maps and GPS we

80
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,719
created something called the RBL

81
00:04:59,719 --> 00:05:03,060
and we got a lot of really useful
information by looking at the query

82
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,710
names

83
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,939
because if you go to a query to our
video for you

84
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:11,439
it tells you immediately that somebody
corresponding to that IP address the IP

85
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:12,669
address that some coated

86
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:16,669
into the DNS name just tried to send
email to somebody

87
00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:20,580
and if a whole lot of people start
asking you questions about the same

88
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:25,550
a cue name when you know that particular
IP address is trying to send email to a

89
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,930
lot of people

90
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:30,919
was the run your wait list you could
just assume they're bad

91
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:34,960
and there are I'll of course a whole
bunch rules that you would apply in

92
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,490
smarter software them in a book

93
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,360
that's generally the way network
telemetry starts

94
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,539
coming into one of these new companies

95
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:48,150
arm there are of course other things you
can do you can use public information

96
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:51,699
Verisign for the dot-com to apps on

97
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:55,810
allows anybody on the Internet if they
fill out some paperwork to download the

98
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:56,819
dot-com zone

99
00:05:56,819 --> 00:06:00,800
free are in lot of people have made a
business

100
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,560
download in that zone once a day looking
differences from yesterday to today

101
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,639
saying what those differences are the
adds and drops in all the new ones in

102
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:13,689
the last 24 hours are immediately
suspect because as we know

103
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:17,969
most new domain names are crap so

104
00:06:17,969 --> 00:06:21,449
that would be another example of where
you get your telemetry up but neither a

105
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:22,360
voz

106
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,870
is likely to make you competitive if you
want to be in the threat

107
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:28,849
information business you want to sell
reputation feed you wanna sell

108
00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:30,219
anti-virus

109
00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:34,069
packages of some kind for smart phones
or laptops or whatever

110
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:38,330
you need to be able to demonstrate to
your customers that you have information

111
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:42,939
other people don't have otherwise why
should they do business with you

112
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:46,529
and a the Sourav

113
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:49,719
the usual result of that line of
thinking is

114
00:06:49,719 --> 00:06:52,800
okay who do we know runs a network

115
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,059
who's got maybe an Ethernet switch full
observers

116
00:06:56,059 --> 00:07:00,009
and is willing to let us hang one of our
servers on their switch

117
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:04,169
and set us up on a SPAN port so that we
can watch traffic go by

118
00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:08,370
without interfering with that but we can
gather telemetry information that way

119
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:11,689
and inevitably in what used to be called
a

120
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:15,389
rolodex when I was a kid but I guess my
was called your contact

121
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:19,529
listing your phone there will be a list
of people that you've done business with

122
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:21,680
regard to school with a drink with

123
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,939
who operate such networks and if they

124
00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:28,249
if you're the first person to call them
they might be willing to install

125
00:07:28,249 --> 00:07:32,259
some with your equipment in their
network so that you can gather telemetry

126
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:36,279
and that's where the real value seems to
come from its companies with them that

127
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:36,830
well

128
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:40,740
who really risen to the top of the heap
in terms of

129
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:44,159
succeed in this business and creating
the larger share of the

130
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:49,479
trillion dollar market capitalization
than I was described a few minutes ago

131
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:53,169
on here's the problem you really have to
be the first person to call

132
00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:57,900
that particular network operator if
somebody else is already got

133
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,240
telemetry server and is already
collecting information about what's

134
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:01,839
happening

135
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:05,020
on that network they're likely to tell
you look

136
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,869
I'm not in this business I can't sell
this I can't turn

137
00:08:08,869 --> 00:08:12,009
Sourav the favor you'd like me to do you
into a business

138
00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:15,650
I can't make this clear even a
cost-recovery case if I tell my lawyers

139
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:17,319
that I'm selling this

140
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:21,199
a they will kill me or what's worse they
want to sell it to someone who is not

141
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,129
you at a much higher price

142
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:27,279
so this has to be kept on on the Qt we
have to do this quietly

143
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:31,919
after a make sure that nobody catches me
giving data away

144
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,419
and that means I really can't do it for
everybody who comes in the door gonna do

145
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:37,320
it for the first person

146
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,940
and again plays into the business model
love creating all over this

147
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,690
absolutely useless wealth I say useless
because it's not solving the problem I

148
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:47,949
don't know about you but I am

149
00:08:47,949 --> 00:08:51,519
let's say from the internet now than I
was twenty years ago

150
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,339
saw 12 isn't doing any good I'll

151
00:08:55,339 --> 00:08:58,360
government sure have earned myself a
response

152
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,959
I'll anyway these are exclusive

153
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:05,509
relationships between the places that
things are happening on the network has

154
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:06,600
to be an ISP

155
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,779
enterprise University name server mail
server whatever does

156
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:14,279
a and a given security company

157
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:18,560
who is trying to role that they'd up and
turn it into something that

158
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,380
their customers might be willing to pay
for and I want to emphasize again that

159
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,300
you're not doing something like that you
won't be competitive

160
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:29,000
no matter how many honeypots you set up
on

161
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,250
you were or or how many much public
information you pull down

162
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:38,149
you still have to be able to do this or
you will not be seen threats early

163
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:39,100
enough to

164
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,550
up compete the other people who want the
same customers you do

165
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,620
recess the perception

166
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,670
now the is what I call information silos

167
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:55,000
silos toll thing sometimes for love
corner grain or whatever

168
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,660
and a bottom has an absolute
gravitational relationship to the top

169
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,279
things float down they don't go sideways

170
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:08,170
and in this case and information silo is
a relationship between

171
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:11,870
some network operator having telemetry
having the ability to

172
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:15,050
informer observe about what's happening
on the network

173
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:18,300
and some consumer some security company
who wants them

174
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:22,759
data I'm once we silo something

175
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:26,800
other competing companies can't get it
and the customers up those competing

176
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,779
companies

177
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:31,500
can't get it more information silos we
build

178
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,389
the more stock value we create some more
about trillion dollars we

179
00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:39,730
excelerate I'll and the less above the
problem we can solve

180
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:43,779
because anything that we've got an
excuse exclusive lock on

181
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:47,130
will not be seen by enough your
competitors to protect enough

182
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,240
the world to do any good other words the
more

183
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,860
this stock value we create the more we
benefit the bad guys

184
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:58,800
as they can operate a pretty much
freewing

185
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,740
because very few people will ever get a
chance to cross correlate what they're

186
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,800
doing

187
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,949
you know it's it's as though you're in a
room

188
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:11,060
a robbing people and unless somebody
points a flashlight

189
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:14,339
right at you you can't be stopped

190
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:17,810
I prefer to turn the lights on I would
like

191
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:22,040
the Internet to become more safe rather
than less if someday

192
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:26,769
like the trend to reverse or frankly if
you just stop getting worse

193
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:30,220
I would a treat as a victory right now
unit gets less safe

194
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:34,680
every year om so 2007

195
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:39,139
weird internet systems consortium
created some open source software

196
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:42,680
around Open Data concept

197
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,920
the original software is gone now was
called in cap for network capture

198
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,040
and we had to develop software because
there was no standard tools at your

199
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,560
standard network

200
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,380
packet format for work telemetry it's
not like you can take a peek ap file

201
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:01,149
and play it over the network somehow you
take a peek ap file

202
00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:05,660
and copy it a if you you know stick in
the file on our sink it from server to

203
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,379
server that's

204
00:12:06,379 --> 00:12:09,790
pretty much what we all do but that
doesn't scale

205
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,879
so we develop some software to do this
with

206
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:16,040
datagrams rather than TCP streams

207
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,600
datagrams are unreliable but there are
also

208
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,629
very lightweight and you can broadcast
from

209
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:27,120
for an Ethernet switch and you have some
data you'd like to share with everyone

210
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,379
you can transmit with no what used to be
called the all one's address and

211
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:34,029
everyone receives a packet at the same
time

212
00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:37,410
you want to do the same thing with TCP
you have to rsync to each person

213
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:38,819
individually

214
00:12:38,819 --> 00:12:43,790
so we liked packets we like datagrams
and we develop some tools for that

215
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:48,040
I develop those tools and and I'm I say
probably the other crap and they're all

216
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:48,709
gone now

217
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:52,410
been replaced by better tools written by
younger man

218
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:55,589
arm but since 2008 so for the last

219
00:12:55,589 --> 00:12:59,100
three-and-a-half four years we have been
operating

220
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:03,060
and Open Data a facility we call it the
security

221
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:06,480
information exchange talked about

222
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,660
here two years ago a and

223
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:13,040
was well received but on

224
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,449
what has happened since then and I know
that I love you weren't here two years

225
00:13:16,449 --> 00:13:17,639
ago so I

226
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:21,230
offered to sort of say again when I send
them

227
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:25,490
please send us your data few operate
infrastructure

228
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:28,759
whether whether that's spam trapper
honey pot

229
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:32,560
DNS server whether you've got a network
telescope

230
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,720
whatever typeof information you have

231
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,850
either because you operate it for the
purpose of the other in security

232
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:39,569
telemetry

233
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:42,600
like a honeypot or you just have it
because you operate

234
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,120
network is very interesting it's very
useful to people who would like to stop

235
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,899
crime

236
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:52,009
do not give it to whoever you want to

237
00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:55,800
college with when they call you and say
could you please insert the server in

238
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,089
your network

239
00:13:57,089 --> 00:14:00,899
because if only they have it them the
bad guys will benefit way more than he

240
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:02,860
or you will benefit

241
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:06,709
we don't want to do that we have to find
a way to align our actions with the end

242
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:09,709
result would like to obtain

243
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:14,240
I'll so would you do instead is finding
information sharing

244
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,750
facilities somewhere and mine is the one
in its systems is

245
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,620
at your disposal I'll send the data to
that facility

246
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:27,930
and a get them to give you some kind of
feedback about who else is receiving and

247
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:30,310
who they will share it with on your
behalf

248
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:34,279
and what those people are able to do
with it wanna show you what we do

249
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:37,339
with that data but before earning get to
that

250
00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:40,860
on serve go through a little bit more

251
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,870
of who's sending us the data and what it
is

252
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:48,449
and what we do with it that's what I
call the front end problem

253
00:14:48,449 --> 00:14:53,720
Josh welcome

254
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:58,040
um right so let's imagine you are
running

255
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,639
any name server: recursive name server:

256
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:05,209
possibly in this building serving the
wireless network

257
00:15:05,209 --> 00:15:08,639
so that when a DHCP leases handed out to
somebody

258
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,810
it's got your nick name servers IP
address and

259
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:15,300
causes your name server to receive a lot
of DNS queries

260
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:19,629
from laptops smartphones 101 whoever's
on the wireless

261
00:15:19,629 --> 00:15:23,019
any time it gets a question that house
seen before

262
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:27,060
it is likely to be able to answer that
question from its cash

263
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,629
won't have to go upstream won't go ask
for a sign away pres

264
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:34,459
you know example that comment when asked
the root name servers well where is da

265
00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:38,689
SG I it doesn't have to go upstream and
ask anybody anything

266
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:43,589
if it's already in cash a those
transactions are not interesting to me

267
00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:46,999
mostly because they contain personally
identifiable information

268
00:15:46,999 --> 00:15:50,730
on the words the IP address of the
person who asked that question

269
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:54,209
is considered piri in most countries and
I don't wanna fight those

270
00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:57,540
those battles a but that upstream
traffic

271
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:01,149
if you ask for name server: if someone
asks your name server: something you

272
00:16:01,149 --> 00:16:03,490
don't know when you have to go find it

273
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:07,180
a that has no PI those transactions when
I call your

274
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:10,779
upstream or cash miss transactions are

275
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:13,879
are fair game you can share them with
anybody without

276
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:17,420
really having any of your lawyers or
anybody

277
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:21,569
responsible for your country's privacy
laws raising an eyebrow

278
00:16:21,569 --> 00:16:25,430
ideally you'll share them again with me
or with someone like me who will make

279
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:25,870
them

280
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:30,149
further available I'll what you can do

281
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:34,870
if you receive enough of the state a is
rebuild the entire DNS

282
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:40,930
one response at a time without ever
making any queries on your own behalf

283
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:43,959
hours idea first came to me for

284
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:47,810
one Florian weimar was a German student

285
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:52,050
as part of his master these a set
University Stuttgart

286
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:55,600
did something called passive DNS logging
and

287
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:01,610
his particular use case was that the .de
demand for the German

288
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:05,760
as the German country could I'm have
been made

289
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,160
private have been taken out of the
public domain you could no longer

290
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,490
transfer it

291
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:13,980
and so he being an engineer for smart

292
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,670
and very passionate decided that he
would recreate the content of the .eu

293
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,900
domain one response at a time

294
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,130
and then make his copy %uh that publicly
available to

295
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:27,059
sort of challenge to lawmakers on this
and

296
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:31,169
he achieved his aim buddy also created
this

297
00:17:31,169 --> 00:17:34,860
marvelous model that we all know call
passive DNS

298
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:38,279
us so we need your response data I don't
just mean for this

299
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:42,279
wireless network I mean for your house
is if you've got a name server at your

300
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:43,279
house

301
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:46,679
a you if you're in this room you're
smart enough to be running your own name

302
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:47,440
server: you

303
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,750
are not using the one that came with the
small plastic box from your DSL provider

304
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:55,140
if you are a DSL provider if you are
university if you were a small

305
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,100
enterprise

306
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:01,000
and you run this running name server:
please consider running a passive DNS

307
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,710
sensor

308
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:06,600
that sensor will look like a background

309
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,760
demon just a server process um

310
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,870
it hooks in the same place the TCP don't
with ochem

311
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:18,130
Tom so just use what we call the BPF
berkeley packet filter

312
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:21,580
to grab all the packets related to be an
ass and

313
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:25,059
reassemble the related ones into

314
00:18:25,059 --> 00:18:28,580
the underlying transactions that cause
those packets to be sent

315
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:31,830
and then it will uplink those strength

316
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:35,100
I guess reassemble transactions to us

317
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:39,570
arm you could do the same thing with
spam if you have a spam trap

318
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:42,720
a honeypot whatever data you're
gathering

319
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,250
if you're in the security business is
great interest to other people

320
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:50,490
if you shared with us we will share it
with them a

321
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:53,690
something called Burke up love Gartner

322
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:57,570
some sometimes called in at work
telescope it's hard to believe that

323
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:01,620
now the IP version 4 has been fully
allocated and there's not really very

324
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,640
much left in inventory

325
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:09,130
that any part of the ipv4 address space
as advertised in the global BGP tables

326
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:13,289
is not fall love people but it's true

327
00:19:13,289 --> 00:19:17,870
quite a bit is sparsely used to really
not used at all

328
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:21,490
there are some companies who were on the
internet back in the early days twenty

329
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:22,669
five years ago

330
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:26,539
who have large amounts of space which
they advertise into the global routing

331
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:27,770
table but they don't have any

332
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:31,029
customers on it so what they receive in

333
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:34,350
those advertised but unused blocks is so

334
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:38,000
which a good thing covers cosmic
background radiation

335
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,750
this is Code Red this is a Conficker
this is everybody who has got

336
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:47,750
for some that have malicious software
that needs to find

337
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:52,270
other hosts to in fact a they're
constantly probing what we call me

338
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:55,950
network telescopes over the world and
I've got

339
00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:00,370
6 Class B is worth six last six teams as
they're now called

340
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:03,720
worth space from various people who

341
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,289
have the space and aren't using it and
rather shirt with us

342
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:10,700
them to share it with the first security
company who asks them

343
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,289
we make it available to any security
company who asks us

344
00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:17,620
or do I mean make available mentioned
all the sensors that you could be

345
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,659
running and sending

346
00:20:18,659 --> 00:20:21,779
us Gordon a part some

347
00:20:21,779 --> 00:20:27,140
what we've been do with it a strings up
to be controversy or

348
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:31,419
you will send it to us usually and very
small batches

349
00:20:31,419 --> 00:20:35,770
we let you build up about one minute
worth of traffic on your side

350
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:38,820
and then use rsync I don't like that

351
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:42,830
rsync and I don't like that one minute
delay but I recognize the need for you

352
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,460
to be able to compress it

353
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:48,450
on the way to us if you were to send it
to us packet by packet by packet

354
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:51,610
it would all be clear text unencrypted
uncompressed

355
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:55,950
and I know that their parts the world
where that is an expensive proposition

356
00:20:55,950 --> 00:21:01,169
so with a lot built up for a minute and
you will send it to us

357
00:21:01,169 --> 00:21:04,610
when we received her bachelor's we
uncompressed them

358
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:07,799
and open little and play them

359
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:11,470
Sourav as though they were tiny little
music files we play them

360
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:15,240
on a private Ethernet switch in our
facility

361
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,279
and anyone who has paid us a porkpie

362
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:22,539
to be connected to that switch is an
able to see your data

363
00:21:22,539 --> 00:21:27,159
with about one minute delay along with
everybody else is data

364
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:30,990
a I wanna say pay for the privilege I
have to say that

365
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:34,549
no one has been turned away because they
couldn't pay

366
00:21:34,549 --> 00:21:37,760
we have plenty love just internet do
gooders

367
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,870
who get connected because they have

368
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:44,679
public benefit use for that we are a
non-profit company we want to help those

369
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:45,559
people

370
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:48,760
on the other hand if you can afford it
then we will make you pay us

371
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,520
whatever we think you can afford for the
airport and we have

372
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,250
I think about forty different companies

373
00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:00,240
some other security companies some our
university researchers

374
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,419
we have a couple of law enforcement
agencies

375
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:06,890
government intelligence services

376
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:11,289
whatever convinces us that they're gonna
make the world safer as a result of

377
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:12,409
Senor data

378
00:22:12,409 --> 00:22:15,980
gets a chance to be on our switch

379
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:21,140
arm I we played as I said we play these
as though they were music files

380
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:25,090
we pretty much spew them out at top
speed and delete them

381
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:28,929
as we have no ability to students about
half a gigabit per second

382
00:22:28,929 --> 00:22:32,029
traffic we have no capability of storing

383
00:22:32,029 --> 00:22:38,240
as much data as we carry I know that
some of our customers to

384
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,289
Jose appear in the from: is can vent
connected or switch on/off over the

385
00:22:42,289 --> 00:22:44,710
years and I'm betting he's got enough
disk space

386
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:50,250
to store at all but we don't I'll sort
job really is to be the bearer channel

387
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:54,409
we created the sensors software and
formats we

388
00:22:54,409 --> 00:22:57,809
encourage people to run are sensors we
collect the data

389
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:02,659
and a we connect people to switch when
we play the date on the switch and with

390
00:23:02,659 --> 00:23:03,690
it that's our role

391
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:07,799
answer this is to me and open day to
play

392
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:10,929
arm interestingly we've got

393
00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:15,130
two different security companies who
have come into existence since 2008 when

394
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:15,840
we first

395
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,600
open for business who were able to hit

396
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,100
both first revenue and profitability
using no other data

397
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:28,690
than what they got from us and to me
this is a wonderful proof

398
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:31,770
love the concept that information silos
are

399
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:36,350
a false benefit at his idea of having an
exclusive relationship in order to keep

400
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,220
your competitors from having a

401
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:41,590
be the only way that you're going make
profitability is

402
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:44,950
a false false on the face of it

403
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:48,429
what matters is how smart you are
processing the data

404
00:23:48,429 --> 00:23:53,330
how good your salespeople are telling
people what you have in closing deals

405
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:56,440
so the efficiency love your organization

406
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,049
near engineering and marketing and sales
departments are going to be much more

407
00:24:00,049 --> 00:24:01,409
important than what

408
00:24:01,409 --> 00:24:04,470
exclusive access you have although

409
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:08,820
from on the flip side of the coin the
exclusive access you have

410
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,899
will certainly help the bad guys a

411
00:24:11,899 --> 00:24:15,789
so and the there may not be any good
that can come up there certainly will be

412
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:17,390
some bad

413
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:20,580
arm right

414
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:25,210
right

415
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:27,679
so the first thing I've asked you to do
is please

416
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:31,900
run a sensor some us the data or if not
I'll send it to somebody else who was

417
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:32,940
doing the same thing

418
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:36,580
%uh second thing is can act

419
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:41,070
you know find out what it would cost you
could be nothing if your

420
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:45,230
you know doing only non-profit good work
could be in

421
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:48,230
easily affordable amount of money plug
into our switch

422
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:52,159
get the data more people who process it
and turn it into

423
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,429
security intelligence the safer the
world will become arm

424
00:24:56,429 --> 00:24:59,840
now thinkin

425
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,220
the third thing you might do some people
don't wanna share their data

426
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:07,549
openly think that is valuable

427
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:10,570
I want to sell it but they don't want to
have

428
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:13,730
the problem finding customers for

429
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:17,309
negotiating with each customer a

430
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:20,630
and figuring out how they're gonna send
the data to each customer

431
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:23,720
I in that case they've come to a song

432
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,899
of half a dozen of these now only passed
for a private

433
00:25:26,899 --> 00:25:32,720
channel every ve Lam on this private
business which they told you about

434
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,179
is we think I was a channel kinda in a
sense of

435
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:41,330
digital satellite television the most of
them are public we created them we

436
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:42,169
determine what

437
00:25:42,169 --> 00:25:45,940
format would be for packets on them feel
and we are in charge of

438
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:50,760
what customer gets to be in that the
land and see the date on that channel

439
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:55,440
um but you can also ask for your own we
don't charge for that

440
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,350
if you will only share data with people
who pay you money and pay a license fee

441
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,600
that's fine to us at least you're still
sharing the data

442
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,860
so the fact that you're demanding
payment for it does not make it

443
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:10,460
less of a public benefit act for you to
share it therefore we will carry the day

444
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,799
before you we will be

445
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:16,539
your distribution channel so several of
the larger spam traps

446
00:26:16,539 --> 00:26:19,600
who have between 50 and 100 megabits per
second

447
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,870
spam that they are receiving wanna make
sure that if

448
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:27,270
their direct competitors are planning to
improve their

449
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:31,360
anti-spam reputation feed using the same
spam for updated that they themselves

450
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,500
are collecting

451
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:36,520
this will hold each other for ransom and
make each other pay money

452
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:40,130
and they do and they still use us to
distribute it because

453
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:45,539
it's one-stop shopping they send us one
copy in all of their potential customers

454
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:49,530
will just get access to it for nothing
they also have the option of sharing it

455
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:53,100
in real time with the same set love
academic

456
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:56,590
or nonprofit do gooders that we share
data with if they wanna make it

457
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:58,130
available for you they can

458
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:02,409
but it turns out to be a wonderful
information sharing system even

459
00:27:02,409 --> 00:27:05,730
if it's not fully public or not in the
in the public domain

460
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:11,429
from so wanna talk about I wanna move to

461
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:16,149
a how we are using some other data on
the for-profit side of my company before

462
00:27:16,149 --> 00:27:17,020
I do that

463
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:21,080
please use this moment for questions

464
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,539
about what I call the front end of the
sensors

465
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:29,059
the formats the rules for connecting to
work

466
00:27:29,059 --> 00:27:34,640
switch help me out here don't think

467
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,220
become Jose Jose ask

468
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:45,220
a question

469
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:52,940
we have denied access to only one person
in the four

470
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:55,970
years or so that we've been doing this
on

471
00:27:55,970 --> 00:28:00,250
and it was because they have no
references we didn't know who they were

472
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:04,530
they were from a country where I have no
friends and they could not identify

473
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:06,680
anybody that we have in common

474
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:10,540
who would give them a thumbs up and say
yes

475
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:15,040
this person is not a spammer they are
not some ex-kgb

476
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:19,210
digital gangster you know I i have to
have some

477
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:22,420
positive reason for contacting people
and

478
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:26,000
have only one I love for you or so

479
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,570
just couldn't meet the bar I don't know
if they were

480
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:34,160
legitimate or not a legitimate player
but and without

481
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,330
that's the second half of your question

482
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:41,440
first half when would we disconnect
there's

483
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,240
a contract our Terms of Service you have
to agree

484
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,850
among other things not to reassure the
data you can use it for your own private

485
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:53,190
purposes you can sell products based on
it but the wrong data

486
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:57,180
once it's in your hands cannot leave
your hands and

487
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:01,260
no one has yet been thrown away thrown
away thrown off

488
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:05,290
disconnected terminated no contracts
have been terminated we have

489
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:08,540
had two sons mornings to a couple of
people

490
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:11,870
who were mixing our data in with other
data

491
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:15,850
that they were carrying and sort of

492
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:19,200
not paying attention to where it all
came from and it was quite

493
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,360
accidental that they were including raw
data they got from us

494
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,880
in something else that they were given
away so they weren't even

495
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,900
monitor isn't necessarily they were
however leaking it

496
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,160
so the if if the cease and desist

497
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:36,380
warning have not worked then we would
certainly have pulled the plug on them

498
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:39,580
Josh

499
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:46,580
ask a question

500
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,820
backbone connections um trying to

501
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:03,890
correctly interpret your question the

502
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:07,909
data-sharing facility where the season
it switches

503
00:30:07,909 --> 00:30:11,370
a is inside have any connects facility
in fact we've got

504
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:14,870
two of them one is in the cracks Ashburn
and wonderful

505
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:18,830
is in Equinix Palo Alto which I saw them
covers packs having been the founder

506
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,169
their

507
00:30:19,169 --> 00:30:25,220
arm so that is where people go off at
one point and we're switching

508
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:28,600
we make them rent cabinet space and by
transit from other

509
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,649
people who are in those data centers on

510
00:30:31,649 --> 00:30:35,620
if you are one of these non-profit do
good in freeloaders than I have

511
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,140
mentioned

512
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:40,080
then we will let you install your
equipment at I have see

513
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,100
where we have dark fiber to

514
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:46,140
both 200 Paul and 529 brand

515
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:49,230
and we pure with 190

516
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:52,890
other networks and we wrong

517
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:58,860
multiple 10q trunks order to make sure
that if there's a problem

518
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:02,490
won't be on our network as I guess there
the ruler on

519
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:07,039
that network the

520
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,149
Bay Area research at work that is
agencies backbone

521
00:31:10,149 --> 00:31:13,509
is also what where all of the incoming
data

522
00:31:13,509 --> 00:31:17,479
arrives and so chances are very good

523
00:31:17,479 --> 00:31:22,710
that the well we have transit from a
couple of companies who

524
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:27,820
just donated transit to us in 10 gig
increments but it is very rare for

525
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:30,859
sensor data to arrive over transit
connections

526
00:31:30,859 --> 00:31:37,859
as we really do have pretty bright
peering ask you a question later

527
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:58,610
no arm like a physical access good

528
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:04,090
call

529
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:09,490
access will not cause a problem a if you
just can't afford to own your own

530
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:10,630
equipment at all

531
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:14,280
then we will let you have a KVM on one
of our plates servers

532
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:18,150
we've got couple of contracts where we

533
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:22,919
ourselves receive the data and then turn
it back into batch files in our sink it

534
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:23,700
to somebody

535
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:27,990
because that was the only way that they
could possibly do it and we thought

536
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:28,590
their

537
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:34,919
their use was public benefit okay

538
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:38,730
gonna give you a demonstration now no

539
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:44,370
explain what this is comes up

540
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:48,070
so talk to their primary role

541
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:51,720
is to build and maintaining sensor
network

542
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,390
defined performance we wrote the tools
with you all the outreach

543
00:32:55,390 --> 00:33:02,169
as far as getting the data

544
00:33:02,169 --> 00:33:05,390
and getting more data over time on

545
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:08,669
we also have the role love hearing

546
00:33:08,669 --> 00:33:13,049
the data other words after we broadcast
in on this property finance which

547
00:33:13,049 --> 00:33:16,919
and throughway the copy that you sent us
from your sensor

548
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:21,770
arm we feel that were

549
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:25,789
else entitled has anyone else

550
00:33:25,789 --> 00:33:29,419
to hear the data that we have broadcast
and turn into

551
00:33:29,419 --> 00:33:34,309
value-added products value-added
products for a nonprofit as a little bit

552
00:33:34,309 --> 00:33:36,110
controversy where you end up

553
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:39,830
competing with your customers and you
end up having a complicated relationship

554
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:44,210
with your tax authority because some of
your revenues taxable and some is not

555
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:48,669
so we have more multiple different
corporate entities that are all tied

556
00:33:48,669 --> 00:33:50,890
together in a way that tries to make
sense of that

557
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:55,309
arm nevertheless because no one else
built

558
00:33:55,309 --> 00:33:58,490
thus Indiana's TB II

559
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:02,380
no matter how often I would ask them
please can somebody please take the raw

560
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,140
data and turn it into

561
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:07,900
a database that questions can be asked
over in wasn't happening

562
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:12,780
and I realized that people who were
plugging in and receiving the data

563
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,780
existing business plans an existing
product

564
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:19,700
roadmaps and so forth on May could not
be bothered

565
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:23,500
to also build thing that was gonna
leverage us in some good way

566
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,780
on and I just couldn't get the resources
or

567
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:29,879
it was too darn much data Africa bit
love

568
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:33,280
real time you TP is tough

569
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:38,109
you could call it drinking from a fire
hose but it is more likely in under

570
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:40,139
Niagara Falls with your mouth open

571
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:44,859
it's a lot of data um so

572
00:34:44,859 --> 00:34:48,530
we have a multi-stage filtration system
that all describe first

573
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:52,179
want to get to the demo using this
what's on the screen here

574
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:55,940
I'll when

575
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:59,730
you have hundreds have megabits a
passive DNS data

576
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:02,900
which are the aggregate of all the cash
miss traffic

577
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,900
that was received don't you know

578
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:09,740
dozens of universities and ISP's
hundreds of name servers

579
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:13,130
across the world a lot of it will be
duplicative

580
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:16,810
on there's a huge amount of
self-similarity if

581
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:20,910
if some name is suddenly used somewhere
in its whatever

582
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:26,650
dubbed about something earlier who's in
Zaria dot com or whatever

583
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:30,280
I chances are that it's about to be seen
everywhere

584
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,940
and I V so if you see a new thing you
can almost

585
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:37,690
just set your watch ok in the next few
seconds everybody else is going to get

586
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:38,950
interested in that too

587
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:44,750
on and that's a that's hard problem
because if you're about to deploy a a

588
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:47,290
lot of infrastructure to process this
data

589
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:50,609
and most of it is duplicative firm

590
00:35:50,609 --> 00:35:53,950
your first task is to do but a

591
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:57,619
so that you're not using high-cost and
perhaps

592
00:35:57,619 --> 00:36:00,730
low performance SSD's or

593
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:05,250
something with persistent media on
something that is actually garbage data

594
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:08,300
so we developed our own de duper

595
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:12,869
that operates in the following manner it
connects to the internet switch

596
00:36:12,869 --> 00:36:16,630
but I've described twice it isn't too
different freelance

597
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:20,430
here's the raw data at the same time as
everybody else here's a

598
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:23,589
maintains abundant 80 gigabyte

599
00:36:23,589 --> 00:36:26,960
hash table and processes

600
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,270
every inbound message and if

601
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:34,770
that inbound message has some new thing
in that which causes an update to the

602
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:35,880
hash table

603
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:40,770
than that inbound messages copied to the
other veal and to the other channel

604
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:44,140
for if on the other hand that inbound
message

605
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:47,200
changes nothing its drop on the floor

606
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:51,010
this gives us about an 20 21 reduction

607
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:56,619
and a and the input can be hundreds of
thousands of packets per second her

608
00:36:56,619 --> 00:36:57,730
messages per second

609
00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:02,230
should say the output will tend to be
ten fifteen thousand

610
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:05,520
messages per second and the particular
host that those those

611
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,600
is pretty much the most expensive
computer that I have bought

612
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:14,259
in recent years it has not only a great
deal a memory but the very fastest

613
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:17,770
course in a very fastest front side bus
and so forth

614
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:21,430
and every six months wanna

615
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:25,710
becomes yesterday's technology we
replace it with something newer and

616
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,740
faster and more expensive

617
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:32,260
and if you stand behind the rack where
all of this work happens and you run

618
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,200
your hand

619
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,880
along the back over all the servers you
can tell which one this is

620
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,960
because it's the one that has the most
heat coming out at the fam's on the

621
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,350
power supply

622
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:46,470
on nevertheless it means everything else
that wants to process the state it does

623
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:48,290
not have to be that expensive

624
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:53,190
as 10,000 events per second is nothing
do than a laptop

625
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:56,710
now we have other post processors that
work the same way the copying

626
00:37:56,710 --> 00:38:01,190
from some source %um they maintain some
kind over

627
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:05,190
some some kinda state they have some
kinda rules and they will drop

628
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:09,790
some things and forward others for
example we have what we call the chaff

629
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:13,280
filter I don't know if you're aware of
this but Netflix

630
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,700
uses DNS makes DNS query

631
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:20,730
from their little application their
streaming application

632
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:25,109
a every time they are wondering if you
have permission to watch that

633
00:38:25,109 --> 00:38:28,380
so dan coats into the DNS who you are

634
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:31,850
and what does the content that its
asking about and

635
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:35,040
I suppose it does a one-way hash some
kind

636
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,100
using a private key and asked a DNS
question

637
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:45,359
and so that turns out to be a big seller
for them because I can tell you that's

638
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:48,950
thousands of packets per second now arm

639
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:52,490
but one thing you don't wanna do is put
that in a database any more than you

640
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:54,080
would wanna put in RBL lookup

641
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:58,270
in the database accordionist tunnels a
lot of people use DNS is a tunneling

642
00:38:58,270 --> 00:38:59,750
protocol

643
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:02,990
in order to get through some kind of a
paywall and

644
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:05,990
coffee shops in use the wireless but
they don't wanna pay for

645
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:09,980
a kind of thing DNS works built on all
their other traffic over diana's

646
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:13,460
are we have an extraordinary list

647
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:18,430
love the patterns various domain names
that those things are happening in

648
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:22,630
and we have a filter that reads the
dedupe channel that I just described

649
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:26,960
and a performing baseless puts the flow
into

650
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,300
wheat and chaff if you're a farmer

651
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,480
and your trying to deal with the crop
that your

652
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:37,089
bring in and you're gonna find that you
have quite a bit of weed seed

653
00:39:37,089 --> 00:39:41,950
the is mixed in with your weed seed the
weed seeds are called chaff

654
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:45,400
to actually have a chance channel in
that case we don't drop the chaff we

655
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:50,119
broadcaster onto a particular channel
and we have one company who came in one

656
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:50,839
report

657
00:39:50,839 --> 00:39:54,380
want to connect want to get the data and
the traffic channel was the only thing

658
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,570
they wanted

659
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:59,170
now we don't need any other dedupe stuff
or not using span we don't care about

660
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:01,430
dark not just give us the chaff

661
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:05,200
I have no idea what they're doing with
the normal I could cast but

662
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,200
you know one man's courage is another
minstrelsy i spose

663
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,990
arm so that that trick multi-stage

664
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:17,670
filtration works very nicely and its
something that proves the point that

665
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:21,420
Internet can be used for something other
than plugging our servers and/or

666
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:25,089
just option to broadcast that we do

667
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:29,119
is obvious the simulated the same unit
has come a long way from

668
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:33,220
having been a private radio spectrum
inside over well terminated coaxial

669
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,740
cable

670
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:39,140
um so these Ethernet switches are doing
quite a bit of work to simulate

671
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:43,089
broadcast refuse in the packet with all
one's and it has to put

672
00:40:43,089 --> 00:40:46,480
your packet into everybody's output
queue on

673
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,569
chances are that is going to be a lossy
and unreliable proposition

674
00:40:50,569 --> 00:40:53,859
I will tell you that we are on our third
Ethernet switch

675
00:40:53,859 --> 00:40:58,170
a so far and we're now evaluating what's
going to be the next one

676
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:01,740
cuz broadcast is not something that is
usually done and hardware it's not

677
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,630
something that the

678
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:06,720
designers have you turn on switches
optimize for but it sure does work well

679
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,490
for us

680
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:13,440
arm right so eventually we get it down
to around 10,000

681
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,819
per second and we build a database on a
bit review demonstration up that

682
00:41:17,819 --> 00:41:20,510
database before I do I wanna point out
that

683
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:24,600
we're not the only one or other passive
DNS data bases in the world

684
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:28,310
no team covering has one that they use
in-house

685
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:31,970
shock me if Arbor didn't have one that
used to house

686
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:35,300
BFK which is the employer that

687
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:39,040
for in Weimar went to after he left
university they have one

688
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:43,839
I in New Zealanders one called DNS parse

689
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:48,089
there are two radical differences
between

690
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:51,500
awesome Bell between us and all of them

691
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:55,680
first we make the raw data available and
they don't

692
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,540
rights of if you think you're smarter
than us you may be right

693
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:02,839
and if you think you can make a better
day to place then we can

694
00:42:02,839 --> 00:42:05,839
go to it we will give you the same
inputs we have

695
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:09,010
you can get the raw data dedupe it
yourself you can

696
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:12,869
get the dedupe data whatever it is you
want all over intermediate

697
00:42:12,869 --> 00:42:16,520
data products in the real time front and
are available

698
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,930
and we encourage people to prove that
they're smarter than us we want the

699
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:23,700
the we want to be you part of the rising
tide

700
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:27,890
raises all boats um

701
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:31,310
second important difference between us
and them is that we have

702
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:36,330
a

703
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:39,800
for strange business model if you are

704
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,980
interested in just solving crime

705
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:46,800
if you're going to be up there a on

706
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,180
secret handshake mailing lists at night
and stove

707
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:53,390
plane with your kids and you're going to
be out there investigating

708
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:56,710
where certain attack came from and you
need access

709
00:42:56,710 --> 00:43:00,420
we will just give that to you a even if
you're

710
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:04,510
a commercial company we don't care if
you're a commercial company protecting

711
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:07,470
your own network we don't care we will
give you access to

712
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:11,700
user interface that I'm about to
demonstrate a

713
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:15,410
the people who have to pay are the ones
who are deriving

714
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:20,670
other products on our data so if you
want to use us as a way to generate

715
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:24,050
or filter or QQ a or

716
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:27,640
value have some kind of reputation
feature cell

717
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:32,310
we will sell you access to that but the
primary purpose of all of us

718
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:35,910
is to make the world safer so

719
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:39,700
people who come in with that as they're
in town will walk out with a key in

720
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,990
their hand

721
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:46,240
as a non-profit we have the
responsibility of paying ourselves in

722
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:52,319
keeping the doors open which is why we
don't make everything free

723
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:56,630
so here's our database that

724
00:43:56,630 --> 00:44:00,580
hopefully mom host my cookie on

725
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:03,640
um this is a

726
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:07,990
the web interface all I will also show
you a command line interface

727
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:11,369
in a moment because the web interface a
local

728
00:44:11,369 --> 00:44:14,880
have yeah thank you I'm

729
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,240
web interface demos well but I'm sure
that you will not be able to imagine

730
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,900
using a

731
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:22,960
from your desk

732
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:29,960
soul Josh what's your vanity domain

733
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:36,480
what's your company to me

734
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,480
you burt say

735
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:46,480
okay so should be able to find his annus
records

736
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:51,080
and other similar type stuff

737
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:54,250
and this is not an impressive no at this
stage

738
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:58,170
because I could have done them dig
slight differences

739
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:01,190
do it will not only what used to be true

740
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:05,859
from deep down her for know if you'll
see that

741
00:45:05,859 --> 00:45:12,460
for example his and its records

742
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:16,300
are different between I'll

743
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:20,000
look at us just randomly different for
no reason at all

744
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,560
missus ugly so from marcher 2011 through

745
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:28,160
now eyes been using these two

746
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,520
okay from 2010 up to March users in
those two

747
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,750
so you can imagine that if Josh were
criminal

748
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:38,339
he may have taken that this name server:
of

749
00:45:38,339 --> 00:45:42,430
because he ended up in a fight with some
other criminal that was hosting come to

750
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:43,330
inform

751
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:47,010
and you might really wanna know okay so
if it changed in

752
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:50,710
March love for 2011 wanted a change

753
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:56,520
to NY so I can ask questions about bad
thing

754
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:01,560
see okay I'll

755
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:06,280
thrilling nothing particularly excited
about them

756
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:09,790
I am interested in this network

757
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:13,569
over to show you that this will give you
some history it'll tell you what used to

758
00:46:13,569 --> 00:46:14,589
be true

759
00:46:14,589 --> 00:46:18,240
rather than just telling you what's true
now

760
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:22,619
um that's not the power-up our oven as
being able to ask questions

761
00:46:22,619 --> 00:46:26,130
about what answer was given out and what

762
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:29,339
questions could have produced this
answer

763
00:46:29,339 --> 00:46:33,680
so let's find out

764
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:39,600
for his class being at work

765
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:46,600
its some strong

766
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:51,450
buses come this is a big result

767
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:56,310
seven thousand results have to tell you
that we would cut us off at ten thousand

768
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:57,780
because after ten thousand the

769
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:01,150
browser crashes so with limited

770
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:05,850
if you use the command line mode which
is actually a Web API little describe

771
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:09,980
there's no limit to how much do you can
get back um

772
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:14,030
so we have here

773
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:19,720
is this really long list love names

774
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:23,210
which have answers and his partner

775
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:27,130
should have owns because I said any

776
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:34,130
for a records

777
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,430
hoping this is going to list the and
receive each one rather than just a name

778
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:43,300
I

779
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:47,110
I am NOT using public interface

780
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:51,970
okay I'm using a

781
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:58,910
internal interface that sometimes
doesn't work

782
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:02,620
the much better that way um so here

783
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:06,590
is this border word on org thing IP DNS
I was using

784
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:11,020
a records and Russia's IP block but
probably was not using them as

785
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:15,860
host names for web browsers fine

786
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:21,330
click on one of these

787
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:28,330
hoping to be able to get it to show you
the IP address

788
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,940
ago on previews display is

789
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:39,380
hiding these IP addresses that would
normally tell you what the what address

790
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:41,240
was associated with each other's names

791
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:44,500
um which one can probably imagine

792
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:48,180
whining law enforcement people love an
interface like those

793
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:51,190
because if they get their hands on one

794
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:55,050
IP address that was used by some child
abuse material scanning

795
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:59,329
they can get from out to all of the
domain names that have ever return

796
00:48:59,329 --> 00:49:02,440
that they can get list all the

797
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:07,040
name servers for for that

798
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:11,030
a big catalyst to all the other domain
names that have

799
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:15,089
ever used to that name server: let's go
back to

800
00:49:15,089 --> 00:49:18,030
yes

801
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:21,080
and find out

802
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:24,570
want other you fall Josh

803
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:28,130
is performing so

804
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:32,080
it's like named a new elmer CA is

805
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:35,300
one of his two name servers choice

806
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:39,390
stick a look

807
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:46,390
aunt

808
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:54,600
right so here we go first column you'll
see

809
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:57,800
domain name second column tells you the
type

810
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:01,000
third column tells you that the values
equal to my search key

811
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,430
so these are all over the domain names
that

812
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:07,540
have used this name server: how's their
publication point

813
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:11,270
and in his case is not a criminal

814
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:15,640
I'll would say bear tracks to you
Alberta .ca

815
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:22,540
is suspect up but look at all these
other cool things you digit systems .ca

816
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:27,610
the evidently it's been out some
professor decided that he'd rather have

817
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:31,420
an IP over name retirement benefit um

818
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:34,490
you albert about biz

819
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:38,640
not sure we have any other easy way to
find out that they thought that they

820
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:39,770
were taking .biz

821
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:43,900
seriously um this kinda permuted index
work

822
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:48,510
where you can find out all over related
properties from a two-man

823
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:53,290
is boy it is a game-changer

824
00:50:53,290 --> 00:50:57,380
if you are chasing bad guys and they
think that who is privacy is gonna save

825
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:57,740
them

826
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:02,530
at one fellow inside of the FBI's

827
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:06,840
child Crimes Division tell me well being
willing to tell me the details of course

828
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:07,340
but he

829
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:14,020
said Tom yeah I went out two degrees of
separation from the one IP address I had

830
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:18,290
and look at all the history of all of
the different domain names and name

831
00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:20,170
servers and IP addresses

832
00:51:20,170 --> 00:51:23,640
and I found one thing

833
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:29,090
that was 36 months old that was clearly
on by the same person

834
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:34,090
and which he had the criminal have
thought was so far separated in time and

835
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:36,310
so for separated and data relationships

836
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:40,320
but it did not need who is privacy and
we arrested them

837
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:43,520
thank you very much I thought okay

838
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:47,590
there was a point to this so

839
00:51:47,590 --> 00:51:52,250
on very briefly I see I'm down to my
last 12 minutes but

840
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:56,670
clock but I think clock may have started
late down to my last minute

841
00:51:56,670 --> 00:52:03,670
if you guys want to make the next talk
all good

842
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:10,210
apologize for the fact that this is when
does

843
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:13,810
have a job that calls from you

844
00:52:13,810 --> 00:52:17,440
be able to read Microsoft talk

845
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:24,220
docking doctor X files tried by a
macintosh the trying to give me a

846
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:25,170
chiclet keyboard

847
00:52:25,170 --> 00:52:30,760
so

848
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:34,260
this is a

849
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:37,500
tiny little shell script calls curl see

850
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:41,280
URL on is going to transmit

851
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:46,140
Mike question as a restful

852
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:49,430
squaring and is going to receive an
answer that is in

853
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:53,660
chase on format and it's going to
trivially form into

854
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:58,070
result for me so let's start with

855
00:52:58,070 --> 00:53:05,070
query the picking on Josh initial pecan

856
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:11,700
Jose we don't work there anymore I'm

857
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:16,360
went by in a hurry so

858
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:22,660
I'll you can see they change their
delegation in Patna

859
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:26,070
we don't know the dot net file so any
place you see that it's never been

860
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:28,290
accessed counter 0 that means that's a

861
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:31,890
zone file important that we did and you
can tell that

862
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:36,310
from February of 2011 20 March love

863
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:39,590
2012 they have been using five name
servers

864
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:42,910
and before that they were using 3

865
00:53:42,910 --> 00:53:46,390
okay makes a certain sense

866
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:50,370
where you see the bailiwick about me up
but the counters

867
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:55,450
not zero means is not is on file with
that as a response that came from 10

868
00:53:55,450 --> 00:53:59,520
thing known authority servers for dotnet
kinda have to guess what the Bailey work

869
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,900
was in that case because we're not
concerned the name sir

870
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:06,000
we don't know where they thought they
were week it's it's a it's a reasonable

871
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:06,610
guess

872
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:10,280
arm let's take a look

873
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:15,760
stew similar type of query because I
really am

874
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:19,600
out of time I want to get together

875
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:24,820
the juicy and in here phone search the

876
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:28,750
our data and I'm interested in and

877
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:33,620
that and us

878
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:39,010
last a occurred

879
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:43,250
sorry

880
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:46,250
right so here's all the different

881
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:51,230
domain names peak flow you see quite a
lot of peak flow here that is one of

882
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:55,750
arbors fairly well-known boxers is
pretty much the Cadillac

883
00:54:55,750 --> 00:55:00,250
love NetFlow processing devices if you
wanna do not flow on your

884
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:03,780
looking for something to do it with that
would be my choice

885
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:09,510
my recommendation my Arbor .org looks
like they've got a portal

886
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:14,170
Arbor probably I'll don't even now but I
can certainly find out

887
00:55:14,170 --> 00:55:17,640
they're all a list of all of their

888
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:22,550
all other brands all in this case all of
their networks

889
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:25,750
not that are worse than anything I but
you could imagine that a criminal

890
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:29,380
might not like to be naked in this way
so

891
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:32,610
retailers the implications of this if

892
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:38,360
you come along down my street camera and
you take a picture the front of my house

893
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:41,450
you have not violated my privacy

894
00:55:41,450 --> 00:55:45,380
if you're the Google van and you take
pictures above every house

895
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:49,770
in my old neighborhood new macon indexed

896
00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:53,000
database of these accessible to anyone
in the world

897
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,780
so that anybody conceding my front yard
looks like

898
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:59,900
that starts to make me feel a little bit
squeamish

899
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:03,070
and i feel like i me me deserve some
privacy

900
00:56:03,070 --> 00:56:06,110
at scale that they would not ask for one
by one

901
00:56:06,110 --> 00:56:09,240
and that difference in how I feel is

902
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:13,080
the difference between being able to
find out what's true now

903
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:17,990
by asking questions persons to find out
what has ever been true my looking at

904
00:56:17,990 --> 00:56:21,720
reverse indexed questions arm

905
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:25,140
this again this has been a game-changer

906
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:29,130
I think Florian Weimer for and

907
00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:33,710
through raising visibility of this I
think that we have

908
00:56:33,710 --> 00:56:38,020
taken it to the next level if you would
like access to this either

909
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:41,230
commercial access to this API or just

910
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:45,510
nonprofit do-gooder access because you
like to chase crime and thus can help

911
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:46,880
you

912
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:50,210
drop me a e-mail all talk it over

913
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:54,400
arm effect on drumming up to today and
has to be done

914
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,540
IRC dorgan apply for a log in there

915
00:56:57,540 --> 00:57:02,150
and if when asked you what is your
proposed area research if you say

916
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:06,600
investigating now where that creates
more work for me because I have to ask

917
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:07,590
you what you mean

918
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:10,860
so please be detailed about that

919
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:13,930
please operates answers send us your
data

920
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:17,230
if you are in the business of processing
data please

921
00:57:17,230 --> 00:57:20,280
consider buying a port from us for rent
in a port from us

922
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:24,330
and getting getting access to the real
time data that that backs this and

923
00:57:24,330 --> 00:57:28,010
other similar data it's within the hour

924
00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:32,070
john has a question

925
00:57:32,070 --> 00:57:39,070
I just said used and has to be done I
have seen on organs was at that website

926
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:43,960
now message to GPS

927
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:50,090
my emails for widely known I am all and
returned on work

928
00:57:50,090 --> 00:57:53,430
Paul Red Barn dork or

929
00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:57,560
fixing my last name I have seen or

930
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:00,560
given that a hundred thousand other
people find that email

931
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,690
every day I'm think you should have no
trouble locating

932
00:58:03,690 --> 00:58:07,290
me online yes

933
00:58:07,290 --> 00:58:10,590
i doing anything was like we use data

934
00:58:10,590 --> 00:58:15,100
you just like mission in in terms like
cross-correlation I think we should be

935
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:16,320
like more interesting

936
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:21,810
actually we don't currently have who is
because there are

937
00:58:21,810 --> 00:58:24,890
couple other and it is out there like
super who will start

938
00:58:24,890 --> 00:58:28,420
now .org which is running for office
thing on there are

939
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:31,820
some people who agreed and cash Julio's

940
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:36,670
a and in order to make that work you
have to make a deal with every domain

941
00:58:36,670 --> 00:58:40,930
who is provider because everybody has to
rate limit at this point

942
00:58:40,930 --> 00:58:44,420
and we've decided that that this is a
solved problem

943
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:48,310
thing I'm trying to do is to get the

944
00:58:48,310 --> 00:58:51,910
certain with the re- arson I am a member
of the board of trustees for Aaron

945
00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:55,670
so be in RAR I might have been in with
but also right

946
00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:59,080
United Center I would like to get the
querystring

947
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:02,540
I would like to get all the WHOIS query
is that they receive

948
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:06,940
because most parts now when they start
up to a WHOIS query on their own IP

949
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:09,400
address in order to find out

950
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:12,440
how safe it would be to release them
from here

951
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:15,660
and so these arms are getting

952
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:19,860
bursts love like millions who is queries
per hour

953
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:23,560
when a new botnet starts up and I think
that would that there would be very

954
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,110
interesting

955
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:28,670
picture love you so we are working on
who is channel for the query strangely

956
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:29,060
enough

957
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:32,900
rather than the responses Morris like
passive sensor

958
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:36,260
to grow up to who is requests but arm

959
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:40,330
was the quiz thing there's like there's
no fixed for mint and

960
00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:43,620
it's basically conforms in terms of like
parsing

961
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:46,820
ok with the other problem if you're
going to try and do a permuted index on

962
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:50,010
who is similar to what I have described
for denounced

963
00:59:50,010 --> 00:59:53,970
you would find that you had to do a lot
of free text person which is extremely

964
00:59:53,970 --> 00:59:55,910
expensive and unreliable

965
00:59:55,910 --> 00:59:59,740
um there is always who is working group

966
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:03,240
for the twenty years I've been involved
and ATF

967
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:07,280
we never go more than two years without
a internet-draft proposing

968
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:12,220
unified format for who has on so no
matter what time you decide that you'd

969
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:14,990
like to go help with that there will be
somebody trying to reinvent

970
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:19,970
who is recommend getting involved

971
01:00:19,970 --> 01:00:26,970
years seriously past ten o'clock here so

972
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:35,500
okay thank you both now we have a coffee
break

973
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:42,500
and will be back at 10:30

974
01:00:47,170 --> 01:00:48,650
this

975
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:55,650
sleep
