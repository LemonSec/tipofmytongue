1
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,980
ok

2
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,990
this

3
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:12,730
this

4
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:13,560
this

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,440
slow

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:22,440
sleep

7
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,310
om I wanna start of just a little bit
over useless trivia

8
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:31,410
mister year I'll be talking about that
be talking a little bit about some

9
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,570
how some things were discovered the
techniques are used to discover things

10
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:39,239
and then I'll probably going to be
playing about maybe five or six minutes

11
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:42,700
even longer an actual blue box

12
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,270
in use recorded back in 1975

13
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:49,899
the audio tape is called classic and
stacking

14
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:52,899
and it's from Wide Web dot com

15
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:57,559
laugh own trips what somewhat confining
it's pretty hard to find the website

16
00:00:57,559 --> 00:00:59,120
isn't that easy to get around that

17
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,890
its of classic denim act abusing
excerpts from an audiophile

18
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:07,409
it was recorded by doorbell in 1970 by

19
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:11,110
doorbell was one of the original phone
phreaks that

20
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:14,280
used to frequent the 2111

21
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:20,230
conference 604 2111 so without further
ado

22
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:24,280
let's go into when I won't talk about
here

23
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,350
on talk a little bit about the Apple
stories

24
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:31,740
are starting off with her when the Apple
first came out

25
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,740
the only way you can connect your app to

26
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,550
to a video display is through a video

27
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:43,550
input connector to a TV set not all TV
sets had video input connectors

28
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:47,990
the only other way to do this was with
the modulator which was a small device

29
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:52,030
which you had to purchase separate from
Apple that would allow you to be able to

30
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,170
transmit your Apple screen

31
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,300
to a regular TV set internet channel 3

32
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:02,660
or channel 4 depending on where you're
physically located at this modulator

33
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:08,700
was an additional I additional device
you had to buy separate from Apple many

34
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,920
people have often wondered why you
couldn't connect that might later a

35
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,900
way they didn't design mind later into
the actual Apple to

36
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,950
three words ap see see

37
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:24,860
it is illegal to connect anything under
Part 15 the SEC rules and regulations

38
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:29,190
without having lot ok red take and so

39
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,710
that was sorta by that happen Steve Jobs
and the wise blue boxes

40
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:37,300
talk about those blue boxes steez blue
box had

41
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,990
one major law first the ball it's
frequencies were

42
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:44,630
in were so accurate you've never had the
tune

43
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:49,270
problem is the waveform output was

44
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:52,690
a square wave when you send a square
wave into and

45
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:56,319
analog phone system things come can work
right

46
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,209
you gotta fiddle with it a little coups
a couple runner your mouthpiece

47
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:04,920
get it just exactly right distance apart
and maybe after seven or eight tries

48
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,800
your call will probably go through but
those seven those seven tries you make

49
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,980
that are unsuccessful

50
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,650
those drop a trouble card at the for a
switching

51
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,870
told him and that attract

52
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:21,650
attention and that's exactly how I got
busted I got busted

53
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:25,730
as a friend of mine who wanted me to
build him a blue box

54
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:31,630
I says no way he also knew wise went to
wise by his blue box for 150 bucks

55
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:35,290
and I told which races Richard you don't
want to use this thing you're going to

56
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,209
get into trouble

57
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:40,280
he didn't listen to me another thing
that he did which I really really didn't

58
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:40,720
like

59
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,620
and he really abuse my trust as he took
my phone number

60
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:48,380
using only person I ever give up my
phone number two and a

61
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:51,400
you voted now bad news

62
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,000
used to go back to me time from home
detected it

63
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,360
and a busted him course when he got
busted

64
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,239
my phone book my address with in his
phonebook

65
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,580
and so that was how I got busted so
let's talk a little bit now

66
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:13,060
about to the role that call computer had
with Apple first let me tell you what

67
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,300
call computer is

68
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,889
our computer was one of the very first
timeshare systems

69
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:23,009
you can walk into a store front and get
an account on call computer

70
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:26,569
and use their terminals for 99 cents an
hour

71
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:30,069
and that was that was timeshare for the
rest of us

72
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:34,100
it's a BT I 2000 computer basic only

73
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,919
but you can type your program in a punch
paper tape where you could store it in

74
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:39,800
your own account

75
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,389
and you can run it and I I'd is
completely fell in love with computers I

76
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:44,930
can actually

77
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:48,260
interface with a computer I took
programming on

78
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:51,580
IBM 360 fortran that

79
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:55,440
processing system and I me tell you
programming in that environment

80
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,449
totally suck

81
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:01,760
let's talk about some other
contributions the home computer

82
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,990
revolution

83
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:06,270
I I was there I I witnessed everything

84
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:09,389
I witness was getting together with jobs
I witnessed

85
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:13,550
wise in jobs talking in his garage about
building a computer

86
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:17,040
I saw Steve Jobs's computer 6-bit
computer

87
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,600
I said i think is used by some accounts
up to 64

88
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,630
a good is that and sell but the fact
that he built it on discrete components

89
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,830
was really amazing

90
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:32,040
so when I did soon as the 8080 came out

91
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,830
this is about Mid 1975 cross assemblers

92
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,900
arrested this I used car computer

93
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,680
and a run across December for car
computer from that you could just type

94
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,389
in your assembly language code in

95
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:48,290
ASCII text and it would assemble it
internet ASCII text

96
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:52,690
into machine code and then it would then
use to punch a paper tape

97
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:56,419
and in that paper tape could then be
used to load at loaded into your Altair

98
00:05:56,419 --> 00:05:58,060
eighty computer

99
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:04,500
and a lot min a lot sophisticated
operating system started out that way

100
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,500
and before the Apple there was a TV
terminal TV terminal is

101
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,380
nothing more than device with that RS
232 connector on

102
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:17,970
and help but much later that go to a TV
set a turn your TV set into a terminal

103
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:21,300
before the Homebrew Computer Club there
was the PCC

104
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:26,280
people's computer clock this was a small
little strip mall in Menlo Park

105
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,340
and there's a small little organization
called the people's computer company

106
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:35,540
they had a Pepa there and they were
using and you basic

107
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:39,550
running on this PDPA giving children the
first time

108
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:43,290
an opportunity to sit at a computer
terminal and play games

109
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:46,889
right programs hunt the want this do you
normally do

110
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:51,169
back in net day I'm a lot a prominent
people together

111
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:54,570
I mean wise in jobs I met them they were
already

112
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:59,020
game at a time them I mean there are so
many people that I ran across

113
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,990
and I just witnessed all this very
amazing things

114
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:07,380
that URL on the screen if he would mind
copy that down

115
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:12,150
that is I'm written by Bob last whether
the original founding

116
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:16,009
hollers at the Homebrew Computer Club
and

117
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:19,410
give you a chance to copy that because

118
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:23,860
that is a very interesting perspective
in historical perspective

119
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,150
a day in the life for the complete on
Rue Computer Club

120
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:32,009
in Silicon Valley I also got a lotta
engineering programs on-call computer I

121
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:32,380
was a

122
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:35,850
electrical engineer by trade I went to
college

123
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:39,690
Mikey degree an I designed and developed
a lot of

124
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:43,060
programs using analog analog

125
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:46,340
circuits design complicated Chevy check
another

126
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:50,240
butterworth filter circuit designs for
boys grammar I was using

127
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,250
it was no way I could do that a
calculator

128
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,720
okay hope you guys get the URL copied
down that we can probably get the slide

129
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,240
leader unearthing the car computer did

130
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,490
you the recruited local high school
students to go in and write programs in

131
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:08,759
help that helped the facility %ah

132
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:12,229
get together with writing a lot of
programs and

133
00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:15,330
the put the program's up in the public
library so

134
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:18,759
you see would you wanna program you have
to write yourself you couldn't exactly

135
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:20,550
go to a computer store back then

136
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:23,720
my an exit by a program one other
programs

137
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,169
I wrote was called in dicta this is a
program that I'm using for dictation

138
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:31,509
right book right now Hannes really
useful

139
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:34,690
and maybe when I'm done with that I
could figure out how to market right now

140
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:38,380
it works on a Macintosh and a is it's
really cool

141
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,250
I'm not here to show that program offer
anything but I've been using it quite

142
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,990
extensively in writing the book

143
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,290
Homebrew Computer Club lotsa startups
perhaps

144
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:50,339
from a club there were no corporate
secrets

145
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:55,149
a computer club was such an open
exchange it was just mindboggling

146
00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:59,480
at the very beginning at the club they
had a %ah

147
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,910
they had a I we call

148
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:06,170
a a random access

149
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,930
period and any mapping period mapping
period start off with

150
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:13,350
if there something you wanted to know
about computers it raise your hand

151
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,950
addressed homegroup

152
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:18,230
and you the address the group and then
one or two persons in that group would

153
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,720
raise their hand and say yeah I can help
you

154
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,540
and enacted during the random access
period you could and meet interface

155
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,680
that person have him help you with some
your problems you have when you're

156
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,850
building your first computer is among
the most amazing free exchanges

157
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:34,740
anywhere it wasn't until after somebody
got a hold a bit

158
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,240
are all the paper tape from are

159
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,570
Microsoft's basic and

160
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:45,649
bill %ah Bill Gates wrote a scathing
open letter

161
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:49,000
to the Homebrew Computer Club howdy and

162
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,480
you know and so ticked off that they
were making copies in this basic

163
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,320
programming sharing

164
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,700
bill gates didn't want had anything to
do with that

165
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,930
but it got out and that's what got bill
gates in

166
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:06,730
your and Microsoft started and Bill
Gates actually was the first person

167
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:10,020
ever to consider that programming

168
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:14,270
was closed at idea

169
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:18,140
as as workmen on this was about 1976

170
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:21,769
steve wozniak approach me one day and
said

171
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:24,760
how would you like the bill that
telephone interface board for the Apple

172
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,060
to

173
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,670
ices I'll will I get paid one develop
your

174
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:33,610
he says sure you can work in my office
here in Cupertino

175
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:36,980
and there was a small strip mall in
Cupertino where

176
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:40,180
apple computer had just one big room and
then

177
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:44,110
of to the side was a very small annexed
apple computer

178
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:48,220
for all the really cool stuff was done
and I was in that room there with Steve

179
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,589
Wozniak

180
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:53,480
I Randy Wigginton was one of the first
high school kids

181
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,740
and actually randy was one other person
to who I

182
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:01,490
actually mentor call computer and Mandy
now is still working at Apple right now

183
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,050
he said

184
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:05,649
chief is a big executive making tons and
tons of money

185
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:09,029
anne's in charge a lot of cool things
that Apple

186
00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:12,970
so what did this phone port you it could
just about do

187
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:16,860
anything it could send and receive any
Kong's

188
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:21,040
you can map two-tone gether you can
create any frequencies you want and

189
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,390
match the two tones

190
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,480
to make any digits you want he could do
just about anything

191
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,240
you can detect a difference between a
busy signal ring

192
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,250
you could even recognize certain voice
commands if you knew how to do it right

193
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:39,130
biggest problem lies it was illegal the
connected

194
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:42,209
the phone line you had to buy a 30
dollar-a-month

195
00:11:42,209 --> 00:11:47,620
the vice from Montvale to connect
anything to the phone company

196
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:51,730
and it had all kinds of filters in it
and you couldn't do a lot with it you

197
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:55,500
can control the hooks which you couldn't
control a lot of stuff in the phone

198
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,510
so it just made it impossible to use
which was one of the reasons why

199
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,640
the phone board never saw the light of
day and

200
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,940
I just recently talked to Steve Wozniak
but three weeks gonna ask him

201
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,380
really was that will happen is he said
it just was

202
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:13,360
it was just the market decision Steve
Jobs made back in the day

203
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,459
but word has it that not only was Steve
Jobs contacted by the FBI

204
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:21,600
by AT&T and put a lot of pressure and
legal pressure or not

205
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,839
making a on board see the light of day
I'll

206
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:27,910
with us also the basic three reasons
number one it wasn't really

207
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:31,570
via the product which I disagree number
two

208
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:35,200
it was you had to connect it directly to
the phone line in order to get to work

209
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,649
and do stuff you want to do

210
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:40,670
and of course number three you could be
used for illegal purposes or in other

211
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,200
words

212
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:48,200
it could had illegal Fox so my attorney
said during one of my trials for using

213
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:53,490
begin now also detect in San blue box
tones limited speech recognition is

214
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:56,930
word I'll and I'll with over a third
thirty different responses

215
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:00,089
you can detect another extension phone
an course

216
00:13:00,089 --> 00:13:03,589
Eve box and these are the reasons why

217
00:13:03,589 --> 00:13:07,070
Steve Jobs did actually wanna market

218
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:11,540
however I bet good news I still have the
phone cord

219
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,540
it still exists with my friend in
Sacramento

220
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,810
and it's the regional board my 9

221
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:20,910
not designed it steve wozniak help you
with

222
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:25,510
so it not yet had more chips it also had
better quality comes

223
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:29,290
and better sensitivity because I had to
make a lotta compromises the

224
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:32,880
get reversed or chips Steve Isaac didn't
think I needed

225
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,450
I had and I'm going to release the
schematic diagram

226
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:39,750
up the board don't know when don't bug
me about it

227
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,899
but it's gonna come out eventually and
of course the actual board itself will

228
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:46,390
probably wind up in some museum
somewhere

229
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:50,399
we're negotiating that right now

230
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,820
let's talk a little bit about finding
secret numbers

231
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,870
it is possible like going to any country

232
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:01,540
I'll give russia has as an example in
1988 and went to the soviet union on

233
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,889
I'm kinda like a assistance exchange
program

234
00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:08,980
it was a course during the communist
days when it was called the USSR

235
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:12,720
very strict very dreary very drab

236
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,470
and I just said to myself what can I do
here in the phone system

237
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:21,519
but actually winding up in jail doing
anything first thing I did was

238
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,260
I went to the phone book the phone book
is your best friend

239
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,950
first thing and in the phone book is a
look for all the emergency services

240
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,370
numbers

241
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:32,769
things like Louise fire using those
numbers will have a lot less

242
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:35,990
its dial mostly 3 like in the USA

243
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:41,350
911 emergency work in other countries 11
Francis r1 r2

244
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:44,630
whenever they are those three did
service numbers

245
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:48,430
also can go to very interesting places
you know how to scan

246
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:51,740
and I found lotto really cool numbers
that way

247
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,360
it wasn't long before I found the here
numbered

248
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,610
went into the key TV network and a

249
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:02,600
so with that also because the phone
system was all mechanical

250
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,450
I was able to classics which so you
douse the role

251
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:09,870
on all step 16 your readout does incense

252
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:13,389
10 posts but we're happy send 12 passes

253
00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:16,639
or 11 posts what can you get doing that

254
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,290
well-being some very interesting things
computer access numbers

255
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:23,850
course a very important to get and you
can find those pretty easily

256
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:27,079
just by scanning companies will rarely
hi

257
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:31,480
their computer access numbers in their
PBX is so do you go to accompany see if

258
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,050
they have a PBX

259
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:36,950
you could scan that PBX and probably
within about maybe 3-4 hours

260
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:41,050
you have all their computer access
numbers you look for the unusual

261
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:44,889
and phone book is again your very best
friend

262
00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:48,529
OCC comes OCC stands for

263
00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:51,570
other common carrier in nine

264
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:54,610
keen 79

265
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:59,750
19 eighty AT&T broke up into smaller
phone companies

266
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:03,269
US britt started offering long-distance
service

267
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:06,730
spread originally started from actually
the railroad system

268
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:09,930
the railroad system in the United States
has got

269
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:13,699
are their entire phone directory there
in fire phone network

270
00:16:13,699 --> 00:16:16,959
set up so they can make calls from 13 US
1

271
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,209
%ah railroad station to another it built
its

272
00:16:20,209 --> 00:16:23,920
meeting infrastructure which eventually
turned out to be sprint

273
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,820
have of things but here's what you can
do

274
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,320
let's say you have a credit card ca okay
to hippies used would be used to do is

275
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:31,760
ease

276
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:37,230
do actually are take I can give every
year the phone company have a credit

277
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,889
card code

278
00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:42,199
the credit card co be using the map to
your your phone number

279
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:46,240
like my phone number was 408 266

280
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,339
6666 and my credit card number would be
408

281
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:53,769
666 6666 and then there'd be a

282
00:16:53,769 --> 00:16:57,329
are four-digit number after that and
then

283
00:16:57,329 --> 00:17:01,690
followed with a letter well it didn't
take the hippies long to find out what

284
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:04,589
those credit card codes were in every
time that credit card code

285
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:08,769
every year comes out I'd say within 2-3
months you have the coat

286
00:17:08,769 --> 00:17:12,100
but then you then they started a
queueing a credit card numbers that are

287
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,130
not tied to your phone number

288
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:17,329
will how can you tell unverified this
credit card is good

289
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:20,879
with a blue box can very easily do keep
calls 2013

290
00:17:20,879 --> 00:17:23,909
000 start ago clock clock

291
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:27,669
you're connected into a truck and then
you keep past year your credit card

292
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:28,169
number

293
00:17:28,169 --> 00:17:31,720
come back and I'll say negative -4 say
okay

294
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,690
okay and that operator can use to verify
that credit card number is good

295
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:40,600
be another thing you could do back it
back just about the time

296
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,100
direct Diana credit card calls this
happen

297
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,259
around nineteen eighty in nineteen 81

298
00:17:47,259 --> 00:17:51,700
you get down zero plus the number
normally an operator come on ask you how

299
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,460
you'd like to make

300
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:56,440
call you can make it collects you could
go to credit card number

301
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,700
and the on then we done by the operator
now

302
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,249
then in 1981 the the plate number called

303
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:07,019
zero plus a number if all that with a
credit card number

304
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:10,799
and then a call to go thru and you come
back and say

305
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,909
bong a few dollars you're a posthumous a
farm ATT

306
00:18:14,909 --> 00:18:18,080
and then you just enter your ATT calling
card in the loop

307
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,519
in to put the call through here's the
really interesting thing you could

308
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:25,379
credit card number is your is your
10-digit number plus a four digit code

309
00:18:25,379 --> 00:18:26,519
after that

310
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:29,729
but instead using a four digit code

311
00:18:29,729 --> 00:18:34,139
used ABC dietrich what that is you have
1633

312
00:18:34,139 --> 00:18:38,720
row which is normally not on a
touch-tone phone is a special priority

313
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,470
the military uses well if used abcd

314
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:46,409
instead at four-digit code any number
works your credit card number

315
00:18:46,409 --> 00:18:50,600
and you can make calls anywhere for free

316
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,899
these so-called transition as

317
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:58,570
ATT started breaking up they started
deploying something might be

318
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:03,720
other common carrier coats now to make a
call you can choose which song this is

319
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,710
carrier you want to use to make your
call you could dial 10 to 80

320
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:10,989
follow that with the area code and
number your call go through

321
00:19:10,989 --> 00:19:15,399
AT&T if the dow 10 to 22 follow that
with the record number

322
00:19:15,399 --> 00:19:20,470
a call be handled by Sprint you go up to
Berkeley payphone

323
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:24,200
to 57 and you down 10 to 22

324
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,720
follow that with a record number and the
call would go through

325
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:32,200
berkeley being a college town shame on
the phone company for allowing that

326
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,879
exploit happen

327
00:19:33,879 --> 00:19:38,149
it really working at work from
eight-month when he finally sat down

328
00:19:38,149 --> 00:19:41,809
and there is 950 members 950 numbers
where

329
00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:45,720
numbers with recombination a week RC 08

330
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,139
when a recombination away means you can
call numbers from pay phones at a

331
00:19:49,139 --> 00:19:49,869
payphone

332
00:19:49,869 --> 00:19:53,440
on phone it's free down 950

333
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,129
108 get a thong dial your number in
Congress

334
00:19:57,129 --> 00:20:00,320
you is no you can't help but I'm at a
payphone just goes through

335
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,509
works beautifully so these some this

336
00:20:03,509 --> 00:20:06,759
come in the numbers that you can do
kinda been review our you got

337
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:10,570
got numbers like the police or fire
phone repair you've got mechanical

338
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:11,279
switches

339
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:14,739
you can flash sex which that doesn't
really work anymore in today's

340
00:20:14,739 --> 00:20:18,779
today's phone system cuz are all
electronic now they're all digital

341
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:22,639
so you pretty much not really pan on
mechanical switches

342
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:26,710
with you happen to be in such a backward
country that they're still using

343
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:31,009
recognition what you when kinda error
code you get when you make a call is

344
00:20:31,009 --> 00:20:32,470
also important

345
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:36,249
macon you make a call and it'll come
back and it'll give you like a busy

346
00:20:36,249 --> 00:20:37,169
signal

347
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:41,119
where to come back and we'll say awesome
like work all we're sorry your call did

348
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:42,749
not go through

349
00:20:42,749 --> 00:20:45,830
this is recording there's a four digit
number after

350
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:50,200
2132 2013 says that the two and three
exchange

351
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,249
area code X truck Camelback call

352
00:20:53,249 --> 00:20:57,659
the two is that is a number 148 took
that call

353
00:20:57,659 --> 00:21:01,169
and then of course a sixteen 33
information Creek you could be in

354
00:21:01,169 --> 00:21:02,809
information operator

355
00:21:02,809 --> 00:21:07,279
by just simply going calling your
information

356
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:10,609
I and then you put in 1633 Tom

357
00:21:10,609 --> 00:21:14,599
and you can intercept information calls
by doing

358
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:18,789
it's great fun hundred-numbers let's
talk a little bit now perhaps blue boxes

359
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:21,700
working when it became such a problem
with the phone company

360
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:25,330
shame on the phone company for allowing
in dancing going to work

361
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:28,669
that was one of the most stupid asinine
things anybody

362
00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:32,299
ever do and to think that mom Bell AT&T

363
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:35,340
the big monopoly could actually be so
cheap

364
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:39,249
as use the same channel for both your
speech signaling

365
00:21:39,249 --> 00:21:42,769
it was amazing that would actually
happen

366
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:45,869
so these Tom r6 tongs

367
00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:48,970
and their group into a binary
arrangement

368
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:52,919
tones are 700 hurts 900 hurts

369
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:57,080
1100 1500 and 1700 hurts

370
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,349
the stones RI because they're

371
00:22:00,349 --> 00:22:03,359
because when you combine them together
don't in their monthly

372
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:07,169
together this one of the reasons why
there that there that way

373
00:22:07,169 --> 00:22:10,869
sought to make a number 5 with me

374
00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:13,999
you would have the tone for four

375
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,349
which should be 1500 and the tone for
one

376
00:22:17,349 --> 00:22:21,289
which should be 700 so 1500 700

377
00:22:21,289 --> 00:22:25,799
would be digit 5 3 would be

378
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:28,919
700 plus nine hundred

379
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:32,330
I 700 actually would be the would equal
to that

380
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:35,960
equal the value 0 900 would be the value

381
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,869
one 1102 be to

382
00:22:39,869 --> 00:22:46,080
1500 would be for and 1700 is a special
town used for opening and closing your

383
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:46,919
call

384
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:50,669
start of the KeePass all that with the
phone number

385
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:54,309
and then you go to start and the call
would go through

386
00:22:54,309 --> 00:22:58,849
so now I'm gonna give you a little
demonstration with this would sound like

387
00:22:58,849 --> 00:23:03,419
you actually done we have are you ready

388
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:09,109
all dialing a number

389
00:23:09,109 --> 00:23:16,109
snapped number all now

390
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:32,350
this is narrated the doorbell by the way

391
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:35,790
the number that's ringing at this point
doesn't matter what's important is that

392
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:39,420
this call is gone over a trunk from New
York to a distant for a

393
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:46,420
which can be reset by 2600 that's the
supervision handshake

394
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,220
of work on ok and now it's waiting for
new digits

395
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:59,220
which been will supply those are not at
home when he dialed was

396
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:02,660
216 054 064

397
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:07,860
these are old ruling goods the network
in the nineteen seventies had

398
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:11,540
routing codes for tandems in all major
cities

399
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:15,190
the first code 216 054

400
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:18,690
is the really good for Youngstown Ohio
be

401
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:22,340
064 in the are you could have to 16

402
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:27,090
is the ruling code for Canton Ohio both
of these across party and inns

403
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:30,380
when then he's in the sequence before a

404
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:34,520
into which he is key picks up the trunk
to Youngstown Ohio

405
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:41,400
and sends 064 that tick is the for a
cutting through to Youngstown Ohio after

406
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,170
having sent

407
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:46,700
064 now what does Youngstown do with the
064

408
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:50,500
well it picks up the trunk to Canton
that's the code for Canton

409
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:55,490
but having been sent only the routing
code: and no digits to follow it it

410
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:56,110
simply

411
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:59,420
dumpsters into the Canton trunk without
sending any

412
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:05,960
in other words its tax that's the sound
of Youngstown Ohio dumping it into a

413
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,360
drunk to Canton and

414
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:12,240
and that's the handshake from can't
Canton Ohio

415
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,550
is now ready to receive its okay do you
notice there that

416
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:20,200
the the first time heard heard a
handshake there was just a very

417
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,800
short literature that surfaced 2600
stone

418
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,750
the second time it routed to the stack
there if you notice there was

419
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:31,280
Kutcher very close together and almost
hard to detect

420
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,740
I spotted a point that out because this
is some this is basically

421
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:38,020
the whole concept how you could stack
tens

422
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:41,300
stacking 10 is something really cause
the phone company

423
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:47,650
major headaches thats 054

424
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:51,990
064 this causes can to pick up the trunk
to Youngstown and send

425
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:56,809
064 now we're in Youngstown again which

426
00:25:56,809 --> 00:26:01,280
stacks in the canton and in Canton and

427
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:05,450
gives us the handshake three years into
another 05 4064

428
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:10,179
now read Youngstown again

429
00:26:10,179 --> 00:26:14,510
Youngstown stacks to Canton and

430
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:20,710
that's the handshake and here we go
again same did its

431
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:24,570
Youngstown Canton where

432
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:31,550
and sick now the connection is gone so
long that the handshake is all you can

433
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:31,900
hear

434
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:37,260
me an act now on that supervision place
you couldn't really hear

435
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:40,260
multiple links both on the of work can
be on

436
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:45,030
is going around again

437
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:48,179
me and

438
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:52,040
that was such a short flies that you
didn't get to hear all the on

439
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:55,179
so there you have what it would sound
like

440
00:26:55,179 --> 00:26:59,730
we're actually stacking can which is
kinda cool actually

441
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:05,660
this is a little bit of a procedure how
you actually do this

442
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:09,179
placing a call normally what with
barbell did he was just

443
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:12,260
downing a normal seven digit number be
paid

444
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:16,240
that call he didn't Lee defraud the
phone company when he did that

445
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,570
he was just basically demonstrating what
you can do

446
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:22,890
how you can exceed take to number one
crossbar switches

447
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:26,240
and and inner and incoming interface
between them

448
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,460
going from one to the other act from one
to the other and you could look as many

449
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,590
times as you can

450
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:34,110
eventually what happens the connection
get so bad that the tones that go

451
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:34,700
through

452
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:38,790
aren't really gonna be registered
anymore and I you can get about that I

453
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:39,770
think the biggest

454
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:44,070
record was I think thirty or forty winks
and there's another way of stacking

455
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,950
tenants to it is little bit more

456
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:49,110
with little bit more finesse actually
developed a technique

457
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:52,929
by understanding how the how the band
with the phone call is

458
00:27:52,929 --> 00:27:58,440
the telephone frequency response along
this is caused from 300 3,000 hurts

459
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,540
26 on it is just above the upper ed

460
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:04,610
that I love that that

461
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:10,490
bandwidth if you happen to send II 3200
hurts along with the 2600

462
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:14,500
hurts there's one group little our
technologies

463
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:18,460
phone company put into their network
that will actually pre then

464
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:21,700
you from %ah disconnect your call

465
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,870
if you have a very high pitch woman on
the phone talking

466
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:28,890
okay and sell to prevent that from
happening what they'd done as they put

467
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:29,140
it

468
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:33,400
II system electronics together called
the guard band

469
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,070
guard band with guard Ben does guard
bien basically

470
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:40,919
if there's any other frequency b-sides
26 senate President in

471
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:45,740
in the audio channel than that 2600 will
not trip to call and disconnect your

472
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,720
call

473
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,419
and a many many people have complained
initially when the first but the system

474
00:28:50,419 --> 00:28:52,340
together

475
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:56,140
they were getting disconnected so by

476
00:28:56,140 --> 00:29:00,169
I exploiting this limitation in the
garden and what you can do is you can

477
00:29:00,169 --> 00:29:02,030
put 3200 hurts

478
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:05,590
along with the 26 on your 3202 level

479
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:11,510
you need to be able to adjust its volume
leave the 2600 volume exactly the same

480
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:15,290
so when you start your call you keep
your 3200 canelo

481
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:19,120
and each time you loop through you could
push yourself forward

482
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,300
each time adding little bit more 3202

483
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:26,260
guard that ban and you can go through
and you can hop on hop hop so that the

484
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:29,550
and office cuz we need ripped

485
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:33,800
you dropped the call our trip to call
you not going to land locally anymore

486
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,520
you can land distant drunk he keep
pushing herself forward pushing yourself

487
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,429
cord

488
00:29:38,429 --> 00:29:42,150
and I'm high near that technique going
in about 10 hops at it but you don't

489
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:42,870
have

490
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:46,220
you not just restricted just using
number one cross-party

491
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:50,030
do with any work nasa need very powerful

492
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:53,750
so after sending a 10 per discomforts
tony was the handshake

493
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,820
you keep also a good number start and
that's lameee

494
00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:00,750
call now how did

495
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:05,960
are the blue how did the Esquire
magazine article came to be

496
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,090
there was this guide on ballenger he was
like

497
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:12,190
one of these mafia type persons

498
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:17,190
he built the blue box he was using
information number to call he would call

499
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,630
555 1212 numbers

500
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:23,030
if your area code 555 1212

501
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:26,200
call information operator that's a free
call

502
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,179
but when you call information operators
when she picks up the phone

503
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:33,460
you don't get that on hook signal roth
looks sick

504
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:39,409
it just shows still it's on huh so if
you make the call with 555 1212

505
00:30:39,409 --> 00:30:43,830
on said you see a lot of 555 1212 bill
is complete cause which is never

506
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,179
supposed to happen

507
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:49,150
you get busted pretty quick and that's
how I got busted human contact one is

508
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:50,780
but he's run rose in town

509
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:55,230
who wrote the esquire article and then
it was Steve Jobs

510
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:59,179
did to basically up

511
00:30:59,179 --> 00:31:02,250
cock Wozniak in the making a blue box
wise

512
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:06,120
complied he made a blue box but he
didn't know the frequencies

513
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,860
is a as particle would not give you
those frequencies

514
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:13,530
so of steve did was went down the
Stanford University at Bell System

515
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:14,530
technical journal

516
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:18,270
years with the lou back stones were
right there for all to see

517
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:21,409
again a really stupid mistake on their
part

518
00:31:21,409 --> 00:31:25,429
well in 1964 1968 I joined the US Air
Force

519
00:31:25,429 --> 00:31:28,530
I got stationed at probably one of the
most worth

520
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:31,720
places in the world be I mean this place
is real Seattle

521
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,100
way up in alaska way above north of the
Arctic Circle

522
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:39,300
I have had gas station up there for a
year and

523
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:42,880
I occupied myself to happen the military
phone system

524
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,850
they have their own separate phone
system totally separate from the

525
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:47,290
civilian system

526
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:50,419
but I can call basis that that are

527
00:31:50,419 --> 00:31:53,840
close by at a local call to San Jose

528
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,640
one of them was alman an Air Force
Station which is big radar system

529
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:01,140
said away on top of a mountain and I can
just call them

530
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:04,940
and then ask that switchboard operator
to connect me to a local sends a number

531
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,899
and that I can make free calls

532
00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:11,460
but other than also you can also do a
lot of other things the on

533
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:14,850
you got different flashing priorities
like you got

534
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:18,200
for those reels a priority a priority
flash

535
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,179
get flash over right it's the highest
priority and once you put a call to with

536
00:32:22,179 --> 00:32:23,340
flash override

537
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:26,440
man everybody wakes up so it's all

538
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,630
internal a military phone system they
thought

539
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:33,360
there was no way do you go from the
civilian that work to the military

540
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,840
wrong there are two points one nicholson
Creek Alaska

541
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,540
and also Murphy Dom alaska which uses
the same

542
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:46,419
fun for both military and civilian use

543
00:32:46,419 --> 00:32:49,419
all you have to do with you just had to
come in

544
00:32:49,419 --> 00:32:53,659
at the right track level to do it you
cokie pols

545
00:32:53,659 --> 00:32:57,159
9 907 its record for Alaska

546
00:32:57,159 --> 00:33:00,580
940 9501

547
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:03,990
start he goes through Guard Band through

548
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:07,520
being oh you're on the Autobahn you saw
use

549
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,690
used keep all ski pass one people's to

550
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:14,169
those for the priority calls you can
make priority military calls

551
00:33:14,169 --> 00:33:17,560
on the on book the US Air Force the Army
the Navy

552
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:21,260
and the federal telephone system with
are using at system

553
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:25,220
and to a bridge existed if you don't
know ask up until about nineteen

554
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:30,840
eighty one mean you're really earlier
nature

555
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,870
all right now minor thing on one of the
talk about a little bit

556
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:38,480
is some I currently my little views on
current events

557
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,770
not miss everybody knows about anonymous
they I can say one thing for sure about

558
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:43,580
these guys

559
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:47,919
they really had given the authority to
wake up call I support them in that way

560
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,830
people need to get woke up about what's
going on I think these guys doing a good

561
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:51,810
job

562
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:55,480
not that I support a lot of their other
stuff they did Sunday

563
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,510
well not so well informed on this issue
last I heard he was still at the

564
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:00,620
Ecuadorian Embassy in London

565
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:03,929
and I take down that URL called YouTube
dot com

566
00:34:03,929 --> 00:34:08,100
what's that's the URL for the anonymous

567
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:11,759
heights but an hour have documentary on
anonymous I highly recommend you watch

568
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,760
it

569
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,889
in a change your views on anonymous

570
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:19,839
I tell you when I watched it sure well
me up I was really amazed

571
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:24,470
an as far as Manning's concern with my
familiarity with the military

572
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:28,190
I doubt it many ever see the light of
day for it very long time

573
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:32,589
when he did with absolutely unforgivable
as far as the military goes

574
00:34:32,589 --> 00:34:35,669
I was bad bad bad however

575
00:34:35,669 --> 00:34:39,159
their West there were some issues in
their where you know he brought to light

576
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:42,089
certain very important issues

577
00:34:42,089 --> 00:34:45,149
%ah the next 11 talk about now

578
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:48,339
is my mime

579
00:34:48,339 --> 00:34:52,100
my ideas abusing crunch creations

580
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:55,560
I thought prince pieces about a year and
a half ago an

581
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,890
got great patience I napped that's my
client facing page

582
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:03,260
so if your client want services I you go
there you get an idea

583
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:07,660
what we do and there's a block
discussion block grants creations dot

584
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:08,710
com

585
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:12,580
and what we're doing billion
members-only web franchise

586
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:17,130
where if you re: qualified member and to
get be a member of country asians you

587
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:22,030
really gotta know your stuff so far
about 20 indian programmers applied

588
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:25,560
not twenty have field miserably is this
is how

589
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:29,319
this suspect we r your if you're really
good

590
00:35:29,319 --> 00:35:33,109
and want to get involved in this kinda
ask how I recommend

591
00:35:33,109 --> 00:35:37,460
billing really nice where web franchise
where people can collaborate with

592
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:42,660
businesses Inc you contact work with a
very large projects

593
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:46,830
I you can collaborate with your client
in with your project leader

594
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:50,710
and your project we would have access to
all the work that you do

595
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:54,270
and will help to organize your work and

projects

597
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,930
it still in design phase right now but
is probably one thing that's

598
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:06,230
really really cool and a I'm replanted
proud to be part of it

599
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:09,330
and i really wanna see other people try

00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,540
Eagle weisel this is another little pet
project in mine

605
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:29,050
%ah I've always been into building
sustainable communities

606
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:32,740
ever since the zero our whole economy in
our host

607
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:36,700
infrastructure is falling apart as we
speak

608
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:40,190
there's gas prices getting and same
expensive right now

609
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:43,710
note on what's going to happen five
years or ten years from now

610
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:47,990
and there was a little experiment Donna
on a TV program called the one hundred

611
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:48,770
miles

612
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:51,850
challenge what you what you had to do

613
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:56,480
it took about maybe six or seven family
scattered throughout the United States

614
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:01,940
and the challenge them to only get food
within 100 miles away the live

615
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:05,190
every single one of those six family
says failed miserably

616
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:08,890
they cannot get food within 100 miles
they've either had

617
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:12,080
to stop the program well they've had two

618
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:16,080
use other you know do not do it your
groceries the you getting your grocery

619
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,460
store in the US

620
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:20,970
ship from thousands miles away wut
happens wen et shipments

621
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:24,100
what happens when that shipping
infrastructure fails how are you

622
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:27,560
eat then okay so lot of stuff that we're
doing any good

623
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:31,050
is that we're building new ideas and
energy generation and storage

624
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:35,339
for instance I ultracapacitors which
show a lot of promise

625
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:40,040
allow you to build a charge very very
quickly with humongous amount of power

626
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,900
and there's research being done by fast
caps systems

627
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:49,920
I dot dot com and ascap systems is a
company that was

628
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,460
granted I think like 20 million dollar
grant from the company

629
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:56,740
Smit year is a graduate

630
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:59,870
work did some research in nanotechnology

631
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:04,109
using are using result capacitors and
you're able to rival

632
00:38:04,109 --> 00:38:08,630
a lithium-ion batteries my storage
density sauce lot good exciting things

633
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:09,380
happening

634
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:15,250
in store in the future are so what we do
is we address sustainability in both

635
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:20,030
financial even financial sustainability
is getting to be really bad right now

636
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:23,900
all economic system the United States I
could be one big Ponzi scheme

637
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:27,490
its gonna collapse unless we do
something about it energy transportation

638
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:28,700
food and water

639
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:32,150
all these things are very important to
consider in the future and building on

640
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:34,810
your sustainable community we're gonna
be doing

641
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:38,740
you can actually be building a virtual
community online

642
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:42,300
and putting together the to people who
have the

643
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:48,800
knowledge the build-up power systems
have the mechanical knowledge to build a

644
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,000
anything that they want for their
community including leadership and

645
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,450
everything else like that

646
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:57,930
and that's what we're doing we're kinda
exposing visitors new all technologies

647
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:01,870
to make things work other projects have
involved in a course is my book and

648
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:03,609
movie projects

649
00:39:03,609 --> 00:39:06,680
documentary out called hacked this movie
its site

650
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:10,819
company works in progress you could
probably google it get an idea

651
00:39:10,819 --> 00:39:14,130
needed 2 trailer and

652
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:18,120
my my book I'm working on right now I'm
bout

653
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:21,780
me twelve chapters in my book i've
interviewed

654
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:25,180
probably close to 30 people so far

655
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:28,710
unfortunately I didn't get a chance to
interview jobs in time

656
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:32,640
before he passed but I did get a lot a
really cool information

657
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,630
and I can't wait tell you about that
book I have you gotten get

658
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:40,630
an read it and could

659
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:44,830
I'm been doing lottery search I would
say eighty to ninety percent among

660
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:46,589
effort and working on this book has been

661
00:39:46,589 --> 00:39:49,859
research research and research I mean

662
00:39:49,859 --> 00:39:52,910
lotsa stuff I did and I have to go back
over

663
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:56,250
and look for my best friend is wiki
pedia

664
00:39:56,250 --> 00:40:01,390
and Facebook and LinkedIn those three
sources that I use

665
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:04,460
for my research because

666
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:07,900
princess I want two dates the Homebrew
Computer Club how we keep

667
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:12,290
he is God okay so I use a lot of this
information from live

668
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:15,620
sources and putting together all this
information into

669
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:18,900
very comprehensive book the book is
about me

670
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:22,930
the book is now mind life how I started

671
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:26,740
where I grew up where out when I grew up

672
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:30,030
what my my struggles in life were from
the

673
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:33,540
day I was born right now so that but my
book is

674
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:37,319
not going to be a a book on how to phone
free

675
00:40:37,319 --> 00:40:41,310
thats that book is coming out next year
and netbook is by

676
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:44,430
I feel Lapsley to book on phone phreaks

677
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:47,910
and that bugs gonna be all the technical
gory stuff used to do in phone phreaks I

678
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:50,720
highly recommend it that but to it comes
out

679
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:54,580
but thats pretty much so what i did. an
Steve Jobs

680
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:58,569
course in the squire just recently
passed he was a very very

681
00:40:58,569 --> 00:41:01,609
%ah very one of them are amazing hackers
in

682
00:41:01,609 --> 00:41:05,290
in Amsterdam in the Netherlands he
developed lotta

683
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:09,029
really cool projects one of which is
called Final Scratch

684
00:41:09,029 --> 00:41:13,970
which is a DJ system have the special
vinyl records got

685
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:18,060
time code stamps on it and you could
spend its practices regular records inc

686
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,290
do this with mp3 files instead of going
on

687
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:25,350
fine records were amazing system

688
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:29,120
at this point %ah I guess I can stop now
for questions

689
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:32,580
I'm a little early in ending so are you
got all this time that you can ask

690
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:33,279
questions

691
00:41:33,279 --> 00:41:36,980
go back and review anything you want to
ask me

692
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:42,560
and a so I can only see a pic too well
so

693
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,950
and then of course last and final thing

a Google Voice phone

698
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:08,589
based in the USA can reach me I can pick
up these calls anywhere on the internet

699
00:42:08,589 --> 00:42:15,589
so you have any questions at this point

700
00:42:18,779 --> 00:42:21,700
you if you guys want

701
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:24,730
is within this time remaining: I can go
back and play some that

702
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:30,849
some that that tandem stacking thing in
this half

703
00:42:30,849 --> 00:42:37,849
you've been listening to the beginning
of the original 1975 take stretched

704
00:42:38,069 --> 00:42:42,559
to allow me to describe what's going on
let me go back and play this part again

705
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:49,559
without stopping to talk and that

706
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:25,490
for and

707
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:32,490
and

708
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:40,780
me and

709
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:49,110
the

710
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:54,200
listen to the longest act like it fine
in all the tape libraries

711
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:58,040
missus pounds right one longest attack
town believes in

712
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:01,280
toward the end this tape I don't let
your laser its

713
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:05,380
there are few above what I think are
nonessential links

714
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:08,430
in the middle of it and so on

715
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:11,900
you know with the path once this when he
didn't record the setup %ah

716
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:15,710
he just you know stacked it up and that
was enough to know where he went

717
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:19,080
yeah I would too thank

718
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:22,120
and back its prime you can I crash

719
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:25,720
and then my disconnect America

720
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:30,200
ACA there there are you and i'd

721
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,630
and from the main thing maybe okay

722
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:39,210
at came back now I'm receiving an

723
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:43,360
an international crime and punishment
did this with 25 laps

724
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:50,360
you can switch between the two thousand
unfortunately one his limbs is not

725
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:51,900
really

726
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:58,900
ford's that actually is needed again

727
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:19,880
you can

728
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:26,690
with you

729
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:31,339
an hour disconnect which you hearing
their

730
00:45:31,339 --> 00:45:35,810
are he goes to the called phone and then
he flashes

731
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:40,440
calling phone just long enough not to
disconnect

732
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,869
with just cost the flashing the Gulf
from one to the other

733
00:45:43,869 --> 00:45:49,270
so what happens is on one line it goes
from being really really weakening

734
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:52,810
closely for sequestering closer on the
other phone line

735
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:56,640
it starts released really strong

736
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:00,130
in getting weaker and weaker and weaker
and weaker and so you're actually seeing

737
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:00,730
it from

738
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:04,740
both ends and then this is gonna be part
of the disconnect the 1i largest

739
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:11,740
tennis tax we did now

740
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:23,980
that's it that's like

741
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:27,500
very very long stack it took quite a bit
at times set that up

742
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:31,339
but that every time he had ulterior
what's happening is

743
00:46:31,339 --> 00:46:34,720
want of only just collapsing down after
you

744
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:38,440
disconnected and what you're looking
your look what you're listening to your

745
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:38,920
look

746
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:42,500
listening to the called the phone this
is the phone

747
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:45,790
you call and then when you hang up
calling

748
00:46:45,790 --> 00:46:49,740
phone then you just listen to the call
phone in the car

749
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:53,890
known as we heard all that collapsing go
down it is getting closer and closer and

750
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:55,550
closer and closer you call in 20

751
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:58,910
finally the last truck this completely
goes away be

752
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:03,020
in its than at in that connects is
collapse and that was the whole thing

753
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:06,400
and the whole purpose attendance thank
you see how big it was tennis

754
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,970
FB get and and we believe found a lot of
really cool things

755
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:15,020
%ah another thing to IHS Global Times
back local tennis

756
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:18,750
acting as we're actually stacking %ah
with a

757
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:22,109
overseas lines like in the UK

758
00:47:22,109 --> 00:47:25,589
used 2280 kurds with Aaron man
signalling

759
00:47:25,589 --> 00:47:30,480
into work but in the UK they got it they
don't have sixty translation

760
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,890
so you have to know in order for you to
call from area to area be

761
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:38,970
you have to know that area a code is
area be

762
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:43,000
because you're over an area see him on a
call area be you can use the same

763
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,140
code everything every every area you
have within the UK

764
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:50,320
is God different code do

765
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:54,430
and until then they went need
standardize things they call it s

766
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:57,440
key subscriber trunk dialing

767
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:01,640
that was the first time its standard
could became use in the UK

768
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:06,270
late call from one city the next and
their signal used 2280

769
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:09,599
in Australia you 600 herds

770
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:13,960
so by using these different towns you
can go from country to country

771
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:17,550
the hop around inside this country than
you can snap over to another country

772
00:48:17,550 --> 00:48:20,859
hop inside that country that back in the
United States

773
00:48:20,859 --> 00:48:24,320
I've been there like that big damage
thank you just heard and then go over to

774
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,030
Australia

775
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:28,570
something over there then disconnect the
call we did that

776
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:32,730
Anton you it was amazing the quality of
the audio

777
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:36,400
so bad you just add Shaw here here

778

speech

782
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:57,609
you mention that mornin systems the used
owns more left mom systems

783
00:48:57,609 --> 00:49:01,339
mom phone systems right yeah especially
modern countries

784
00:49:01,339 --> 00:49:05,230
use it on systems arm I think you'll be
happy to know

785
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:08,810
arm in some countries including
Singapore are

786
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:12,400
the pool systems to on like and even
Singapore I'm

787
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,910
you know I'm present their block old
form which is using

788
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:20,050
put me on Paul's visit SoCal I plug it
in I was very surprised to hear the

789
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:20,589
storm

790
00:49:20,589 --> 00:49:24,170
and my sister works so you hear the 2600

791
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:28,700
sure probably from a room I'm not expert
I just trying to give you idea

792
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:32,440
them addresses surprise the answer there
are still come

793
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:36,119
countries use in ya so probably the
supportive

794
00:49:36,119 --> 00:49:40,349
arm so is just measure for you probably
can stoop wages

795
00:49:40,349 --> 00:49:43,640
all system buy the same time Francis the
dome

796
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:47,099
arm new system urged to become more
complicated if you have more stuff to

797
00:49:47,099 --> 00:49:47,690
put your

798
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:52,550
completed computers so I guess it's a
big draw for your

799
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:56,220
if are you interested to example yes
it's very interesting

800
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:59,530
you have any reporting in your head you
was there

801
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:02,589
you'd have been reported that did you
married him

802
00:50:02,589 --> 00:50:06,500
okay I would like that heard that tape
you did I will help you analyze it

803
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:09,839
there aren't there I think as far as I
know

804
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:12,980
their places in police which is in
Central America

805
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:17,050
where you could where they still use in
band signaling

806
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:20,109
so as I was saying earlier let me the
misspelling mister so

807
00:50:20,109 --> 00:50:23,550
are a lot of times and then maybe the
ESC article maybe some articles they say

808
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:24,099
that

809
00:50:24,099 --> 00:50:27,180
I talk on one phone is a fifteen twenty
second the layer

810
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:31,109
minutes away were here the boys coming
out there there was going on minute

811
00:50:31,109 --> 00:50:32,800
delay is this couple seconds by

812
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,000
about maybe three or four seconds delay

813
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,599
I because these connections were pretty
fast

814
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:43,930
but the delays it is the quality the
connection with you so bad

815
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:47,869
and just to see how you can just push
the audio push those old

816
00:50:47,869 --> 00:50:51,819
thankyou step 16 into something that can
be just

817
00:50:51,819 --> 00:50:56,170
amazingly interesting and the fact that
we will do this

818
00:50:56,170 --> 00:51:00,970
analog instead a digital I kinda like
makes it for a really cool

819
00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:04,700
thing and I'm really glad I was able to
share some with these

820
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:08,650
all the analog stuff with you guys
because

821
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:12,849
then the circuits exist anymore they're
all past history

822
00:51:12,849 --> 00:51:16,750
the last multi-frequency I

823
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:20,170
rock died 9 he

824
00:51:20,170 --> 00:51:24,410
now in 20 I 20

825
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:27,790
0 for yeah actually that was like

826
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:31,569
right about the time I was here jack in
the box about a month or so before I

827
00:51:31,569 --> 00:51:33,740
came here my first check in the box

828
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:37,150
talk and I got invited

829
00:51:37,150 --> 00:51:40,260
by the owner the phone company

830
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:43,580
as a press think is that with a word
they were retiring there

831
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:48,859
the last 2600 bowling I respectfully
decline because in California

832
00:51:48,859 --> 00:51:52,050
possession and use them blue boxes still
illegal

833
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:56,580
even though the never work so if you
have one

834
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:59,560
technically illegal but i dont you could
do anything eight years there yourself

835
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:00,410
with one

836
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:03,790
there is something very interesting to
and that is there's the MF

837
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:07,020
project are and there's an eight
hundred-number

838
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:10,660
not even is a number you can call and
you could

839
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:14,250
blue box on then on that call on
controlled things with it

840
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:17,589
make calls pat yourself through and

841
00:52:17,589 --> 00:52:21,069
they're using an aspect PBX box on and
the bill

842
00:52:21,069 --> 00:52:24,400
the mall %ah all technology

843
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:28,200
they could use the 2600 down you switch
from one

844
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:31,330
back to the other using that technology

845
00:52:31,330 --> 00:52:34,869
sorta like kinda plaything we can play
around you blue boxes

846
00:52:34,869 --> 00:52:38,420
to happen at one you can go to the MM
