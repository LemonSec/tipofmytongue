1
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:11,519
up

2
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:12,330
this

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,150
space

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:21,150
skills

5
00:00:25,349 --> 00:00:30,660
good morning everyone welcome to the
second day of

6
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,130
back in the box security conference 2012
Malaysia

7
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:37,750
on XP Kerr is Stefano's the narrow

8
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,600
assistant professor quality

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,719
technical the Milano Atlas

10
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:48,890
boss thank you very much

11
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:53,749
good morning its very early sell I would
sign the AM Best's

12
00:00:53,749 --> 00:00:58,050
not to be too too boring

13
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,109
if they see you nodding off I would try
to stop

14
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:05,180
some I my name is Stefano

15
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,909
I work at Politecnico di Milano which is

16
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:12,390
%ah milan's University of Technology

17
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:17,810
we have 38,000 students working on
branches of computer

18
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:21,270
and non-computer engineering I'm

19
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:26,100
my talk today is about its how do we

20
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,520
analyze out to magically modeler

21
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,180
and if someone as seen the presentation
yesterday

22
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,260
I V France grades system that was
delivered

23
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:40,580
op this is pretty much complimentary

24
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:45,600
22 what has been shown yesterday so you
can you can compare it to talk soon find

25
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,540
connections

26
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:53,540
I'm so I'd like to start with the usual
boring quotation from

27
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:58,300
soon sOooo %ah which serves only to
score a point

28
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,790
and the point is that in the

29
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:05,390
battle against mahler %ah

30
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:09,629
there's a significant problem of
knowledge and the proof nah leads

31
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,709
can be easily not summarize

32
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:16,160
like this are

33
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,250
mahler

34
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,769
has been and the roots of several
security problems

35
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:29,920
sees a number of views you can find

36
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,769
meekly point and stalk on 10th the

37
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:38,900
tells the story of the bottle against
mom but there's been a significant

38
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,290
change

39
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:44,340
that they would like to focus on and
this significant change

40
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,989
is that while in the nineties mom where
was about

41
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:53,430
explosive the fusion of self-replicating
cold

42
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,510
so-called that was always seem enough to
itself

43
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:00,730
in the 2010 ends Mahler's about

44
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:05,469
the stealthy a slow diffusion of code
that does not actually self-replicating

45
00:03:05,469 --> 00:03:09,060
most cases it's just delivered by
drive-by installation

46
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,079
and which is always difference

47
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:17,859
or it has many many different variations

48
00:03:17,859 --> 00:03:22,010
because people keep updating and this

49
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:25,989
changes the nature of the problems from
optically because

50
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:29,189
the solution that we have to this
problem

51
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:32,900
the make the

52
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:37,459
made up solution that we have to this
problem is axle listing

53
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:40,569
known my leashes fights

54
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:44,719
which is a very good approach if you're
dealing with a lot of cool biz

55
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:49,999
the same thing or are reasonably good
approach if you're dealing with a lot of

56
00:03:49,999 --> 00:03:50,480
cops

57
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,790
the same but it's a very bad proach

58
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:58,310
if you are dealing with different things
because then

59
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:02,019
what's your Tang is something like this
this is

60
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:05,790
live statistics from virus the law for
the last

61
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:08,840
week about

62
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,779
detection ratio of antivirus es

63
00:04:12,779 --> 00:04:16,180
so each of these columns is a commercial
anti-virus

64
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,260
and the I'm

65
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,830
orange ratio is actually the one that
you want to look at which is the

66
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:23,850
detection rate

67
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:27,610
for samples that are very likely to be
malicious

68
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,930
because several other antivirus is I'm
them

69
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:36,310
as malicious and as you can see even the
best anti virus is that you can see I

70
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:40,539
censored the name so that they avoided
lawsuits and protecting the conference

71
00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:41,650
but

72
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:46,150
as you can see even the best anti virus
is

73
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:49,650
never ever gets over ninety percent

74
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:53,090
detection rate and if you're looking at
the blue lines

75
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:57,220
which she spent our detection rates for
samples that they've been tagged as

76
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,789
malicious be at least one antivirus

77
00:04:59,789 --> 00:05:04,360
so these are slightly less reliable
because there could be false positives

78
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,569
in them

79
00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:09,620
but the yard the fractious

80
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,990
samples as well the infection rate goes
even lower

81
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:18,310
that's because our approach to fighting
Muller is busy coli

82
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,860
not the right approach any

83
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,569
and this is an and I speak to that I
found

84
00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:29,840
its pretty famous it's been the castle
it's been designed by Pete Carroll

85
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,000
switches %ah

86
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,819
and Austin anti-virus company and its
present your anti-virus industry 1998

87
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:38,280
and 2008

88
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,009
and that's pretty much reflects the
reality

89
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:47,210
cell one of the issues here

90
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:51,470
is the analyst ship the knowledge as a
as they started

91
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:55,030
are claiming because analysts

92
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:59,780
are way too few and the call to analyze
is way too much

93
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:04,039
so we need better ways always improved
ways

94
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:08,590
to out to Mexicali analyze the code that
we have in front of us

95
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:12,020
out a magical a reverse engineer Mauer

96
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:17,599
and as most of you probably know out a
magical to reverse engineering something

97
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:20,680
is a very very difficult problem

98
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,659
so in general it is so difficult that it
cannot be SOL

99
00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:27,819
generally m4 all computer programs

100
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:31,280
but it can be sold for some specific
subset

101
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:38,210
of interest and another subsequent
arrest is automatically classify modeler

102
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:42,509
so that we already know when we have a
new specimen coming in

103
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:45,990
at least and generally what it looks
like

104
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:49,720
shouldn't we are ready now what are the
differences in what are the things that

105
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,319
you're looking for

106
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,500
so for for doing both this things

107
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,530
there's in general to different
approaches which are not the right one

108
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:00,460
and the wrong one

109
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:05,319
they just have symmetric advantages and
disadvantages

110
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:08,770
so static approaches me you take up your
code

111
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:12,860
you the compile it you reverse engineer
it in some way

112
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,110
give someone study at

113
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:20,219
and the benefit is of course that as
long as you can study it completely

114
00:07:20,219 --> 00:07:25,830
you can understand anything that this
cold ass

115
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:29,319
d negative part is that one you need
analysts

116
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:32,389
a lot of them

117
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:37,990
you have the difficulty understanding
the semantics understanding what the

118
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,050
absolutely kodak's

119
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:43,270
that has for suffered that has been
actually Britain

120
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:47,610
in order to be difficult to decompile
any case

121
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:52,240
and you have the use a double the
techniques of obfuscation and pack

122
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,699
that can be used to hide malicious code
and to make it more difficult

123
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:00,719
to automatically or manly analyze

124
00:08:00,719 --> 00:08:04,169
so what we resort to do many times

125
00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:07,550
is just a dynamic approach I pick up the
code

126
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:12,520
put it in a sandbox if if it wants to
run

127
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,439
it needs to on park itself and it needs
to actually do

128
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:20,879
what it's supposed to do so i luk at the
behavior and the code

129
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,900
while actually acts

130
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:29,139
the problems here is the problem that we
called the problem of the dormant coat

131
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:33,110
because in many types of malware in
particular man want that

132
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:36,650
as a command-and-control infrastructure

133
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,669
not all the functions are I'm at all the
time

134
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:44,860
so you may very well have a piece of
Mahler that has some stealthy components

135
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,889
the actually compact themselves and
activate themselves

136
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:53,180
on the unspecific a specific conditions

137
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:56,450
cell our approach in this

138
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:00,560
was basically what's in some with have
advise as to do

139
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,010
to try to turn this week masks

140
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,440
that we have in first track

141
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,370
and the weakness is mahler offers are
producing

142
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:15,459
many many variations on the same fire

143
00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:18,660
the same our

144
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,410
so leveraging his weakness

145
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:27,079
means that we use that against them we
try to track

146
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:30,389
code reuse across from our samples

147
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:34,130
and use that disc over interesting
features of Mahler

148
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:39,329
that has not been shown during that time
announces

149
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:44,160
I'm also by using variations of the same
technique

150
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,990
we can also one other interesting things
that they will show up

151
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:51,950
along the end of my talk to

152
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:55,899
I'm started evolution the actual
evolution of Mahler

153
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:59,920
so wat actually D mahler August are
modifying

154
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:05,600
in their code I'm this is obviously a
difficult problem

155
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,200
because we don't have source called of
my work in most cases

156
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,990
in many cases we do because many mahler
creation kits

157
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,300
have source code and throughout through

158
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:22,709
I intelligence efforts we r able to get
them

159
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:26,040
from the bad guy circles but

160
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,139
the specific source code of most
specimens don't have of course

161
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:34,339
otherwise we wouldn't have the problem
so arm

162
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:38,300
our proceedings to start not from the
actual source code

163
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:43,300
but from the compiled versions and so we
created this tool that is called the

164
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,480
Reanimator

165
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,010
in a in in loving memory

166
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:52,040
of I am the

167
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,529
orders of the tool cycles

168
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:58,529
you will you will find is his name

169
00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:02,160
quoted index will cycles in the times

170
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,110
I'm and basically re any manner

171
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:09,420
as run

172
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:13,160
mahler samples in in a sandbox

173
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:18,430
the tax malicious give yes the we are
interested in tracking

174
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:21,699
I then it can identified the codes

175
00:11:21,699 --> 00:11:25,690
which is responsible for these malicious
behavior in

176
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:30,519
that we call be if you're a fan of time
and Emily the code genotype

177
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:34,880
in in an hour to with what happens in
biology it's not really a very

178
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,769
very good analogy actually after after I
A

179
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:42,449
much reflection I find that their its it
has its limits

180
00:11:42,449 --> 00:11:47,839
but then we matched physically genotype
more the so the more this in the code

181
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,149
against honor malicious software

182
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:55,579
that we have in our collection and we
can fine

183
00:11:55,579 --> 00:11:59,050
malicious software that has not accepted
the same behavior

184
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:02,230
but as the same he ever implemented
we've seen our

185
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:06,610
if not the same codes

186
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:10,570
said you give us like this I am i were
sample I executed

187
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:14,570
it shows a number of BMDs I

188
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:19,759
most of his bf years I would probably be
interesting to sidetrack bisbee endures

189
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:23,910
to the actual portions of the code that
execute them

190
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:28,050
and they find a reliable modell for
finding these

191
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:32,550
functionalities across the company's of
samples that they have

192
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:36,430
so it does not only need to be reliable
but it also needs to be very fast

193
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,029
because

194
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:40,670
of course that the samples at the basis
of samples

195
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:43,709
are growing larger

196
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:47,750
so let's start with the identification
to do that we use

197
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:51,430
irony cemented same box that many of you
may be familiar with

198
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:55,139
its cool the new Miss you can access it
from the web and was the basic

199
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:58,410
or are you go there you upload the
sample

200
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:02,800
or whatever file you want to check and
yes we're running to monitor the

201
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,380
environment and give your report of what
this

202
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:09,170
is Melinda's so with the final this

203
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:14,220
to I'm have a set of rules to detect
some be just as we were interested in

204
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,959
two

205
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:20,160
arm and to map basic Kelly

206
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,350
the I its single bf your

207
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:27,269
to a set of system calls or API calls
better

208
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:31,199
which are responsible for it at this
point

209
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:35,670
when we run our sample our sample shows
the even if they're interested in two

210
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:40,079
we have a set of calls that the money
the simple does that implement this

211
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,850
as your so this is an example of

212
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:49,170
of of several %ah yes that we have
identified this is the type

213
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:54,220
of things that we have that we need to
fright the roof or so

214
00:13:54,220 --> 00:14:00,970
very generic prescriptions of things
that we may be interested into

215
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:04,519
so I'm the extraction of oven temp is
actually the

216
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:07,779
DD specifically difficult portion this
week

217
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:12,069
I'm because we need a complete set by
PSO

218
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:15,139
as main as much as possible love the
code

219
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:18,550
implementing the behavior and the
precise Tim

220
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:23,769
type so a way to mess that code that
does not match against code that is not

221
00:14:23,769 --> 00:14:24,730
specific to that

222
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:28,380
your because otherwise we would generate
false positives

223
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:32,579
so one person might three steps slicing
filtering and germination

224
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:36,069
and they will explain each one so the
first step

225
00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:40,410
is called slicing would basically start
from recalls that we tend to fight is

226
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,139
implementing the your

227
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:45,920
we include in our slice of cold

228
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,160
any assembly instructions that either
repair

229
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:55,339
inputs for does API calls so we followed
the time dependence backwards

230
00:14:55,339 --> 00:14:59,519
from coal inputs trackback with out what
is preparing to

231
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,389
will inputs or distractions that process
the output

232
00:15:03,389 --> 00:15:07,740
on the call so it's the classic team
flow analysis

233
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,579
om of I of input and output of the Scots

234
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:15,329
we do not consider consular flow level
depend this is this is

235
00:15:15,329 --> 00:15:20,029
of a limitation on the prince but it's
necessary because otherwise

236
00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:23,860
we've read them the team explosion so we
basically would include everything

237
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:27,529
in our in our houses so these lights

238
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:32,000
on his knees not precise at least
because it could includes code that be

239
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,509
longstreet utility functions

240
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:37,930
so the bad guy maybe brody's own
function to

241
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:42,209
I reorder bytes in whatever data
structures they are using

242
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:45,550
this function get school then they will
see this function included

243
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:48,839
in my slice but then again if they call
it throughout

244
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:52,649
all of the code of their malware when
Iran asserts

245
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:56,399
if I include this in my slice what will
happen is that they will have a lot of

246
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,470
false positives because they will find
that

247
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,779
there are thousands and thousands of
functions in the my word that iraq to

248
00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:03,370
the max

249
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:08,170
I'm or French is that come from the
XXIII from standard shared libraries

250
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:12,379
I want to take to get those out the
second thing is that

251
00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:16,699
backcourt slicing is just too much
backward for us

252
00:16:16,699 --> 00:16:20,250
so it goes back and at some point it
will and up

253
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:25,839
including initialization and if it
includes also the unpacking rotis

254
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,899
then we're screwed because we will met
anything that has been packed

255
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:33,329
with the same back so I'm

256
00:16:33,329 --> 00:16:36,649
what we do basically is filter out

257
00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:40,850
%ah these these fractions that are not
to really

258
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,879
exclusive which means

259
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:48,060
filter out the structures that so
exclusive instructions that they're the

260
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,910
ones that we are interested in two

261
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:54,970
is the structures that basically every
time the are executed

262
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:59,730
they only work untainted data so we
exclude these structures that can

263
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,779
possibly be called

264
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:07,100
on no meeting to take up missus news
obviously takes out all of the

265
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,600
of the utility functions or at least
most that

266
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,170
who %ah the second away for filtering

267
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:18,750
is busy coli if I do execute the same
for multiple times

268
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:23,159
and it doesn't show the BHR nothing
interesting to every time

269
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:27,199
I take up one execution that has not
shown to be there

270
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,390
I look into all the structures that have
been executed in that in

271
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:33,870
that the execution and the fields are
those out because those are

272
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:38,620
evidently the baseline of the execution
that does not have anything to do

273
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:42,299
with my %ah with Micah

274
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:45,330
this point since they've been filtering
and filtering filtering

275
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:49,559
my slices obviously incomplete I'm left
with only the structures that the excuse

276
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:50,650
is that the behavior

277
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:54,620
but this is not sufficient to actually
have a set

278
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,960
of he structures that will run cell

279
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,720
I'm what we do is we pick up this
instructions

280
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,990
and we basically complete the graph

281
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:09,299
by adding all the structures that cannot
be executed

282
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:13,130
we vote tripping on at least one of
these instructions

283
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:17,780
in this way busy coli we are
reconstructing the recent bility

284
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,970
on the console flow graph destructions

285
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:24,919
so what we end up with is a set them
he's a sec is the set of the structures

286
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:26,470
that implement your

287
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:30,090
eenie a complete in in a completed
version of the concert cost

288
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:36,270
or or some control graph of the program

289
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:39,780
this point what we need is a way to
match this

290
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:43,210
portion of the concert flow graph
against them hull

291
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:47,179
use the base a father of other monomer

292
00:18:47,179 --> 00:18:50,330
we've outrunning into I'm

293
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:54,760
into a problem of I performance

294
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,460
cell %um CS basically the genotype

295
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:01,990
is %ah a sec obvious distractions

296
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:05,390
some some be some the controversial
property

297
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:08,450
up the am mahler

298
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:13,090
remove the leads by using its
controversial draft

299
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:16,940
collard with the type of distractions

300
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:20,590
that is contained in each single basic
block

301
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:23,679
so we basically I divides

302
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,909
the x86 extractions into categories

303
00:19:27,909 --> 00:19:32,039
fourteen of them and according to the
presence or absence

304
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:36,820
these categories of instructions week
callers to block

305
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:40,150
based on this instruction classes is
more than a

306
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:44,570
was originally proposed by Christopher
crew go few years back

307
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:48,419
in order to analyze kicking sorry to
work in order to analyze

308
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:51,730
polymorphic worm cult

309
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:55,280
and basically gave you guys that you
build this

310
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,230
drop you call a rate according to the
structures that are present in the best

311
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,780
blocks

312
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:04,880
and then you build I some graphs

313
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,049
of size KD are you now wheres

314
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:12,110
in our exercise we used size

315
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:16,650
then which is a a reasonable compromise
in trade-off between per season

316
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,919
and speed but people may wish to

317
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:25,309
to change this did too sweet there %ah
their needs

318
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:29,490
in this case what you do is basically
you build all of the sudden crops

319
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:32,669
of a mentioned ten and you look

320
00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:36,760
throughout your database to see if there
is a mahler

321
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,409
the past the same subgraph among

322
00:20:40,409 --> 00:20:43,870
it inside its controversial Graaf

323
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:47,250
so this may sound very expensive

324
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:51,350
with actually sis most of this faint can
be done once

325
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,970
for it smaller sample so you can store
them on were simple along

326
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:58,150
Wii fit's size Stan

327
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:02,360
or size with everyone op fingerprints

328
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:06,190
of subgraphs you can do this once for a
smaller

329
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:09,309
and then you can just look for a the
database and it's just a problem of

330
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:10,960
matching

331
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,130
as long as your database indexing
technique is sufficient

332
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:19,520
this will get you reason to the results
so what happens is that

333
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,490
op the

334
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,600
define no result of this

335
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:30,500
is that you run a sample survive your

336
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,820
figure out what code is supporting his
behavior

337
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:39,140
makes this code through this graph
techniques across the database

338
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:43,909
and you end up with hundreds of other
samples

339
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:47,090
that match that that subgraph

340
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:50,159
so then the question is is is all this

341
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,539
all these the I have proposed is is very
reasonable

342
00:21:53,539 --> 00:21:56,600
but does it actually work cell

343
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,020
are the results back to rate and this
means basically

344
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:03,840
to thinks first if when

345
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,390
rename it undertakes a match theirs
actually code that matches that

346
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:12,490
in seconds how resistant is this max Inc

347
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:16,309
two techniques that Mahler all the
issues to try to a fiscal

348
00:22:16,309 --> 00:22:20,110
ok ok and there's a turning point

349
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:24,919
how useful this turns out to be

350
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:31,549
so the best accuracy obviously we need
to the ground truth

351
00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:36,039
so we got a dataset of 208 votes

352
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:40,400
%ah with source code

353
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,330
on this came from my data said that the
University of Michigan is using

354
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:49,100
hmm from one of the spots week extracted
six mo thats

355
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:52,919
of six different yes just the best

356
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:57,159
Andrew matt said these more those
against the compiled versions

357
00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:02,500
on the remaining 207 box

358
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:06,750
then of course I manly very fine

359
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:10,740
called similarity would have been very
time consuming

360
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,820
so what we did was we took a shortcut

361
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:18,640
we used Moss which is a well-known plans
to resume the texan tall

362
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,220
if you've been through University
recently

363
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:25,919
or if you are a university teacher fair
university sector

364
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,549
this is cool you can sec code for
plagiarism

365
00:23:29,549 --> 00:23:34,020
among your student submissions so
basically we fed Moss with

366
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:38,950
the source code correspond to each of
the six yes and WiMAX and it gives the

367
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,039
other two hundred seven box

368
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,720
and must does not value yes if Max is no
it doesn't.

369
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,409
contracts returns you are called
percentage Mets

370
00:23:48,409 --> 00:23:52,720
cell physically what we expect is the
tree in winter should match

371
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,529
on code the as high I am

372
00:23:56,529 --> 00:24:00,320
similarity scores

373
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:05,279
and this is the comparison its it's a
bit tricky to see this graph so

374
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:09,010
please follow me I basically this is

375
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:13,870
at on this on this axis you have the
percentage of matching code

376
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:18,750
according to Moss so how much of the
code masses

377
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:22,929
n here %um the number CC couldn't see
sure you

378
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:27,110
on Aug on a slide 208 samples with the
results

379
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:30,220
we have looked at the results one by one
we

380
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:33,419
the PhD student was caught off this
paper no

381
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:38,330
at the Maxine distractions thanks we
know are you will not be forgotten

382
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:41,480
I'm but your

383
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,039
i'm summarizing it so I'm showing you
the number of samples that fall

384
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:49,470
in this pin so thirst X number of
samples

385
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:52,529
in this case 240 something

386
00:24:52,529 --> 00:24:56,270
that's for in 20 25 percent similarity
didn't dismiss that

387
00:24:56,270 --> 00:25:01,399
they do not match according to Moss and
we do not expect the Reanimator too sure

388
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:02,620
that they match

389
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:09,620
so basically if you understood me might
way of representing they now

390
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:13,450
the difference between this column

391
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:16,880
and this column are the potential

392
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,230
false negatives in this case

393
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:24,559
of anne minner because most say is that
there's more

394
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:27,940
maxine code there are any major would
say

395
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:30,950
and this

396
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:33,980
are the potential false positives
because ma says

397
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:38,640
yeah that sounds like a 20 percent match
air in the process but there's a metal

398
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,970
my fingerprint

399
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:43,730
so once again useful piece this to
themselves look through this

400
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:49,510
things and physically so we manually
investigated translates the we demand

401
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:50,909
will investigate its

402
00:25:50,909 --> 00:25:57,049
the potential for spas it yourself Santa
gives and the result is

403
00:25:57,049 --> 00:26:01,799
buries a low false negative rate sewing
some cases

404
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:06,730
in particular one the function but has
been executed his res me

405
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:11,320
how r approach me feat it may not
identify

406
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:15,320
mixing code in another in another box

407
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:19,850
but what's interesting is that this
approach shows no false positives

408
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:24,179
so the few false positives that you saw
that were mentally investigated

409
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:29,260
and actually found to be great
implementations of the same behavior

410
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:32,659
that for some reason food mocks so the
false

411
00:26:32,659 --> 00:26:36,380
is is on Moss Side not on in our site

412
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:39,970
and this is interesting because we also
ran

413
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:44,740
checks on a very large database of
fingerprints for ba/bs

414
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:48,700
own over 2000 binary is that count from
a clean

415
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:53,140
is the love Windows and we found no max
is

416
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:57,419
which could be seen as a negative result
because many people like windows to

417
00:26:57,419 --> 00:26:58,330
match against the

418
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:01,669
will the checks for malicious code but
still

419
00:27:01,669 --> 00:27:05,590
this was the expected

420
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:09,539
so what's act if this would be robust
when compiling with different

421
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:12,000
confiscation tricks and techniques

422
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,240
and so it was robust against compilation
options and different

423
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,970
techniques that can be used to change
the actual compiled code

424
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:23,500
width resulted not to be robbers

425
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,590
against completely different compiler

426
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:31,100
this is explained

427
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:35,470
because different compilers have
different calling conventions

428
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:40,350
in this can cost difference says some
parts of the crops

429
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:45,510
are we are working to see if the res any

430
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:49,809
fundamental issue with this or if it's
just the I

431
00:27:49,809 --> 00:27:54,610
an issue of again of mixing that is
present in our current version of the

432
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:55,500
code

433
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,659
because there's no your ethical reason
why this should happen

434
00:27:58,659 --> 00:28:02,390
so I attribute this to limit of our
present

435
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:06,580
above the technique itself

436
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:09,799
com them the other question was how much
this

437
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:14,260
does this work if we try to figure out
what behaviors

438
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:20,059
I am are in the wind

439
00:28:20,059 --> 00:28:23,600
and the res week use their four
different datasets we for

440
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:28,760
thousands of samples and physically what
happens is that

441
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:33,549
for a some datasets there are impressive
results so

442
00:28:33,549 --> 00:28:37,630
arm there's just maybe fifty or just one

443
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:42,440
sample that execute some give your
during then I'm canal is this

444
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,140
but then if you actually run any merit

445
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:50,700
you find that there's over 200 samples
that have been your implemented in the

446
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,140
end up

447
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:54,549
executed cell

448
00:28:54,549 --> 00:28:58,200
at the ends they om

449
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,429
d %ah

450
00:29:01,429 --> 00:29:04,929
detection by ARY an emailer

451
00:29:04,929 --> 00:29:08,950
turns out to be a useful tool to find

452
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:13,580
code that has been left dormant in
versions of Mahler

453
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:16,669
I very precise there's no false
positives

454
00:29:16,669 --> 00:29:21,409
me and false negatives but false
negatives are better than nothing right

455
00:29:21,409 --> 00:29:25,710
om and it is reasonably resilient

456
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:29,019
against them just fishing techniques the
one limits

457
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:33,159
every enemy there that will put forward
is the fact that it works and pocket

458
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:34,200
coat

459
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,289
so you need one popular our first

460
00:29:37,289 --> 00:29:43,330
that's a that's a problem that has
different solutions

461
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:47,289
so then we stand a slightly different
take on this problem

462
00:29:47,289 --> 00:29:53,409
so on the problem of tracking Muller
evolution over time

463
00:29:53,409 --> 00:29:58,559
as we all now one of the reasons widen
our problem is so

464
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,640
difficult to solve is that as I said
that beginning of my cock

465
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,840
mahler all those are constantly updating
their cup

466
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,960
as so we wondered one how much are they
constantly updating this cult

467
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:16,380
to how much of these updates are done
with the specific intent of you know

468
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,630
changing something to avoid detection

469
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:21,140
but not really changing the
functionality and how much from these

470
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:24,519
updates actually changing the function
on this

471
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:28,519
and free what is the actual level

472
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:32,640
of development efforts that goes into
this

473
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,470
so is it just has more changes likes
more and its

474
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:40,990
or is it structure all interesting
changes

475
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:44,350
so I we created a prototype which we
called Eagle

476
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:47,640
like doc om

477
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,130
and physically what beagle does is

478
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:54,610
get a sec of Mahler's the asap

479
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:59,340
let this mahler update itself so every
day we let it connect back to its

480
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,799
command and control server

481
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:06,409
receive any notification of changes and
update itself

482
00:31:06,409 --> 00:31:10,500
and then let it run in 2013 environments
so that we can see

483
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,929
yes every time

484
00:31:13,929 --> 00:31:17,019
that's itself we also trackback these

485
00:31:17,019 --> 00:31:21,490
yes the code and Woodmont changes

486
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:24,490
to the money Cisco cell

487
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:27,870
busy coli these tracking back

488
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:31,950
and identifying uses the very same
techniques that they'd just illustrated

489
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:35,230
fortune

490
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:38,440
so the the interesting part is out do we
actually

491
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:43,940
on analyze and semantically understand
the difference between Co

492
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:47,970
so this is a schematic that represents
what they already said

493
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:52,659
physically I have my cell all they
sample connects to the update server

494
00:31:52,659 --> 00:31:56,570
and on earth time it changes in versions

495
00:31:56,570 --> 00:32:02,980
every time aversion changes I execute
incident but the n2 I'm

496
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:07,750
and they mimic analysis environment i
login system level activity

497
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:11,389
and I analyze it from the by 9.2 view

498
00:32:11,389 --> 00:32:15,260
an impact version a bit once again say
seem

499
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:19,240
basic are requirements as Reanimator

500
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:23,370
it needs to unpack itself

501
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:27,740
and basically ran a binary comparison
between the different versions

502
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:32,580
and apt comparison up the difference in
behavior

503
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:37,320
and we try to this two things together
semantic

504
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:41,179
so the definition of behavior is
actually very similar

505
00:32:41,179 --> 00:32:44,929
to the give your signature of irene
miller

506
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:49,260
we don't use and abuse in this case we
use and dislikes and box

507
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:53,010
was more efficient to do this I'm

508
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:57,940
and we analyze system-level activities

509
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:01,649
basically wine in re any manner

510
00:33:01,649 --> 00:33:05,120
we were focusing on one single be if
you're

511
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,740
and we were trying to discard the code
that was not related to the

512
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:13,330
your what we doing this case is

513
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:17,130
we focused on executions

514
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:20,220
different system calls and recalled this

515
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:23,750
I'm not gonna be a viewer's its it
something

516
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:27,820
because they have been executed together
they have been acting on the same values

517
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:30,830
they have been acting on same variables

518
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:34,639
so they are probably an aggregate that
does something

519
00:33:34,639 --> 00:33:37,960
but we do not know outright what this

520
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:41,299
this thing is going so basically this

521
00:33:41,299 --> 00:33:44,549
unleavened behaviors our class ther

522
00:33:44,549 --> 00:33:48,620
of system activity that maybe interest

523
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:52,240
then analyst namely oz in this case

524
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:57,460
looks pro this behavior and Manuel de la
bas

525
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:01,980
some of them at least saying this is an
interesting behavior and this is

526
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:06,429
the both doing Spanish this is an
interesting behavior and this is the

527
00:34:06,429 --> 00:34:07,649
both contest thing

528
00:34:07,649 --> 00:34:12,409
a command-and-control infrastructure

529
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:16,380
we can generate a record night
considering some rules to recognize this

530
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,740
give yours

531
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:21,380
across different samples pretty much in
line with what we were doing was very

532
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:23,900
intimate but basically we're doing it
the other way around

533
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:27,990
Syrian meter we were doing this top-down
we were defining a rule

534
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:32,500
and then Matt sing it in this case we
are looking at the aggregates

535
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:36,370
in for some of them say okay this is
interesting and a breakthrough for this

536
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:41,230
and a Mexican across the other the other
samples

537
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:45,690
I'm also winery any matter we use the
block

538
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:49,620
a basic block level aggregation
basically

539
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:54,340
in the case of beagle we decided for
functional level panel at the so when we

540
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,850
include

541
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:59,420
a piece of function we decide that they
call function

542
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:03,660
is interesting because we are trying to
track the evolution of code

543
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:08,410
over overtime you're not really
interested in matching code across

544
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:09,400
different

545
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:13,180
samples so we may be interested in some
pieces of code that media being

546
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,990
rearranged differently

547
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:18,140
here what we are looking for actually
small changes

548
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:22,940
in an infrastructure that is already
built

549
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:26,400
so this is the dataset which is a
realize a little bit small but you will

550
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,660
get the slights right after the talks so
you can

551
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:31,800
so this is actually a reference for you
when you get them

552
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,910
I'm and it actually to include several
well-known

553
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:39,460
I'm on where families Zeus at Killie
boss

554
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:42,660
and camera are some to become names that
you have

555
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:46,990
if you have ever worked with my were you
know already them

556
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:51,180
basically what way I'm tits actually

557
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:54,560
it's called Xerox that sucks

558
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,700
sources American version of The ch so

559
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:01,150
just just just for just for

560
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:04,680
you now putting its out somewhere

561
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:09,370
but still we are working on American
English so we see that sucks

562
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:15,080
see I'm so these are some of the
renaissance of beagle once again I don't

563
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,000
want anyone to you too

564
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,490
try to look at this I you will look at
it

565
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:23,550
on this lies more comfortably after the
presentation

566
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:28,220
but basically what get what Anna what we
get out of this

567
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:31,520
as insights is this

568
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,600
I'm

569
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:39,160
on Manny of these families

570
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:43,050
%ah the heirs and average this figures

571
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:46,100
Rd average percentages on advance

572
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:52,460
removed and shared codes between two
subsequent versions

573
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,850
so on some of these families on many of
them actually

574
00:36:55,850 --> 00:37:00,340
there's a consistent percentage of five
to ten percent

575
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:05,140
of and cold between its version

576
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:08,250
these in this case added code is
computed

577
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:12,140
in terms of basic blocks because we
cannot really know the lines of code

578
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:12,880
that implements

579
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,750
the yeah absolutely but still it's a
measurement

580
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:19,880
overall money she's guys are really

581
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:24,440
timeously adding subtracting and
changing

582
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:28,430
things across versions they are not just
edited

583
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:31,650
to try to change slightly

584
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:34,910
Myler not to feed the signature but they
are actually a

585
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:39,570
tightly implementing some changes

586
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:42,880
so another interesting thing that we can
do

587
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,920
is break down the changes across a
single man we're family

588
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:51,430
according to be a tedious so here I am
several different yes

589
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:56,200
download executes change the security
policy of the almost

590
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:00,120
generate GDP traffic span

591
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:05,240
deaths are all executed by samples of
the Gamma Rho family

592
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:09,660
across the different samples this is
basically

593
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:13,050
distribution obvious similarity between

594
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:16,350
one sample and the simple

595
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:20,220
the previous sample so what it meant
what the media

596
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:25,300
means is that if the median is a
similarity of one

597
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:29,320
it means that those functions are not to
really

598
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:32,520
changing much so for instance

599
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:36,060
the function DNS query surprisingly

600
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:39,300
does not really change much across
versions

601
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:43,960
but then in some samples that are marked
with the small

602
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:48,100
I the small ball over here

603
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:51,310
in some samples it happens that one

604
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:54,940
on the changes in the flyer so you DP
traffic

605
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:58,560
had sorry DNS query does not change

606
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:03,260
across basically of the version vendors
one version

607
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:07,250
words difference is complete

608
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:10,930
and this is very interesting because it
pinpoints

609
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:13,960
one dramatic change

610
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:17,460
well in the case have DNS query maybe
not so dramatic but

611
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:20,480
once rapid change the Marana

612
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,260
have made sorry no that if my function
varies

613
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:29,100
always little and then there's one
simple word varies a lot

614
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:33,299
that's an interesting sample to look at
and they don't need to look at the whole

615
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,330
sample

616
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:37,940
necessarily I just need to look at the
specific function

617
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:41,070
because that's weird interesting changes

618
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:44,210
functions the peace that at the boxes
are the classic

619
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:48,020
point I representation I will not going
to it if you know

620
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:52,630
about going to representations then it's
clear if not busy coli

621
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:57,050
the size of the box indicates the
virions

622
00:39:57,050 --> 00:40:00,150
of the change across the different
versions

623
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:04,150
so where there's a large box it means
that that specific

624
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:09,430
piece of code can be very similar on can
be very similar

625
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:13,810
it fluctuates and this is interesting
because

626
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:17,650
says the once were you see all this

627
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:21,770
possible variations or even where you
see a median

628
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:25,390
which is very low a median of similarity
which is very low

629
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:30,520
missed the guys are constantly changing
that specific piece of cock

630
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,640
so it means that those are the
functionalities that in the camera

631
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,320
family

632
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:39,230
are either more used or more interesting
because a lot of development efforts

633
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:43,490
goes into them

634
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:46,670
or the yard the functionalities

635
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:50,600
that correspond to the ants to the anti
malware signatures

636
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:54,650
for that family so they keep changing

637
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:58,400
these are some of the other insights
actually all of the results of this

638
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,390
study

639
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:02,980
will come up at the same difficult for
us which is called oxide

640
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:07,770
at the end of the year but if you want
to have a previous release call p

641
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:12,360
of the paper just ask me as long as you
don't distributed before December

642
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:15,760
as I would be presenting this also
darkest like this conference

643
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,620
the conference run by we go arm

644
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:23,380
I would share it with you just on three
posted on the web

645
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:26,820
arm so this is a summary

646
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:30,010
being sites in the paper om

647
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:33,650
basically some families

648
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:36,930
are actually much more highly developed
than others

649
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:40,670
so there's some families that are
basically much work as a sitting there

650
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:42,220
and doing their stuff

651
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:46,820
and there's other families that keep
being changed

652
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:50,050
thanks to me go we can pinpoint

653
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:53,780
changes over individual give Europe's
and sometimes run

654
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:56,790
this across the collection so we can who

655
00:41:56,790 --> 00:42:02,860
design and Raf and basically look at it
and see that in some specific days

656
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:08,380
not only some behavior has been changing
in in a specific family sees a loose

657
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:11,910
but maybe there's a matching teens also
in chaos

658
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:15,620
or another in other families so when
this happens

659
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:18,900
we know that there are some subterranean
activity

660
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:22,930
some other brown the TV that is forcing
different mahler all others are

661
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:23,900
different

662
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:27,000
group of my we're all this to change the
code

663
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,680
at the same time there's probably
something interesting to look into that

664
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,810
on in some cases for some families

665
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:39,180
what happens is that if you look at the
global numbers

666
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:42,510
they seem relatively stable the change
little

667
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:48,080
then you decided that for yes yes in to
see that a number of BEVs are stable

668
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:51,610
and then there's one that is constantly
changing so you know that mark our

669
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:52,360
family

670
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:55,980
is actually still under active
development they are only focusing on

671
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:58,300
one single piece of it

672
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:02,140
either because it's the one that the
student gets right or read them because

673
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:05,850
the wonder if they are more interested
in to the moment

674
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:10,920
but it may look like as superficial if
you just look at the complete

675
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:14,500
set of code me look like the are very
very soon at each other but actually

676
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,390
there's a specific

677
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:18,890
your that is T

678
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:22,950
om finally what we wanted to do was to
try to

679
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:27,410
make this an evaluation of the
development effort that goes into this

680
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:30,710
this the Spanx on so

681
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:34,660
your the challenges that we have blocks
in ass and Lee and not lie some Co the

682
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:36,720
source code which is the usual

683
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,970
metric for development effort that's
offer ingenious use

684
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:44,330
Britain's I'm we can do some estimate
then

685
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:48,880
in go backwards from there the line of
codes the lines of code implementing

686
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,780
I'm those on those changes

687
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:56,770
in estimates that the average advanced
coding skills

688
00:43:56,770 --> 00:44:00,810
over each variation so over its
different some sequined version

689
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:04,670
is about 142 280

690
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:07,950
lets a couple hundred lines of coke

691
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:10,960
which is not terribly max but

692
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,710
its actually a significant closest spend
continues development

693
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:19,080
effort and what happens is that in some
versions words there's a dramatic change

694
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,620
in the functions

695
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:24,780
this wraps up to 9,000 estimated line of
code siege

696
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:28,300
which overbought which is not a very
complex of work

697
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:33,190
means a significant redesign efforts so
there's actually a significant effort

698
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:38,210
invested in updating this fix om

699
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:41,980
and this busy cuz the roughly owns the
same for other families

700
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:45,320
we are less certain thing because in the
case of sales we have the advantage

701
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:49,490
of having some of the source code for
some version so we can met

702
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:55,860
very well back to the number of lines of
code implementing the tacitly

703
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:59,130
I would like to %ah to conclude my talk
with

704
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:03,290
but the presentation of I after a future

705
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:07,630
issue that we're going to dress which is
the issue of Mahler classification into

706
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:08,940
family

707
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:13,190
misguided this is an open problem much
confusion

708
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:17,600
and classifications given out by
antivirus vendors

709
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:22,220
are completely unreliable which is not

710
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:26,150
you know a bash against and this it's
just that it's not what they are looking

711
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:27,400
for

712
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,670
they are looking for having someone to
justification internally

713
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:35,800
but as far as the signature names that
they put out for us to see

714
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,840
they don't really care right if it if if
you call it

715
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:42,120
a rosary for college violet but its
actually

716
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:48,190
still messing mahler they are fine with
it

717
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:52,100
om would basically the most recent this
we picked up on large they disapprove

718
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:52,860
Marler

719
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:56,200
around four commercial anti-virus isn't
it

720
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:59,770
that's representation at the right is is
basically

721
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:03,550
I one of the representations that you
can find into the paper

722
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:06,910
I it's a paper my were inconsistencies
you will find it in the least

723
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:12,470
myself papers for one-and-a-half year
back

724
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:16,310
but d you know

725
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:20,210
even exist not no wing

726
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:24,110
out these graphs a bit of pain but just
looking at them

727
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:28,290
that's the classification done by
different viruses of the sea

728
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:32,580
they said mahler even just looking at
them

729
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:36,670
you can spot the fact that not only the
are different

730
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:40,010
but the are completely unmarked bull to
each other

731
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:44,810
the have structural differences the
torso greats

732
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:48,390
that there's no way to match them

733
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:52,000
to each other and this is important

734
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,500
because normally when we think about
inconsistencies in naming

735
00:46:56,500 --> 00:47:00,850
what we think is that well yes there's
some weak inconsistencies right

736
00:47:00,850 --> 00:47:04,630
are some some anti-virus company may
called

737
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:08,330
this zulus doc a and then that

738
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:12,990
zoos .be and the other and smaller
company calls both

739
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:16,310
zulus Nazi

740
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:19,580
but if you Matt does you would find

741
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:22,720
actually turns out not to be the case
Thursday out the

742
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:26,780
you cannot really define a mapping that
brings one of these taxonomies to the

743
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:27,860
other

744
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:32,610
which means that they are completely
fucked up

745
00:47:32,610 --> 00:47:36,570
so one of the things that we look very
much like to do

746
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:39,850
is to try to

747
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:44,030
we are scientists would like to try to
figure out a way

748
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:47,410
a better way of classifying the Sphinx

749
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:50,870
because this way is is just not found

750
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:54,330
not not strongly founded it's just

751
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:58,580
based on you know the best approximation
that Manuel and the time our analyst

752
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:02,650
wants to do so there are several were
some this

753
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:06,920
area %ah many of them says work
structurally

754
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:10,430
so they work based on static analysis of
course features

755
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:14,300
however flake and that'll come in to
come come to mine

756
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:17,980
others work on the your on the dynamics

757
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:21,590
and the air works by Parliament unicom
but at the end christopher drogoul come

758
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:24,230
to mind

759
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:28,070
but the NBA is okay so we have seen that
combining

760
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:31,950
structural and dynamic features you can
actually better get

761
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:35,210
get better results and identifying yes

762
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:38,350
so why not trying combining those two
things

763
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:41,430
also for declassification mahler or this

764
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:46,190
let's say not classification because
maybe that that's too much to ask for

765
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:50,450
but at least the clustering
insignificant families

766
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:55,250
and this is what we are currently trying
to work

767
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:58,650
so my conclusions for this stock

768
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:01,910
in perfect timing whoever said that
Italians are not

769
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:06,070
thanks

770
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:10,470
France the nightcap structural analysis

771
00:49:10,470 --> 00:49:15,170
known is through time and bring
consuming for people to to do

772
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:18,840
on across all of them our samples that
we have

773
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:22,340
they namic analysis alone can be able to
monetize good

774
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:27,260
it leases many points so we can combine
both

775
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:31,170
to obtain the analysis and tagging of
fuhrman code that has not been observed

776
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:35,760
in gave your in in they make analysis to
track the evolution

777
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:39,900
of cold over subsequent version to
perform an efficient triage

778
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:43,980
new samples both by looking for known
ba/bs

779
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:47,690
in them 18 when we receive them or give
the yard I'm

780
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:52,440
a new version of unknown malware family
to see where the significant changes

781
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,760
have taken place

782
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,950
if a significant changes taking place

783
00:49:57,950 --> 00:50:01,860
and hopefully in the future it will give
us a better means of classifying

784
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:04,380
specimens in families or in clusters

785
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:08,550
of relevance %ah of relevant interest

786
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:13,970
there's much work that needs to be done
in Syria which means that they will have

787
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:17,690
a job for next few years %ah

788
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:21,930
I thank you for your attention in
particular for being up so early for me

789
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:25,460
on my email addresses the final thoughts
and Eric Bolling

790
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:29,360
ITN I'm very open to receiving feedback
and questions

791
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:34,130
if you want to call p of one or both for
whatever papers that are connected to

792
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:37,970
this please feel free to write me would
be very happy to share that with you

793
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:42,440
I would just like before taking
questions I would just like to

794
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:45,750
mentioned that many of this work is not
just my work

795
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:48,840
I it's work that has been done with I

798
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:57,760
I start up in California and you here
the professor

00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,270
you Northeastern University
multi-million dollar for for the

800
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:04,450
commands in there is something for the
recall who are students of Technical

801
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:05,420
University of Vienna

802
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:08,690
packing coming and where the West
actually did this work

803
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:12,250
I'm of course they are cool waters but
errors

804
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:15,570
and opinions are just might solely so

805
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:18,630
thank you very much for your attention
and if there are any questions and to

806
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:25,630
pick them

807
00:51:27,310 --> 00:51:31,500
any questions yessir

808
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:35,680
is the microphone maybe so that the
audience can hear

809
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:41,300
solar

810
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:45,740
you know I want to know your opinion on
dr.

811
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:49,120
contexte good the slice hedge CDPH

812
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:54,500
make that farm glinting distance between
my way anybody insists for the bull

813
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:58,390
and edifices you're using 95 and so is
that

814
00:51:58,390 --> 00:52:01,800
if your company two different variants
dunno Kong md5

815
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:06,510
are totally will be different but by
using SSD for them but which is the

816
00:52:06,510 --> 00:52:07,350
biggest in

817
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:11,000
did using Deacon DC pp fish meat that

818
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,720
%ah do is a beast is maybe not armenia
has the being

819
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:20,220
produce always shows some kind of
hostility between two

820
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:23,360
audiences %ah dis UAB

821
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:26,420
hakim cross didn't meet n if you deep

822
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:30,040
I'll eighty opinion and what can be
improved

823
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:33,330
far lead outflow of ovarian cysts on a

824
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:37,870
companies in on my way and family girl
okay yeah so if they get error if you're

825
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:38,290
a

826
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:41,980
question correctly basically what you're
asking is

827
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:45,410
op works

828
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:48,670
what Rd techniques that we can use to
are

829
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:51,840
analyzed the similarity or dissimilarity
across

830
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:55,150
different man were samples the their
their

831
00:52:55,150 --> 00:52:59,680
their affinities and their similarities
is that is that what you're asking for

832
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:02,960
less

833
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:08,230
we did it came down from the seam family
see you hit you see does use ABC

834
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:11,230
solicit the Hamma in Haiti could

835
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:14,270
nice the CE ambiance he headed the quote
from

836
00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:18,470
E how can be. how can we ate some Q's

837
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:21,790
so I'm yes that's that's actually
something that

838
00:53:21,790 --> 00:53:25,780
as been mort more than related to my own
work that's something that you will find

839
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:27,200
in the works by

840
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,660
Hiler flake they ended by iraq

841
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:33,810
are they busy cally use several more
those

842
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:37,600
on the graph call graph structure of Mon
where

843
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:40,820
to to see if though was Anne

844
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:43,970
significant heritage from from

845
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:48,510
one type of specimen to another we
didn't really do that work

846
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:52,790
%ah but the basic talent in doing that

847
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:56,480
is that and you can you can actually do
that with the Wii for

848
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:00,010
with the technique we reviews and you
will probably reach the same scene

849
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:01,440
arrests

850
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,860
up yet tough challenge in going back is
that

851
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:07,940
nowadays white wine whence you add

852
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:11,870
up a very tree like structure of their
innovation

853
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:16,680
the very a nation sample then you would
have different evolutions of that sample

854
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:20,770
and get food physically I I'm disperse
itself

855
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:24,690
across different variations what happens
today is that

856
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:29,140
actual samples Inari from multiple
ancestors

857
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:32,900
so it becomes difficult to say what is
the father

858
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:36,830
and what is the Sun between two samples
that share

859
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:40,490
some pieces of code so our approach was
more

860
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:45,090
I oriented to say okay this to I don't
know which of the two inherited from the

861
00:54:45,090 --> 00:54:45,600
other

862
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:49,320
but I know that these two samples ever
seen our viewer

863
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:52,550
and that seem to be a very sexual scene
lamented in this

864
00:54:52,550 --> 00:54:55,840
the very same way so they may have
changed code

865
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:59,240
10 that you may have stolen could from
each other are

866
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:03,050
or being mean just you know it may just
be the that behavior

867
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:06,530
can be implemented only in that same
that specific way

868
00:55:06,530 --> 00:55:09,720
there are some very simple things that I
mean if you

869
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:12,800
twenty students in front of them and you
have them

870
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:17,050
implemented more or less you will end up
with reasonably similar

871
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:20,300
coat as long as something is is very
simple so

872
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:23,390
it's very difficult to actually see if
the if there is a

873
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:30,050
if there is a the San 3 in that sense

874
00:55:30,050 --> 00:55:33,810
any other questions

875
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:37,100
thank you very much for your patience
and attend the status of

876
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:41,390
and if you if you want to talk to me I
will be around for differential

877
00:55:41,390 --> 00:55:43,110
conference so feel free to stop

878
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:50,110
ok thank you very much

879
00:55:58,299 --> 00:55:59,730
this

880
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:06,730
sleep
