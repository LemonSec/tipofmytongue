27
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,670
I've been on the iPhone

28
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:55,810
acting scenes since I 2009

29
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:59,069
and and worked on different things

30
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:02,560
on the drum stuff I put stuff and then

31
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,179
use the land can invent stuff I'm

32
00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:13,010
mock I'm Mokdad I am and security
vulnerability researcher

33
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,750
I've been doing it for a long time and
the recently started again I miss issue

34
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,550
particularly

35
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:21,520
on and the like pox virus five min I
really looking at the

36
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,150
I'm 6 security that is a match recently

37
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:29,490
I'm a relative newcomer Jim leave yeah
we had on

38
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:32,690
awesome presentation yesterday I am

39
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,890
does it a bit more bottom you print
edition

40
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:39,540
good afternoon -6 I yeah I mean the
presentation we did

41
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,890
focused on account security improvements
that the man I'm

42
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:48,280
6 and they basically the future I have
many in the security features

43
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,520
compared to previous I'm engines adding

44
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,130
my castle are I'm he pardoning
strategies

45
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:58,990
address its protection and of some fun
things

46
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:02,940
so it's significantly harder to write
kind

47
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,940
exploits of round six and once I'm

48
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:10,790
I'm who Obama I mean guys give us a bit
over

49
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:14,620
what research because it working on with
got so I A six in

50
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,920
the findings and the changes in the US
I'm actually looking at the same thing

51
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,980
that Mark has

52
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:24,470
for a while an arm actually I'm glad it
turned his talk yesterday because he

53
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,880
gave me some new ideas

54
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,790
we had some chrome on abilities leftover

55
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,940
that Apple had successfully mitigated
with its new changes in a six-man

56
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,160
you know Mark show that those changes
are definitely overcome

57
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,640
arm I don't think we have anything for

58
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,930
user lanyard for noms we still have

59
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:48,570
a few tricks up her sleeve yes auerbach
improvements to

60
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:51,730
like the bass man my from the bathroom

61
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,790
is actually been drastic change in the
basement

62
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:59,150
last year used to be a very hard to get
in a mock

63
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:04,170
for anyone new carrier now did you can
do things on the web site content from

64
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:09,490
between 10 three dollars you can get in
a mock really divided homes on me back

65
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,430
for iPhone

66
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,750
and its doesn't burn business

67
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:18,100
and sort and pack with didn't these
right albert is requiring some perhaps

68
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:18,930
percent

69
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:23,289
%ah so it's almost like there's soon be
Union address

70
00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:27,419
except for the interest in it's a
further you know uniqueness of Prizren

71
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:30,570
packing in its own right no real purpose

72
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,689
I can be spending more Africa arm

73
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:37,560
what about Tom with iPhone 5 like on
this in future I'm

74
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,590
doesn't really change things for baseman
acting in unlocking

75
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,599
well I mean ironically it's it's exactly
the same situation

76
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:46,719
on was that the released the iPhone 5 be
dropping getting

77
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:50,069
an unofficial but still on just as
official

78
00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:53,840
amok through want to use the web mongers

79
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,560
so fundamentally what has actually
changed on a hard when a

80
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,819
overtly is the business in this change
right dev

81
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:03,909
believe they now have enough people
working at on the turners

82
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:08,249
you too surreptitiously inter-lining
eyes into Apple's official video is

83
00:05:08,249 --> 00:05:11,620
om and does not give notice during

84
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:15,550
this is existing while not going to get
as popular as it has for

85
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:18,909
them to you to do this without being
noticed but now if you know that's why

86
00:05:18,909 --> 00:05:20,120
it's a pokémon

87
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,219
you can I'm Muslim corner

88
00:05:23,219 --> 00:05:27,360
website 3 about the GV when when he was
gonna

89
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,360
your thoughts on I'm A six arm

90
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,749
yeah who've you been doing on the 16

91
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:37,240
I was posing because the

92
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,270
I'm my job they have something to to
work on that moments

93
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:45,300
so I poems my word

94
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:51,069
now I'm them resume like week to week
ago

95
00:05:51,069 --> 00:05:54,969
and when I'm with pleated in fact

96
00:05:54,969 --> 00:05:58,509
our work on I was 67

97
00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:01,779
David it's not working on cam box and

98
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:05,199
trying to exploited to exploit the old

99
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,610
the rabbits we have by the past that

100
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:11,759
because the you securities don't work
anymore

101
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,139
so is trying to think that's and and
myself is working on the USANA

102
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:19,550
that straight to to find heredity to

103
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,620
to to treat get the code execution

104
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,439
to of Lansing at the moment said I'm

105
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:29,509
I'm kind of stuck I have to recognize
bats

106
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:33,099
you know its third change E

107
00:06:33,099 --> 00:06:36,249
the country's its it's like as the

108
00:06:36,249 --> 00:06:41,099
yeah market your you needed a paper is
the entire 60

109
00:06:41,099 --> 00:06:44,449
in the findings that that you found I
believe you actually presented

110
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:47,909
jailbreak of some sort in if you should
see the running

111
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:50,960
there's been a bit more about the
technical aspects of how that was

112
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,779
possible

113
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:55,520
yahoo.com the thing we demonstrated was
not axe leave

114
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,539
it out right back at the Vanity
persistence like breakdowns

115
00:06:58,539 --> 00:07:01,819
on the thing we demonstrated with and in
town

116
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:05,279
to some that we may down as I

117
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:08,689
and whose presented with me feel
unwelcome

118
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:11,930
on that that too and I'm basically

119
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:15,289
used and how might exploit to game I'm

120
00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:19,080
thankful privileges to the Islands I'm 6
as

121
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,849
running on fine and now from an had
makes modifications

122
00:07:23,849 --> 00:07:27,139
to various things within the county so
that we can run

123
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:32,349
I'm like I don't like basically an
individual policies on of to make it

124
00:07:32,349 --> 00:07:35,830
so that we can bug stuff Radley

125
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:40,800
with 2 C's with interesting that other
that kinda majorities in

126
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,129
business partner would never be as
popular as as a as a

127
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:47,259
temperatures we know today I feel a lot
more useful

128
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:50,509
to people who are secured conscious and
you don't want

129
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:54,089
to know that when you do a job right you
really are

130
00:07:54,089 --> 00:07:57,849
weakening weakening the defense's on in
many ways to

131
00:07:57,849 --> 00:08:01,009
that server Joburg is actually your
preferred by buys

132
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:04,669
some by no by segment numbers because

133
00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:07,930
you don't want to open things premium
you know

134
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:12,550
with forgive the pun the return policy
on

135
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:16,430
3 so the findings that Mark has how much

136
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,930
added benefit does that give thanks to
you guys for iPhone Dev Team

137
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:23,409
what do you mean like how much was that
improve your I'm on what are you guys

138
00:08:23,409 --> 00:08:26,580
as a shorten the time that we only see

139
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,610
I'm gonna feel recall unlock home

140
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,680
marc has given line excellent ideas to
on us

141
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,740
including Apple so it sa I

142
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,760
wetzel yes it's definitely the lead
story his talk is extremely interesting

143
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,400
I mean

144
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,500
their own logs things there it is close
and not things are useful

145
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,220
on I would say that some things that

146
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:53,449
Apple could close and some things you
know are more general techniques that

147
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:55,410
can be applied to more than one

148
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,430
on our ability which is you know useful
to on research is that Apple definitely

149
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,779
can mitigate with now

150
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:03,779
any zone major architectural changes

151
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:06,980
so I would say that overall it does

152
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,040
are it does help jailbreakers for Dom

153
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,449
definitely you know it's not a
completely you know

154
00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:16,880
%ah if it I can't really good thing

155
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,149
for us and part what you think

156
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:23,490
yeah I'm to I want to

157
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,209
to explain something in fact a jailbreak
ios

158
00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:30,350
on difference things there the

159
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,730
camp parks the can exploit that thats

160
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:36,959
required to modify the camera itself so
it can

161
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,329
for example map readable executed

162
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:43,570
and rated beaches

163
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:46,829
this is one bottom the jailbreak the

164
00:09:46,829 --> 00:09:50,209
their different paths he did as well
because

165
00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:53,959
we did too inject them the required
fines to

166
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:57,320
the defiance for we're we have a salute
to

167
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,490
to have some code execution accuse an
end to

168
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:04,310
trigger the camera it's going om am

169
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:07,470
sometime this exploits that the same the
one

170
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:11,339
that it is study them to so in fact that

171
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:14,550
absolutely we have to packets everything
in a2

172
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:19,639
so I mean when you through can exploit
working

173
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:23,500
to do rate for developers I mean this is
Sam

174
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,889
only a few precedents of the of the
workers

175
00:10:26,889 --> 00:10:33,000
needed to to make the wall stuff so

176
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,490
what's marked deeds with said his
colleague

177
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:39,850
on the complex with a shin is is really
impressive

178
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:43,380
because 0 the the by the bypass to love

179
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,800
securities the camera but its

180
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,480
only a part of the of the wall stuff to
to do so

181
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,990
I am expect people to to

182
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:57,149
to requests jailbreak okay it's done so
you can visit

183
00:10:57,149 --> 00:11:00,509
net its regret rights bit no know it's

184
00:11:00,509 --> 00:11:05,060
doesn't work this way cool %uh so what
do you guys think in your opinion

185
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:09,410
would it take for Apple to actually stop
filbrick or close it to the point where

186
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,220
is just no longer feasible

187
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:15,300
noises takes too much time in a reason
to be bothered to do it

188
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,839
i mean one one policy really to do this
is by offering on the same

189
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:22,029
freedom you get with children with the
official

190
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:26,579
in in March inward really happened I
would with almost everything that was in

191
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:29,880
you look back on the original job
recruiting offered Apple has

192
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,449
from you know Tuesday proper you know
ninety nine-percent

193
00:11:33,449 --> 00:11:37,380
would you do back then there are some
things that you will never be able to

194
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,410
open up because of security

195
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:43,420
on switch when it deals with actors and
my sister

196
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:48,670
more hard word right but one policy with
you can do just by doing with the

197
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,319
continuing

198
00:11:49,319 --> 00:11:52,370
to do now are more and more

199
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:55,750
but what Obama technical standpoint is
there anything that can really do too

200
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:59,889
I don't the constructing software

201
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:03,149
I mean its toughest adequate you know
that the the %um

202
00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:10,149
things growing new features and in the
future aren't always fully custom

203
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:14,139
getting there would be a a hardware trip
that they might add on

204
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:17,379
actually you know on extra security
features

205
00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:21,050
perhaps there are hundreds worth already
departed policy

206
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:24,870
place today from the heart thing that
are on for today on our

207
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:28,620
force ultimately to be level armor with
with hardware

208
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,069
is opposite a buddy from the audience

209
00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:36,069
want to have a question as well the feel
free to raise your hand and I'll

210
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:40,660
calling you guys alright for yeah I
wanna that one thing that they did that

211
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,319
was our

212
00:12:41,319 --> 00:12:45,819
really effective in stopping on locks is
that they had a hardware switch

213
00:12:45,819 --> 00:12:49,230
damn made sure that r Memory now mom

214
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:52,889
is executable in the baseband can no
longer rewritten to

215
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:56,069
and vice versa any memory that can be
writeable is not exactly

216
00:12:56,069 --> 00:13:00,629
and this is a hardware switched at once
turn on cannot be turned off and it was

217
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:05,000
really effective ins stopping us from
doing baseband marks

218
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,250
and I'm planning something like dad and

219
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:12,279
I'll ask would also be very effective
unfortunately there's no way did they

220
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:13,329
can do it because the

221
00:13:13,329 --> 00:13:18,329
still need on you know it's the still
need applications to be loaded from

222
00:13:18,329 --> 00:13:21,540
the from software dinghy different
developers to keep developing

223
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,740
applications is a complete different Mar
mince I don't think they can

224
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:28,940
lock it down ever technically as long as
they could on and they span

225
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:33,550
and you know the best reason I think
that Apple has

226
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,959
on stopped base now not so much that
they may

227
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,649
there's been so many easier ways to get
your eye

228
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:44,550
your iPhone unlocked just from a policy
standpoint an

229
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:47,810
I think you know if they really want to
stop generating they would change their

230
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:50,629
policy so that you could do more more
stuff

231
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:54,310
without jailbreaking assume

232
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:58,459
indecency to at some

233
00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:01,509
with every who is version

234
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:04,949
the Securities reinforced more and more

235
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:08,680
sna maybe one time no temperance be
possible

236
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,370
in a in possible period of time

237
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:16,040
in to its in between to realism I was
the one

238
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,389
we will be able to find exploits to to
break it

239
00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:24,230
that specific am mine announces a points
in fact

240
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:28,649
of Apple trying to to to secure a US

241
00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:31,750
in a way that we can't executes

242
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:35,589
treats on on the system modification

243
00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:39,670
I'm sure the good could find something
they could find something that happens

244
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,410
to

245
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:44,399
arm secure their business with the App
Store

246
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,879
let's leading people do tricks on the

247
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:53,120
the operating system I'm sure the can
find something

248
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,990
and this is my message to to happen
please with your sys-con

249
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:03,100
the 101st Apple these open system in a
way to keep it the man behind I recently

250
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,529
with that rebounds maps

251
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:08,000
business and I know if not for
everything from five people when

252
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,120
everyone was on

253
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,129
are I was 5 and forced

254
00:15:12,129 --> 00:15:16,750
in 2006 the realize release on stinky
maps

255
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,290
optician wanted to go back down five the
couldn't do it and ultimately

256
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:25,610
you can't do it because no happen soon
focused on not letting you down

257
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:29,149
you can't to demand a freeze on boxer

258
00:15:29,149 --> 00:15:32,180
that party so strict that it's actually
I think it affected

259
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:35,279
the bottom line with this massive people
are realizing

260
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:39,209
I'm really being put forward by I don't
really have even freedom to be on your

261
00:15:39,209 --> 00:15:40,129
ass in a non

262
00:15:40,129 --> 00:15:43,480
an hour you know it isn't really want to
go back down five

263
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:48,689
you can't do it because I his policy the
Apple have all come about with

264
00:15:48,689 --> 00:15:53,189
like what Google Android is the words
unlocked bootloader

265
00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:59,519
never I can see good reason for them to
go that far

266
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,680
I could be moving up in 10 not not

267
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,019
yeah on you know I think that ship has
sailed I think the

268
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:10,139
from lead on about it when the for first
doing I'm

269
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:13,139
somebody to say it was a bad idea or
something like that because I can see

270
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,120
them going back down

271
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:19,689
would have a reason to I any person from
the audience

272
00:16:19,689 --> 00:16:23,310
I'm sure you guys have some questions

273
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:27,029
yep this

274
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:30,459
i was just wondering and if you guys
working on Apple TV 3

275
00:16:30,459 --> 00:16:34,689
and how much it overlaps with Silas

276
00:16:34,689 --> 00:16:39,100
and we were gonna from and none of us
are working on Apple TV 3 min

277
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,769
you know we know people who we do sound
the Apple TV stuff

278
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:46,529
there's one more lap Dr colonels the
same for example one

279
00:16:46,529 --> 00:16:50,259
lot the system services are same not
home

280
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:54,949
arm for one thing mobile backup service
that we use

281
00:16:54,949 --> 00:17:01,139
to inject the inject the exploit that we
use for previous job race is not present

282
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:02,310
on the

283
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:06,550
Apple TV cell the attack surface foreign
for some the usual and stuff especially

284
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,730
the injection stuff is a lot smaller so

285
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:12,150
home so yeah there are over last night
is also

286
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:16,550
particularly challenging there's very
little interaction between the user or

287
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,189
iTunes

288
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:20,230
and the Apple TV 3 you know you're going
through the remote

289
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:23,279
in otherwise abuse going on

290
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:27,120
network not really interacting with the
directly very much

291
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,480
very few opportunities to to too much
with your

292
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,390
with tradition

293
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:39,150
yeah this is the point is

294
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:42,590
this that the lot of of Service said
overlaps

295
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:45,610
the lot of them for example the
different its book

296
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:48,940
expensive be used for a

297
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:53,970
produce fish in the US um the use and
exploit the camel exploit the

298
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:57,150
and the Rings ride everything works

299
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:00,279
the people tv3 fact there's no

300
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:04,570
issue issue is is thats we

301
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:09,620
weekend just send the file at the right
place on the filesystem

302
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:13,710
with missus this bottom above the
jailbreak

303
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:17,080
so as I as I said previously Wrexham a
lot of

304
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,240
exploits difference to and the we miss

305
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,700
only one party approved a pretty arm

306
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:28,799
acing whiz I was 6 with them tried to
find

307
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,340
an injection victimizes thats that's
compatible we will

308
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,440
friends uses finding it to fix

309
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,460
darts compatible with to be three birds

310
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,500
you know the exe faces

311
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,679
is reduced so I don't know

312
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:50,120
who I we've got a question how that's
coming in from 2 to

313
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,440
and also if anybody if you are watching
this on you she might be the thing about

314
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,500
250

315
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,350
triana people currently tuned in I if
you guys have blessed is the one of the

316
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:58,799
panel

317
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,240
these cheaters with the hash tag half it
had to be live

an Las aggression so want this is this
year's actually

319
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:10,029
I'll what's the most complex difficult
part of our job creation

320
00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:13,100
a month maybe my wanna I'm

321
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,539
on Adana with his lawn stuff monthly
figures

322
00:19:16,539 --> 00:19:20,440
stuff Hannah icon Sangam its it's a lot
different

323
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,659
now I'm 6 how 95 is definitely

324
00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:26,820
I'm not a talented there but to

325
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,980
intensive some other stuff these other
guys talking about

326
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:34,580
about happening farm office right place
I'm

327
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:38,580
had to do that for my work I have been
luckier

328
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,620
what to do anything like with what would
you guys think is the most difficult

329
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,610
part about

330
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:45,830
duplication that this is with the tutor
file

331
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:50,650
about this it's interesting with Mark A
something that's ago

332
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:54,610
by the past the most difficult part with
the use and

333
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,809
1 and the cam pathways the

334
00:19:57,809 --> 00:20:02,289
the really easy one because there were
no protection at home

335
00:20:02,289 --> 00:20:05,380
the the cam now

336
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:09,150
i sync was I was six this is different

337
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:12,320
yeah boasts spots

338
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,679
on the same complexity

339
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,899
that's why this pleated worked with with
the

340
00:20:19,899 --> 00:20:23,669
critics believe them over the split work
that you guys

341
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:27,799
yeah I mean like I am was the interests
internal stuff because

342
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:31,520
II I always bitches in trials in

343
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,770
low-level hardware have a things then
and

344
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:38,309
party G as a lot more experience that
the usual and sidings

345
00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:41,490
arm my background comes from on the way
back we're doing

346
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:45,179
Rompuy a boiler explosion ROM exploits

347
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:48,320
arm I tend to be more comfortable with
that sort of thing and

348
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,450
parties obviously come from a more

349
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:55,159
you know traditional background in in
the terms and

350
00:20:55,159 --> 00:20:59,190
in the types of exploits that are more
generally interesting to security

351
00:20:59,190 --> 00:20:59,770
community

352
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:04,730
like return program and things like that

353
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:09,610
no significant departure from that was
your whose shanor

354
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:13,059
chapter to China

355
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:17,309
sorry I mean few and far between chatter
every that SAT

356
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:21,440
the brown from its myron I mean that's
right you

357
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,440
really came through with that but it
ended up not being used use phone

358
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,919
in the public gallery because myron

359
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:33,490
you you want me to the montana fact his
car trusting your

360
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:36,929
your that's true I figured out how
Africa the first thing that we were

361
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:38,120
trying to get images can

362
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,610
which is a brewery thing was it your own
thing the first thing we worked on

363
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:43,990
together was actually on

364
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:47,120
was a call he was called 24k phone
that's right

365
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,909
an yeah for completely forgot about that
if

366
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:54,169
yes %ah yeah we work together on

367
00:21:54,169 --> 00:21:58,809
on this end this first the X exploit
them

368
00:21:58,809 --> 00:22:04,120
and it was in 2009 it so that's some
years ago

369
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:08,029
we're we dumped the boot room

370
00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:12,630
then there than by static in the and the
places we found that there

371
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:16,029
there were some overflew in the

372
00:22:16,029 --> 00:22:19,090
yes the SSN David came with the idea

373
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:22,419
that's we could use it to you modified

374
00:22:22,419 --> 00:22:26,470
the shower just as in and bites

375
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:31,130
to as a stack no there the boot room I
remember it was

376
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:34,309
really really via interesting amazing
stuff

377
00:22:34,309 --> 00:22:37,520
because and working on the boot ROM is
not like a

378
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,950
working on USANA stuff %um

379
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:44,320
you playing with your ID trying

380
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,580
to do static and I season find the right
places

381
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:51,059
you don't have any feedback from the
boot room yeah it's

382
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:54,570
its rise to you can see the stock an arm

383
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:57,679
because there's no crash times or
anything like that so you basically have

384
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,370
to stack the allies in

385
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:03,809
and find reconstruct with the stock
should be at the time of the crash

386
00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:08,490
and an hour I really love working they
do is diagnosis because I love

387
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:12,279
doing reverse engineering on is really
slow and sometimes

388
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:15,419
you know I've to do a lot of
Azerbaijan's attaching the muggers

389
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:16,260
something I never

390
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:20,470
you know I just have more fun doing stag
houses

391
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:23,929
and the same I always go back to stock
now augment

392
00:23:23,929 --> 00:23:28,490
absolutely necessary a kind word and

393
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,600
as him because he wanted to on is any
chance that we'll get

394
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,039
on lovable comics Mike services again

395
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,409
you guys will see them I me relieved now
have

396
00:23:38,409 --> 00:23:42,309
around them the Mersey devices

397
00:23:42,309 --> 00:23:45,940
%um likely and I'm

398
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:50,870
I there's a chance that the man it seems
to be wrong with the iPhone 5

399
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:54,890
rate I was just are being in the dump it

400
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:59,240
arm while I mean is a it the iPhone 5
uses a different connectors

401
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,840
turn might be a chance that the
changeable around there might be a

402
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,740
chance that the introduce some bugs

403
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:08,269
to it with that change in there might be
a chance that the didn't make any as

404
00:24:08,269 --> 00:24:13,669
securely unreadable as known we haven't
really looked at is the truth

405
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:16,940
laundry done official with the Nuclear
even at 100

406
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:21,960
Houston room

407
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,909
but that would be the first to begin
random too much

408
00:24:25,909 --> 00:24:31,080
before that you can turn a crash you
know you too much

409
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,179
so arm when you guys where'd you guys
cock with you

410
00:24:34,179 --> 00:24:37,309
one fun when ability nice what you guys

411
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:41,490
due to start looking for opportunities

412
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:45,529
would you even begin I mean on debris
using where you've been before

413
00:24:45,529 --> 00:24:48,570
Apple oftentimes Texas directly the
problem use

414
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,860
Spurs with the children but they don't
often 63 problem when they don't

415
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,860
completely fix

416
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:56,429
you explorers in first place so a lot of
time these reviews

417
00:24:56,429 --> 00:25:00,409
I think between at last future Richard
for you something about my

418
00:25:00,409 --> 00:25:03,590
gone with a raccoon more rigorously
after

419
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:07,159
after the gingerbread they would have
prevented

420
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:11,179
March 1 so I'm the exquisite you guys
used in 5111

421
00:25:11,179 --> 00:25:14,740
on filbrick I have they all been closed
own

422
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:21,029
verified yeah actually as RTG the
question how do you find bonneville is

423
00:25:21,029 --> 00:25:24,500
and fell several times it has because
you know he finds a lot more

424
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,700
model is an idea of and his answer is
idea

425
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,679
what do you apparently don't know what
that means

426
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,350
as have the he gets lucky again the
members in

427
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:39,690
he went off if you look at the CBC's for
at some point right for

428
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:42,960
a record for from for record yeah and

429
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,470
watch their the mailing lists vids and

430
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:51,010
and found at that's why I call it luck

431
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:54,850
so the

432
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:58,279
11 one guy yeah report its

433
00:25:58,279 --> 00:26:02,010
a problem with raccoon now that serves
you

434
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:06,279
throughout woods three sections
three-month configs section

435
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:09,960
the conflagration fine %ah it crashes

436
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,409
recoup and nobody answered to to him the
meeting its

437
00:26:13,409 --> 00:26:16,480
so I just tried to do the same on my

438
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,950
my iPhone the key it crashed so

439
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:23,080
for the problem was nuts about the the

440
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:26,890
configure but configure sections that's
it was

441
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:30,200
related to the number of tennis
statements

442
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,510
in its but anyway it was a it was like

443
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:37,250
the the worst the will stuff was like
because on

444
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:41,500
them the configuration the the memory
the configuration have everything

445
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:45,039
and stew to exploit its to bypass

446
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:48,110
a SNR harassing sOooo yeah was

447
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:52,950
was lucky 3 and a cock comics is had to
make sure thing

448
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:56,870

refrigerant to you

450
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:04,350
to britain manager opportunities I'm you
can often

451
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:09,110
in terms of use used as it has been for
mailing lists for Stevies for

452
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:12,570
stuff that you knew that we're was in

462
00:27:43,419 --> 00:27:46,980
90 for Tom using land mines tend to be

463
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:50,279
you have to use of modern them to do
like 10 jailbreak so

464
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:53,289
there we have to use up a lot

465
00:27:53,289 --> 00:27:57,389
have a buffer for those I think it's
imperative that you always have a knife

466
00:27:57,389 --> 00:28:00,909
sleeve your you could

467
00:28:00,909 --> 00:28:05,929
gonna keep coming to North for rent

468
00:28:05,929 --> 00:28:09,470
%um Tom yeah

469
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:13,809
we have some stuff kama we have
something to expect

470
00:28:13,809 --> 00:28:17,649
we have also people know seem

471
00:28:17,649 --> 00:28:21,799
that tweeter but there is a at tempering

472
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:24,980
the film favorite brands that exists

473
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:28,299
the and it's too execute sign unsigned
code on

474
00:28:28,299 --> 00:28:31,600
the device thats it requires jus

475
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,870
to have developers such became to

476
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:38,350
to use its and developers you know I

477
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:42,279
under d so you we can it's use this
stuff

478
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:45,679
anyway and it relies on

479
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,760
on some executive

480
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,360
that's it is developers

481
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:56,250
on mister so yes we have different
scenes

482
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:59,250
%ah with his like as aryan the

483
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:02,570
use on parts

484
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:06,010
I'm I'm still cautious confidence we
weekend

485
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:09,580
Kim find something in the next few weeks

486
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:14,470
with you renews every I necklaces from
the floor

487
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:21,170
I'm because

488
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:24,790
hi there may come from a secure great
panel arm

489
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:28,570
I've a question regarding general
security

490
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:32,760
on US devices iPhone has been out for
five years now

491
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,920
as you know we've seen no no real-world

492
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:39,870
mile with problems on my fone zone or

493
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:43,980
US devices and/or arm that's despite the
fact that these

494
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:47,809
your abilities exists in basically many
of these jailbreaks are basically

495
00:29:47,809 --> 00:29:48,980
drive-by downloads the

496
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:52,680
exactly the same technique could be used
to malicious on phones

497
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:57,200
any ideas why we haven't see real-world
malicious attacks on

498
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,280
we might just not be detected and I'm

499
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,500
and I don't see any reason why there
could be arm

500
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,840
but it's a significant amount of
investment for the attacker I suppose

501
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:13,420
because they have to generally I use
some experts and stuff like that

502
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:17,590
but definitely if there's money to be
made them so people

503
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:22,500
do it i think is a picture

504
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:26,290
I think back in the early days when it
was easy to adopt

505
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:30,290
Joe breaks for your own use and various
or not

506
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:34,760
I think whose is what was popular back
then nowadays I'm

507
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:38,450
I from is extremely popular but the
method used to do the job right

508
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:42,290
you know secretary to change model
exports one after the other in

509
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:46,350
and I because just is just more
complicated for a random third-party to

510
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:50,130
to adapt without on inside without these
jobs

511
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:54,150
for their own again I am

512
00:30:54,150 --> 00:31:00,170
don't believe that this is not happening
I think it's from happening real my

513
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:03,900
my my my guess I don't see any reason

514
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:07,120
why we could have where some

515
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,410
the the I US thats there's

516
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,910
something I E I want points stands is
thats

517
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:18,179
I'm you said it the same process in fact

518
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:21,500
to jailbreak hard to create mine where

519
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,510
it's not a to the true

520
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:29,310
because we are only using local exploits
in fact in late as June breaks

521
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:32,710
om so yeah it was

522
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:36,910
true with Judd Gregg the and and/or

523
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:40,200
and when these jump X that's not really
true

524
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,090
is with local exploits liters generates
we

525
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:48,520
with it actually we've we've had some
moms

526
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,000
medication on Armada John Deere

527
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,040
I believe when there is a certificate
problem

528
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:58,400
on that was causing some concern

529
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,410
human often is part of the job right as
Burma downloadable

530
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:05,230
package generator UN often in fix the
certificate from where

531
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:08,810
the cruise some interesting certificate
authority or something

532
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:11,870
arguing often just needed a robust
package you could

533
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:15,420
usually beef up your that version and
firmware

534
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:19,220
I compared to the stockard firmer by
being Joburg

535
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:23,010
and mines on package acids 100 back into
things interesting

536
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:26,110
I'm every time we have as drive-by

537
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:30,330
down situation we always had a hatch
foreign release at the same time

538
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:35,210
in fact on not out I'm think that's
relevant because the percentage of my

539
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:35,860
phones be

540
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:39,230
that are actually jailbroken iOS is
relatively low so you know there's

541
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:40,870
always going to be a lot of people

542
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:44,400
one will be passed but it's there

543
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:48,150
cool inadequate from on

544
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:52,860
got about 25 minutes left 1s

545
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:56,810
home this question senator too touristy

546
00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:00,140
a little bit more well you went through
and reversed

547
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:03,720
almost every single birdie iPhone to the
point regard and returning on it

548
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,419
completely

549
00:33:04,419 --> 00:33:07,490
and you can even acceptance and phone
calls on

550
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:10,640
on on can usually not a good about how
you did that

551
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,160
and what would be arm necessary for
spirited

552
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:18,669
on the lead spices yahoo.com it's been a
while

553
00:33:18,669 --> 00:33:22,940
and there's been a lot changes but
basically what I did was I looked at

554
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:23,440
them

555
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:28,760
loner I do which uses mostly the which
has pretty simple code is pretty compact

556
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:33,630
smaller than the entire I was colonel
and he uses la the hardware so

557
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:36,700
I went through an you know physically
picked up

558
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:41,750
picked it apart figured out how to run
on devices that these at a basic level

559
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:47,280
and then I wrote Linux drivers for all
these various different hardware devices

560
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:47,840
there

561
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:52,260
Mon different hardware devices and noms
that's basically what I did

562
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:55,660
try the hardest part was just getting
the fast translation where

563
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:59,580
going working because who is a very
complex algorithm

564
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:03,929
arm right now we still have access to
the pool owners for the lead is a vice

565
00:34:03,929 --> 00:34:04,580
is worth the risk

566
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:07,690
exception a the iPhone

567
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:11,020
5 I believe law and for us so

568
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:14,240
mom with down as you can I'm breeze

569
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:19,409
mmm you could basically rivers actually
you also have the kernel for the

570
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:23,480
further for us and on your iPad so you
can basically reverses colonel

571
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,899
or you can also reversed I'd on your
devices

572
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:30,899
in order to figure our works

573
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:34,609
yeah the FTL as an example summers
assume

574
00:34:34,609 --> 00:34:38,440
now every night innately people
continued with this work trying to get

575
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:42,290
other other I found another firm earns
working

576
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:45,419
Andrew om but the feeling that are being
a really big issue

577
00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:49,820
think again doing this project because
ft all by itself is changing so

578
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:53,679
so frequently depicted Apple's using
Bernard

579
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:57,670
the cue track not only give the
different if you offer different devices

580
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:01,430
you to convert into you all through the
different farmers and is rapidly

581
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:04,460
and I think at a certain I think I think
it while you can

582
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:08,359
getting early could focus on one from
where in one device I think trying to

583
00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:11,760
trying to expand at a mob rises more
details

584
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,670
and to be quite a when task yeah I'm we
ve you really have to have absolutely no

585
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:17,320
life

586
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:22,420
to University once

587
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:27,290
cool any other person

588
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:31,010
no okay home I'll at sea

589
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:35,400
are we do have person I side near the
back

590
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,230
question to anyone of you members
wouldn't do

591
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:43,120
to develop something like can emulator
the proper

592
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:46,580
QEMU date thing for

593
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:49,870
running bureau stuff on it

594
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:54,070
you know we love the great things and
play and make non-persistent

595
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:59,580
cochran Chris we've had a virgin for
again from these earlier devices

596
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:03,050
and using who's a branch of Qumu

597
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:06,640
and it was working to try to get the
fuse brooding on

598
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,890
I don't know if he was able to get past
I don't because the utility

599
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:13,230
point in getting past fairplay which is
used for a lot of

600
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:18,820
production do not contact but use

601
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:21,840
reading all the way into the OAS and at
least stern

602
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:25,170
some musica after that has since I'm

603
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:28,380
stopped around the Kansas

604
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:32,490
you know Chris when I'm joins the
company's

605
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:36,980
the time as abuses there the army joined
picking up the pieces for dinner

606
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:41,630
are some other yahoo.com I mean in order
to do that in the first place you have

607
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:42,530
to actually

608
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:46,530
arm reverse everything how we're is
almost everything about the hardware

609
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:47,010
zone

610
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:50,740
basically would have to almost be able
to make the Linux

611
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:54,220
Android for before you're able to read
it any later in the first place

612
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,070
obviously that's why our

613
00:36:56,070 --> 00:37:00,180
and there also may be additional legal
issues like Apple really hates it when

614
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:04,070
you're under south around sometimes not
Apple devices

615
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:07,450
sentencing you have never really hates
now

616
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:12,890
is leaving hates if you make complaints
about their hiring

617
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:16,260
like the new retin-a displayed at a
morning and as a ghosting effect they

618
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,359
can see the ghost of Steve Jobs

619
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:22,609
I the heated effective

620
00:37:22,609 --> 00:37:26,090
Park are the issues that that the
hardware itself is Martyn

621
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:29,770
Martinez i'm too tired to it are trying
to determine if you don't have

622
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:30,950
documentation

623
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:35,700
for the producers bits and pieces

624
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,420
thanks glistening from to is free public

625
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:43,070
filbrick sustainable

626
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:47,730
free public you soldier breaks are
available for free without

627
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:51,040
I mean I don't ever sleepy public
regular happening

628
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,430
you I'm

629
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:57,290
it's the same as long as it people you
know continued interest and I don't

630
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:57,770
think

631
00:37:57,770 --> 00:38:01,140
a good I think it's unfair to expect to
generate from the point ovaries

632
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:04,589
many opening and income coming on a map

633
00:38:04,589 --> 00:38:08,060
I think there are some things that you
you actually we into the primaries

634
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:12,100
to to to make public operatic a lifetime
2.0

635
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:16,680
releases bring in too many changes you
need to

636
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:20,300
you setback in see where you are freakin

637
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,859
and I think you know that would got
exactly what happened with my partner

638
00:38:23,859 --> 00:38:27,100
no by the time you had your stuff mom

639
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:34,100
for the for the five-point next job rate
was 35 born

640
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:39,130
I think timing is I think a I think well
we set up some expectations for

641
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,240
something to be removed

642
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,760
some using all time I think a the
realities

643
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,210
when when is a major change like this
I'm

644
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:50,620
which the Ruby returns a pointer to

645
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:53,930
sit back and expect there'd be another
some reason other

646
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:57,990
wanted to use releases from Apple before
you can see something

647
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:01,270
who I'm this offer some clues new on the
scene

648
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:05,390
who wants to get involved with jewelry
on what's the best way to get involved

649
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:05,940
with it and

650
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:10,580
months to come tools that you would need
what kind of software do you guys use

651
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:14,060
okay here have answered this question

652
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:18,570
lot of times yeah and so on

653
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:22,560
to stop some to breaking first you need
to to understand

654
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,620
every seeing related to exploration
because it's

655
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:30,210
recant exploits and so you have to stop

656
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:33,470
reading books on its

657
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:36,589
like for example I was hackers and book

658
00:39:36,589 --> 00:39:39,310
thats that sir

659
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,770
that was released some some months ago

660
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:45,359
are who s sex was six actors and book
are on

661
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:48,890
have I'm one book that I now that I

662
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:53,720
like much easier acquired took 18 X

663
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,849
expectations something like that and

664
00:39:56,849 --> 00:40:02,349
Israel nice also the when you you
understand all the principals

665
00:40:02,349 --> 00:40:06,970
of this book's you can metre you can
enter the jailbreaking community

666
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:11,930
in fact have a question RT did you read
all these months before you join

667
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:15,050
his and no

668
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:19,000
bit but I started long time ago I mean
sna

669
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,849
at that time things went pretty
difference

670
00:40:22,849 --> 00:40:26,329
there were no protections now

671
00:40:26,329 --> 00:40:31,270
I'm no you predictions those that
prediction NEC

672
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:34,700
so it was an just not Z

673
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,770
at that time even even if

674
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:40,859
view we did some some crazy stuff with
the which from

675
00:40:40,859 --> 00:40:44,950
ano it was a it with easy today the

676
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:48,900
its it is not anymore and them it is a

677
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:52,390
only the only a few people on the

678
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:56,670
people involved involved in in security
research

679
00:40:56,670 --> 00:41:00,710
people in fact speakers your people

680
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:04,119
in the assembly here 10 can can't do
this

681
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:07,190
the and sink

682
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:12,000
newcomers may be Anna guys with some
development

683
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,890
know ledge are something can and tear
the

684
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,890
the deedrick community like this

685
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:23,430
I kinda agree with a TD really depends
we starting from

686
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:26,940
arm I like I said before I I'm the
studying I

687
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:30,880
affair fairly recently those very
familiar with exploitation

688
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,349
stuff from on previous work that I've
done

689
00:41:34,349 --> 00:41:37,980
and I thought the easiest way to to to
start with

690
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:41,000
I my stuff was basically damnit the eggs
and use of

691
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,010
start reading and and then like try a
few things on

692
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:48,060
on our index and if like it's working
out then

693
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:51,680
transition over to two islands arm so
that's how

694
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,500
that's how I got done I'm you come to
think I

695
00:41:55,500 --> 00:42:00,140
I think I am you know my Marine
obviously the lamina

696
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:03,560
wide its gives you a perfect opportunity
to you now

697
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:07,480
into you don't even need to dutiful
job-related snuff

698
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:11,560
hot 100 degrees very satisfying enough
to get a piece is it working

699
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:15,270
I didn't want to give them advice is
question 100 problem

700
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:19,150
you the center up but I you this very
good answer which is our

701
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:22,180
you know one way to get into it is to
pick something that you can't

702
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:25,329
do right now on on IRAs and

703
00:42:25,329 --> 00:42:29,839
and just use that as your old records
and Grandma do a good job renewed

704
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:33,500
Melissa you want to be able to you know
on the slider

705
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:38,060
from mocking to myself on the topic on
the figure out what you know this have

706
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:38,650
one

707
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:42,890
specific or mine and is you know spend
the next few months trying to get to

708
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:44,089
that point and not

709
00:42:44,089 --> 00:42:47,900
allows you to to ask the right questions
because arm

710
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:52,079
a lot of them don't wear you must follow
a survey lebow you through Twitter

711
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:55,790
p.m. Dirk Dreyer siemreab the answers to
the questions were my gender specific

712
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:56,520
russian

713
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:00,450
very difficulty after generic question
my condo I hun why

714
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:04,210
I don't jump right your specific
question

715
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:08,630
woodward is what does this guy live have
to do with this review universe specific

716
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:09,849
technical questions

717
00:43:09,849 --> 00:43:13,849
to easier for us to help you to to get
to that ago

718
00:43:13,849 --> 00:43:17,109
cousin as a specific Weston new ones are

719
00:43:17,109 --> 00:43:20,200
how exactly did you guys get the boot
from for the 3GS before

720
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,609
some

721
00:43:23,609 --> 00:43:27,780
for with 3G 3ds yeah I forgot

722
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:31,060
an iPhone 4 are you guys get bombed them
for I was a

723
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:34,510
long time ago remember thank you was
still

724
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:38,430
as up point it was still on the ground
was still map in to kernel memory

725
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:42,579
yeah so we had some sort rights plan and
I'm in no

726
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:46,410
what we had anymore you know you could
Israel memory range in

727
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:50,640
be there there is five different
situation earlier

728
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:54,710
for earlier devices where the turn of
the room than it was in

729
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:59,069
that wasn't the case for 3ds in fact we
at the the 3GS

730
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:02,869
thats to freshen soviets there the whole
true did you put wrong

731
00:44:02,869 --> 00:44:06,049
and the all we had the jailbreak with
people

732
00:44:06,049 --> 00:44:09,359
from one using rats no and

733
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:14,549
you managed to use some camp exploits

734
00:44:14,549 --> 00:44:19,299
to to them the boot from it's also I
also remember something about helping

735
00:44:19,299 --> 00:44:22,760
you're hot dumb boo run at some point on

736
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:26,680
something about the first those for the
first 3GS

737
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:29,799
yeah on there is some he had I think

738
00:44:29,799 --> 00:44:33,869
loser I exploiting want to be able to
dump the

739
00:44:33,869 --> 00:44:37,510
wrongfully confine it and there is an am
I'm setting

740
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:42,099
memory interface unit setting that would
my view map to be run back to 0x0

741
00:44:42,099 --> 00:44:45,880
you know I knew about this earlier from
my house from my work to reverse

742
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,849
engineer in the year-earlier iPhone so

743
00:44:47,849 --> 00:44:52,349
that's what we did and I probably got a
copy will be run from him or something

744
00:44:52,349 --> 00:44:57,420
after he dumped knows it doesn't picture
via

745
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:00,950
you know jihad how to hack text get the
tix execution

746
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:04,670
I'm during I view when it was needed and
then the ritz

747
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:07,790
you know you came along with the
technical introduced

748
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:11,240
it was really happy you're providing
YouTube showing him exactly how the

749
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:11,930
herders

750
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:15,010
you when you need to set the NYU happens
when

751
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:18,880
to return src and I'm

752
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:24,569
into someone into being I'm usership are
used

753
00:45:24,569 --> 00:45:27,940
so good on this month another question
on the iPhone 5

754
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:31,510
iconoclastic who is coming to bug still
possible

755
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:34,720
with the new actor like

756
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,500
I find it hard to believe that Apple
doesn't evoke the kernel through the

757
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:38,599
same connector

758
00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:41,599
I am for production prices right now

759
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:44,819
I a lot has happened when they're doing
it you will get something that needed to

760
00:45:44,819 --> 00:45:45,359
be

761
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:49,700
precisely device the device in the firm
that's running on the customer's

762
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:54,920
on the groceries arms on I'm confident
that you can use that

763
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:59,280
dinner connector to do crown I know
Apple must be doing

764
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:04,010
see got about 10 minutes left II guess
gottfried to questions from the floor

765
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:08,579
max

766
00:46:08,579 --> 00:46:11,890
an oxygen general question why

767
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:15,160
like to hear from you why do you do
things

768
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:18,869
once you move

769
00:46:18,869 --> 00:46:23,819
with this is for first yeah like for
example

770
00:46:23,819 --> 00:46:27,630
since last summer to Broadcom

771
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:30,900
we're we are focused on this stuff

772
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:35,260
his debut his its working on the floor
the man at the wheel

773
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:38,380
the I also am seeking ovitz every time

774
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:42,700
you know it's its its challenging it's a

775
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:46,839
it's like a puzzle you know and it's
really relief for

776
00:46:46,839 --> 00:46:50,240
the we visit with business for 10 inch

777
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:55,329
has very engrossing am its it's hard
it's like doing a really complex

778
00:46:55,329 --> 00:46:58,710
Sudoku puzzle or crosswords or something
right now there's like

779
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:04,049
ten times harder and it is its is
entertained to be able to use your brain

780
00:47:04,049 --> 00:47:08,500
in that way forum for a long time and
that's really the only reason that I do

781
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:08,950
it

782
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:13,299
yeah its on them sides really quite
rewarding when you get something working

783
00:47:13,299 --> 00:47:16,430
first would like there's no way good
workout

784
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:20,060
and you know everything eventually falls
into place

785
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:23,170
after been tearing her at about it and
inspire

786
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:26,700
morning home when it finally comes off
to

787
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:30,750
and I do tricks thing I'm a hardware
engineer by midday job into a lot but my

788
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:31,490
love my

789
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:35,410
focus on the stock has been revival or
at the Brisbane

790
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:38,510
are reliable artist whose real
interesting me too

791
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:41,900
I just make you a to view toward
ministers in something

792
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:45,640
shouldn't have access to I'll but no
other stuff doesn't really make it into

793
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:48,900
a public number exactly did work but
it's fun to think around

794
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:52,260
I'm bird secondly it's also interesting
to stir be after

795
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:55,310
to play this game with Apple I think in
a

796
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:58,349
its interesting to see them react to
something you do to relieve morning

797
00:47:58,349 --> 00:48:02,990
you're doing something and making

798
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:08,089
suffer fundamental change in

799
00:48:08,089 --> 00:48:11,920
gothic one last question flew in an hour
asked the question everybody

800
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:17,529
on the internet and everybody in his
room month no so 1/2

801
00:48:17,529 --> 00:48:20,630
if epilogue if you and opportunity to
work for them

802
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:26,690
why should you accept or decline the
offer

803
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:31,020
I I'm I would be really

804
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:34,170
interested in prompt work is up

805
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:37,240
because I thinking that the security
team them like

806
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:40,810
their people that's really talented

807
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:44,520
I think they have a lot of know which

808
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:48,069
to get from them so I think it would be

809
00:48:48,069 --> 00:48:51,440
really good experience to work for have

810
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,700
then what's Anna and it depends on

811
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:59,290
on upstairs like yeah I'm pretty sure
that would like

812
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:01,720
yeah me to come to

813
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:06,110
unite the United States or a how they
would like me to

814
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:09,240
to leave on the

815
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:12,750
to breaking and tho

816
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:15,970
yeah it's the its kinda complicated yeah

817
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:19,570
fundamentally is it's a different job
too

818
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:23,570
it's a different job to prevent the tax
thing to do the attack and I i think is

819
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:24,300
this time

820
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:27,750
depending on what kind of offer you got
you want to be pigeonholed into someone

821
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:28,120
who's

822
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:31,990
whose I'm you do something fun really is
different

823
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:35,070
order yeah beyond the fifth

824
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:38,290
never fun them yeah offenses fun

825
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:43,130
om and also for me I would myself they
basically can offer me something better

826
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:50,010
I'm ok is a girl like about 50 minutes
ago the thick one house cuz I'm
