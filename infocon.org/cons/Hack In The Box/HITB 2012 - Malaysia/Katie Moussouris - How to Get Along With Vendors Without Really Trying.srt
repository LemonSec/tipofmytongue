1
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:10,340
up

2
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,099
space

3
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:14,080
school

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:21,080
sleuth

5
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:30,210
I I'm seamus Rs I am the sick a senior
security strategist leave with Microsoft

6
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,490
Security Response Center

7
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:35,660
and the Microsoft Security Response
Center is responsible for second Tuesday

8
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,269
of the month which we all know and love

9
00:00:37,269 --> 00:00:41,470
I mean I run a team that is responsible
for security community outreach and

10
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:42,970
strategy at Microsoft

11
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,750
so what that means is I think I've new
programs and new ways to interact with

12
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,100
the security community and

13
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:52,930
including hackers security researchers
et cetera so we're gonna talk about

14
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:53,729
today

15
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:56,900
is a have a guided tour for you and

16
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,070
that the title actually when I was
thinking about the title

17
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:04,600
somebody actually didn't really try to
get along with vendors and

18
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,890
on your behalf and and I'm one of those
people

19
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,760
who tried really hard so I'm gonna
actually give you the readouts

20
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,799
a what it is that I found in what i've
discovered as what works best in terms

21
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:17,000
of dealing with vendors

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,160
and give you an idea of what vendors
actually want

23
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:25,320
and how to work out what's in it for you
in sort of a mutually agreeable way

24
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,290
I I know a lot of you are interested in
making some legitimate catch

25
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:32,390
there are plenty of ways to make
illegitimate cash in this industry will

26
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:33,910
not be covering those topics

27
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:38,120
I'm sure there are people in the
audience and a outside this room who can

28
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,340
educate you on on those other methods
I'm

29
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,300
and then to tell you about some I so
standards that I've been working on

30
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,370
in the past five years or so that at
Microsoft

31
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:51,600
and this is actually a really
interesting area

32
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,320
as it applies to you because even though
these ice is standards only apply to

33
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:55,990
vendors

34
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:59,580
a lot of discussion over the years has
been about I

35
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,909
you know in the disclosure in the
disclosure to and fro

36
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:07,220
between researchers in vendors who is
really holding vendors responsible for

37
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,479
their end of the deal

38
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,110
I'm so I'm can actually talk about my
sis standards they're gonna be published

39
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:16,409
next year and how that may affect you in
your dealings with vendors who

40
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:20,390
seek to be compliant with the standards
I am hopefully I'll be able to make it a

41
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,520
little interesting and fun for you
because

42
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,060
a like I said I so standards are

43
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:30,620
a pretty dry topic and I've found myself
surprisingly involved with them over the

44
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,660
past five years

45
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:35,260
and I can hopefully provide that
translation there for you as

46
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:40,490
as to how it applies to you okay so will
mine a little more detail later in

47
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:41,500
Microsoft a

48
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,730
in April 2007 there in the community
outreach team as Roberto was mentioning

49
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,260
wanna things my team does

50
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,630
is a conference at Microsoft called blue
hat when you heard it

51
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,810
with that okay three if you have heard

52
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:58,560
hats ok with that is essentially away
for Microsoft security engineers and

53
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,290
executives

54
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:03,130
to have the hackers and researchers come
to you Microsoft campus

55
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:06,950
and educate entertain be wilder
frightened I

56
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:11,120
you know and hopefully give some insight
into current and emerging threats so

57
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,540
that

58
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,640
we can actually make our products better
so that's what the blue hat conference

59
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,560
is all about

60
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,440
leave the first one was in 2005 and it
was started by 10 Snyder when she was

61
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,970
still at Microsoft as a way to bring
those hackers

62
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,340
into you into the collective and have
that positive influence

63
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,540
I am on the security of our products the
other thing that made team is

64
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,650
responsible for something called
Microsoft vulnerability research

65
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:37,780
or MSP are and it's a program that I
founded in 2000 8

66
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:42,530
and that is a way for internal security
researchers at Microsoft to find all

67
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,310
abilities in third party products

68
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,379
is a way for them to get those
vulnerabilities specs

69
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:50,569
when they send them out to other vendors
so

70
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:54,349
as a result of that program we've had
hundreds a vulnerability is I'm resolved

71
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:55,030
infects

72
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:58,709
over the past several years and I'll
talk a little bit more about

73
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:03,110
about that how it applies here a little
bit later in the presentation

74
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:08,970
so the policymaker part of my history as
I was mentioning is

75
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:12,730
kind of an interesting it's an
interesting development because if you

76
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:13,459
told me

77
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:17,530
a decade ago one that I'd be working at
Microsoft at this point and to you that

78
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:18,090
I'd be

79
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:21,959
editor in international standard I would
have pipes your suggestion to /dev/null

80
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,389
and forgot about it

81
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:28,060
I'm but it has proven to be an
interesting lever

82
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,809
by which you know I've been personally
able to

83
00:04:31,809 --> 00:04:36,789
to help you know hopefully elevate some
%uh the security responsiveness

84
00:04:36,789 --> 00:04:40,900
I love all vendors not just the vendor
that I that I work for right now so

85
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,339
it's been an interesting time I'm before
security i

86
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:48,300
dabbled in molecular biology in a past
life so ask me about that during the

87
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,529
break

88
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:54,719
okay so why would you even try to get
along with Anders I soon everybody in

89
00:04:54,719 --> 00:04:56,610
this audience is at least curious

90
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:01,379
so you know perhaps this is not this is
not a motivating factor for you but

91
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:04,520
you know there are actually a lot of
legitimate opportunities if you do make

92
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,139
a little bit about

93
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:08,639
effort in terms of getting along with
vendors and everybody's got their

94
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,770
different motivations some people are
really interested in money we're gonna

95
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,509
cover that little more detail in this
presentation

96
00:05:14,509 --> 00:05:18,409
some people are interested in you know
upping your reputation getting

97
00:05:18,409 --> 00:05:21,869
famous and some people are interested
and influence

98
00:05:21,869 --> 00:05:26,599
or power I am and as an individual
researcher going

99
00:05:26,599 --> 00:05:30,490
you know bringing your your ideas your
vulnerability reports to

100
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,759
a major vendor that can seem pretty
daunting a

101
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,680
and I'm just gonna talk about some other
ways in which you can build your

102
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,619
influence

103
00:05:37,619 --> 00:05:41,189
if you're playing nicely with vendors if
that's something that is interesting to

104
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:42,099
you

105
00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:45,210
and also you know what life's too short
we really

106
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:48,990
I think that a lot of people can get
along a a lot better if they actually

107
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,520
just gonna try to

108
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,129
operate with a little bit have common
sense and courtesy on both sides

109
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:55,779
obviously

110
00:05:55,779 --> 00:06:00,969
okay so let's turn to talk about a brief
history of disclosure

111
00:06:00,969 --> 00:06:05,639
I coming if you remember rainforest
puppies RF policy

112
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:09,919
okay so there are few who have been in
the industry for a long time

113
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,479
so that that was a researcher basically
saying this is how I plan to disclose

114
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,050
vulnerabilities when I report them to
your vendor

115
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:21,969
so you know essentially the I'll let you
know I'll give you details I'll help you

116
00:06:21,969 --> 00:06:22,580
with your

117
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:27,960
repro in the issue I you know but in
exchange I expect you to vendor to

118
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,309
to act in a reasonable manner and try to
you fix the vulnerability as soon as

119
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,809
reasonably possible so that was

120
00:06:33,809 --> 00:06:38,689
you know kind of the just that I'm the
term responsible in terms of how it

121
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,550
applied to disclosure

122
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:45,110
I'm it's a morally loaded term you know
that term responsible is moral judgments

123
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:48,889
involved in that term and what I've
heard from people who were

124
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:52,099
around at the at the time talking about
it there's some

125
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:55,589
their sin disputes about where that term
originated but

126
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:59,259
suffice it to say I think it did
probably come from the vendor or the

127
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:02,509
you know vendor or government community
originally

128
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:06,610
I'm and they put that term you know in
terms of their ability disclosure

129
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:11,259
as an attempt to say a what they really
wanted was private disclosure

130
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:14,270
until the vendor never had a chance to
fix it

131
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:17,270
that's what they really meant and said
they kind of put this

132
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,699
moral judgment term in front of it so

133
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:25,270
meanwhile there was a group vendors

134
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:28,770
on that form the organization for
Internet safety year Elias

135
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:32,259
and around 2004 or so

136
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:36,139
they came out with I a bunch of these
vendors had an agreement

137
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:40,699
on how they would perform disclosure and
what they expected in terms if

138
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:44,589
a you know cooperation with the research
community and how they would act

139
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:48,409
I in accordance with that and then in
the US there is something called the

140
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:49,189
Nyack

141
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:52,279
which is a national infrastructure
advisory council

142
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:56,469
I and that when into talking about all
the different roles and disclosure from

143
00:07:56,469 --> 00:07:58,580
the Finder the vulnerability to

144
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:03,110
possibly an intermediary coordinator to
you the vendor responsible for fixing it

145
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:07,279
and all the different ways that those
roles at those roles would interact

146
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:11,029
and the expectations a how to deal with
those roles

147
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:15,789
so this came out you know serve in the
early 2000's and then I had was designed

148
00:08:15,789 --> 00:08:19,439
to inform the president of the united
states on how to protect

149
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,219
national critical infrastructure I'm in
terms

150
00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:26,309
have a vulnerability reporting from from
the research

151
00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:30,999
any so fast forward and a couple years
later

152
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:34,219
and in I still and you just give you a
quick brief I'm

153
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:38,060
the the stage is a nice so standard
begin with something called the study

154
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,260
period so

155
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:43,120
the east and that's to determine whether
or not a particular topic

156
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,100
deserves to be nice if standard now I
obviously wasn't with microsoftr

157
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,890
involved with I so at the time

158
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:52,530
that this became that this was in its
study period but I so

159
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:56,310
study period on a standard for
responsible disclosure and that was what

160
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,830
it was called back then

161
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:01,860
started November 2006 now have been
involved

162
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,310
I at that time I probably would have
just said why would you try to

163
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,390
standardize

164
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:09,250
something that no one's been able to
really standard as everybody has their

165
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:09,760
own

166
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,590
you know vendors have their own
disclosure policies researchers have

167
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,160
their own disclosure policies

168
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,550
coordination centers have their own and
there's some overlap but you know

169
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:21,340
why would you try to standardize this
furthermore I would have pointed out

170
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:25,290
the air in the ways %uh a standards
organization trying to dictate

171
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:28,850
how hackers react act at all I

172
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:33,380
so needless to say I wasn't there at the
time stop this from happening so

173
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:38,070
when I became involved with it in we've
late 2007

174
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,890
so for those questions you know we're
certainly raised by me and some other

175
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,410
subject matter experts

176
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:46,040
and in the Acer community as to why this
was even

177
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:50,000
being considered for standard so I'm
I'll talk a little bit more about the

178
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,680
evolution in that particular standard a
little later in the presentation

179
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,330
but I'm further along the time line love
disclosure

180
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:01,630
I'm and certainly it in terms of my
experience with disclosure

181
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:05,570
so take turns from the open security
foundation I'm suggested the term

182
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:09,050
coordinated to me as a replacement for
the term responsible

183
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:13,060
this was at outsider a a presentation I
gave it our essay

184
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:18,010
in 2010 I I thought that sounded
incredibly reasonable so what I did was

185
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:21,200
I brought this to the editor of the I so
standard

186
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,970
a on responsible disclosure I write this
idea to him and i actually invited

187
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:30,190
some security community members to have
a talk with him

188
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:34,410
about I'm the fact that this this term
really did need to be replaced

189
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:37,840
now in I still and it's kinda its it's a
strange thing

190
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,880
I'm when you actually get us a standard
approved

191
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,920
as a new work item is what what it's
called I

192
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,990
the tail a bit and the scope a bit are
what

193
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:51,700
national bodies have approved so in
order to change the title

194
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:55,030
and you know potentially change the
scope

195
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:58,560
I this would have perhaps required a a
lot of work

196
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,930
you know on the part of the people and I
said just because if the sort of the

197
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:05,360
bureaucracy and how that works I'm so

198
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,550
they wouldn't replace the term I
responsible with the term coordinated

199
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:14,700
I they ended up just dropping the term
responsible so that actually happened

200
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,120
at the I say meeting and April 2010

201
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,410
so now the standard as it stands is
called vulnerability disclosure

202
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:26,390
no coordinated irresponsible no moral
judgments and all that stuff

203
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:29,630
I'll so fast forward a couple more
months Microsoft

204
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:33,820
I decided to adopt the term coordinated
vulnerability disclosure rcvd

205
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:37,780
for what we essentially term at as you
know responsible disclosure there were a

206
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,650
few

207
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:42,580
differences though when we when we went
ahead and talked about CVD

208
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:46,280
I'm as it applies to Microsoft one was

209
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,320
you know we wanted to make sure that the
researchers understood

210
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,960
that any level of coordination was
welcome you know I think a lot of

211
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,830
researchers thought

212
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:57,080
if you weren't willing to you wat all
the way until

213
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,270
you know the the patch was out before
you disclose your details

214
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:03,860
that you know I think a lot of
researchers erroneously thought

215
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,540
that it was all all-or-nothing you know
either

216
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,630
coordinate all the way or don't
coordinate it all in just rubbed your

217
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,180
day

218
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,520
so one of the things that we're really
emphasizing with coordinated on

219
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,270
disclosure we made that change

220
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:20,180
was the fact that we actually really
wanna any level of coordination

221
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,980
and I am once me that announcement a few
researchers you know kinda raise their

222
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,180
hands and said 0

223
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,180
while I was working on this thing and I
wasn't you know I was really gonna tell

224
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,700
you about it'll probably be ready in a
couple weeks

225
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:34,590
hear some details about what you know
what we're working on right now

226
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:38,170
that couple weeks actually does make a
huge difference to a vendor so in terms

227
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:38,900
if

228
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,150
you know when you're thinking about
whether or not you want to coordinate

229
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,330
with the vendor

230
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,700
essentially all of them want as much
information as much lead time as

231
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,530
possible

232
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:51,070
so is as much as you can give them
though appreciate it

233
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,610
am glitzy so

234
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:58,350
we we announced that we were gonna
change what we call disclosure and some

235
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:02,420
some nuances about how we were going to
an deal with the security research

236
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,060
community around that

237
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:08,230
and then and then in April 2011 we
actually released a process

238
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:11,450
on that we follow in terms of
coordinated on this closure

239
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:14,710
and I was the first time that Microsoft
had ever hosted its own

240
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:19,290
disclosure policy or process on its own
site previously

241
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:23,120
I the only things that we had on our
site was the Finder acknowledgement

242
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,520
policy so basically

243
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:28,700
what conditions you know a finer would
have to meet in order to receive credit

244
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,620
in whatever bulletins or advisories I'm
for vendors it's a very

245
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,780
it's a very individual choice some
vendors you know will give

246
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:39,650
will give credits no matter what method
disclosures used

247
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:43,700
I'm some vendors will give credit in
certain instances and thanks and

248
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,430
other instances and you know vendors
like Microsoft prefer to give

249
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:52,210
thanks when add issues coordinated all
the way until a patch is released

250
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:56,370
and then the researcher and Microsoft go
out with the same type that message

251
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:00,130
so vendors very on you know on their
their credit they're

252
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:04,300
I'm the reason we we actually how's our
own process and we had to announce

253
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,710
earned process was because we were
preparing

254
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:10,710
to start releasing security advisories
on third-party products

255
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:14,200
for the first time in Microsoft history
so that was the accompanying

256
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,540
factor that drove are a our releases the

257
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:22,260
a our formal process what was also
unique about this is that

258
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:26,240
I'm not a lot offenders actually
function formally function

259
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,800
in the capacity finder coordinator and
vendor

260
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,300
most lenders dysfunction in the capacity
a vendor you know you you find a bone in

261
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,980
our product you report it to us and we
kinda acting that role as under

262
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,020
well because we had this a

263
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:43,500
Microsoft on our ability research
program going on since 2000 me

264
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,529
we actually were finders ourselves and
we were coordinators ourselves

265
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:52,779
one of the functions MICR is in fact to
coordinate in multi-vendor issues

266
00:14:52,779 --> 00:14:56,390
I or blended threat types in areas where
you taking

267
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:59,890
lower severity vulnerabilities with one
or more vendors

268
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:04,650
in order to you you know mix it up in a
blender and create some kinda a critical

269
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:05,980
security issue

270
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:11,130
so anyway really had to we really to
clarify this not just for our users our

271
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:13,630
customers but we really wanted clarify
it

272
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:19,260
I for other vendors in in terms of how
they can expect to deal with us

273
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,600
so a what's in the future

274
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,950
in terms of disclosure well you know

275
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:31,840
if you if you consider the you know
around 1999 as sort of the Big Bang I've

276
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,850
disclosure policies and this disclosure
policy: universes been expanding

277
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:40,730
you know since then on perhaps there is
gonna be a collapse in that universe

278
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:43,990
to you you know why not we're a couple

279
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:47,210
disclosure standards at least in terms
of vendors

280
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:50,839
now as I was saying earlier wanted the
flaws

281
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:55,080
in the original I so proposal for
vulnerability disclosure was

282
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:59,470
that it actually was a making making
assumptions and assertions

283
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:02,670
as to how these other roles in
disclosure should behave

284
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:06,190
I which was a very backwards idea you
know considering

285
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:10,600
I don't know if you guys know any
hackers who are I so compliant or feel

286
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,740
like they want to be but

287
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,779
I had never met any before I'm

288
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:17,830
so so what this a it so what if the

289
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:21,250
one of the things that we worked on I'm
when I became involved with scoping

290
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:24,650
that ices standard down to affect
vendors only

291
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,300
and essentially mentioned the other
roles in terms of

292
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,740
you know how offender needs to deal with
these other roles and disclosure

293
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,910
a mentions the finders mentions the
coordinators but it's really focused at

294
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,580
what vendors need to you

295
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,770
in order to properly responsible in our
abilities so when is this thing gonna

296
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:41,490
come out

297
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:45,300
and what is it gonna look like will
we'll get into that and after we talk

298
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,839
about some %uh via cash

299
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:50,070
options that I did mention earlier an

300
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:54,020
right now it scheduled to be published
sometime around the fall

301
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:57,990
up 2013 now that all depends on how the
voting goes

302
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:01,610
I'm actually the week after next I'm
gonna be in Rome at the SS standards

303
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:02,390
meeting

304
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:06,549
and so will will have a session then
we'll see how some voting goes

305
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:09,799
in between that session in the session
in the spring

306
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:13,360
and then if all goes sorted according to

307
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,919
progressive plan then you could actually
expect to see this

308
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:21,240
out and live in the fall 2013 it may
take a little bit longer

309
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,529
now I if you look back at the time line

310
00:17:24,529 --> 00:17:27,869
this thing started in 2006 and the fact
that

311
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:32,210
it's going to finally emerge in 2013 she
can be an indication

312
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:36,039
uva how much how much contention there
was

313
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:39,749
you know in coming up with something
that was reasonable and legitimate

314
00:17:39,749 --> 00:17:43,759
and hand was as technically accurate as
an ISO standard could be

315
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:48,649
I am and anyway I will see if it comes
out in 2013

316
00:17:48,649 --> 00:17:54,019
it will come out probably shortly
thereafter if not 2013

317
00:17:54,019 --> 00:17:57,960
okay so now in it so that was von
disclosure in general

318
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,990
I in terms of history see our during
this time

319
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:05,600
so a lot of these disclosure policies
historically

320
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,999
really were talking about what we call
box product

321
00:18:08,999 --> 00:18:12,649
security I vulnerability discovery in
and coordination

322
00:18:12,649 --> 00:18:15,970
so really that means you know things
like you've got an application

323
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,980
USA security researcher have an
application that you have installed

324
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:19,950
locally

325
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:23,309
you doing all your security testing on
your copy only

326
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:26,490
you're not messing with live production
servers are not messing with online

327
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:27,499
services

328
00:18:27,499 --> 00:18:32,419
and you know essentially this is what
most of these things were designed

329
00:18:32,419 --> 00:18:35,999
to you to deal with in terms of
coordination

330
00:18:35,999 --> 00:18:39,899
something else that happens in our world
is that we have tons of online services

331
00:18:39,899 --> 00:18:42,690
and online services as we all know you
might have

332
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:46,240
Web Services Web bombs those those are

333
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,090
legitimate issues they need to be
corrected I am and

334
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:53,419
in fact there are a number of laws that
govern

335
00:18:53,419 --> 00:18:56,769
in various countries how researchers

336
00:18:56,769 --> 00:19:00,190
you know how they should interact in
terms of what

337
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:03,240
is legal and what is not I am

338
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,419
what's significant about vendors
involvement here

339
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:10,990
is that vendors themselves a you know
this has it really been

340
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:15,779
this hasn't really been to tested in
terms if a third party may be wanting

341
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:19,289
wanting to pursue legal action against a
researcher

342
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:22,320
I'm for online services staff but most
vendors

343
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,740
major vendors have some sort of policy
at least now

344
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,749
to provide some level it amnesty or or

345
00:19:28,749 --> 00:19:32,340
I you know goodwill towards researchers
who

346
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,929
report all their abilities to them
privately for online services

347
00:19:35,929 --> 00:19:39,429
even though technically in that country
it may be against the law to have been

348
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:42,100
doing that research in the first place

349
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:48,139
so long story short back in July of 2007
Microsoft was the first major vendor to

350
00:19:48,139 --> 00:19:49,379
ever put it in writing

351
00:19:49,379 --> 00:19:54,049
on their website to say that actually if
you're kind enough to find a

352
00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:55,139
vulnerability in

353
00:19:55,139 --> 00:19:58,419
a summer online services and reported to
us privately

354
00:19:58,419 --> 00:20:02,720
and give us a chance to fix it that of
course we're not gonna pursue legal

355
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,149
action against you

356
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:07,940
I people followed shortly thereafter and
I point out the difference here because

357
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,009
it is significant

358
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:12,600
and it underlines the fact that you do
need to check with an individual vendor

359
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,240
before you can start

360
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,989
start testing people had followed very
shortly but the big difference in their

361
00:20:18,989 --> 00:20:22,429
their sorted legal amnesty declaration

362
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:25,989
was excluded any Boehner abilities that
were brokered

363
00:20:25,989 --> 00:20:29,619
yes third-party third-party you know on
brokers

364
00:20:29,619 --> 00:20:33,799
so like a CD I submitted you know
vulnerability to then

365
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:37,659
actually wouldn't be exempt from
potential legal action

366
00:20:37,659 --> 00:20:41,070
you have SP palace to why you know they
had that distinction

367
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:45,570
and from from Microsoft's perspective it
didn't as long as the issue was private

368
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:48,809
until we could fix it we really didn't
care if it came from a pawn broker or

369
00:20:48,809 --> 00:20:49,239
through

370
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:53,249
you for a coordinator you know a Cornish
in center

371
00:20:53,249 --> 00:20:57,749
I or from the Finder themselves really
the the important part was

372
00:20:57,749 --> 00:21:01,899
give it to us privately give us a chance
to fix it and so we saw no need to limit

373
00:21:01,899 --> 00:21:05,340
I you know the sources that information

374
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:08,559
so were recently you know we've seen in
the news a

375
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,269
you have similar policies coming out
from Google Facebook et cetera

376
00:21:12,269 --> 00:21:17,480
I'm pledging some sort of fantasy with a
few caveats rate you'd see different

377
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,649
rules and they're saying please don't
das es

378
00:21:19,649 --> 00:21:22,820
you know things like that I'm when
you're doing your security testing

379
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:26,549
and please don't please do your best to
avoid

380
00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:30,059
violating the privacy of our users I am

381
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:33,059
et cetera because the reason for those

382
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:37,509
for those clauses were won the toss the
DAS issues should be pretty obvious but

383
00:21:37,509 --> 00:21:40,929
I but the reason for the second you know

384
00:21:40,929 --> 00:21:45,159
qualifiers that some these vendors have
on their web sites is really because

385
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:49,909
a the vendors themselves are subject to
notification laws when privacy issues

386
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:50,769
are

387
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:53,970
or when there is a breach of privacy and
one other services

388
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:57,980
so ideally you know what a vendor once
in the situation

389
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:02,049
giving you this mind meld with the
vendor really means by the staff

390
00:22:02,049 --> 00:22:05,309
with evander once is they want they
definitely want to know about the

391
00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:06,470
vulnerability

392
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:10,889
they would rather not have to perform a
privacy breach notification to their

393
00:22:10,889 --> 00:22:11,749
customers

394
00:22:11,749 --> 00:22:14,980
as a result if you reporting the
vulnerability so

395
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:18,690
you know I have to give a little
disclaimer here you know as in this

396
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:19,080
isn't

397
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,600
legal advice by any means but a good
idea

398
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,399
for you to do is I you know if you are
going to be

399
00:22:26,399 --> 00:22:29,759
testing some online services %uh vendor
is number one

400
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:33,759
check with your local laws and then
those local laws

401
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:38,039
that intersection between those local
laws and what the vendor stated policy

402
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:38,529
actually

403
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:43,330
is is your sweet spot I am another good
idea is that

404
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:46,590
you know if you're creating test
accounts

405
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:51,080
perhaps to your testing against to test
accounts that you own is opposed to you

406
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,739
you know sort of randomly seeking out I
information from other legitimate users

407
00:22:55,739 --> 00:22:57,200
in the service

408
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,159
so these are just some in this may seem
like common sense but you'd be surprised

409
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:02,850
at how many researchers

410
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:05,889
gonna come to us and they found this
great fall and

411
00:23:05,889 --> 00:23:09,389
there's there's literally you know a
privacy breach embedded

412
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:12,840
in that and that creates additional work
additional hardship

413
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,539
for the vendor I that maybe perhaps
could have been avoided if the

414
00:23:16,539 --> 00:23:18,600
researcher just take the extra time to
make

415
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,059
one other test account so little things
like this

416
00:23:22,059 --> 00:23:25,090
actually make a big difference and

417
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:28,580
okay so any questions so far

418
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:34,809
on the history disclosure and some other
online services nuances

419
00:23:34,809 --> 00:23:38,139
okay alright so what's in it for you

420
00:23:38,139 --> 00:23:42,940
okay Prix 2012 World I can categorize
researcher motivations as

421
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:46,730
around compensation recognition and what
I call the pursuit intellectual

422
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:47,669
happiness

423
00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:51,480
essentially solving the problems that
are hard to solve I'm

424
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,960
before 2012 you know the ways that you
could make

425
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,350
some kind of cashing it would be
traditional pen testing you could sell

426
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,730
it to a pawn broker or somebody else

427
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:05,369
I am you click advantage from the
vendors who offer them recognition wise

428
00:24:05,369 --> 00:24:08,739
well biggest way to be recognized in the
security a

429
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:13,169
industry is is droppings your day before
2012 right

430
00:24:13,169 --> 00:24:17,919
i winning the pond on contest which was
a which was actively for 2012

431
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,190
and also getting some credit in a
bulletin or an advisory from the vendor

432
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:26,909
and finally pursued an intellectual
happiness this hard problem solving

433
00:24:26,909 --> 00:24:31,049
some other ways in which you know the
fulfilment at this motivation

434
00:24:31,049 --> 00:24:34,249
a some the ways in which I'd seen this
motivation fulfilled

435
00:24:34,249 --> 00:24:37,509
were in technique sharing with peers
occasionally

436
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:40,739
you'd see some cross-pollination of
ideas with product engineers at the

437
00:24:40,739 --> 00:24:44,960
vendor company I have and access to
elites so either elite's

438
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,960
in the security community or elites a

439
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,480
within you know the the target vendor
company to some people

440
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,749
really really value that influence level
right and one of the things that

441
00:24:55,749 --> 00:24:58,859
that the blue hat conference that we
have back in Redmond

442
00:24:58,859 --> 00:25:03,129
really give some those researchers is
and ability to interact directly

443
00:25:03,129 --> 00:25:06,090
with the people who are building the
products and making security decisions

444
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:07,669
on the products

445
00:25:07,669 --> 00:25:11,789
that that those researchers are breaking
so I'm

446
00:25:11,789 --> 00:25:15,470
might see so let's talk about own
economy

447
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:20,029
in very high level terms if you think
about it in terms of white marquise gray

448
00:25:20,029 --> 00:25:21,679
market in black market

449
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,239
I'm essentially what we're looking at is

450
00:25:25,239 --> 00:25:29,200
the primary motivations for the
vulnerabilities intended use

451
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,249
tends to be the differentiator here so
you know in the weight market

452
00:25:33,249 --> 00:25:37,259
you kid you know there's better but
danny's their brokers like CIII defense

453
00:25:37,259 --> 00:25:38,090
et cetera

454
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:41,850
who will share vulnerabilities with
vendors I at no cost

455
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:45,220
at work the brokers who share
vulnerabilities offenders at no cost

456
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:48,840
I'm and the price ranges you know are
from fairly low o2

457
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,850
I'm you know in the pony contest up to
sixty thousand dollars

458
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:55,980
in the pre-market though the primary
purpose for

459
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:00,470
a for acquiring vulnerabilities in the
gray market could be used for defense

460
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:04,129
I am I've seen some the bright von
brokers who

461
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:07,359
by vulnerabilities from the community
but don't choose to share

462
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:10,899
with the vendors for free and they do
claim some defensive

463
00:26:10,899 --> 00:26:14,330
you know applications of their work as
well as

464
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:18,210
as the offense and applications have
their work and the prices you know are

465
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,779
certainly going to be greater than
twenty thousand dollars

466
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:23,840
on average for those types have on our
abilities

467
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,629
finally at the black market is a you
know primarily buyers ur

468
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:31,470
governments organized crime et cetera
the information the owner Billy

469
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,820
information is

470
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:36,129
pretty much solely use for offenses
purposes I am

471
00:26:36,129 --> 00:26:39,759
that is the primary use and you know
we've seen prices reported I'm sure

472
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:40,909
there are people

473
00:26:40,909 --> 00:26:44,039
at this conference who could give you
the current market prices for just about

474
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:45,039
anything

475
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:49,509
on but the primary thing here to keep in
mind is the fact that

476
00:26:49,509 --> 00:26:52,769
the weight market does not try to
compete with the grey or black markets

477
00:26:52,769 --> 00:26:56,600
I am at least not now and and if you
think about it that

478
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:00,190
that sort of makes sense considering at
the grey black markets probably have

479
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,600
access to you

480
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,119
quite a bit more closer to unlimited
funding

481
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:09,159
I'm then the way market players would
have

482
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:12,210
okay so how does this affect a

483
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:15,210
Microsoft in particular the reason why
I'm

484
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:18,629
we take a look at this this issue and we
looked at well

485
00:27:18,629 --> 00:27:22,440
are finders who report issues to us are
they reporting

486
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,600
primarily directly to us are the
reporting

487
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,090
I through vulnerability brokers and if
you actually look

488
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:34,590
am so the red their is at the the issues
that are dropped is full disclosure

489
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:38,989
an the light green which is the next one
down are the vulnerability brokered

490
00:27:38,989 --> 00:27:40,659
cases so these are the ones

491
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:44,609
that we received from you know Ceesay
Iran I defense

492
00:27:44,609 --> 00:27:48,100
and then the large darker green

493
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,309
is actually the issues that are reported
directly to Microsoft

494
00:27:51,309 --> 00:27:54,419
from the research community so this

495
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:57,659
email it's surprising to you you know if
if you're thinking that

496
00:27:57,659 --> 00:28:01,479
researchers are primarily motivated by
money at maybe some research

497
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:05,350
researchers are but the ones who tend to
report owner abilities

498
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:08,549
in Microsoft products I you know

499
00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:11,999
the ones who report 10+2 to actually
come to us directly

500
00:28:11,999 --> 00:28:15,869
at a great rate so over ninety percent

501
00:28:15,869 --> 00:28:19,649
actually the security researchers who
choose to report on our abilities

502
00:28:19,649 --> 00:28:23,450
privately at all I'm choose to report
directly to us

503
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:27,070
even though there's their monetary a
things available

504
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:31,269
so at Microsoft we definitely respect to
rate researchers journaling

505
00:28:31,269 --> 00:28:35,269
we want to help that cause you know in
various ways I'm gonna talk about one

506
00:28:35,269 --> 00:28:36,159
other ways that

507
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:40,489
we decided to give the researchers and
cash compensation

508
00:28:40,489 --> 00:28:43,919
and if they do so long as you know we're
just hoping that they go for the white

509
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:47,779
market so that we can get a chance to
fix things

510
00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:51,940
okay so this is what Microsoft decided
to do I have you heard about the blue

511
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,600
half price

512
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,169
okay so the blue hat prize was the first
ever

513
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:01,970
a challenge to use the security
community

514
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:05,629
for defense solution with a very large
fries

515
00:29:05,629 --> 00:29:09,239
when I was thinking about this issue
internally and Microsoft I was thinking

516
00:29:09,239 --> 00:29:12,879
you know what can we do in terms of
presenting a hard problem for their

517
00:29:12,879 --> 00:29:14,330
security research community

518
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:18,049
stimulate that you know I proceeded
intellectual happiness

519
00:29:18,049 --> 00:29:22,129
and how can we make the reward you know
fairly significant

520
00:29:22,129 --> 00:29:25,149
so we're in this contest we look for

521
00:29:25,149 --> 00:29:29,869
you know new runtime medications that I
would be capable of preventing some the

522
00:29:29,869 --> 00:29:30,899
open problems

523
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:35,080
in exploitation right now that currently
defeat mitigation so

524
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:39,379
things like a solution or proposed
solution to mitigate return oriented

525
00:29:39,379 --> 00:29:40,149
programming

526
00:29:40,149 --> 00:29:43,279
and as it happened all three of the top
winning entries

527
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:46,519
were mitigations against returner
oriented programming

528
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:51,479
so a this is how much money we paid out

529
00:29:51,479 --> 00:29:54,479
so as far as a

530
00:29:54,479 --> 00:29:58,359
providing a cash incentive for
researchers to look at the defense I did

531
00:29:58,359 --> 00:29:59,850
the security equation

532
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:03,239
I and having some kind of incentive

533
00:30:03,239 --> 00:30:06,309
that worked with what Microsoft is
really invested in

534
00:30:06,309 --> 00:30:10,249
which is making are platform as a whole
much more secure

535
00:30:10,249 --> 00:30:14,220
and trying to eliminate entire class is
a boner abilities eliminate or mitigate

536
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:17,509
entire class is a boner dodi's this made
sense to us

537
00:30:17,509 --> 00:30:20,779
in terms a a you know how we might
structure

538
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:24,570
word program so the other major thing
here

539
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:28,090
and I went on for size is that it was
important to us that the intellectual

540
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:29,179
property

541
00:30:29,179 --> 00:30:33,179
up the solutions all of them all the
entries retained

542
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:36,649
her the intellectual property was
retained by the original inventor

543
00:30:36,649 --> 00:30:40,279
so by entering the contest they granted
a license to use it

544
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:43,519
is to use their technology but in fact
if they wanted to

545
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:47,309
you know use that technology on other
platforms et cetera et cetera

546
00:30:47,309 --> 00:30:51,389
you know no problem the IP remains the
property that

547
00:30:51,389 --> 00:30:55,070
that individual

548
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:59,690
so why is it that vendors are really
interested

549
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:04,889
in a investing in security at all I mean
all vendors who care about security

550
00:31:04,889 --> 00:31:07,940
are basically interested in I

551
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:11,809
increasing the cost to the attacker

552
00:31:11,809 --> 00:31:15,629
and decreasing the cost to us as
defenders so

553
00:31:15,629 --> 00:31:19,769
how to how do we can have go about doing
that so we as vendors

554
00:31:19,769 --> 00:31:22,970
increase our investment in finding
vulnerabilities ourselves

555
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:26,679
obviously all the investments in the
security development life cycle that

556
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:28,299
Microsoft made over the years

557
00:31:28,299 --> 00:31:31,359
other companies have made significant
investments in this area

558
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:34,849
I where you focus on automation to train
scale

559
00:31:34,849 --> 00:31:38,849
and at you know and remove entire class
is a boner abilities

560
00:31:38,849 --> 00:31:44,099
yeah on a mission if you can other ways
that vendors are investing is

561
00:31:44,099 --> 00:31:47,570
they're trying to increase the attackers
investment in order at

562
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:52,009
for the attacker to rate the exploit so
if you build enough medications and

563
00:31:52,009 --> 00:31:53,809
actually makes it a lot harder

564
00:31:53,809 --> 00:31:57,179
we've seen this and you know timing and
with the later versions

565
00:31:57,179 --> 00:32:01,149
love most operating systems including
ours and making

566
00:32:01,149 --> 00:32:05,119
making the exploits really hard to write
reliably so it's very very

567
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:09,909
it just becomes much more expensive i'm
for the attacker

568
00:32:09,909 --> 00:32:14,129
and then finally and increasing our
response capabilities

569
00:32:14,129 --> 00:32:17,429
to shrink that window should
accountability be discovered

570
00:32:17,429 --> 00:32:21,190
shrink that window exposure I'm and
decrease

571
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:25,349
the opportunity for the attacker to
recover their investment

572
00:32:25,349 --> 00:32:30,080
you know in finding the ball and
weaponize and

573
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,679
okay so you're doing here

574
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,970
II wanna make sure to leave some time
for questions at the end

575
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:41,269
I'm so now in me post-2012 world

576
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:45,229
what do we have in terms meeting some
buddies motivations and fulfillment

577
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:48,340
well we've got the blue hat prize in all
categories

578
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:52,869
I'm and corneum contest as well you know
has come into being in the last year

579
00:32:52,869 --> 00:32:56,279
but you know essentially the

580
00:32:56,279 --> 00:33:00,200
one of the things that you know you want
to consider as a security researcher is

581
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,799
what are these motivations are the most
important to you and what are the things

582
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:04,509
that your

583
00:33:04,509 --> 00:33:07,869
you know kinda prepared to do in terms
of cooperation and coordination

584
00:33:07,869 --> 00:33:10,879
in order to get to your ultimate goal
you know

585
00:33:10,879 --> 00:33:14,899
I am after a while in a security
researchers

586
00:33:14,899 --> 00:33:18,119
they tend to grow up have family is you
know

587
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:21,960
mortgages things like that and if you're
thinking about your career in longer

588
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,909
terms

589
00:33:22,909 --> 00:33:25,830
think about you know maybe it's
beginning of your career you're more

590
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,019
interested in money

591
00:33:27,019 --> 00:33:31,190
maybe you're interested in building out
you know your a recognition and fame

592
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:34,809
are maybe your more interested in
pursuing you know sort of a challenge in

593
00:33:34,809 --> 00:33:37,289
the problem itself

594
00:33:37,289 --> 00:33:40,519
you know in a switch gears and talk
about what vendors

595
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:44,149
are going to be held responsible for in
terms of these I set standards

596
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:47,450
that I've been alluding to okay

597
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:50,769
so of everybody knows what a click

598
00:33:50,769 --> 00:33:55,659
is in high school right it's a you know
one group that's fairly a.m.

599
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:58,759
fairly close to of from the other group

600
00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:03,309
right so I so I active titled the slide
everything aight needed to know about I

601
00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:04,989
so I learned in high school

602
00:34:04,989 --> 00:34:09,240
a but there's essentially two camps in I
so and I'm telling you this because

603
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:14,030
it matters in terms if how the how the
as is standard on bone disclosure ended

604
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:14,510
up

605
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:18,790
a involving there the subject matter
expert so people like myself got real

606
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,340
world experience

607
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:24,419
in the area in question but subject
matter experts may not have experience

608
00:34:24,419 --> 00:34:25,429
in dealing

609
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:29,540
with the world by so then there are the
I so experts

610
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:34,260
I'm their experts in actually creating
standards there are some people in se27

611
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,620
which is the

612
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:39,770
the I am the the group that dis the
standards fall under

613
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:44,270
that have been a part at the I so %uh
standards body for twenty years

614
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:49,320
and most meanwhile some a them are quite
politically motivated and

615
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,570
who knows what else what's interesting
about it is that subject matter

616
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:53,460
expertise

617
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:56,550
is not required by I so in order to be
calm and

618
00:34:56,550 --> 00:35:00,760
editor a a standard so what that means
is if you

619
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:05,940
decide for example that you want to
standardize on something like

620
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:09,220
responsible disclosure you don't
actually have

621
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:12,940
needed to have any kind experience in
disclosure any role

622
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:16,630
I there's a finer coordinator a vendor
and that's exactly what happened

623
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:21,120
when I when that standard was proposed
it was a non subject matter expert

624
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,840
who thought this would be a good idea I
am

625
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,920
so how was it like high school well
pretty much you've got the nerds in the

626
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,460
docs

627
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:32,320
and a for you know

628
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,130
from my experience in this world it was
very much like

629
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:40,140
you know the the I so experts are
willing to copy your homework

630
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:44,090
you know and then as soon as you're not
sorta useful for their purposes

631
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:49,930
they will stuff you into a locker to be
discovered by the janitor hours later

632
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:53,970
okay so let's get down to the two
standards basically the standards

633
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:54,780
overlap

634
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:58,340
and they are related they evolved out if
the

635
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:01,500
the first one I'm in fact some other
process

636
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:05,300
issues that are covered in the second
one were originally a subsection

637
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,700
above the first one I there were a lot
of issues with the first one there

638
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,750
continue to be a lot of issues with the
first one

639
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:14,000
which I can tell you about during the
break but essentially

640
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,490
user with the two standards cover the
vulnerability disclosure standard which

641
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:19,980
is 29% 147

642
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:24,120
dictates how vendors should deal with on
early reports from external finders

643
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:27,530
are going to each of these in a little
more detail in the next few slides

644
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:30,900
and then the centered on water body
handling processes is

645
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:35,600
how vendors should investigate reaction
resolve all potential vulnerabilities

646
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,630
and that's whether it was discovered
externally or

647
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:43,050
discovered via the vendors own internal
testing or security development life

648
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:44,940
cycle processes

649
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:48,980
so in terms of what vendors are being
held accountable to

650
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:53,830
I I would actually say that the second
one is probably going to have much more

651
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:55,380
of a significant impact

652
00:36:55,380 --> 00:37:00,400
on your experience in dealing with the
vendor then in fact the first one

653
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,780
kept so let's dive in a little bit
little bit deeper

654
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:07,020
the disclosure standard roughly covers
that

655
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:10,110
vendor should have a clear way to
receive on ability reports

656
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:13,920
I mean you have searched in vain for
some kind of security contact at a

657
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,360
vendor

658
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,960
many yes okay so that alone

659
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,260
will actually help given that there's no
standard way to have a front door

660
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:27,350
to receive these things I the other bit
is that vendor should acknowledge that

661
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:29,000
they receive the phone earlier reports

662
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,790
within one week that number love how
long it takes to acknowledge

663
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:35,930
yes I did receive your report that
number is changed

664
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:39,380
at you know a lot over the past five and
a half years within that standard

665
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:43,280
I believe the one-week a one is that one
that is going to stick

666
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,580
but I've seen things like 24 hours
forty-eight hours 30s

667
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:51,130
you know 72 hours to weeks in all manner
at these things but

668
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:54,310
I think one week is probably gonna stick
their some

669
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:58,070
vendors should coordinate with finders
this seems like a simple no brainer

670
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:02,330
however a lot of vendors if you have
newest will not communicate with the

671
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:04,980
finer at all once they receive the
vulnerability report

672
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:09,000
and in fact sometimes the vendors just
find out that the ball was fixed or

673
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,260
maybe not text

674
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:13,590
by you know reading the the release
notes

675
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:17,820
you know the next version and testing
their ball against the next version

676
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:22,030
and there's no actual communication back
to the finer so so gonna help with

677
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:25,340
with those types of issues I'm and then
finally

678
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:28,570
the advisories that the vendors are
advisors are built into the vendors

679
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:33,480
issue how do you have seen I so-called
security advisories coming from vendors

680
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:37,600
that literally don't say anything at all
anything meaningful

681
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:41,370
yeah a lot of you right so one of the
ways in which this disclosure standard

682
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:42,760
may actually help

683
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,920
is that it does give guidance to vendors
on

684
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,750
useful information to include in an
advisory at the bare minimum

685
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:53,020
include as many affected products is the
vendor knows about

686
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:57,020
right I'm include the impactor the
severity of the issue

687
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:01,460
if the vulnerabilities successfully
exploited and then include for the user

688
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,590
the customer

689
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:06,560
how it is that you're gonna protect
yourself so at a very basic level this

690
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,710
all seems

691
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:11,680
like remedial vendor response rate and
it is

692
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:16,600
but the funny thing is not all vendors
including some major vendors

693
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:21,980
not all vendors even follow this basic
amount

694
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:25,890
see okay so in the vulnerabilities

695
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:29,740
handling standard this is the one that
dictate the internal processes

696
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:34,510
other vendor this is basically organized
us such that its informing vendors via

697
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:35,430
the standard

698
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:39,030
defender should have a process to handle
a

699
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:42,490
should have a process and should have
organizational support

700
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:46,090
and structures I to perform

701
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:49,280
vulnerability investigation and
remediation

702
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,360
this also seems like a no brainer
however a lot of vendors

703
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:57,060
they don't really come up with any kind
organizational structure

704
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:01,130
or they don't come up with any kinda
processes internally to fix moms

705
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:04,280
or its parted you know the regular bug
fixing process

706
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,660
and that doesn't take into consideration
a lot of the security concerns

707
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:11,260
around fixing bugs that happen to have
security implications

708
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:14,340
so it's really important you know in
terms of the standard a

709
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:17,680
leading vendors know that if you were to
comply with the standard

710
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:22,200
you need actually have a specific
process for dealing with security bugs

711
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:26,210
in particular on and you need to have
some kind of work structure to support

712
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:27,740
dealing with that

713
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:32,520
seconds this one is up probably the one
that's nearest and dearest to my heart

714
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,890
is that vendor should perform some kind
root cause analysis

715
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:38,920
what actually cause the vulnerability

716
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:42,460
this is amazing that we're you know were
in 2012 and

717
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:46,510
this is the kind of thing that actually
my a lot of vendors don't do correctly

718
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:50,350
I'm in my in my years a reporting on our
abilities to

719
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:53,360
major vendors I'm I've actually seen

720
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:57,230
vendors patch the d1 vector

721
00:40:57,230 --> 00:41:00,870
that we reported your personal concept
have you seen that before

722
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:05,090
8 yes so the fact that you know a vendor

723
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:09,260
doesn't have the capability a perhaps
understanding

724
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:12,450
the root cause if their own
vulnerabilities is something

725
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:16,520
that is it you know that's a problem
they're gonna have to work on long-term

726
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:21,110
what will perhaps help help guide them
towards that and

727
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:26,350
is the fact that it's going to be in the
standard and

728
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:30,610
0 one thing I should actually clarify is
a not all vendors not a hundred percent

729
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:31,560
vendors

730
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,690
I are going to have to comply with these
I set standards

731
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:37,950
essentially the way I set standards
compliance works is

732
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:42,160
a an organization decides whether or not
they're going to be compliant

733
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,160
and part of that decision process is
business right

734
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:48,600
so if you're an organization that wants
to do business with

735
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:52,970
a government the government will say
these are the following: I so standards

736
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:55,320
and various other standards that you

737
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:59,710
a my vendor need to comply with before
you can be my vendor

738
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:03,510
right so major vendors are going to be
effected

739
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:06,820
by this a lot more than mid-size or you
know

740
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:10,910
mom-and-pop Deb shops so if you're kind
of thinking about it in terms if

741
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:13,980
well how is you know a single developer
open source project

742
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:17,000
pointed provide organizational
infrastructure to support on our ability

743
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,120
response

744
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:21,570
how is that possible well they're not
really going to need to be compliant

745
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:23,840
unless they want to do business with the
government

746
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:27,130
that requires compliance so that's just
a little background on how

747
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:30,290
you know how is it that vendors are
actually gonna be held accountable to

748
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:30,650
this

749
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:34,170
it'll be the major vendors who want to
do business with organizations are

750
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:36,660
governments that require compliance

751
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:40,530
on so the other thing that's included in
the standard

752
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:44,610
is that vendor should way the various
options for remediation

753
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:49,020
and adjust for real world risk factors
it doesn't give a prescriptive guide on

754
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:53,230
you know if this than this you know in
terms of how offender should react

755
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:56,690
but it does provide a lot of context in
this in this document

756
00:42:56,690 --> 00:43:00,440
about you know balancing the need for
speed with the need for

757
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:04,060
providing a comprehensive update so
it'll say things

758
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:07,980
you know in their considerations being
I'm you know is there explico da

759
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,030
Republic

760
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:12,440
you know and that maybe will speed you
up as opposed to I

761
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:16,680
doing all this testing and looking for
you know looking for variants looking

762
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,410
for

763
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:20,710
and a the same or similar code

764
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:25,050
and vulnerabilities in different you
know other product lines that you own is

765
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:25,800
a vendor

766
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,400
so ideally you wanna do you the most
thorough investigation and remediation

767
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,860
is possible

768
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:34,270
as a vendor and that's definitely what
this standard supports

769
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:38,830
however it does also give that idea of
taking into consideration the relative

770
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:39,500
risk

771
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:43,290
and the prioritisation I am and then
finally

772
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:46,400
a this standard talks about

773
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,590
vendors trying to coordinate with other
vendors

774
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:53,880
especially in the case of multi-vendor
issues and multi-vendor issues you know

775
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:54,610
they're

776
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:58,520
their issues where you know let's say
the vulnerability is found in

777
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,700
a a a protocol

778
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:06,730
or the vulnerability issue is found I am

779
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:10,800
you know in in some common library that

780
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,390
that can end up being you know
essentially a supply chain issue

781
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:17,780
so there is mention in in this handling
standard

782
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:21,140
about trying to coordinate upstream and
downstream

783
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:24,780
if you're a vendor who somewhere in the
software

784
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:30,360
supply chain so

785
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:33,870
okay how is this actually can affect
your life his idea when I just go for

786
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:36,680
another five minutes before I open it up
for questions

787
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:40,170
and ideally the mall

788
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:43,690
disclosure standard is going to told
vendors

789
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:46,990
you know some basic stuff that will make
it a lot easier for you

790
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:50,020
as a security researcher 21 find the
front door

791
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:54,740
to report a vulnerability and two I to
actually have those advisories be more

792
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:56,680
useful when they come out

793
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:00,220
the bone handling standard as I said I
think it's actually gonna help raise

794
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:04,500
the baseline level up security
investigation and remediation

795
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:08,450
vendors do and again like I said it'll
only affect vendors who want to do

796
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:09,140
business

797
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:12,920
in certain countries are certain areas
that require compliance with the

798
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:13,910
standard

799
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:17,530
but it's a lever and it can help move

800
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:22,140
some parts the disclosure world

801
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:25,810
okay so just to wrap it up I

802
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:29,290
vote this measure doesn't need to be as
painful for you or the vendor

803
00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:34,130
I am you when in doubt coordinate as
much as possible

804
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:37,710
most under secure about security want to
hear from you they definitely want to

805
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:39,120
hear from you and they want to hear from
you

806
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:42,450
as early as you want to give them a
heads up for online services

807
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:44,050
vulnerability reporting

808
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:47,900
it's a tricky area there are some legal
gray areas that you have to be able to

809
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:48,800
navigate

810
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,620
in order to I you know keep yourself
safe

811
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:56,590
and and make the risks worthwhile for
you I'm so first and foremost check the

812
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:57,870
laws in your country

813
00:45:57,870 --> 00:46:01,020
next check the policy very intended
research target

814
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:04,150
and you know there is an intersection up
the above

815
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:08,400
I'm or you could always try just asking
for permission that usually helps

816
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,440
you know in terms as even if the
intended research target doesn't have a

817
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,610
stated policy

818
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:17,740
if you ask for permission is granted it
well that in most cases will

819
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:22,100
literally get you out of jail in the in
the first bullet there in terms of

820
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:25,680
running afoul of the law for some cash
opportunities you know there's always

821
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:26,810
pen testing

822
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:29,960
I'm which if you're interested in doing
that for vendor building that

823
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:34,240
strong relationship with the vendor in
providing you know cooperation and

824
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,400
details and all that stuff really help
in building a relationship

825
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:40,620
there the white market brokers there are
some vendor ben is out there there at

826
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:42,630
split contest like pony in one

827
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:46,670
Antonio on and there's a course the blue
half price for security defense

828
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:50,440
if you want some legitimate money and
then finally

829
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,820
these ice is standards that are going to
reach fruition

830
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:56,910
at some point next year very shortly
thereafter

831
00:46:56,910 --> 00:47:00,600
will actually be there to hold some
vendors accountable for some

832
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:04,360
love the disclosure interactions with
the research community

833
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:07,640
and more importantly summer the
investigation that they need to do in

834
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:09,510
order to truly remediate

835
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:12,500
these vulnerabilities that are being
reported or are being discovered

836
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:13,720
internally

837
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:18,010
I think you know I think we've we've all
had at least one experience with the

838
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:18,680
vendor

839
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:23,420
where they literally just patched you
know the one after that we sent to them

840
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:27,350
and not only is that you know that
certainly wasn't

841
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:31,220
you know the researchers intent I'm in
terms of the vendor ending up

842
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:35,030
your day themselves I'm because they
didn't really fix the issue

843
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:38,760
I'm but you know it certainly hurts the
vendor as well so I think that

844
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:41,610
with these processes in place in with
the standards in place it should

845
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:42,200
increase

846
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:46,120
your predictability in dealing with
vendors who claim compliance with these

847
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:50,540
on it can also help you have some tools
that vendors may

848
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:53,730
you more prone to listen to you
considering it's coming out in this

849
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:58,070
I says standards by I if the vendor
doesn't claim compliance you can always

850
00:47:58,070 --> 00:47:59,780
point them to the standard saying

851
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:03,080
these are the ISO standards on how you
actually supposed to do this

852
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:06,260
vendor I'm so provides you as a
researcher

853
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:09,580
summer these tools that you can use to
help leverage

854
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:13,160
I the right outcomes for you i'm for the
community

855
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:16,800
and and for the vendor's himself as they
know what's good for them

856
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:21,460
right so without I more information on
the blue cap rising to half price that

857
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:23,780
comes in various links up here

858
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:28,120
and Katie now on Twitter and i wanna
open up the floor for any questions in

859
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,140
the last 10 minutes

860
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:36,800
yes

861
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,170
um okay one of the slightest on mention
the party

862
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:43,750
full disclosure and coordinator
disclosure

863
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:47,880
on to can you please on

864
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:54,880
shift slept

865
00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:00,569
I know which one you're talking about a
sure

866
00:49:00,569 --> 00:49:04,730
some so what do you mean by full
disclosure drop yesterday

867
00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:08,430
or does that include mall where the
users

868
00:49:08,430 --> 00:49:12,510
undisclosed for abilities does that
include now where what

869
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:16,839
that users undisclosed what abilities
that uses undisclosed

870
00:49:16,839 --> 00:49:20,319
yes yes so if now where uses your day
and that

871
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:24,470
that your days so do you see a trend of
people dropping are disclosed what

872
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:25,779
abilities are being these

873
00:49:25,779 --> 00:49:30,180
or do you see more arm what undisclosed
liabilities been dropped

874
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:33,609
true no way well it's still a relatively

875
00:49:33,609 --> 00:49:37,000
low percentage overall and

876
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,319
we've seen something you know some
notable examples in the past couple

877
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:40,869
years

878
00:49:40,869 --> 00:49:43,950
%uh now we're using using Saturday's I'm

879
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:47,579
and that had been that had fallen out of
vogue for a while

880
00:49:47,579 --> 00:49:51,730
and but enemies we started seeing you
know some state-sponsored hackers using

881
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:52,240
some

882
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:56,680
some our that that does leverage 90 days
so it's hard to tell where the trend is

883
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:57,549
going right now

884
00:49:57,549 --> 00:50:00,670
but for a while it was it was very much
not in fashion to essentially

885
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:03,760
lawyers your day on you know mass our or

886
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:08,140
even targeted some targeted an hour no
one last question is that

887
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:12,910
and most is that the I so addresses snow
when does clean eating and communicating

888
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:13,960
with the reporter

889
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:17,119
bottle what does Microsoft to

890
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:20,380
as far as some on though

891
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:23,700
making sure that what abilities get
addressed on time

892
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:28,279
or as far as a stick and at whether and
not sitting on the portability for a

893
00:50:28,279 --> 00:50:29,200
couple years

894
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,910
for not goes well one of the things I
saw

895
00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:36,559
why reporters decide to Brickell

896
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:40,289
brick phone coordinate for tablet is
close because

897
00:50:40,289 --> 00:50:43,480
friend Austin to see on for abilities
for a long time

898
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:47,240
and actually causes them to no to get
into some trouble

899
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:52,430
yeah okay so what was the question up
question is that a what us

900
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:55,569
Microsoft to to address some no arm

901
00:50:55,569 --> 00:50:59,430
situation where to meet and to sit on
what a pity for a long time

902
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:02,490
because to me not happen I do to fix the
problem or the meeting that

903
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:06,490
the personal problem well could result
in a high res of introducing more

904
00:51:06,490 --> 00:51:07,180
regression

905
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:10,940
yes ok with select know what what does
Microsoft to in this case

906
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:14,200
so we actually have a yet white paper
out

907
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:17,710
that talks about the different the
different time

908
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:22,650
stages a our investigation and how much
relative time

909
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:26,059
stages take so if you think about it in
terms if I'm

910
00:51:26,059 --> 00:51:29,940
you know looking at the vulnerability
itself and coding up the

911
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:33,140
the actual security fix that doesn't
take that usually doesn't take a lot of

912
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:33,700
time

913
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:36,980
it's really the compatibility testing
stage for us

914
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:40,400
as a as a platform provider and we've
got hundreds of products there's

915
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,450
language localization

916
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:44,490
huge test matrix that we have to

917
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:48,630
that we have to comply with because in
the early days you may recall

918
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:52,520
there wasn't a the the tendency for

919
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:56,000
for vendors was to try and fix it as
quickly as humanly possible

920
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,440
and then a lotta a a lot of the result

921
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,910
that was having issue um fixes to the
fixes

922
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:06,650
so what Microsoft processes involved in
two is trying to do that

923
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:10,049
balance between timeliness and
comprehensiveness

924
00:52:10,049 --> 00:52:12,849
and we have a whole white paper that
actually talks about those different

925
00:52:12,849 --> 00:52:13,520
stages

926
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:18,440
and what that means but I mean for
example in my past life when I was

927
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:22,299
a Linux developer and rolling patches
myself my test

928
00:52:22,299 --> 00:52:26,420
phase was doesn't compile on my Linux
box doesn't compile on the guys

929
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:30,440
Linux box next to me alright road into
anarchy and stick it on the FTP server

930
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,549
and then let your users test it for you

931
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:35,710
for the rest of it right that was that
was that world

932
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:39,210
microsoft has a very different
responsibility level

933
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:42,890
in terms of our customers they don't
wanna roll out a patch

934
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:46,430
to fix the last patch so we have to
balance that out

935
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:49,630
and I can point you to the way paper a
little bit later

936
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:52,720
I have a question

937
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:56,079
yes supposing I am a security researcher

938
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:59,150
and then coming from some stupid
European country

939
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:02,720
no names where for example the simple
possession

940
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,799
over exploiting to whether it be a
public to

941
00:53:05,799 --> 00:53:10,339
or my own to it's a crime home I
supposed to end the situation

942
00:53:10,339 --> 00:53:14,380
for example with Microsoft so you're
saying

943
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:18,799
your security researcher who's in the
country where it makes the exploit tools

944
00:53:18,799 --> 00:53:19,529
illegal

945
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:22,779
yet anyone there's a familiar jail
what's the quest

946
00:53:22,779 --> 00:53:26,740
that a No I want to I want to
communicate with you with Microsoft and

947
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:28,049
they want to handle

948
00:53:28,049 --> 00:53:31,460
the X over rape and then to

949
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:35,390
Microsoft to get the a better boys for
example

950
00:53:35,390 --> 00:53:40,000
how should I E behave how should you
behave in that situation

951
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,720
well I mean it's a matter how much
personal risk you want to assume

952
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:48,309
in your own country and whether or not
you're going to be able to

953
00:53:48,309 --> 00:53:52,440
I deal with the consequences if if your
own country decides that

954
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:55,520
that you violated their laws I mean
certainly Microsoft

955
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:58,779
love to get you know the vulnerability
information from you

956
00:53:58,779 --> 00:54:01,849
but not if that means that you're gonna
be you know putting yourself at legal

957
00:54:01,849 --> 00:54:02,509
rest

958
00:54:02,509 --> 00:54:06,500
at the larger problem that you know I
think especially if perhaps any

959
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:07,270
standards

960
00:54:07,270 --> 00:54:11,329
you are widely adopted that if it
becomes

961
00:54:11,329 --> 00:54:15,579
obvious that this is actually helping
the overall security %uh vendors

962
00:54:15,579 --> 00:54:16,460
products

963
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:20,819
that maybe there might be ways in which
later down the line that that those

964
00:54:20,819 --> 00:54:22,480
countries may overturn some those

965
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:26,660
legislations but I'm not a lobbyist so I
don't know exactly how that would happen

966
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:29,200
in your country

967
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:32,710
it doesn't yet actually my question was
a suggestion

968
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:35,859
because a most of the time laws are
written by

969
00:54:35,859 --> 00:54:38,930
politicians who knows nothing about
security

970
00:54:38,930 --> 00:54:43,430
Germany had a taste for it for example
right

971
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:46,770
doesn't work okay probably the Microsoft

972
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:51,180
should lot be actually should the
address to politicians say hey look

973
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:55,240
the slows and not really helping
actually they are

974
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:59,430
they have a counter effect because their
security researcher so

975
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:03,000
I'm very personally very interested in
this I you know

976
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,490
if my work in the standards wraps up
because it is a lot a grueling work

977
00:55:06,490 --> 00:55:07,359
honestly

978
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:10,539
I'm being being a nerd in that festival
jocks

979
00:55:10,539 --> 00:55:13,759
I'm you know may be there their ways
that that I

980
00:55:13,759 --> 00:55:18,059
myself could help out in that area so
I'm personally interested in this

981
00:55:18,059 --> 00:55:23,170
I'm and miraculously enough the ice a
community seems to have accepted me

982
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:26,299
perhaps you know perhaps a in a future

983
00:55:26,299 --> 00:55:29,950
iteration my career Microsoft I may be
able to help influence among those

984
00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:33,640
legislature legislators as well because
I know it's really frustrating

985
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:36,829
right when you're re looking at the
politicians and

986
00:55:36,829 --> 00:55:40,970
literally you know I don't know how how
clueless on the older ones are

987
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:44,700
you know in this country or in europe
and everything but in the US

988
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:48,460
a lot of them are you know they're just
not informed in terms of technology we

989
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:49,480
hear things like

990
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:53,579
the Internet is a series of tubes mean
if you heard that quote from 10 when the

991
00:55:53,579 --> 00:55:54,819
US lawmakers

992
00:55:54,819 --> 00:55:59,390
is a very frustrating issue and it's on
this you know it's a similar frustration

993
00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:01,460
that I've experienced on the micro level
with

994
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:05,500
I so in terms that their subject matter
experts who may or may not be listening

995
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:06,410
to you

996
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:10,599
I'm and then there are the career
politicians you know who are

997
00:56:10,599 --> 00:56:14,359
who are versed in the ways that laws are
made you know and so I think

998
00:56:14,359 --> 00:56:17,960
you know if possible I would like to
apply some my skills in that area

999
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:21,369
good luck all right thank you any other

1000
00:56:21,369 --> 00:56:27,069
see with time for one more question

1001
00:56:27,069 --> 00:56:31,289
or time to thank you very much thanks a
lot

1002
00:56:31,289 --> 00:56:38,289
thank you baby

1003
00:56:48,049 --> 00:56:49,710
this

1004
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:56,710
sleep
