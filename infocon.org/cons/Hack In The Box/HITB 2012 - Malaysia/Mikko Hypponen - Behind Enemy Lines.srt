1
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:09,820
for

2
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,440
this

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,490
a

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:14,250
this

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,110
sleep

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:23,110
space

7
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,789
this

8
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:37,789
skills

9
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,670
and my name

10
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,089
is it could happen from f-secure
Corporation

11
00:00:53,089 --> 00:00:57,000
and this here

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,440
is the website of the at some

13
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,580
energy organization of Iran a couple
months ago

14
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,710
I receive an e-mail completely by
surprise

15
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:13,540
out of the blue by a researcher analyst

16
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,540
nuclear scientist was working there

17
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:21,210
he emailed me because he wanted to
inform me

18
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,810
that there once again their nuclear
program has been breached

19
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,979
and you want to do the world to know
about this

20
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:34,000
and imparting killer he emailed me that

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,159
yes some music playing randomly on
several of the workstations inside

22
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:42,210
the item energy organization Iran

23
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,970
they were playing at full volume in the
middle of the night and the nuclear

24
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,420
scientists believe it

25
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,580
the song loss from the American band
ac/dc

26
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:59,580
the song loss funders not I don't
actually now

27
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,940
if this really happen I gone actually no

28
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,940
if they were really playing
thunderstruck

29
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:11,370
at full volume in the middle of the
night at on some energy organization

30
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:16,069
Ron what's possible what I do know

31
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:19,250
is that these emails were indeed coming
really

32
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,760
from at some energy organization Iran I
don't know why

33
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,230
is gone email me when i search with the
guys name

34
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:29,840
there's really a guy with his name he's
a real nuclear scientist is

35
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,620
published several nuclear sign
scientific papers about different

36
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:39,209
effects of radiation stuff like that and
he must exchanging email back and forth

37
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:41,290
with me from the atom energy
organization

38
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:45,549
now assuming $this really optics let's
assume for a second

39
00:02:45,549 --> 00:02:49,359
he's telling the truth but these re
what's happening why

40
00:02:49,359 --> 00:02:53,599
would any attacker duties want they
start playing music at the middle of the

41
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,810
night doesn't really make any sense
because they basically

42
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:59,040
let be victim know that they've been

43
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,370
0 been attacked maybe why would anybody
do

44
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,650
then again if you go on

45
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,859
read the book confront concealed by
David Sanger from the New York Times

46
00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:14,829
one key now about the United States and
the Israel

47
00:03:14,829 --> 00:03:18,419
operations against Iran the operation
Olympic Games

48
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:22,859
one of the key point of these operations
ass documented in the book must make

49
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:27,760
the enemy feel stupid make sure to enemy
feels

50
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,219
airstrip for example the problems that
they were causing with the strength

51
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:31,889
fuchs

52
00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:36,219
at the Bushehr nuclear enrichment plant
in Iran for several months

53
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:39,389
arm the scientist thought that they were
just doing a

54
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:42,680
there they were going to work right
screwing something up

55
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,219
lots of people are fired because of the
problems they had with the strength

56
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:52,340
and no idea that they would work stupid
ever being

57
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,709
so for something like this to happen in
the real for some good for playing

58
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:59,919
thunderstruck what would be the motive
well one motive could be

59
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:04,370
that the attacker has already been in
they've already stolen the information

60
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,299
they were looking for

61
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:09,510
and they now wanted to make sure all the
employees

62
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:12,680
in the organization no their

63
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,190
IT department can't defend the best way
to make this happen is

64
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,500
to play music in the middle of the night
from all the computers now everybody

65
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,199
knows to be infected everybody knows
that something happening here

66
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,430
and they know that their own IT security
department can

67
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:33,590
handle once again I don't know it will
happen maybe

68
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:36,840
this is just one example

69
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,610
of the con- a tax receipt this is
obviously a very

70
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:45,160
unusual attack in fact

71
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,340
isn't the attack we really should be
very about because it's highly unlikely

72
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:54,210
any of chaos personally or any of our
organization

73
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,300
becomes a victim for such an attack yet

74
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,000
attacks like these exist and I strongly
believe

75
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,480
if you want to have any hope at all

76
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,690
in defending our systems against attacks
we have to understand

77
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:12,150
who were fighting we have to understand

78
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:15,460
who's behind the attacks what's the
motive of the attack if we don't

79
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,040
understand the motive of the attacker

80
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,530
we have no hope in defending ourselves
because the attacks

81
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,110
and the techniques used in the attacks
are completely different

82
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:29,910
you take a look at an organization which
is being attacked by a criminal attack

83
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:34,030
trying to steal money his techniques
motives are completely different than

84
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,390
let's say

85
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:38,500
another organization which is being
targeted by the animes

86
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,710
completely different attacks completely
different

87
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:46,910
we have to understand we're fighting

88
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:50,150
once you understand who were fighting
then you have done do have some kind of

89
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,150
measure how likely

90
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,300
your organization is to become victim

91
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,620
of said kind of attack for example a
local pizza place

92
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,210
doesn't have to worry about government
11 attacks nobody's interest

93
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:08,360
nobody spied however if you work for a
local defense contractor

94
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,430
son are you do have to worry about
espionage

95
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:15,560
governmental level attacks and
information leakage

96
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,900
so you start preparing

97
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:23,750
defense by understanding your risk level
and understanding whose after

98
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:28,980
who could be after you and if you're
after you how would they be doing

99
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,670
so that secure has been around for 25
years that's where I

100
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:36,660
left Tuesday when I left and once

101
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,760
our headquarters in Helsinki in Finland
which is where I'll be working

102
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,200
for 21 years now so quite a while

103
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,420
our rock closest office

104
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:50,390
to where we are right now would be this
building here in Kuala Lumpur which is

105
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:55,380
f-secure Malaysia our regional
headquarters which also hosts

106
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:59,080
our local research lab here in Malaysia
we do

107
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,130
local analyzes response for

108
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:07,820
customers around the world overall we
have offices in 22 countries

109
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,440
the way it secured us businesses we work
with the operators

110
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,670
which means you're mostly behind the
scenes we mostly

111
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:18,890
providing security to millions of users
who have never heard of secure

112
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:22,420
we work with their operators and a to
pick you don't see us

113
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:27,130
that's the way we like but also gives us
a very good window

114
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:31,050
to the world of attacks because we see
such a massive amount of traffic

115
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:35,540
through more than 250 operators around
the world

116
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:39,310
that gives us the and inside whose
behind the attacks

117
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:42,690
one on techniques using the attacks

118
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:47,210
one automotives of the attack

119
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:51,990
the rocks plea to use on the attackers
is asleep in three

120
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:56,980
speak in three based on why these
different parties are doing the attacks

121
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:01,180
number one criminals and this is by far
the biggest

122
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:06,030
group by far the most active group the
vast majority of attacks we analyze

123
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:09,830
are being but done by criminals and it's
actually interesting to think about this

124
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,580
because

125
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,420
isn't arm it always looked like this

126
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:19,889
PC viruses were found in 1986 26 years

127
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:22,990
for the first fifteen years

128
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:26,780
all the mall where it was being written
by four beasts and teenagers for fun

129
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:30,110
they had no real motive at all they were
just doing it because they could or

130
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,490
because of the challenge or

131
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:36,630
because they thought it was fun
criminals have been in the picture

132
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:40,529
only for 10 years even less than that
the very first

133
00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:44,600
money-making PC miler was found in 2003

134
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,100
nine years ago originally all of these
was being

135
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,860
monetized by using mile word went
Windows computers to build

136
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:55,060
botnets distance so I just the

137
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,500
are coming together of Mama writers
spammers

138
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,450
most initial money-making since then

139
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:05,670
the scenario has changed completely
hobbyists

140
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,879
have practically disappeared we don't
seem other attackers

141
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:12,420
noble basically everybody has a motive

142
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,829
some random obese mice Alexis really
isn't

143
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:20,980
even on the map and in addition
money-making attackers

144
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:25,430
we have two other groups we have
activists

145
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,980
who are actually fairly close to copies
but they do have a mod

146
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,230
they want to achieve something with
their attacks typically they want to

147
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,050
protest

148
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:38,829
they have a politicos motive or they
want to send a message

149
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:42,800
this includes movements like animus and
and the Second Mile second the

150
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,290
similarity

151
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:47,809
and then the third group are different
kinds of attacks launched by

152
00:09:47,809 --> 00:09:51,110
governments this wide range of stuff
here

153
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:55,009
coming from are intelligent agencies
using

154
00:09:55,009 --> 00:09:58,079
attacks for espionage purposes

155
00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:03,550
to law enforcement using backdoor
Trojans against their own citizens

156
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:07,240
while they are doing investigations

157
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,160
all the way to attacks like Stuxnet
flame girls Dougal

158
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,999
which are cyberattacks one day

159
00:10:14,999 --> 00:10:19,249
we might see Simon and I want to
emphasize these

160
00:10:19,249 --> 00:10:23,110
we haven't seen side why because we
haven't seen the war

161
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:26,779
wars or something else forth between
nations what's happening between United

162
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:28,499
States and Israel and Iran right now

163
00:10:28,499 --> 00:10:32,559
whatever it is isn't war I don't
remember anybody declaring a war

164
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:35,879
between these countries it's clearly
cyberattacks

165
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:40,290
sure we really shouldn't be using the
word cyberwar

166
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:44,740
when we don't because one day we will
then we need to work for

167
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,959
causing unnecessary inflation for the
work

168
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,480
where it doesn't achieve that level of
attacks

169
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,889
during our lifetime even if we wish we
wouldn't we most likely will see

170
00:10:57,889 --> 00:11:01,889
conflicts crises and wars between
technically advanced nations then when

171
00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:02,850
you have that

172
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:06,059
you will have army of country a

173
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:10,129
attacking computer systems army of
country be

174
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:13,329
and if that is inside the ward I don't
know what it is

175
00:11:13,329 --> 00:11:17,559
we haven't seen

176
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:21,550
there are other groups in addition of
these main three

177
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:25,170
arm for example earlier this year I
spent quite a while

178
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:30,699
investigating whether we should be
buried about cyber terrorism

179
00:11:30,699 --> 00:11:34,050
when I'm when I say cyberterrorism I
mean hacking

180
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:37,999
or and or anything like that I mean real
real-world

181
00:11:37,999 --> 00:11:41,529
terror group using computers

182
00:11:41,529 --> 00:11:45,129
to benefit their operations so

183
00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:49,410
al Qaeda other on

184
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:53,649
Islamic extremist groups white supremist
group

185
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:57,180
other ever

186
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:01,670
and throughout my research well it was
easy to see that these groups

187
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:05,480
the old use computers the old Houston
day communicates

188
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,079
they use their own cryptosystem arcade
as their own encryption

189
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:12,100
a program they used to encrypt email
connectivity

190
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,649
arm they used the internet to spread
their message used for propaganda

191
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:20,490
and the euphoric with but that's not
really cyberterrorism

192
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:24,160
real cyber terrorist would be to
actually do attacks or at least assist

193
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,639
attacks with some sort of cyber
capability side

194
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:32,079
Elena that we really haven't see I did
find individuals

195
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,809
especially the Islamist extremist groups
were clearly

196
00:12:35,809 --> 00:12:39,670
hackers and were using tools like
Metasploit

197
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:43,899
backtrack we're trying to teach others
but there were so few and far between

198
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:47,029
it really isn't a problem then again

199
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:50,119
it's only likely to get worse

200
00:12:50,119 --> 00:12:54,519
but the basic split is this criminals
activists governments

201
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:58,439
and criminals is the easiest group to
understand

202
00:12:58,439 --> 00:13:01,679
just a do whatever they do to make my

203
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:05,929
money is a very easy mode we all go to
jobs to be all good work

204
00:13:05,929 --> 00:13:10,019
to make money song if somebody can
become rich

205
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:13,519
by running malware well somebody will do
it

206
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,350
so let's take a look at some examples
casey's of exactly how this works how

207
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:22,920
do the criminals get their hands cash

208
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,209
so this is my guests Korea ok from
Slovenia

209
00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:30,019
pictured at the courthouse in in
Slovenia

210
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:34,269
well he went into court of a year ago
forty money pose a

211
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:39,050
book this year

212
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:43,189
is behind you up pictured as he's
exiting his Porsche

213
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:48,149
bucharest Romania he's related to this
guy another Romanian guy

214
00:13:48,149 --> 00:13:52,339
been tracking for quite a while the sky
here is flooded with chechen

215
00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:57,059
from the city of bob dole stone

216
00:13:57,059 --> 00:14:00,149
all these examples are Eastern Europeans
and

217
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:03,589
the same countries keep coming up over
and over again lots of

218
00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:07,160
organized criminal activity from Rush

219
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,410
from ukraine from be a lot of

220
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:15,569
from Kazakhstan from Romania from
Moldova

221
00:14:15,569 --> 00:14:19,589
then we have other conservative the
Chinese which are clearly very active as

222
00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:21,379
well lots of commercial criminal

223
00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:24,829
organized activity from there as well
what's resilience

224
00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:28,389
especially targeting local Brazilian
backs which is

225
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:30,939
which are prone to being targeted more
than any other bank anywhere in the

226
00:14:30,939 --> 00:14:33,040
world

227
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,160
what common to all these years well in
one way or another they're all

228
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,399
developing areas

229
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:41,869
this areas with lots of people with
skills but it might be hard to find

230
00:14:41,869 --> 00:14:46,329
well-paying job with your computer
programming or

231
00:14:46,329 --> 00:14:50,129
networking skills in fact that might be
easiest

232
00:14:50,129 --> 00:14:53,489
to become rich to go into a life of
crime because

233
00:14:53,489 --> 00:14:57,829
months ago like crime the whole world is
at your disposal

234
00:14:57,829 --> 00:15:00,999
these guys don't really care who their
victims

235
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:04,019
they don't really care where in the
world victims

236
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:08,550
as long as they make money that work

237
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:13,170
so how much money on these guys making
money man was running the operation

238
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:13,899
which we

239
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:18,920
know as DNS Changer and DNS Changer

240
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,540
make the headlines earlier this year
actually make the headlines when the

241
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,329
network was finally shut down

242
00:15:24,329 --> 00:15:27,699
network which was saw

243
00:15:27,699 --> 00:15:32,509
fairly large it's fine but I think the
best way to illustrate how successful

244
00:15:32,509 --> 00:15:37,100
London has been computer crime
businessman is to take a look at what he

245
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,759
owns

246
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:42,100
so I'm from Finland Estonia right across
the border across the

247
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:46,769
Baltic Sea on if you go to a story in
which isn't a very large country you

248
00:15:46,769 --> 00:15:48,529
take a look at public records

249
00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:52,829
of properties and want to get a touching
I'll

250
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:57,999
legally in Estonia it's quite remarkable
property so how sees

251
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:01,949
this guy almost one hundred and fifty
five separate properties

252
00:16:01,949 --> 00:16:05,239
in a store he's been investing is money
into realistic

253
00:16:05,239 --> 00:16:08,259
which is probably a good move if you
make a lot of money in

254
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:12,069
cybercrime a computer crime you wanna
invest it somewhere safe

255
00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:15,489
summer Rican actually make more money

256
00:16:15,489 --> 00:16:19,089
155 real estate properties

257
00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:25,920
on by one touch I think that's
remarkable

258
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,069
this guy was running the harbored
operation

259
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:34,689
from moscow weeks video clip we play %um
minute of this clip from russian

260
00:16:34,689 --> 00:16:39,369
television

261
00:16:39,369 --> 00:16:43,189
we have the audio on

262
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:46,759
seascape southern gas station where
Democrats additionally computer should

263
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:49,939
have quite the opposite lets us than
years past I need to use its Internet

264
00:16:49,939 --> 00:16:51,559
the personal use a

265
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:55,299
keeping a program of possible high comes
up with the she's the set new

266
00:16:55,299 --> 00:16:56,649
wonderfully

267
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:59,949
the profession which one QA

268
00:16:59,949 --> 00:17:03,399
aborigine puchis vehicle a town with my
mother who polices d

269
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:07,290
municipal level like Movable son wants
pizza been absolute by the way my mom

270
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:10,290
reverse it would you want more DP it is
due to not

271
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:17,290
enough for me to believe you need to do
much good cousins while

272
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:22,720
the machine is a pretty good grounding
it could happen is in montana

273
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,449
good him personally to any computer
technology pleaded innocent committed

274
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:26,760
them

275
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,420
by the way I'm me to solve the you gonna
like it how the

276
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:34,630
Russian let law enforcement takes no
shit raid

277
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:37,780
signed a criminal case and a SWAT team
to rubble in from the roof

278
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:41,440
which is nice I have a feeling there was
more like TV

279
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,640
opportunity just happen to have a TV
crew they're shooting

280
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,710
ever going in to

281
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:52,820
another example on just how bold some of
these guys are on how

282
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:56,650
openly they operate because they really
feel that

283
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:59,690
no getting caught like that guy just in
moscow are really

284
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:02,890
the exceptions most of these guys they
know they will never be cool

285
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:06,890
you know the able they will %ah have no
chance of someone finding them and even

286
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:07,890
if they do

287
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:11,310
what can arrest even if they can arrest
they won't get sentenced

288
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:14,720
some of these operate freely openly
these YouTube disease

289
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,190
Gold Club he's running a service called
DDoS

290
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:21,730
cities dot orc which is website where
you can order

291
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:25,400
distributed denial-of-service attacks
and they are so open about and they

292
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,760
actually post ads

293
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:31,840
of their services so you here for one
reason

294
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,940
that reason is is because you need your
business competitors

295
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:38,240
rivals heaters whatever the reason is

296
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,810
or who the or to go game do you my
friend

297
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:46,030
you came to the right place if you want
your business competitors to go down

298
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:49,510
well the key you when your rival to go
offline

299
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:54,400
while they will not only their we
provide any short term to long term Diaz

300
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,170
service for scheduled attack starting
five dollars per hour

301
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:02,370
for small personal web sites to tend to
be dollars per hour

302
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:07,350
for huge DS protected web sites prices
may depend on how huge website is for

303
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,190
how protected is

304
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:13,040
with four years adidas an experience
several years a study

305
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:17,690
on dedust protection you cannot do wrong

306
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:21,560
so if anybody's interested in the
service the URL loss

307
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:28,440
here deed of service to the war

308
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,790
many of these criminal attacks or
practically all of them

309
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:36,590
today are being distributed through the
web this is the problem

310
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:41,860
web is the problem people get infected
because they choose to browse the web

311
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:45,960
where do you get in you get infected by
visiting the site you know and trust

312
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,740
side you've been going every day for
years and years let's see some

313
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,740
you side some agassi because it got

314
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,820
act and now it had annexed

315
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:59,880
or you gets infected by using Google go
to Google you google for something and

316
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,890
then you click on results

317
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:04,770
one of the results coast on website
which has no useful content

318
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:08,230
just has a lot of keywords but it also
has an expert

319
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:12,220
decide to set up from the very beginning
just own people

320
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:15,800
wasn't always like this we've had other
vectors

321
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:20,280
major for example email email
attachments used to be the number one

322
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,670
wave could

323
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:25,710
is anymore hasn't been for five years
it's too wet

324
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:29,030
we have some other routes like USB
sticks which are a real problem

325
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:32,310
nowhere near the amount of infections
are being caught by

326
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:36,060
website

327
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:40,030
and almost all of these infections
through this website are being caught by

328
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,110
exploit kits

329
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:45,120
and the king of the hills of different
exploit kits is black

330
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,880
black hole has a lot of competition most
of these again made in Russia

331
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,990
or in ukraine and sold on underground
sites

332
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:56,390
black cock black hole has been around
for a couple years stem a lot by a guy

333
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:56,860
called

334
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:01,080
porch we believe is chanting his
nickname to kidnap

335
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,980
and he selling these typical price with
the pentagon options somewhere between

336
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,640
1,000 to 2,000 US dollars 40 K

337
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,910
it's a very professional kit once you by
it

338
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:15,790
arm it's sort of a turnkey solution you
can even lease

339
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:19,320
web black hole licensees so you need to
buy

340
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:24,610
rent next the expertise completely
invisible

341
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:29,050
for the victim victim goes the website
the website looks just like it used

342
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:32,300
five years ago ten years ago if somebody
would pack website

343
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,970
summit would gain access to a large
profile site

344
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:39,580
they were just delete the side and put
some stupid debasement messages

345
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:44,180
and creating for their friends everybody
would immediately see decided act

346
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:47,750
two-day with the same thing happens they
don't change the site hell

347
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,990
they include one love JavaScript every
single page on the site

348
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:56,000
that chuck clough launches black black
hole goes through the infected machine

349
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,510
or

350
00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:00,840
machine to be detected trying to find
something that can be exploited

351
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:05,120
this is very extensive goes through your
operating system

352
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,870
your browser your problem for plugins
and extensions

353
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:12,250
trying to find anything that could be
exploited

354
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:15,870
and typically isn't the operating system
ass abilities because

355
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:18,710
what is a windows box is most of them
are updated automatically through

356
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:19,530
Windows Update

357
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:23,340
Microsoft Updates it even to the is in
the browser because

358
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:26,370
Firefox Chrome IE a pic

359
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:30,460
it's typically the plugins this here

360
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:34,040
this is the administrator from and
fullback

361
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:38,170
for these what the attacker sees victim
never sees but the attackers

362
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:42,680
you get real time statistics how many
victims have visited Web sites

363
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:46,470
where he's running black hole right now
real time statistics and analytics

364
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:50,700
where they are coming which country
operated which browser

365
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:55,160
and how many of them were infected this
system is very powerful

366
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,380
if you for example look at typical
statistics showing

367
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:01,830
and on this particular system arm

368
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:07,060
people 16,000 144 visitors

369
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:12,530
have become exploits eat because they
had an outdated version of John

370
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:15,650
then maybe two thousand more than home

371
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:19,680
because an outdated version of the Adobe
PDF Reader plugin

372
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,230
some own because they had an outdated
version of Flash and so on

373
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:26,790
but the speaker keeps repeating over and
over again its job

374
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:31,290
that's the problem let me be particle
about it's not just like self

375
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:34,840
its charmer plugin in the browser

376
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,240
which is the problem there's nothing
wrong with Java or job as a language

377
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,780
or Java aP's its D Juma app lets for
which

378
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:46,460
you need the plugging in your bro

379
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:49,700
I dropped job offer more of my
production systems two years ago

380
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:53,170
I haven't needed for any I recommend
this to anybody

381
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:57,040
some you can't do it because you have
some internet system or maybe some

382
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,430
online back or something which requires

383
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:03,230
then you might want to have a separate
browser for debt service only

384
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:06,410
and in your daily bras were you dropped
the block you

385
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:09,530
immediately redact your risk of getting
had

386
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:14,140
by something like black in men's but
there's something else I want to show my

387
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,230
black hole

388
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:18,560
arm if you look closer at the
administrator from 10

389
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,670
to get an idea of how popular

390
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:26,100
black hole isn't just how many hackers
have bought are using

391
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,010
black hole the best way to get
understanding of that is to pay

392
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:29,580
attention

393
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:32,880
what's at the top of the screen because
they have

394
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,120
banner acts act of two screens so these
are

395
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,870
shown admin interface which are only
seen by the criminals

396
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:44,530
so this you know criminals book are
using backhoe

397
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:49,450
but it's worth their wild actually wanna
network for criminal acts

398
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:54,510
to the administrators black hole
administrator pass

399
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:58,480
and the typical ads like your you're
selling hosting web hosting

400
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,530
in in Syria of placees:

401
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:05,890
or mass domain registrations switch you
can pay with

402
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:09,510
Liberty Reserve what money and paymer
all

403
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:13,400
money mechanisms for malware for traffic
an

404
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,970
the other things if you need what of
domains these guys are willing to sell

405
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:17,870
them to you

406
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:21,730
can you just believe that these guys one
them own ad networks just for criminals

407
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:28,480
banner ads for that's the way it works

408
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,760
and in black hole to which was released
month ago

409
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,910
on they paunch has now added new
features for example now separately text

410
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:36,900
mo bonior

411
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,950
if you browse to your website which has
the expert could running with

412
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:43,220
a with an iPhone with an Android phone
with a Nokia device

413
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:47,110
on you get put to a separate group they
don't much exports against my body

414
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:47,650
buddies

415
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:50,860
yet a good for example show wrote

416
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:54,970
at or something else about you they also
added support for Windows 8

417
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:58,650
and especially like how they even Andy
right icon

418
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:01,950
for Windows thats Windows 8 users

419
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:06,060
visited blackhole exploit kit

420
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:09,920
then we have the ransom Trojans so these
are trojans which will

421
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:14,530
take over the computer and demand
payment to continue to use the computer

422
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:19,050
many of these the most popular of these
right now claimed to be from the police

423
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:23,510
so your computer gets lockdown with the
message explaining that

424
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:27,730
this is the police we've seen that your
computer has been used to

425
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:31,250
store illegal mp3 songs

426
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:34,940
and coren the movies and you also seem
to have

427
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:39,980
child porn on your hard drive there some
terrorist motives found from your emails

428
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:44,940
now the police has blocked your system
you will have to pay a fine

429
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:49,460
fine is typically 100 euros or two
hundred dollars

430
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:52,680
and this message keeps changing where in
the world you are

431
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:56,020
right now these tool kit supports 15

432
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:59,590
different countries United States Canada
and

433
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:03,020
their 30 European countries with local
branding

434
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:06,520
with the name of the local police
translated local language

435
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,750
fairly well the amount of money these
guys are making

436
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:13,460
once again it significant we know
because we work with paysafecard

437
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:17,520
which the payment mechanism these guys
are actually moving money their services

438
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,590
I especially like a

439
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:24,430
counter measure

440
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:27,450
that paysafecard is now using to cut
down the

441
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:31,320
with the amount of money being sent to
these criminals right now if you go

442
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,840
many of the European country when you go
on hot Kolkata

443
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:38,320
kiosk and by paysafecard descent

444
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,750
the ransom for these guys the Pacsafe
card receipt

445
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:46,620
will automatically print text which said
if you bought this car

446
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:49,910
to pay for a fine for something

447
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:53,260
Thomas shown to you on your computer
don't

448
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:56,500
it's fake that's very effective because

449
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:00,120
that's the only way these guys actually
get the money victims will see the

450
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,500
warning when they go and buy the card to
pay them

451
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,810
of course people have no idea its it
wrote

452
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:13,810
I think it's really the police and isn't

453
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:17,800
the problem is sizable honey guys

454
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,600
release the very nice visualisation
called not good hunting and don't walk

455
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,320
just last week it's in the offer right
now but I suggest you take a look

456
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,460
I would have to show it to you live but
either the network here

457
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:32,450
doesn't support for some reason whites
downright but it as a very nice

458
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:35,550
live view of computers

459
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:39,150
which are or what it's all over the
world

460
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:43,380
arm this was released two days ago by
the researchers of University of

461
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,090
California San Diego

462
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:49,130
arm this is visualisation on how to sell
it the BOP

463
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:52,200
scant through the Internet harm

464
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,350
around 10 months ago they took four days
and they scan through the whole

465
00:28:56,350 --> 00:29:00,130
ipv4 address actually see the addressees

466
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:04,930
year's top corner going through are
every single IP address in the world and

467
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:06,710
you can see what the scanning

468
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:11,410
on is taking place it's taking place all
over the world

469
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:14,470
they were actually scanning for on seek

470
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:17,470
system so Voice over IP systems for

471
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:21,370
to be used for some exploit or somewhere
ability which have been found from

472
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:25,740
systems was quite remarkable to see
activities very active right now

473
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:30,190
to see here at the stop for three days
so much how the activity dies out

474
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:34,660
right about

475
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:39,120
just goes away just some slight
backscatter

476
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:45,510
for a while then three days later jumps
back up

477
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:51,200
another hour on visualization we reserve
the dining hall at I really like this

478
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,470
we this is real time data we actually
use all real time interface to see

479
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:58,940
where in the world we're stopping mahler
one of the guys in West

480
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:02,550
building the visualization parties just
thought it would be

481
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:06,330
look much nicer with these retro feel so
these 2012

482
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:09,700
this is real time data is a relief
effort in the world just

483
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:14,510
look like and then last week we released

484
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:17,550
a KML file or

485
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:21,210
the key nodes

486
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:25,130
of the zero access blocked receive my

487
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:28,730
Google Earth operational is operational

488
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:32,120
see actually move around

489
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:35,470
and all

490
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:39,750
all right let's try zooming in ago

491
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:42,990
so the red dots are not

492
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:46,630
computers infected by 0 axis

493
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:49,840
red-nosed Rd keynotes

494
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,110
older infected machines as well but you
can't think of a massive birds so they

495
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:55,470
controlled a peer to peer network

496
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:58,500
for the whole whole book these

497
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,930
is a large bore he sizable for

498
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:06,010
by any measure go

499
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:10,730
tried to model more

500
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:14,130
when you have more than one hundred
thousand of or a

501
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:18,160
key points Google it starts to slow down

502
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:22,060
even this for for laptop is

503
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:27,430
barely able to keep Nazi actually

504
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:31,390
see what's happening here in Kuala
Lumpur

505
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:35,790
I think we just too slow too slow

506
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:38,860
welcomed by the game a file from our

507
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:42,010
block from have secured Cox last weblog
and you can

508
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:49,010
look around it yourself there's plenty
of stuff happening right here

509
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,710
xeroxes is actually a good example on
just how big

510
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:56,760
these things can become

511
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,580
think historically what's what's the
biggest case BBC

512
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:03,890
biggest cases may be the biggest case
history wanna be in love letter

513
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:07,840
I love you in year 2000 which was a
massive

514
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:12,580
I email were and it was so successful
because at the time

515
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:15,940
people in real reno what was happening
stack

516
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:20,360
nobody was really good protection on the
estimates range but he definitely picked

517
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,250
the tens of millions maybe even fifty
million computer on the world

518
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:26,300
which is size on

519
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,559
Conficker from four years ago in fact
the

520
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:32,850
more than 10 million computers maybe
fifty million computers

521
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:36,070
arm flashback which was the massive

522
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:39,880
Mac with six outbreak earlier this year
infected around ha

523
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:43,210
million computers which comes on is
locked of course is much less axe

524
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:46,300
so percentage-wise must huge

525
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:50,900
arm storm worm infected somewhere in the
range of

526
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:55,360
five million computers maybe 0 access

527
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,470
is probably nine and its active right
now

528
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:02,750
so it's Conficker level almost to the
level of Conficker

529
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:06,290
in the amount of infectious so what's

530
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:10,390
xeroxes 10 axis

531
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:14,120
is once again commercial kit it's a

532
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:18,090
arm rootkit bundle being developed by

533
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:21,570
and sold by a guy called ring 0 or Ringo

534
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:25,330
and a here she's for sale at from

535
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:30,610
a rush informers listing different
features providing 24-hour support

536
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:34,410
arm very low level will in fact the NBR

537
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:37,590
of the computer when you put up an
infected Window System the very first

538
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:38,190
thing

539
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:41,660
executed on the computer is the mahler
milder than boredom

540
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:47,080
Windows stays alive through windows
putting up even 64 bit Windows 7

541
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,090
there now adding support for 64-bit
Windows 8

542
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:53,250
arm the guarantee on detectability

543
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:57,490
which we of course try to counteract but
they keep updating it

544
00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:03,490
arm they definitely are able to bypass
most would get detectors

545
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:07,100
and it comes with a user-friendly had
pack

546
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:10,770
that's a nice feature so these things
are really becoming

547
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:15,780
profession but even more interesting is
what's happening in Brazil right now

548
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:19,270
because these things will need to in
fact

549
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:22,460
your Windows computer to be able to

550
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:26,379
they come through the web but they will
need to be have some codes and binary

551
00:34:26,379 --> 00:34:28,000
code running on your Windows PC

552
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,190
with xeroxing access to be able to right
your boots

553
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:34,300
very low level stuff what was happening
in Brazil

554
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:38,450
earlier this year is quite remarkable
had a very large skin infection

555
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:42,119
around four maybe five million
infections which were not

556
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:46,470
infected Windows computers fortify
million devices

557
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:50,340
they were deists boxes this is

558
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:54,980
in many ways remarkable case because
people got infected through the web

559
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:58,630
they got infected through a cross-eyed

560
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:02,930
request forgery you go to an infected
website

561
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:07,210
hackman it runs couple of months HTML
which will

562
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:10,420
I think the settings of your DSL router

563
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:13,850
all diesel almost all these robbery gone
is the manufacturer

564
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:18,740
run in the 192 168 space more than in
192 168

565
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:25,180
11 and these Brazilian ISP's were using
the same Posterous and every single box

566
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:28,430
so by using cross-eyed request forgery
could actually go

567
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:33,640
from the website the settings of the
digital box change the settings

568
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:37,310
some of the Brazilian ISP's reported a
fifty percent of the customers

569
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:40,460
at are affected by this request forgery
must

570
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:44,340
actually very simple nothing special
needed they've changed the password

571
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:47,890
are of the DSL and they will change the

572
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:51,190
Scenics of the DSL box

573
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:55,180
they would change the primary DNS server
to a criminal DNS server which never

574
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:57,850
contradict themselves and the secondary
DNS ever

575
00:35:57,850 --> 00:36:01,150
28 it which is the Google dentist

576
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:04,630
if they're only in some dollar all-round
they would back

577
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:07,950
fall back to the regular data center
which would give mobile access

578
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:12,030
and their own data center bar serving
all the sites with the right eyepiece

579
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:15,820
except google.com google.com.br

580
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:19,520
present Google MSN Live dot com

581
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,590
our facebook dot com a couple others

582
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:25,800
and they will change their sites when
would go to Google Google

583
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,390
would prompt you did you have to install
Google defense

584
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:33,050
this new Google security system this
would be coming

585
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:36,190
the real good except it isn't the real
good because it's

586
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:39,290
being redirected to a different IP but
it looks like Google

587
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:43,180
and now we will prompt you to download
Google depends on the xy

588
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:48,780
if you're in facebook oren MSN something
else

589
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:52,160
and they could have used this to do what
lot of bad stuff this is what they were

590
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:52,770
doing

591
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:55,820
these are basically banking Trojans
targeting Brazilian backs

592
00:36:55,820 --> 00:37:00,310
by a quite remarkable attack what's
interesting here is that wants to be a

593
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:01,490
soapbox

594
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:04,830
in your house get infected now all the
DNS traffic is forged

595
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:09,360
not just for the Windows computer you
use the same diesel books with your

596
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,860
iPad it gets the same results used your
phone

597
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:16,140
to get the wrong results as well obvious
they won't be able to run to the exit

598
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:19,240
launched believe different attacks well
it's a phishing scams

599
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:22,340
which would have worked all of these
devices so this attack

600
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:29,340
13 Windows Pacific or it could have been
much more wide range

601
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:33,869
and this year is from the manual of farm

602
00:37:33,869 --> 00:37:37,580
XOOPS see actually have manual

603
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:41,260
right here so when you buy zoos the
banking Trojan

604
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:45,160
if comes with a manual which details on
how to use the banking Trojan

605
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:49,540
how to talk different banks how to run
the control panel the syntax of the

606
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:53,119
configuration file the macros arm

607
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:56,580
what kind of hardware requirements they
have how to install into maintaining how

608
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,060
to remotely manage it

609
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:02,330
I think is criminal banking Trojan is
better documented and most on the most

610
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:05,070
part

611
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:08,410
these guys have been very successful in
targeting backs

612
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:11,450
juice when open source or

613
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:14,700
source was leaked last year after which
we've seen tones

614
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,750
of different versions 25 yr like see the
no 1 ice

615
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:21,550
exxon dollars and then there's the
competition arm

616
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:26,190
the spy to which is would use a
compatible configuration file

617
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:30,350
it's very very tight competition between
different banking Trojans

618
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:33,360
the prices are banking Trojans also
arranged somewhere in the

619
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,970
one thousand dollars two thousand
dollars range by these

620
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:39,980
the way they make money is that when
people go

621
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:43,619
from infected Windows computers to do
online banking the the Trojan on their

622
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:44,420
computer

623
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:48,369
will insert extra transactions or change
the money amounts or

624
00:38:48,369 --> 00:38:52,980
account numbers when you pay bills

625
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:58,440
so what I do when I go and visit
customers

626
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,650
when I go to companies what I like to do

627
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:04,840
is that I I asked to them to show me
around

628
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:09,730
to walk around in your office Sean Iran
here's is manufacturing and here's

629
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:13,800
are all researchers on your design
department

630
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,330
ask okay show me who pays

631
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:21,660
the company's bills could you show me
the person who's in charge

632
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:24,990
of paying the bills of his comp

633
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:28,330
and they take me to a point always
corner room

634
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:31,980
to be on a high floor there's always the
same middle-aged woman

635
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:35,410
your she's the one paying the bills

636
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:39,119
if it's a small or medium companies 11
if it's an enterprise it's a roomful of

637
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:43,040
middle-aged the other ones paying the
bills and if it's a large company

638
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,700
the amount of money they move every
single day can be tens of thousands of

639
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,430
dollars

640
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:50,960
hundreds of thousand dollar for
enterprises they move millions

641
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,990
every month and the way

642
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:57,200
companies do online banking is not that
different from the way you

643
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,640
21 back they seek with the web browser
they are locked

644
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,530
into an online back type money figures
cops

645
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:07,550
they might have some extra features like
many banks for corporate banking they

646
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:08,340
have an extra

647
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:11,430
card reader or something like that it's
not like it would be

648
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:16,480
by passable but package completely
bypasses

649
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,890
so I talk to the lady always very nice

650
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:23,510
then I asking two questions: I ask her
to questions

651
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:26,830
question number one could you show me

652
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:31,990
the computer that you use to move money
around

653
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:36,609
she's a bit confused and then she
pointed the computer this

654
00:40:36,609 --> 00:40:40,050
like you and then I ask

655
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:43,310
roughly how much money movement could be
a hundred thousand dollars a month

656
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:46,640
could be two million what

657
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,780
then asked the last question could you
now show me

658
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:54,800
the computer that you use to go to
Facebook

659
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,000
and go to YouTube and to surf the web

660
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,210
and to retrieve good you know showed up

661
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:06,710
and now she's even more confused than
she point at the same computer

662
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:10,260
the almost immediately get my point

663
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:13,420
like in that actually

664
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:16,619
stupid idea I'm using his computer to
move millions

665
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:20,990
every month computers cost like 200 your
of

666
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:24,720
three hundred dollars baby it would be a
good idea

667
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:28,220
have a separate computer just paying the
bills

668
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:31,390
and then another computer for doing
everything else

669
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:34,480
but this time courses to mine unless re

670
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,150
pointed out life originally

671
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:41,950
pointed this out years ago completely
different scenario because we were

672
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:43,350
investigating a

673
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:48,260
break in very professional poker player
guy who plays poker for a living

674
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:52,780
around the world in the real world and
on online casino

675
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:55,850
he was hit by a Trojan and he lost

676
00:41:55,850 --> 00:42:00,200
hundreds of thousands of euros because
somebody stole the Trojans computer

677
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,000
which gave them

678
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,890
this creature feature good just to get
screech of the screen to see these carts

679
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:09,480
if you're playing poker and I know you
cards I'm going to win

680
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:13,190
so this guy lost hundreds of thousands
of euros because is and the advice I

681
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:13,900
gave

682
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:17,109
exactly the same like cop more you

683
00:42:17,109 --> 00:42:20,359
our professional this laptop is your
professional

684
00:42:20,359 --> 00:42:23,740
to like when you don't

685
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:28,200
used to play poker you close it down and
you put it into a state

686
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:32,170
and then you have a separate computer
for doing everything else

687
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:36,070
and he was a million beasley afford to
buy two or three or five computers

688
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:39,220
yet he was using this one computer to
surf the web

689
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:43,340
look at videos and play poker with
millions

690
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:47,530
so many cases really isn't more
complicated

691
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:54,530
we aren't getting even these

692
00:42:55,609 --> 00:43:01,220
so what about these guys who are not
doing their attacks to make money

693
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:04,720
ho movements like animus

694
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,380
it's much harder for people on the
street understand these cuts because

695
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:08,380
they are trying to make money

696
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:12,460
monies easy money to understand these
guys take big risks

697
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:16,890
risk getting jailed or or getting taken
da

698
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:20,890
yes there's no immediate reward for
themselves

699
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:25,160
state typically high for a higher cost
higher-cost the see themselves

700
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:29,790
they have a protest or a political

701
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:33,340
some of these guys get caught arm the
biggest

702
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:38,300
catch so far has been subtle or an
animal some

703
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:42,760
who was arrested by US officials and
turn into a snitch

704
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:48,859
or turned into a an informant for the US
government

705
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:52,080
very active in down times on the ground
for several months while he was working

706
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:55,580
for the FBI

707
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:59,680
let me just give you an example how
companies make themselves

708
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:04,250
talk I have yet two guys so you might
know these guys

709
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:08,369
this is george talks known also as Gil
job

710
00:44:08,369 --> 00:44:11,420
and a this is stop

711
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:16,480
Nicholas Allegro known also as coax

712
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,630
they're both programmers they both had
the same problem they both wanted to run

713
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:23,140
their own programs on their own devices

714
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:26,300
do wanted to run his own program on his
own

715
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:30,480
Sony Playstation 3 but you can't do that
because I can only run the programs you

716
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,640
buy from the shop

717
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:34,859
which have been approved by some

718
00:44:34,859 --> 00:44:39,700
so he broke the security system of its
PlayStation 3 I rooted

719
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:42,930
now anybody could run any programs
wanted on their Playstations and Sony

720
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:43,869
didn't like this

721
00:44:43,869 --> 00:44:48,359
so what gets onto Sony suit

722
00:44:48,359 --> 00:44:52,220
these created a massive protest campaign

723
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:55,340
and Sony became talk

724
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:58,480
seems bent on has been hacked more than
30 times

725
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,359
including the Sony PlayStation Network
breach which which one of the largest

726
00:45:02,359 --> 00:45:02,930
data breaches

727
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:06,840
history

728
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:11,020
so what about the cost I'll he wanted to
his own programs as well he wanted one

729
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:12,200
is programs

730
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:15,560
on his phone I've so he created

731
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:21,720
jailbreak apple sold a couple didn't
like it wanted Apple do

732
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:26,450
day did not sOooo Nicholas

733
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:30,480
they hired is not working

734
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,280
good new right nobody angry

735
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:37,450
he's probably in a great position within
Apple to

736
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:41,859
no improve the overall security of the
system his skills

737
00:45:41,859 --> 00:45:46,460
and Apple has never been targeted by
attacks like sony has been tied

738
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:50,530
don't get me wrong I'm not really trying
to defend

739
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:53,830
these guys in any way it's obvious what
they're doing this

740
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:57,790
is criminal when I'm just saying is the
organizations which become

741
00:45:57,790 --> 00:46:02,280
targets what of attacks like these many
ways

742
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:05,369
they make themselves talk they could
have no

743
00:46:05,369 --> 00:46:09,109
beforehand what we're doing right now
will make us talk

744
00:46:09,109 --> 00:46:12,770
many companies can minimize this level
of risk by just thinking it through

745
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:13,400
before

746
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:19,530
taking actions

747
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:22,750
so what about governmental attacks
attacks which are not coming from

748
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:23,600
criminals

749
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:28,400
which are not coming from activists
governments themselves

750
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,850
attacks like what the German government
has been doing a good against them own

751
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:32,660
people

752
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:36,350
against their own citizens Wednesday hi
your

753
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:41,570
Trojan orders and backdoor creators to
work for the government

754
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:44,930
the right Trojans which they then used
to infect them

755
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:50,770
all citizens during criminal
investigations

756
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:54,830
now I don't see any problem with this
ass long

757
00:46:54,830 --> 00:47:00,220
asked the suspect turns out to be killed

758
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:04,800
but if the suspect turns out to be in
this

759
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:09,260
this is a horrible breach of security
and confidentiality

760
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:15,320
I'm not really sure if we really want
our government doing this to us

761
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:18,869
and is also brings us to the next
question which is whatcha on the barge

762
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:20,030
companies do

763
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:23,200
by attacks like these when and its
government

764
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,810
when it's the police using the truth

765
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:30,590
should on the barge companies look away
and allow them

766
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:34,490
those Trojans to rock so the police can
use because under barges to take them

767
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:38,580
the police can used

768
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:41,680
hell no we should we should try to
detect

769
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:45,280
and that's what we do we've never

770
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:49,560
been approached by never law enforcement
agency asking not detected Trojans

771
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:53,080
if they do we won't comply we will

772
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:56,390
the controlled because we believe this
is what our customers want

773
00:47:56,390 --> 00:47:59,570
our customers come to us

774
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:03,349
we would give them option here on the
bars which dicks everything we know

775
00:48:03,349 --> 00:48:06,290
and even on the virus which the
everything we know except the police

776
00:48:06,290 --> 00:48:07,119
Trojans

777
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:13,349
which one would you like to buy

778
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:17,090
then we have the attacks like APT's

779
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:20,140
which are typically used for espionage
purposes

780
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:23,670
of Casey's by governments targeting
other governmental

781
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:26,680
targeting private sector in other
countries

782
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:31,770
targeting defense contractors and
they're almost always launched we've

783
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:34,859
will be trucked emails in spoofed email

784
00:48:34,859 --> 00:48:39,369
messages look like real messages contain
realistic-looking document files

785
00:48:39,369 --> 00:48:43,490
like these these are all examples

786
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:46,720
booby-trapped files work Excel

787
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:50,020
PowerPoint and PDF files when you open
these files

788
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:53,440
you get home hook real act real

789
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:56,720
pecans and exploit which brought back
door by the time

790
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,950
you have these on your screen you have
already a backdoor

791
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:03,180
on your system backdoor connecting back
to the attackers

792
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:10,180
they gain access to whatever you have on
your computer and in your local area

793
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,930
and then we have the real

794
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:20,950
military action again

795
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:25,920
no cyberwar here yet but it's quite
clear that what stocks that started in

796
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,280
2009

797
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:31,990
is an arms race all the other
governments which have any capability

798
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:36,849
are now busy building them own
capability to build

799
00:49:36,849 --> 00:49:40,630
cyber or fancy attacks not defensive

800
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:45,230
offensive

801
00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:48,690
so the atom energy arm

802
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:52,630
scientists or nuclear scientists

803
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:56,550
well it's pretty clear they lost their
innocence in 1945

804
00:49:56,550 --> 00:50:01,599
what we started using nuclear weapons
exactly the same way

805
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:05,130
computer scientists lost their innocence
2009

806
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:08,440
started using stocks

807
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:15,440
I think that's how big a change it will
be seen history books

808
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:20,820
so back to iraq back to ac/dc

809
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:24,420
thunderstruck the Atomic Energy
organization of

810
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:27,550
iraq interesting when you go to Google
Maps you for example look at the bush

811
00:50:27,550 --> 00:50:28,070
where

812
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:32,830
nuclear power plant Google Maps labels
like your speak

813
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:36,250
ventilation chimney is the solid waste
building

814
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:40,760
electrical building turbine building
emergency feed water bill what the hell

815
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:41,930
how Google perhaps

816
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:45,869
have this information but they do I to
put the special guest

817
00:50:45,869 --> 00:50:49,310
arm looking at some of the

818
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:53,450
research material at some energy organza
iran is putting out

819
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:59,619
they actually have pretty expensive
nuclear research capability and I was

820
00:50:59,619 --> 00:51:03,140
actually interested to find from the
website of data manager organism Iran

821
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:04,110
they have actually a

822
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:08,100
statement official statement which says
arm

823
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:12,130
somewhere around here it says because it
but it secure

824
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:15,840
and they say that these claims given by
Nick Cooper

825
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:19,400
about thunderstruck playing in their
computers is patently false

826
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,420
this hasn't happened they deny any any

827
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:27,100
acknowledgement of anything like this
ever happen like I said we don't know

828
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:31,980
but it is interesting that when we look
at the latest

829
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:36,770
milem where which has been used by the
United States and Israel against

830
00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:41,380
Iran some other Middle Eastern countries
because we have stocks met flame

831
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:45,050
do gots dollars was found three months
ago

832
00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:48,840
Gulf doesn't try to explode Center

833
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:52,820
so anything like that it's just an
information gathering tool and encrypts

834
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:53,840
the network traffic

835
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:57,210
when it is sending out from the computer
and encryption is in very

836
00:51:57,210 --> 00:52:00,330
strong it's actually a sixteen-bit

837
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:04,109
X and on you it uses for the encryption

838
00:52:04,109 --> 00:52:10,940
is ac/dc and it could be a coincidence

839
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:15,930
texaco to look at it that's what it is

840
00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:22,930
saw

841
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:31,540
we have a hard time detecting

842
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:35,150
bomber like flea flame

843
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:38,410
which spoof the windows

844
00:52:38,410 --> 00:52:42,760
updates mechanism which arm

845
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:48,480
created a down md5 hash collision

846
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:52,500
so that the binary it's sending through
this proved

847
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:57,060
windows update mechanism would be
accepted by other computers in the same

848
00:52:57,060 --> 00:53:00,840
local air in it scooping in defiance

849
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:04,550
it's doable isn't easy the way they
spoofed

850
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:07,720
24 trash lucien was completely new
completely normal

851
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:11,420
if you look up reap the cryptographer

852
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:14,640
mailing list they're all really excited
about this new discovery

853
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,980
somebody came up is completely new and
novel way of forging

854
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:21,870
md5 harsh conditions and his world-class
research

855
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:24,970
somebody would have used supercomputer
to do this

856
00:53:24,970 --> 00:53:30,650
and its own obvious that the really
aren't very many places on this planet

857
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:34,560
which have supercomputers and
world-class crypto research

858
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:40,070
and it must have been weird inside
Microsoft

859
00:53:40,070 --> 00:53:44,080
when they realize that this has happened
when they realized

860
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:50,500
that somebody ass broken the security of
their most important

861
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:54,210
Microsoft updates which is used

862
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:57,370
and relied upon by $900 million

863
00:53:57,370 --> 00:54:00,830
paying Mike of customers all get their
updates from

864
00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:05,740
all trust but these updates are secure
somebody broken that security and

865
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:06,230
somebody

866
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:09,940
had misused their certificate so they
had

867
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:15,040
actually had to revoke one of the
Microsoft group etc and when they

868
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,950
realized actually done

869
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:21,980
against them by their own government
that must have been

870
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:27,690
we now we missed flame

871
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:31,600
we missed stocks that we missed calls we
mistook we missed all of them for a year

872
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:32,540
or two

873
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:35,710
not just week but the golan interest

874
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:40,240
on the barge industry often get a bad
rap

875
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:43,380
around other executing make people think
that we are somehow

876
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:47,870
it's not that hard to build under haha
could be to stop is parked car

877
00:54:47,870 --> 00:54:52,300
well let me tell you it's hard many of
the best

878
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:55,680
mines all security should I know work

879
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:59,510
100 this is one of the toughest
challenges we

880
00:54:59,510 --> 00:55:04,840
it really is ease yet we keep failing

881
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:07,960
I was in a customer meeting

882
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:13,540
in Austria in July right after I wrote a
column for the wired magazine about how

883
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:14,440
we failed

884
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:18,450
to block flame I knew that our customers
would be asking the tough questions

885
00:55:18,450 --> 00:55:22,640
about so I explain to them why

886
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:28,240
when this plane I expanded by showing
two-thirds the first photo is this

887
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:31,240
his trademark

888
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:36,930
most likely summer in South America
stops cars on the road with a gun

889
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:40,550
steals the 150 passengers hers is
leaving like

890
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:45,080
he doesn't care who the target is as
long as he gets

891
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:48,330
wats and the cyber equivalent of him

892
00:55:48,330 --> 00:55:52,360
is juice spy

893
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:57,140
0 access credit card key loggers banking
Trojans runs Android

894
00:55:57,140 --> 00:56:01,650
money-making attacks somebody wants to
steal your credit card number for the

895
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:02,680
key lower locker

896
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:07,110
he doesn't care if you're from Malaysia
or if you're from Singapore

897
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:10,200
or if you're from Australia doesn't
matter as long as he gets the credit

898
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,910
card we targets everybody any

899
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:14,930
and we can handle these

900
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:19,080
this is what we can flame

901
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:23,520
and stocks are not like this claim in
Stockton not

902
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:30,520
like this flame stocks are like this
James Bond

903
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:37,030
we fix unlimited budget on limited
budget no budget weepy

904
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:41,780
greatest technology greatest and latest
technology in the world with

905
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:46,830
on limited resources and if James Bond

906
00:56:46,830 --> 00:56:51,540
wants to kill you James Bond will kill
you

907
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:55,530
right it doesn't matter if you run and
hide people find you

908
00:56:55,530 --> 00:56:58,780
it doesn't matter if you have a helmet
and a bulletproof West will kill you

909
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:04,480
when

910
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,940
so trying to defend against governmental
level attackers

911
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:11,710
just like trying to defend against

912
00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:15,990
very hard and I'm not saying we've given
up we have I'm saying sorry

913
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:20,120
it's very easy to

914
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:25,430
but the good news is the James Bond
doesn't wanna kill you right

915
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:29,460
he wants to kill the ones who have done
something to be said

916
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:33,240
flame stocks and don't want to infect
you

917
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:36,690
that's the good part of the story

918
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:43,690
with that thank you very much

919
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:01,950
this

920
00:58:01,950 --> 00:58:08,950
school
