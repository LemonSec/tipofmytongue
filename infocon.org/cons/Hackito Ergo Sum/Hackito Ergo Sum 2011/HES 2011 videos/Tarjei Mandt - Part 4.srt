00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,540
structure or other that now

65
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,130
ueberroth writer energy what about

66
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:09,520
that structure here

67
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,380
captors for call them

68
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,489
will be min

69
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:17,920

72
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,080
some reason I'm so years

73
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,470
no room

74
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:36,050
for way unfortunately

75
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:39,229
old

76
00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:42,970
them you know that actually for Windows
8

77
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,160

78
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,690
their legal everywhere

79
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:51,470
upgrade

80
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:56,410
said

81
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:57,150
cases

82
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:00,440
so I wouldn't someone we vulnerabilities

83
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,370

00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,330
will that you never go wrong with these
both were

87
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:19,449
less the old I think much of the rare

88
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:23,580
