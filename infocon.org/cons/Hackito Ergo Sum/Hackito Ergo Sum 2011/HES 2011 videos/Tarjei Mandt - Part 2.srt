long

170
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:55,750
who every time because that you know if
there's a lot of time

171
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,829
year your life every time

172
00:10:58,829 --> 00:11:01,910
so whenever you have more

173
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:05,399
or around 500 fell he was rather regime

174
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:09,440
using this optimization so pretty much
everyone

175
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,949
we have maybe I'm

176
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:17,069
and what this does is that it hands shop

177
00:11:17,069 --> 00:11:20,579
previous and if there's very few

178
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:24,199
is on that list no prizes over chance it
won't go

179
00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:27,850
lashkar-e-islam the pools better

180
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:31,660
that of a lot of

181
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,660
lucky me on of

182
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,829
there's a lot more efficient went on the
attack

183
00:11:38,829 --> 00:11:44,449
is really songs on that's pretty far
less because they're changing their own

184
00:11:44,449 --> 00:11:48,050
similar with while not being used

185
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:51,839
so you manage overflow into one of the
entries on route as well as the

186
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:52,730
basically

187
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:55,910
you know K which 10 yes

188
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:59,209
I'm with you know

189
00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:03,790
for yeah

190
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:08,370
reported good for people I

191
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:11,569
it's pretty much the same as the
previous good

192
00:12:11,569 --> 00:12:14,649
have them that race

193
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:18,550
these from Memphis writers its

194
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:21,360
okay for example

195
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,720
call people

196
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,730
yeah

197
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,339
so

198
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:33,370
this is the last line in the finals I
don't think anybody

199
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:34,970
home

200
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:38,160
ok

201
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,540
I'm so

202
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:45,090
this one is mudguard

203
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:48,400
I'm understand that where it's really
important

204
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,260
said is for them

205
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:55,390
yet little you
