00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:13,000
hand no me not we yeah

115
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,790
that will be there and through the more
reliable

116
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:21,190
because you already work with the
network layer informed written you know

117
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,980
their will be provided with

118
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:31,980
the there there are some ways whose you
to the moon

119
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:35,530
another way to resolve this issue this
movie

120
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:38,800
fact that for you possibilities you have

121
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,010
you do that leverage written by pyridine

122
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:46,750
at today no without their you want

123
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,330
run my nor you right by the

124
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:54,670
however birth and I that I visionary

125

I workers are all Kaiser

126
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:03,430
the future if we have more just worrying
that you would you identify Hernandez

127
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:10,160
nor not be through Jan grover

128
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,090
always capture I would be to use the
mower

129
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:18,010
the your reaction would be dead which
had all these days I'll

130
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:21,760
your yeah 3 3 is a greater

131
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:26,050
usual I'm sure other you don't know

134
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:36,319
I preparation the repeater

135
00:08:36,319 --> 00:08:39,969
a you know that will matter and bases

136
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:44,660
with a we've gotten I'm this way urine
