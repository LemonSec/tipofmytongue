1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,060
bit faster life preservers

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,629
a ride yes that's really important to
know is

3
00:00:07,629 --> 00:00:10,980
1 you know anyway worth

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,070
so

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,800
I was the internal and

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:24,800
period

7
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:29,029
flow of the attack I'll

8
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:32,730
in my eyes trusted traditional recent
attacks that were

9
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:37,370
mom that may be the only problem is that
Greece

10
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,550
this is what this is the attack before

11
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:44,620
said and the other ones are the ones
that I came up with

12
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,660

00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:37,750
so it is however

73
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,540
through below the first John

77
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:55,220
it with an upgrade be on

78
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:59,090
planners that you provided at

79
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,380
true there is actually a copy

80
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,850
that entries ily with you went back to
the

81
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:10,260
and restructured so you know you know
that you can access

82
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:14,440
now Sophie everywhere be replacing the
thing

83
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,570
have your yeah location they said he
would actually use a hair

84
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,850
would be appreciated rock

85
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:27,990
and that his you know you leave with you

86

so 30 essentially they fail to

91
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,490
validated

92
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,600
so in this case you know you can see
that

93
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,639
revealed to you right yes

94
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:59,470

this from give can actually on

102
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,560
usually also you know chain

103
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,680
these scared

104
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,220
