26
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,299
but it became really today not to change
the voltage ok like the

27
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:42,259
now then holding company I wouldn't call
him

28
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:45,310
that allow use of the use another

29
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:49,450

31
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:57,290
headline or who tried to extend the
period in 2010

32
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:01,770
but the whole thing can go on the other
side you can increase the voltage

33
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,079
sometimes you can increase it we do much
you have that bit

34
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,149
in food burned thing would

thumb well food Sikkim

37
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,470
function feel increasing the voltage

38
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:23,160
will visit here is the and as a result
more Mb

39
