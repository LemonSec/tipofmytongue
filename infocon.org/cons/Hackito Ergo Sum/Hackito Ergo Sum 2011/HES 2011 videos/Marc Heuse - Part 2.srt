59
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:41,159
now if there's a second row from the

60
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:44,459
I want different never been on death row

61
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:48,049

what would happen I'm noses with Saif

67
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,000
while different network on wonderful on
this

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,409
very very unlikely though I don't
believe that

69
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:17,820
and everybody's should do on this

70
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:23,509
your pricing surprise but it's your call
this course are you confused by all this

71
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:27,070
you know service and then oil industry

72
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:30,280
and it goes out as well or he might
Windows

73
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,860
Microsoft that that mean any any Windows
version which I

74
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:39,570
using active goes down yeah no know what
follows is a bit what he said

75
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:43,889
10 presented presented around
consumption

76
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:47,330
or reviews he thought have that

77
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:51,050
breakthroughs I gone I'm move

78
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:54,250

133
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,870
fuck how is it possible to identify

134
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:31,390
both well comfortable range of course

135
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:34,390
all by for you way are number

136
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:38,290
you everything that we have therapy
networks or whatever

137
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:42,360
out doesn't get enough arab boycott

138
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,800
anymore because what the CAF and Israel

139
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,870
way any I'm weekend search engine data
is

140
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:54,730
only hope so much honey who both the
whole network

141
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:58,280
if these people like that happen

142
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:04,030
not so lucky but some will be back about
girl you might find yourself

143
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:08,030
you everyone through the air I'm you
might fun stuff

144
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:11,730
US actually because I music through are
all

145
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:15,890
so you don't want to write down every
time wall

146
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:20,500
so you will yeah and

147
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,600
people use common address fury

148
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,780
that theory which with I 52

149
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:31,310
second is really hey from Bondi

150
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:35,030
3 action parties harmful and I know

151
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:38,340
new what the percentage of after someone
will probably be

152
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:42,100
fun pay per cent of 50 percent whatever

153
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,100
and that's why I mean something the on

154
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,190
breadth I'm I hope my

155
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:51,500
yeah I'm there might be some okay

156
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,500
