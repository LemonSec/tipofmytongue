1
00:00:02,959 --> 00:00:08,880
thank you very much I'm really excited

2
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:13,500
to be able to present present my topic

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:16,470
here today so my name is Antoine I work

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,390
at switch which is the national research

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:21,119
dedication network of Switzerland but I

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:26,279
I'll tell you about more of switch right

7
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:29,820
afterward here's the agenda so intro to

8
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:31,920
switch I want to give you a super fast

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,190
intro to blockchain proof of work in

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:41,820
cryptocurrencies so that you can

11
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:44,760
understand why those this is even a

12
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,640
problem web crypto mining then well

13
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:50,670
we'll get to the topic of mining in the

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:54,960
browser with JavaScript and then since

15
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:58,260
switch is also the dot CH registry we

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,090
can we have an overview of all the dots

17
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:04,319
each domain so I did a little research

18
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:06,479
on all websites running on dot CH and

19
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:10,589
who is affected by a web crypto minor

20
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,840
and in the end I want to show you and

21
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:16,320
tell you about what switch is doing

22
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:20,460
about that so for the first part the

23
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:23,939
introduction to switch switch is a

24
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:27,389
foundation which was created about 30

25
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:28,889
years ago and is closely related to the

26
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:37,009
history of the internet in Switzerland

27
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:40,920
so in May - May 1987 professor Plattner

28
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:46,110
submitted a request to Ayana to kind of

29
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:49,079
register the dot CH TLD which he did by

30
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:52,079
sending an email and they told him well

31
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:56,250
yeah here you are we are we resisted dot

32
00:01:52,079 --> 00:02:00,089
CH well they actually just put the CH in

33
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:03,450
a zone file and Charlie after in October

34
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:05,610
1987 the foundation was created and he

35
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:10,848
was managing their director so he and he

36
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:18,200
handed over the dot CH to the foundation

37
00:02:10,848 --> 00:02:20,250
this is here why was switch created

38
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:24,030
here's an excerpt from the dita

39
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:25,860
foundation in october 1987 so the

40
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:28,950
objective of the foundation is to

41
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:31,620
promote modern methods of telecommuting

42
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:33,839
which is a pretty old-fashioned word but

43
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:38,549
for the 80s it's okay

44
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:40,799
we would say maybe IT nowadays in so

45
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:42,810
promote telecommuting teaching and

46
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:46,920
research in Switzerland so the idea was

47
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:48,989
you have we nowadays we have about sixty

48
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,790
eight universities at different levels

49
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:54,269
so you have the federal Institutes of

50
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:58,620
Technology you have the universities on

51
00:02:54,269 --> 00:03:00,720
Cantone level then you have universities

52
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,060
of Applied Sciences you have some

53
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,750
private universities and so on and all

54
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:11,909
of these organizations had the same

55
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:16,019
requirements to be able to exchange data

56
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:19,399
between one another and instead of doing

57
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:24,810
them that all by themselves they decided

58
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:29,579
with the support of the of the

59
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:32,730
Federation to pool resources together

60
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:35,879
and to create switch which is the goal

61
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:40,310
of the foundation it's nonprofit

62
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:44,519
foundation and we we don't have any

63
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:45,900
profits strategies which is kind of nice

64
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:50,639
for a change

65
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:56,489
when working at switch ok so back in the

66
00:03:50,639 --> 00:04:00,239
timeline when two years later the switch

67
00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:02,760
LAN was created and what is switch LAN

68
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,949
it's actually the backbone and it was

69
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,888
the first IP based backbone in

70
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:10,530
Switzerland this is the map of the

71
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:12,720
backbone nowadays if if you look back in

72
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:14,940
history the first link was between the

73
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,970
two Institutes of technology one in

74
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:22,289
Zurich and the other one in in Lausanne

75
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:24,130
with speed of 128 kilobits per seconds

76
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:28,960
nowadays we have

77
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:32,020
gigabit routers and you see we we try to

78
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:35,640
have most of the path in a redundant way

79
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:40,359
so that every organization has good

80
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:44,140
connection to internally between one

81
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:46,780
another but also to other networks like

82
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:50,159
Jian which is also the research and

83
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:57,789
education network on European level and

84
00:04:50,160 --> 00:05:01,210
also commercial ISPs and so on okay so

85
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:05,700
this was actually the first version of

86
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:08,500
the internet in Switzerland then in

87
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:12,070
1990s which becomes the registry for ch

88
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:14,200
so with the internet when you have IP

89
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:15,790
you also need to resolve domain names

90
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,500
because otherwise this kind of lack of

91
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:23,890
pain if you need to remember all those

92
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:29,440
IP addresses so it was pretty gnarly

93
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:32,860
goons pretty evident that switch would

94
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:38,040
also operate the DNS infrastructure for

95
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:44,580
the developing Internet at that time

96
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:48,160
then during the early nineties we

97
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:52,510
noticed that security network security

98
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:54,490
is an issue so is that the on an

99
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:57,039
international level

100
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:58,840
the first cert organization so computer

101
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:05,770
emergency response teams were created

102
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:10,000
and I think switch started a team in

103
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:15,150
already in 1992 but in in 1996 it got

104
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:20,460
its cert certification and from then on

105
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:24,099
switch has been really involved in

106
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:26,020
matters of incident response for the

107
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:28,240
network for the university network but

108
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:30,340
also for other network operators in

109
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,660
Switzerland and it was actually the

110
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:40,310
first cert in Switzerland

111
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:43,260
next in 2002 the operation of the dot CH

112
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:46,290
went in the responsibility of the office

113
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:48,000
of communication so the Federation said

114
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:49,350
okay this internet thing is getting

115
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,190
bigger and bigger I think we need to

116
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:53,640
regulate that

117
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:56,910
so they took responsibility of dots eh

118
00:06:53,640 --> 00:07:03,180
but mandated switch to still operate the

119
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:05,520
registry and in 2010 we had the

120
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:08,430
ordinance on internet domains which is

121
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:12,330
relevant for fighting cybercrime which

122
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:17,000
tells you how to deal with domains and

123
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:19,550
then later on how to fight cybercrime

124
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:24,960
okay the last slide on the introduction

125
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:27,480
who are our customers primarily the

126
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,030
Swiss universities in the academic

127
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:32,220
sector and other research institutions

128
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:34,979
then you have an extended community of

129
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:37,590
organisation which are also involved in

130
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:40,020
research and education like research

131
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:42,840
facilities libraries and so on but we

132
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:45,900
also serve commercial customers so on

133
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:49,440
the registry level we have actually

134
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:51,950
anyone who has dot 0 dot Li domain is

135
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,510
indirectly customer of us but our

136
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:58,380
primary point of contact are the

137
00:07:54,510 --> 00:08:00,480
registrar's then you have Swiss

138
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:04,530
financial institutions to which we also

139
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:06,300
offer assert services and everybody in

140
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:12,659
the research related industry in

141
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:15,350
government areas ok so let's go on with

142
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:19,260
the intro to blockchain and

143
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:22,950
cryptocurrency and so on why do we even

144
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:28,020
need a blockchain because it's pretty

145
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:30,719
hip and I if you read like IT News it

146
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,349
seems that blockchain is a solution for

147
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,260
every problem

148
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:36,270
but what problem are we really wanting

149
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:40,500
to solve with the blockchain is you want

150
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:45,560
to have a decentralized database with

151
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:48,680
entries and and data

152
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:51,290
that we can all agree on so we want to

153
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:55,459
have a consensus of the content of the

154
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:58,969
database and we want to make sure that

155
00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:02,000
nobody can change those contents

156
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:06,830
afterwards and manipulate them so how is

157
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:11,990
this done so obviously I had to draw a

158
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:13,880
blockchain and if we have all those

159
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:16,190
blocks that are chained together and I

160
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:19,520
want to add a new one so let's look at

161
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:22,279
block number 17 so you'll have the

162
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,600
payload the data and in the special case

163
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:25,939
of crypto currencies

164
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,700
you're going to have transactions so if

165
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:31,310
we look at the transactions

166
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:33,320
Eve gives $100 to capture thirty five

167
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:38,150
dollars from Andrea's to Danielle and

168
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:39,890
then dobin is very nice he gives me 1

169
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:42,260
million eight hundred fifty thousand

170
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:45,500
four hundred and eighty dollars thanks

171
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:47,930
Dubin where are you and this is what

172
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:50,510
Dobin would like to prevent he sees

173
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:54,729
that's obviously not him that did that

174
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:59,390
so he wants to prevent anybody of

175
00:09:54,730 --> 00:10:02,300
inserting rogue transaction so how's the

176
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:05,150
training done is when you when you take

177
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:10,760
the blocks you're going to represent

178
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:13,459
them as hashes and the red arrows on the

179
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:16,370
slide are represented by the hash of the

180
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:19,370
previous blocks you're going to refer to

181
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:24,080
the previous block so the new block will

182
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:28,910
based upon the previous block and if you

183
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:34,010
assume that block number 17 is it's a

184
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:38,390
correct block then if you go back in the

185
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:40,760
chain then you can make sure that all

186
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:45,199
other blocks also that the whole

187
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:47,990
integrity is as valid next what you also

188
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,959
have in a block is random number called

189
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:54,020
the nonce which we will see just

190
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,349
afterward why it is used but then you

191
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,030
have the hash of

192
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:59,640
the actual block and the hash of the

193
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:03,329
actual block will protect the block and

194
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:06,660
is actually pretty difficult to compute

195
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:08,520
but very easy to validate so all

196
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:12,180
consumers of the blockchain that can

197
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:15,300
very quickly figure out okay this block

198
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:17,489
is good because the hash corresponds to

199
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,349
the content of the block and you can do

200
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:22,530
that recursively with it every previous

201
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:26,520
block but actually to come up with this

202
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:29,459
hash is rather a hard task and you want

203
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:31,500
to give an incentive to people to mine

204
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,830
the block to find the right hash to do

205
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,470
it

206
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:37,050
because you're going to give them a

207
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:39,780
reward in the corresponding

208
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:41,579
cryptocurrency so to understand how

209
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:43,680
mining is done we first need to talk

210
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:47,790
about crypto hack cryptographic hash

211
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:51,660
functions so say you have a string and

212
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:53,310
you want to hash it you're you you're

213
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:56,520
going to put it through a hash function

214
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:59,699
like sha-1 which is maybe not the most

215
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:03,180
secure one but it's just for the example

216
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:06,630
what you get as an output is a string or

217
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:09,660
a binary blob of a fixed length in this

218
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:12,600
case 160 bits but you could have applied

219
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:14,640
exactly the same function on any data of

220
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,520
any size so here for instance the

221
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:20,699
blu-ray disk of hackers you would get

222
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:23,699
this hash which differs from the first

223
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:27,210
one because it's not the same input and

224
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:29,100
if I were to change only one bit in the

225
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:30,930
blu-ray disk the hash would look

226
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:35,850
entirely different it would look like

227
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:39,750
totally randomly different so the idea

228
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:42,810
for an attacker is to find an input X

229
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:45,360
that would actually match to the same

230
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:47,760
output as the hackers blu-ray disc and

231
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:53,610
this should be computationally

232
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:55,980
infeasible but what we're using in the

233
00:12:53,610 --> 00:13:01,140
blockchain is exactly this property that

234
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:04,290
we want to have a specific hash as a

235
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:06,240
result but not a specific hash in itself

236
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:07,449
but a specific property of the hash so

237
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,060
actually

238
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:13,090
we're asking the miners to do is to come

239
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:17,650
up with a hash that will have a certain

240
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:23,020
prefix of zeros and the rest the green

241
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:25,060
part is as whatever you want so this is

242
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:28,390
how you model the difficulty in the

243
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:31,089
mining part and the difficulty can adapt

244
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:32,949
over time because you require them to

245
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:34,870
have more zeros at the beginning so if

246
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:36,490
you start with a very easy mining

247
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:39,670
algorithm where we say okay the first

248
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:41,710
year of your hash should be should be

249
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:44,729
the first bit of your hash should be a

250
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:47,200
zero then you have a 50/50 chance to to

251
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:50,010
satisfy this requirement but if you say

252
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:55,060
you want to have the first 90 bits of

253
00:13:50,010 --> 00:14:02,800
the hash all of zeros then it gets

254
00:13:55,060 --> 00:14:05,969
exponentially harder so now let's get

255
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:09,250
back to the nonce I mentioned previously

256
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:12,250
you can think of it as a lottery ticket

257
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:14,110
but unlike the real lottery you don't

258
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:16,030
need to buy tickets you can have as many

259
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:20,080
of you want you just need to choose your

260
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:23,620
announced randomly and actually the

261
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:25,840
lottery numbers are chosen well you know

262
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,910
you you have a time window of about two

263
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:33,550
to ten minutes depending on the crypto

264
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:36,520
system blockchain system and you need to

265
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:39,010
find a nonce which will satisfy the

266
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:41,530
requirement of the number of zeros and

267
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:44,740
the prefix of the resulting hash like

268
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:49,480
this and the first person to come up

269
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:51,700
with the result gets the reward and can

270
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,580
insert well you can insert the new block

271
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,990
in the blockchain and everybody

272
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:58,800
validates it that the block propagates

273
00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:02,200
and everybody accepts this as a new

274
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:06,189
block in the blockchain so obviously not

275
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:08,440
everyone can do that just like that you

276
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:13,300
need to have certain competition and the

277
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:15,870
competition is done with computing power

278
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:20,620
if you look at the beginning of Bitcoin

279
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:24,390
you could very easily get rich

280
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:28,000
and by only using the CPU in your laptop

281
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:30,490
but then with time because of the

282
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,070
properties of the Bitcoin blockchain

283
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:36,670
algorithm or proof-of-work algorithm

284
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:39,160
people started to think okay I have a

285
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:41,170
gaming machine I have a graphics card in

286
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:45,520
it and the graphics card is really good

287
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:49,870
to do parallel processing so this char

288
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:51,790
250 256 algorithm I can paralyze that

289
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:53,980
and and and compute a lot of different

290
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:56,459
nonces in parallel and there been way

291
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:59,650
more faster than all of my competitors

292
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:03,490
so that was around 2010 when this came

293
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:06,579
up then people start to say okay how can

294
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:10,120
we specialize even more so let's take an

295
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:13,780
FPGA program the hashing algorithm

296
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:16,090
within an FPGA which gets more and more

297
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:18,819
specialized and the current state of the

298
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:24,460
art is having application-specific

299
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:27,550
integrated circuits to do your mining

300
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:29,710
but you're not only going to have one of

301
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:31,270
these if you want to play the game with

302
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:35,140
Bitcoin what you need actually is a

303
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:37,420
whole farm of those Asics so that's

304
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:43,319
problematic because what you want to

305
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:43,319
achieve in a blockchain system is this

306
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:52,959
diversity so you want to you want to

307
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:55,890
make the system fair so that nobody has

308
00:16:52,960 --> 00:17:00,610
a control over the blockchain now

309
00:16:55,890 --> 00:17:02,740
nowadays only a few entities can afford

310
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:05,980
to have such a setup so like mining

311
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:09,700
pools or maybe I don't know maybe state

312
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:11,710
actors could be and it's not

313
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:14,080
decentralized anymore so you have maybe

314
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:18,220
a couple of entities like three or four

315
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:20,139
entities that if they put themselves

316
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:21,940
together they could have a really big

317
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:24,430
impact on the blockchain and they could

318
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:27,370
have more than 51% of the participation

319
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:31,180
in the blockchain so that means they

320
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:34,899
actually decide which block gets

321
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:40,300
put into the blocks in which not so this

322
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:44,080
is why in the evolution of blockchain

323
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:46,780
you you have different alternative

324
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:51,850
systems and one of them is Manero which

325
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:54,370
tries to defeat the this evolution where

326
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:57,010
you you you you can get very specific

327
00:17:54,370 --> 00:18:00,879
hardware and a specialized hardware to

328
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:05,170
do the mining and they they want to make

329
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:08,620
tripped affair again so that everybody

330
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:12,370
like me with my laptop I can again play

331
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:16,030
the game and mine and earn something

332
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:17,919
because then it's much more difficult

333
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:20,080
for someone to take control of the

334
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:23,170
blockchain Manero

335
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:26,320
in addition designed some privacy

336
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:30,730
aspects well a lot of privacy aspects

337
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:35,139
actually and unlike Bitcoin it's very

338
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:37,870
difficult to track the transactions so

339
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:41,410
there are a lot of websites on the

340
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:43,000
internet were like blockchain dot info

341
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:46,270
where you can track all the transactions

342
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:49,480
if you have Bitcoin address you can see

343
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:52,810
where the whole money flows and so on so

344
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:55,000
people need different addresses to make

345
00:18:52,810 --> 00:19:00,610
sure that nobody can link their

346
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:03,850
activities with money oh it's not the

347
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:08,830
case it's almost impossible to figure

348
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:11,620
out or one origin address starting from

349
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:16,629
one or address in the origin what

350
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:21,250
transactions were made ok so this makes

351
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:24,400
money oh very interesting for hackers as

352
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:27,750
well so we saw yesterday's talk from

353
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:30,940
Dave leavin leaving back he talked about

354
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:33,690
money robots how they were deployed and

355
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:38,920
so on and with the vulnerabilities like

356
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:41,530
Drupal get on its it's now the new thing

357
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,630
to do you when you have remote code

358
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:45,120
execution

359
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:48,919
you're you you can automatically install

360
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:52,489
your minor it's very maintenance-free

361
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:55,340
you just drop it and configure the right

362
00:19:52,490 --> 00:20:00,179
target address and then leave it and and

363
00:19:55,340 --> 00:20:03,480
go and hack the next one so a couple I

364
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:06,750
think yesterday are on Thursday there

365
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:09,030
were there were also reports of docker

366
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:12,570
instances which you could get from

367
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:15,000
docker hub which were compromised so

368
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:18,030
anybody who would retrieve those Dockers

369
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,490
would already have a minor in it and so

370
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:26,220
I think the evolution is hackers are

371
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:28,909
trying to put Moneo - everywhere we had

372
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:34,580
a case a very interesting case of a

373
00:20:28,909 --> 00:20:38,429
client who unfortunately left the darker

374
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:39,720
management interface open it's somewhere

375
00:20:38,429 --> 00:20:43,039
on the high port it's not a standard

376
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:45,419
port but if you look at the docker

377
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:47,820
documentation they give you an example

378
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:51,299
of the port it's in the 4000 something

379
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:54,000
and actually the port by itself is not

380
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:55,710
authenticated so you need to to block it

381
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,690
to block the access from the Internet

382
00:20:55,710 --> 00:21:03,330
there were they exposed and I think

383
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:05,190
there were victim of a automated attack

384
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:09,199
which would just scan the whole internet

385
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:13,460
and see where there they could find any

386
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:16,919
exposed docker interfaces and then

387
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:17,309
inject a new or create a new dock on

388
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:23,159
Taner

389
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:27,710
which has a minor in it ok so let's also

390
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:30,960
look at the algorithm comparison they

391
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:34,890
the reason why manejo is possible to

392
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:37,470
mind on general-purpose computing

393
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:41,970
devices is because it's not only CPU

394
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:46,590
buying bound so with Bitcoin you need to

395
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:49,039
do char to for 256 computations twice in

396
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:51,340
a row and you can parallel parallel

397
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:54,820
parallelize this

398
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:57,730
and for former naval what you need is a

399
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:59,950
CPU obviously but also a lot of memory

400
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:02,529
because in the algorithm what you need

401
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:03,070
to do is build up a scratch pad of 2

402
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:05,220
megabytes

403
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:10,090
this means it's like you're working

404
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:15,279
buffer of 2 to 2 then do the hash

405
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:18,730
computations on it so what's good good

406
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:22,629
hardware to do it is CPUs with large

407
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:26,649
caches on it so if you have a l2 cache

408
00:22:22,629 --> 00:22:27,459
of 2 megabyte and you could fit in the

409
00:22:26,649 --> 00:22:32,070
whole scratchpad

410
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:38,470
and you can work much more efficiently

411
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:43,450
ok so let's go on to mining in the

412
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:45,639
browser with JavaScript so I guess a lot

413
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:47,950
of you have heard about coin hive it's a

414
00:22:45,639 --> 00:22:51,908
service that started about a year ago

415
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:54,249
well in July 2017 and they offer a

416
00:22:51,909 --> 00:22:58,899
JavaScript miner for demonio blockchain

417
00:22:54,249 --> 00:23:03,369
which you could use an insert into your

418
00:22:58,899 --> 00:23:05,229
browser and mine well actually if the

419
00:23:03,369 --> 00:23:07,570
visitors of your website who are going

420
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:10,299
to mine for you for the operator of the

421
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:12,990
website and they advertise the service

422
00:23:10,299 --> 00:23:16,899
as an alternative to advertisements

423
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:20,710
which is great because I hate ads on the

424
00:23:16,899 --> 00:23:22,418
other side you need to figure out how to

425
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:24,940
do it the right way so that your

426
00:23:22,419 --> 00:23:27,970
visitors know ok I'm currently mining

427
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:30,129
for the website operator we'll get to

428
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:36,340
that later so how does it work

429
00:23:30,129 --> 00:23:40,090
technically you need to inject huh bind

430
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:43,899
the external coin hive miner script and

431
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:46,539
then you instantiate the miner with your

432
00:23:43,899 --> 00:23:49,229
address if you want to see an example of

433
00:23:46,539 --> 00:23:52,658
that can go on coin - H which I

434
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:54,999
registered and you can see how that

435
00:23:52,659 --> 00:23:57,360
works and if you have the website open

436
00:23:54,999 --> 00:24:02,640
just leave it open

437
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:05,850
a couple of hours days okay so what

438
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:09,150
happens when you download coin hive min

439
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:13,820
jf you'll get a JavaScript file which

440
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:18,470
will then check if your browser supports

441
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:22,919
webassembly if it doesn't it will load

442
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:24,960
an ASM GS version of the miner which is

443
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:30,480
actually a subset of JavaScript which

444
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:35,160
works very efficiently which which is

445
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:37,260
optimized for well I mean I have no idea

446
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:39,919
of how javascript is executed in a

447
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:43,590
browser but I know that some parts are

448
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:49,169
compiled just in time and I think the

449
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:52,620
motivation behind a fmjs is to make it

450
00:24:49,169 --> 00:24:54,900
as efficient as possible by knowing how

451
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:56,370
the stuff is just in time compiled and

452
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:59,000
the other hand web assembly is I

453
00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:02,610
actually byte code that you can compile

454
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:07,429
like a normal binary executable and you

455
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:10,010
load it to the to the browser and it's I

456
00:25:07,429 --> 00:25:12,720
should have some more efficiency but

457
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:15,990
from what I've seen I tried both

458
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:18,540
versions I get actually about the same

459
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:20,100
hash rate so it's it's neat that you

460
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:22,320
have the different implementations but I

461
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:26,969
think in the end it's not that relevant

462
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:29,010
for the computed hash rate and I think

463
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:30,960
the hackers don't mind the either which

464
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:34,799
version you're going to download so I

465
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:38,970
did a little test with different devices

466
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:44,010
the first row is my Apple a7 that's the

467
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:49,230
processor in my iPhone and with two

468
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:52,350
cores with 512 K of l2 cache each and I

469
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:56,700
can achieve 16 hashes per seconds with

470
00:25:52,350 --> 00:26:01,020
that then in the office we all have Macs

471
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:04,830
so we have Intel Core i7 processors

472
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:06,918
different freak different frequencies

473
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:09,580
depending on how old the laptop was

474
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:13,509
always about the same

475
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:15,489
of caches on different course and as you

476
00:26:13,509 --> 00:26:18,999
can see the fastest machine which will

477
00:26:15,489 --> 00:26:21,549
in the last row which wasn't an Apple PC

478
00:26:18,999 --> 00:26:24,700
but was like a 60 hashes per seconds

479
00:26:21,549 --> 00:26:27,820
let's mining in the JavaScript if you

480
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:29,950
have a native miner like the ones you

481
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:32,320
would get in cell from a but a mining

482
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:35,830
but it will you could achieve up to

483
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:39,730
maybe 100 or 200 also if you if you

484
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:43,749
leverage the the GPU that modern laptops

485
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:46,539
have then you can also yeah say go up to

486
00:26:43,749 --> 00:26:48,580
200 hashes per seconds but now for the

487
00:26:46,539 --> 00:26:51,070
next computations I would say an average

488
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:55,239
laptop you should reach about achieve

489
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:57,939
about 50 hashes per second so a small

490
00:26:55,239 --> 00:27:01,090
revenue calculation if you go on coin

491
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:03,850
hive at the day I made the slide they

492
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:06,369
would give you really a little fraction

493
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:06,939
of XMR which is the abbreviation for

494
00:27:06,369 --> 00:27:10,418
manejo

495
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:12,549
for 1 million hashes so whenever your

496
00:27:10,419 --> 00:27:15,809
visit to his mine 1 million hashes you

497
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:21,309
would get that fraction of an XML and

498
00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:23,769
the conversion rate is 1x m r is 198 US

499
00:27:21,309 --> 00:27:27,129
dollars so if you do that on one system

500
00:27:23,769 --> 00:27:30,989
during one hour at 50 at a rate of 50

501
00:27:27,129 --> 00:27:33,639
hashes per second and you generate

502
00:27:30,989 --> 00:27:36,159
during that one hour you don't generate

503
00:27:33,639 --> 00:27:37,928
a million hashes but a fraction of a

504
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:41,980
million hashes like a hundred and eighty

505
00:27:37,929 --> 00:27:46,779
thousand hashes then you get nothing

506
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:50,259
it's if you want to get close to

507
00:27:46,779 --> 00:27:52,139
somewhere to have some revenue you can

508
00:27:50,259 --> 00:27:55,269
scale it up and say you have a hundred

509
00:27:52,139 --> 00:27:58,238
visitors during one hour on your website

510
00:27:55,269 --> 00:27:59,499
mining at 50 hashes per seconds then

511
00:27:58,239 --> 00:28:02,799
obviously it's a hundred times more

512
00:27:59,499 --> 00:28:06,429
hashes generated so 18 million you get

513
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:11,139
still almost nothing what you really

514
00:28:06,429 --> 00:28:14,529
need a computing power to get like a

515
00:28:11,139 --> 00:28:17,678
dime is ten thousand systems during one

516
00:28:14,529 --> 00:28:19,509
hour a day at the same hash rate and say

517
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,220
you wanna have to have the same in a

518
00:28:19,509 --> 00:28:22,040
five minute window then you'd need a

519
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:24,770
hundred

520
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:29,090
mm but that's not all because coin hive

521
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:31,280
is taking a 30% pool fee so yeah they're

522
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:35,060
making a lot of money actually from

523
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:36,620
everyone I mean 30% is really a lot but

524
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:40,250
I mean there's this system is really

525
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:42,620
easy to use so you just need to to put

526
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:46,820
the script in it with your address and

527
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:49,010
it's it's it works I don't know if that

528
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:53,060
legitimizes that mining fee but okay

529
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:56,660
it's another problem okay so next I want

530
00:28:53,060 --> 00:29:04,129
to figure out how bad does this look

531
00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:07,790
like in the Swiss websites community so

532
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:10,220
what I did is obviously we as a registry

533
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:12,590
we have access to all dot CH domains I

534
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:18,380
took those days are about two million

535
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:22,490
domain names and took the the file put

536
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:24,280
that in a read askew on the right of

537
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:29,440
that red is Q you have

538
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:33,950
openshift with a little cluster of

539
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:36,560
docker instances which runs crepey which

540
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:41,120
is a very nice Python project used to

541
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:45,350
scrape websites but in this case I

542
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:49,250
didn't want to scrape the I just needed

543
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:51,169
the whole HTML file so what I do is I go

544
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:53,840
on the website using the domain name and

545
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:56,780
just put HTTP double colon slash slash

546
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:59,270
in front of it with the domain name and

547
00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:01,580
try to resolve that and to access the

548
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:04,280
HTML file if that doesn't work I also

549
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:05,870
try to put www in front of it dot and

550
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:09,740
then do it and if this still doesn't

551
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:11,540
work the well I don't I don't store

552
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:14,060
anything for the websites that are

553
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:16,430
accessible I then take the HTML content

554
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:18,889
just of the of the front page of the

555
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:20,690
home page of the site and put it in the

556
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:25,330
elasticsearch where I can then search

557
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:28,160
for patterns the thing is I'm not

558
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:30,260
indexing the whole all of the websites

559
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:32,750
and that's eh because I don't get all

560
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:34,669
the subdomains so if you look at for

561
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:41,799
instance Institute's

562
00:30:34,669 --> 00:30:44,539
in in universities you have a lot of

563
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:47,570
subdomains I don't get them I just get

564
00:30:44,539 --> 00:30:48,289
the principal domain so who's mining on

565
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:52,759
your back

566
00:30:48,289 --> 00:30:55,009
I did three samples and one of them in

567
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:58,690
January so you see there's not really

568
00:30:55,009 --> 00:31:02,210
much people having miners the first one

569
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:06,980
in January 19 and 15 more in April and

570
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:10,820
then almost eleven more in May always

571
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:15,080
using the same patterns well okay that I

572
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:18,678
always took the fresh zone file there

573
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:23,149
are TLDs who offer there the whole zone

574
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:27,259
file as as open data so you can access

575
00:31:23,149 --> 00:31:30,408
all the dot fr domains the dot SC as

576
00:31:27,259 --> 00:31:32,690
well and you see that well that it's

577
00:31:30,409 --> 00:31:35,480
always it's very marginal the number of

578
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:36,739
crypto - you have on them I guess if

579
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:40,129
you'd go on com

580
00:31:36,739 --> 00:31:43,070
it would look differently but I didn't

581
00:31:40,129 --> 00:31:45,369
access that so then I thought ok let's

582
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:48,739
let's have a look at the affected CMS

583
00:31:45,369 --> 00:31:50,299
systems in in Switzerland so you see

584
00:31:48,739 --> 00:31:52,489
there are a lot of WordPress like a

585
00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:57,799
third of it is WordPress then you have a

586
00:31:52,489 --> 00:31:59,779
lot of Drupal no small I think Drupal

587
00:31:57,799 --> 00:32:01,609
was more of but it wasn't and then you

588
00:31:59,779 --> 00:32:03,830
have Joomla but depends also on the

589
00:32:01,609 --> 00:32:05,269
market share of course then I thought

590
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:08,119
let's have a closer look at the

591
00:32:05,269 --> 00:32:10,639
WordPress instances and to see any here

592
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:13,699
on the left side of the pie you see most

593
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:17,719
of them were on the actual current

594
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:20,840
version of WordPress and I guess it

595
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:22,639
doesn't only depend on the version

596
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:25,070
number of WordPress but also on all the

597
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:27,289
plugins you have on them if you look at

598
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:29,779
the different addresses which were

599
00:32:27,289 --> 00:32:34,190
injected in the code you see some of

600
00:32:29,779 --> 00:32:35,960
them were used as many as 14 times so

601
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:37,970
and then looking at the websites they

602
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,619
had no relation to each other so this is

603
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:43,099
an indicator that they got hacked

604
00:32:39,619 --> 00:32:44,928
I also took one of these addresses and I

605
00:32:43,099 --> 00:32:46,939
didn't know I learned that a couple of

606
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:48,230
weeks ago you can do HTML of content

607
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:50,090
search with

608
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:53,360
you need to be logged in and then this

609
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:55,850
address produced like modern for 500

610
00:32:53,360 --> 00:33:00,139
hits for the same address so obviously

611
00:32:55,850 --> 00:33:05,240
this was a hack case so why are people

612
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:08,059
crypto mining well the legitimate case

613
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:10,940
is the operator mines and with the users

614
00:33:08,059 --> 00:33:13,370
concept but then in the other second

615
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:15,470
case the miner originates from the

616
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:18,439
operator busy he doesn't communicate it

617
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:21,350
and the third one is the site has been

618
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:25,429
compromised and a crypto miners was

619
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:28,189
injected so here's an example of the

620
00:33:25,429 --> 00:33:30,260
legitimate case it's a website called ad

621
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:32,330
free TV where you have video streaming

622
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:34,279
which makes a lot of sense because while

623
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:37,760
you're watching your two hours movie in

624
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:39,500
the background it's streaming if you go

625
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,480
in the About section they say we're

626
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:44,360
using a miner while you're using so I

627
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:47,990
think it's pretty fair let's make a made

628
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:50,689
evident but in the meantime the website

629
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:53,240
is still online that they don't use the

630
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:55,789
miner anymore I don't know why then the

631
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:58,070
second example is obviously as a hacked

632
00:33:55,789 --> 00:33:59,990
website because you see the miner script

633
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:01,700
is injected three times in a row which

634
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:04,870
doesn't make any sense so this was

635
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:11,089
probably probably a HTML in injection

636
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:13,580
with time there came a lot of browser

637
00:34:11,089 --> 00:34:17,089
add-ons which would block crypto - also

638
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:19,609
your conventional ad blocker like you

639
00:34:17,089 --> 00:34:23,779
block or something they would detect

640
00:34:19,609 --> 00:34:25,969
also the existence of miners so what did

641
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:28,790
the hackers do they obfuscate the code

642
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:32,209
this is what it looks like then also

643
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:35,000
have the example for somebody who is

644
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:36,830
intentionally mining I guess so because

645
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,440
this website is about bitcoins and

646
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:43,369
crypto currencies he has a miner on it

647
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:45,710
and but he doesn't tell it just so what

648
00:34:43,369 --> 00:34:50,750
I do is I go away but I mean he doesn't

649
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:52,820
even have a valid certificate so okay I

650
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:54,460
gotta go a bit faster what's switch

651
00:34:52,820 --> 00:35:00,800
doing about it

652
00:34:54,460 --> 00:35:01,400
nothing no we as so I already said we're

653
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,249
mandated

654
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:06,710
the office of communication to operate

655
00:35:04,249 --> 00:35:08,990
the registry and as part of this mandate

656
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:12,410
we also need to keep the dot CH zone

657
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:14,930
clean that means if we see instances of

658
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:17,210
phishing and Malware we need to get in

659
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:20,328
contact with the operate of the web site

660
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:23,960
the domain holder the registrar and the

661
00:35:20,329 --> 00:35:28,069
host ER and we give them 24 hours to

662
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:31,180
clean up the the malware the phishing

663
00:35:28,069 --> 00:35:34,369
and if we don't get anything any any

664
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:36,649
reaction then we we take away the domain

665
00:35:34,369 --> 00:35:39,200
from the zone file within 2 or 3 hours

666
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:44,900
nobody is going to be able to resolve

667
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:48,859
the domain so if we look ok one more

668
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:52,609
thing we ask the Ofcom how to handle

669
00:35:48,859 --> 00:35:55,519
crypto - is it malware or not their

670
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:57,319
answer was it is malware so every time

671
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:58,910
we see a crypto minor we should get in

672
00:35:57,319 --> 00:36:02,630
contact and launch the process and

673
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:05,779
eventually maybe block the website how

674
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:07,849
are we actually dealing with it so if we

675
00:36:05,779 --> 00:36:09,739
at the operative place is a secret trip

676
00:36:07,849 --> 00:36:10,759
- minor we're going to inform him and

677
00:36:09,739 --> 00:36:13,849
tell it's not right

678
00:36:10,759 --> 00:36:15,920
if website has been compromised because

679
00:36:13,849 --> 00:36:18,890
it it was hacked we're also going to

680
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:21,739
inform and eventually block but we leave

681
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:25,308
one thing open as a legitimate case if

682
00:36:21,739 --> 00:36:28,039
somebody informs the visitors he's using

683
00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:30,259
a crypto minor then it's ok but how do

684
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:33,170
you ask the visitors for the consent and

685
00:36:30,259 --> 00:36:36,349
the example before I showed you you need

686
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:39,680
to go in the About section and UCI ok

687
00:36:36,349 --> 00:36:41,660
the the operative tells me he's mining

688
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,430
but that's not really obvious my

689
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:46,460
suggestion would be to use something

690
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:48,618
like the cookie consent you see on all

691
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:50,950
European websites where you say oh I

692
00:36:48,619 --> 00:36:53,119
have to accept the cookies and fun fact

693
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:55,279
when you say you don't want to have

694
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:57,230
cookies the websites place the cookie to

695
00:36:55,279 --> 00:37:02,569
remember that you don't want cookies but

696
00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:04,690
that's another story I just took one of

697
00:37:02,569 --> 00:37:07,670
those banners and just change it like

698
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:10,220
for using it for crypto mining so that

699
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:13,489
could be something people would want to

700
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:14,470
do if we see that crypto mining as in

701
00:37:13,489 --> 00:37:17,550
the

702
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:20,680
a real alternative for advertisements

703
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:23,200
okay I want to end our presentation with

704
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:25,419
a very interesting case so for the case

705
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:29,259
of these cookie consent banners you

706
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:31,630
could use JavaScript so this is a

707
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:34,150
website who offers such a JavaScript

708
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:36,190
it's called cookie script info so you

709
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:39,090
don't have to code it yourself but if

710
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:42,310
you go and have a look at some of their

711
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:44,260
JavaScript versions in the past which

712
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:47,349
are deployed on content delivery

713
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:51,490
networks well you see their javascript

714
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:55,720
is injected and well so somebody is

715
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:58,509
making big money with them okay that's

716
00:37:55,720 --> 00:38:01,029
it thanks for your attention and I'm

717
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:01,540
open for questions if time if we still

718
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:09,430
have some time

719
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:11,529
good thanks answer okay thank you very

720
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:14,440
much I was very very informative and

721
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:15,640
yeah interesting does anyone have any

722
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,530
questions that's all we still have a few

723
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:22,259
minutes before we move on to the next

724
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:22,260
one so please don't be shy beautiful

725
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:35,470
thank you when you when you inform the

726
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:38,380
holders how many are saying oh actually

727
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:40,990
it was not intended or how many are

728
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:43,150
saying oh but I'm fully in the right of

729
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:47,109
putting a crypto minor what is the

730
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:48,880
percentage the the website I showed the

731
00:38:47,109 --> 00:38:52,359
example with the video streaming was the

732
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:55,390
only website where I noticed somebody's

733
00:38:52,359 --> 00:38:58,119
doing it in with the intent of like

734
00:38:55,390 --> 00:39:00,220
using web crypto mining as an

735
00:38:58,119 --> 00:39:03,730
alternative to advertisement so all

736
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:05,859
other people all that we contacted they

737
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:07,869
were all like oh no I wasn't aware there

738
00:39:05,859 --> 00:39:12,430
there's a crypto mine on my website and

739
00:39:07,869 --> 00:39:13,240
I'm going to clean it any other

740
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:20,609
questions

741
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:23,439
