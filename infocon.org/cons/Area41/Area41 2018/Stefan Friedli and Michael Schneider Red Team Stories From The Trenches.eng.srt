1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,370
I am so excited to speak here like I'm

2
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:10,320
literally so excited like I've never had

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,450
the opportunity to speak at area 41

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,580
because I was always sort of running

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,948
around and trying to find more Club MOT

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,460
because it was already gone again so

7
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:24,000
this is this is great I'm also super

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:29,220
excited because this is a topic that

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,990
I've been dealing with for the past 13

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,729
14 years professionally and a little bit

11
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:37,769
longer when it comes to personal

12
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:39,870
interest and the longer I sort of live

13
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,690
in this space and work in this space you

14
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:45,510
know this certain changes you notice how

15
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,959
the perception of certain fields changes

16
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:50,280
new people come into the industry and

17
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:53,010
when I was walking the conference floor

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,110
this morning it really struck home with

19
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,210
me because there are so many of you that

20
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:00,030
I've known from previous years that I've

21
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:02,160
seen before but there are so many new

22
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,739
faces because there's such a massive

23
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,840
influx of new talent into the space and

24
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,820
I think that's amazing that's super

25
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,040
exciting to me especially since the

26
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,750
space has grown like I feel like we as

27
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,049
an industry have grown up a little bit

28
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:19,920
we diversify maybe a little bit there is

29
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:22,710
much more to do also but I also realize

30
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,350
that penetration testing which has been

31
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:29,250
like sort of a household name for a long

32
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:32,220
time has come a bit of a bad rap so what

33
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:35,460
I want to do together with Mick here is

34
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,979
I want to give you a little bit of a

35
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:40,408
mixture of a primer for the people who

36
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:42,720
haven't been industry for so long along

37
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:43,020
also it may be a little bit of a wake up

38
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,210
call

39
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,340
for those of you who have been around

40
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:50,880
longer I hope there is going to be

41
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,290
something for everyone and I hope you

42
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,048
can have some questions and answers

43
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:58,759
well at least questions I guess in the

44
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:58,759
end and yeah let's get going

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,939
so this is titled red team stories from

46
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:07,160
the trenches now I'm aware that

47
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:09,478
terminology is a little bit muddy

48
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,459
essentially because like where does a

49
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,710
penetration test start where does it end

50
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:17,100
what's the security assessment

51
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,420
what is essentially just an SS can we're

52
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,519
not going to talk about this today okay

53
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:23,970
we're just going to assume that a Red

54
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:26,220
Team assessment is going to be some form

55
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,450
of more advanced penetration tests where

56
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,130
you have a fuller scope where you

57
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:32,519
actually get to deal with stuff that

58
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:34,730
matters if your definition varies feel

59
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,080
free to come up to me at the barbecue

60
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:39,209
kind of sort this out one way or another

61
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,340
I'll find a way

62
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:44,940
I'll probably just buy a beer wait beer

63
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,650
is free right okay anyway but yeah what

64
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,410
I want to do and what the objectives of

65
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,660
this talk are I want to clarify the

66
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:55,620
opportunities that you get from doing

67
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:57,720
penetration testing um not just for

68
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,760
people who do penetration testing also

69
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,890
for people who are customers to

70
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,720
penetration testing companies I want to

71
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:06,000
show to you what you can get from an

72
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,160
engagement because I think in a lot of

73
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,150
cases you are not getting what you could

74
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:14,549
get or in what you should get I want to

75
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:17,250
also mention that before for those of

76
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:19,860
you who are right like straight out of

77
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,940
university something like that I want to

78
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,400
give you a little bit of a head start

79
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:25,020
show you what this is all about and like

80
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,080
you know show you some cool things you

81
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:30,840
can do and translates also for to that

82
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,880
point here we have a workshop area set

83
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,740
up just outside where you can try some

84
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,109
of the stuff out that we talked about in

85
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:40,560
this talk so if you want to do that that

86
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:42,390
would be really cool and last but not

87
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,390
least I want to illustrate to you some

88
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:47,609
of the stuff that goes way beyond what

89
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:49,350
many of us may be considered the fun

90
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:52,310
part of penetration testing which is you

91
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:55,620
know popping shells stuff like that and

92
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:58,500
also part of this somewhat maybe more

93
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:01,610
important even and can very be very

94
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:05,160
gratifying if you do it the right way so

95
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:08,520
why are we presenting this legitimate

96
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:11,540
question I guess Mike here has been

97
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:14,030
professional pen tester since 2010 and

98
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:16,079
since we sort of restructured our

99
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:18,810
approach to penetration testing

100
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,380
especially for larger corporations make

101
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:24,960
has spent a large part of his life in

102
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:27,210
other people's office buildings or at

103
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,638
least in you know cars outside of them

104
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,799
or

105
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:32,460
you know in their networks at least

106
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:36,699
let's just leave it at that

107
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:38,378
yeah I'm Stefan many of you probably saw

108
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:40,599
me on that stage before another capacity

109
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:43,840
I've been a professional pen tester

110
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:47,139
since 2007 and our on the red team at

111
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:49,150
skip and don't get to Campo and in van

112
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:53,860
so much anymore but it's all very much

113
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:57,489
fun I had personal interest or community

114
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:59,860
interest in penetration testing as much

115
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:02,729
as a professional and one as well I did

116
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:05,199
a project with a bunch of friends in

117
00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:07,508
2010-2011 and four were called

118
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,330
penetration testing execution standards

119
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:14,770
and saying what he heard of that yeah

120
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:16,960
cool for those who haven't check it out

121
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:19,448
it's essentially our attempt to

122
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,609
formalize penetration testing to a point

123
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:23,589
where everybody knows what it's about

124
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:27,879
what he's getting what he's supposed to

125
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:31,180
get out of it or not it has grown from a

126
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:33,430
small hobby project to something that

127
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:36,639
gets reference in pci-dss

128
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:38,319
so we're quite happy about that and yeah

129
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,060
this talk is not about pts but you

130
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:45,159
should really go check it out it's cool

131
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:48,490
anyway when I was growing up and I am a

132
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:52,688
kid of the 90s it's true

133
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:55,330
I loved puzzles I loved puzzles above

134
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:57,219
everything else my granddad had like two

135
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,139
dozens of them like in a trunk just to

136
00:05:57,219 --> 00:06:02,589
keep me busy and I think that's the

137
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:05,009
epitome of my generation of security

138
00:06:02,589 --> 00:06:09,189
professionals I think the traditional

139
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:10,899
hacker mindset revolves around curiosity

140
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:13,020
trying to figure out how things works

141
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:15,419
starts with traditional puzzles I

142
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:18,639
personally also really liked computers

143
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:21,669
so I started dealing with like these

144
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,439
types of things I realized that the

145
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:25,568
younger people among you probably don't

146
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:27,099
realize the chair existed because

147
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:31,000
everything in software as-a-service now

148
00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:34,029
but I had so much fun with shareware I

149
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,709
was never going to use just to get rid

150
00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:38,620
of like this nag screens or just to

151
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:40,449
figure out how it worked why why it

152
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,520
would restrict you and how you could

153
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:46,199
bypass it

154
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:48,508
and that's what ultimately made me want

155
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:52,590
to get into penetration testing like I

156
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:54,750
could get paid to solve riddles and like

157
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:56,669
break into systems and like tell people

158
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,080
how I did it and like show off with it

159
00:06:56,669 --> 00:07:00,508
that's amazing

160
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:04,440
so when I got the opportunity to just

161
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:05,610
add in 2007 I was delighted and I still

162
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,750
enjoy it to that day that's why I'm

163
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:11,220
still doing it that's why I'm giving

164
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:12,720
this talk and so that attacker mindset

165
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:15,690
keep that in mind because I think it's

166
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,729
an essential part of what makes a good

167
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:19,740
penetration tester but there are also

168
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:20,909
some dangers that come with it and we're

169
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:24,569
going to touch on that a little bit

170
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:26,819
later now let's talk about penetration

171
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:29,639
tests or what a lot of people think

172
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:32,880
about when they are faced with the term

173
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:34,650
penetration test so usually it's an

174
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,050
external assessment because some

175
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:39,539
customer approaches you they may or may

176
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:41,460
not have done that thing sort of thing

177
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:45,000
in the past and they approach you

178
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:46,919
they're like hello we would like to know

179
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,800
what hacker can do to us

180
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:51,479
and you're like all right what's your

181
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,270
friend model a like we don't know but we

182
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:55,258
want you to attack us from the outside

183
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:57,060
like can we use social engineering

184
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:59,460
they're like no that's out of scope like

185
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,590
okay cool um so realism is already out

186
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:03,270
the window so what do we do in the end

187
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:05,130
what you happen to do is like you don't

188
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:08,250
you get a range from the customer you

189
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:10,770
scan it you find active systems you

190
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:12,539
identify service identify the service is

191
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:14,490
running on it you match that with

192
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:16,979
vulnerabilities maybe you do some web

193
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:18,990
application security assessment you find

194
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:21,330
some stuff according to the Oh was

195
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:25,069
placed and then you come by a pile that

196
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:28,289
all in a very long very boring document

197
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:29,009
to the customer and you go home with a

198
00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:37,468
job well done

199
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:41,459
cool so that sort of project that sort

200
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:45,120
of procedure is maybe one of the core

201
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:48,209
reasons why this sentence has popped out

202
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:51,829
and popped up over the years over and

203
00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:54,959
over again penetration testing is dead

204
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:56,370
and maybe it is if

205
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,380
that on the slide that I just showed you

206
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:00,900
before is what we define as penetration

207
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:04,320
testing because there are a bunch of

208
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:07,199
problems with that type of approach you

209
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,370
access IQ test from the outside I mean

210
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,310
that was cool

211
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:14,820
ten fifteen years ago when most of the

212
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:17,550
companies who relied on on systems

213
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:20,100
running internet-facing were running

214
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:21,990
their own systems like there was a time

215
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,450
where we dealt with a lot of customers

216
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:26,520
who you know had an FTP server had an

217
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:29,430
SMTP server ran their own DNS service

218
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:31,560
and this provided some sort of value

219
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:35,489
especially since they usually maintained

220
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:38,300
them's and themselves nowadays how many

221
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:47,160
of you work in organizations that run

222
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:51,359
office 365 or Google Apps or slack right

223
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:53,610
that's quite a bunch of hands these

224
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,380
things usually get taken out of scope

225
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:57,840
because it's bothersome to get

226
00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:00,030
permission it's kind of nasty to sort of

227
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,280
deal with the fallout and you sort of

228
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:03,959
outsource security to them anyway at

229
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,910
least in your own mind if you're like

230
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:09,320
running operations for a company that

231
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:13,069
doesn't make sense right the classic

232
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:16,290
enumeration of an external test ignores

233
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:17,880
completely ignores the most common

234
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:21,540
attack paths that we still see in the

235
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:23,580
world today tragically most attacks

236
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:26,610
still happen because somebody clicks on

237
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:30,000
some they shouldn't click on it's a

238
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:31,440
reality and by looking at the DM set

239
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,800
you're essentially looking in the wrong

240
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,860
place in a lot of cases you focus on

241
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:42,719
quantity we focus on quantity so much

242
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:45,920
you actually lose a track of context and

243
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,420
quality of vulnerabilities you indentify

244
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:51,209
what you end up with and that translates

245
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:53,910
directly into the report is a massive

246
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:56,190
list and usually when you look at them

247
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:59,339
very closely you see they're like two or

248
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:01,860
three red items it's massive list of

249
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:05,700
yellow items and there is a more massive

250
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:07,650
list of green items I don't know how

251
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,620
many of you have been on the receiving

252
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:11,590
end of such

253
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:13,300
rapport but if any of you can tell me

254
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:15,280
that you've got one of these reports and

255
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:18,819
you went through every single finding

256
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:21,339
and you mitigated it and you mitigated

257
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:22,720
it because it was for the good of your

258
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:25,060
company and not just because you were

259
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,720
OCD about the report I'm going to buy

260
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,489
you a beer

261
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,620
anywhere in the city where you like no

262
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:34,720
problem because no none of you has done

263
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:37,930
that none and the last part I talked

264
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:41,020
about already this attacker mindset this

265
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:44,229
wanting to solve puzzles that's super

266
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:48,130
cool but it's not necessarily what you

267
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:50,680
need on the receiving end you don't need

268
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:52,840
somebody to solve a challenge for you

269
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:56,109
you don't need anybody to prove to you

270
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:58,270
especially prove to you that they can

271
00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:01,270
break into your network if you are

272
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:04,210
working in a defensively oriented

273
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:06,160
InfoSec position now a day you know that

274
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:09,730
somebody can break into your network

275
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:13,120
it's not about how it's about when and

276
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:17,620
how fast can we stop it so the mindset

277
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:22,090
is essential so we try to kind address

278
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:26,410
that and guide customers towards a way

279
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:29,530
that we feel is more feasible to them so

280
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:31,900
we tried to sort of like like sum that

281
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:35,079
up in this slide here as I said before

282
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:38,650
external testing is overrated so we try

283
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:40,690
to get people to do internal testing we

284
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:44,170
try them to get them to the point where

285
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:45,910
they say okay let's just assume we get

286
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:48,400
preached first layer of this fence is

287
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:50,079
down somebody clicked on something we

288
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,540
have an insider threat we have some

289
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:55,090
disgruntled employee some employee gets

290
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:57,790
blackmailed does not matter it's just

291
00:12:55,090 --> 00:13:00,280
assumed as a hostile client with normal

292
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:03,490
permissions on the network what happens

293
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:06,579
how fast can we react to this we go on

294
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:10,030
from that and we assume the interim

295
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:12,880
compromise and we define a fairly long

296
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:14,560
period of time this is such a crucial

297
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,570
point of discussion in pre-engagement

298
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:20,170
that gets often ignored because of all

299
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:22,360
the constraints example we were talking

300
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:24,519
to a customer about two years ago

301
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,949
and they were like well so here's what

302
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:29,529
we want to do we kind of want you to

303
00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:31,929
infiltrate our like internal team and

304
00:13:29,529 --> 00:13:34,420
become friends with people so you hear

305
00:13:31,929 --> 00:13:37,509
like what they're talking about and then

306
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:40,149
we kind of want you to check stuff into

307
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:41,679
the local git repositories that might be

308
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:43,600
malicious and maybe not and we want to

309
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:45,459
see if they can notice that and then

310
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,230
from there on like you should get like

311
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:49,299
footholds and Network and move laterally

312
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:51,009
and sort of like escalate from there and

313
00:13:49,299 --> 00:13:53,499
it kept going and was like so yeah okay

314
00:13:51,009 --> 00:13:56,529
so what are we looking at like timewise

315
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:58,389
they were like yeah probably should be

316
00:13:56,529 --> 00:14:02,139
done by the end of the month right yeah

317
00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:04,869
I guess so it's probably not going to

318
00:14:02,139 --> 00:14:07,779
happen like if you plan internal

319
00:14:04,869 --> 00:14:09,420
pentesting that it goes towards

320
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:12,249
direction of like full-on Red Team

321
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:15,639
assessments you should take time into

322
00:14:12,249 --> 00:14:17,529
consideration or at least assume that

323
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:22,329
there will be some more visibility

324
00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:26,079
if you push for a faster timeline if you

325
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:28,359
absolutely have to do some sort of

326
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:32,769
external scan if you absolutely have to

327
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:35,249
deliver the dreaded port scan the

328
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:38,439
dreaded like external assessment results

329
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:41,679
run necess your self don't pay somebody

330
00:14:38,439 --> 00:14:42,009
5,000 bucks or more to run an SS can for

331
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:44,829
you

332
00:14:42,009 --> 00:14:47,529
take those 5,000 bucks find somebody

333
00:14:44,829 --> 00:14:50,349
inside your company who is motivated and

334
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:52,540
eager and pay him to do your do SCP

335
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:55,269
you'll be much much happier in the long

336
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:56,889
run but if you need to do like external

337
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:59,049
stuff like get it done get it out of the

338
00:14:56,889 --> 00:15:01,869
way move on to stuff that actually makes

339
00:14:59,049 --> 00:15:04,089
your security posture better and when

340
00:15:01,869 --> 00:15:06,999
you design like sort of any type of

341
00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:09,160
engagement like think about your tread

342
00:15:06,999 --> 00:15:10,959
model and all it's a big word a lot of

343
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:13,419
people get very scared when you say the

344
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:17,349
word fret mode it doesn't need to be

345
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:20,439
complicated but you should know in bit

346
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:22,959
inside your organization what your what

347
00:15:20,439 --> 00:15:25,389
your common thread actors are and what

348
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:27,819
risks you are facing that way you can

349
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:30,009
design the engagement to actually cater

350
00:15:27,819 --> 00:15:32,919
to this that way you can also define

351
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:35,570
objectives for the testers that are not

352
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:38,180
necessarily technical

353
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:40,460
reaching domain admin is a meta

354
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:42,290
achievement reaching the main admin

355
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:44,630
doesn't mean anything for your

356
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:47,000
organization but you can do it domain

357
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:48,590
admin means a lot for your organization

358
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:54,530
but getting there is not really the

359
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:56,750
point so for the sakes of this kind of

360
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:58,790
presentation we're going to use such a

361
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:00,890
rogue employee scenario as I just

362
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:02,870
described and we're going to take it

363
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:05,480
from there and sort of see what we can

364
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:08,120
get so usually in these engagements and

365
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:10,130
we have done about 8 of them in the past

366
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,710
two years all of them were longer than

367
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:14,540
three months just for reference maybe to

368
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:17,000
sort of sort this into the right

369
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:19,430
category and we'll talk about some of

370
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,560
the things that we can do they do in all

371
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:25,729
cases we started as a legitimate

372
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:27,619
employee which is super fun for various

373
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:30,310
reasons because you get to do the entire

374
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:35,360
HR process of getting into a company

375
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:37,729
which is super fun in itself right the

376
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,130
cool thing is because I've been on stage

377
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:42,160
just before this little anecdote here

378
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:45,460
because I've been on stages before

379
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,839
people who run like socks and the like

380
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:49,070
usually know the name is essentially

381
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,740
also another very big scene in

382
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:54,320
Switzerland right so what you get to do

383
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:57,050
is you get to you get to create fake

384
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,550
identities and then you get to go to the

385
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:01,550
HR people and you're going to be like

386
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:04,220
well here's my ID but I actually need

387
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:06,589
you to open this account on this weird

388
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:09,350
fake name and the reaction you

389
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:11,480
consistently get is like why and this is

390
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:14,419
legal so there's a lot of fun stuff to

391
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:16,310
say associated with that as well once we

392
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:19,459
actually get access to the corporation

393
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:21,560
we do for printing or using all the

394
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:23,780
resources we have make is going to talk

395
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:26,448
about this in just second and tell you a

396
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:29,240
little bit more what we use there before

397
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:32,630
I hand over to him I wanted to say like

398
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:35,270
the one of the core reasons people go

399
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:38,600
beyond testing single objects and

400
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:41,389
testing entire organizations is because

401
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:44,120
they want to see where things where the

402
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:45,560
negative space applies you don't want to

403
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,699
look at servers you don't really look at

404
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:49,100
clients you don't want to look at

405
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,460
processes isolated you want to see how

406
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,289
these

407
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:53,750
things interact and where they touch

408
00:17:51,289 --> 00:17:56,960
upon each other because that's usually

409
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:58,279
where the nasty stuff lies so I guess

410
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:03,350
I'm going to hand it over to you

411
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:05,600
and yeah we'll see where we go as Stefan

412
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:08,990
mentioned before we are working as a

413
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:12,590
normal employee and so we are allowed to

414
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:16,460
use tools from the company tools and

415
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:19,580
information we can get access to wiki's

416
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:22,940
to SharePoint to documentation and so we

417
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:25,460
have a good picture of how the

418
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:29,000
infrastructure is built where are the

419
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:31,820
security controls how are the network

420
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,399
segments how is the configuration of

421
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:36,830
Windows servers and we can collect a lot

422
00:18:34,399 --> 00:18:39,529
of information just by reading documents

423
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:42,620
on the intranet of a company that's

424
00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:45,620
quite useful for the first step for

425
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:48,799
information gathering and then we go on

426
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:52,100
from there look for other information we

427
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:54,590
get there's the point with social

428
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,459
engineering then people say ok with

429
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:58,399
social engineering

430
00:18:55,460 --> 00:19:01,279
you'll get everywhere you want anytime

431
00:18:58,399 --> 00:19:04,459
so just you go to the watercooler say

432
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:07,100
hey hello I'm the new guy how are you

433
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:10,549
and what's that Ministry the password

434
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:12,850
please but I think in Switzerland this

435
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:16,429
doesn't work quite that way because

436
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:18,620
switch people aren't that open-minded to

437
00:19:16,429 --> 00:19:22,789
new people so you just can't go there

438
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:26,629
and press them you just stay around the

439
00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:28,700
water cooler over here talks maybe

440
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:30,710
collect some little little bits of

441
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:34,940
information and get it to the big

442
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:37,399
picture maybe after a few weeks you get

443
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:39,679
trust of employees and then you can go

444
00:19:37,399 --> 00:19:41,989
to social engineering way but I think in

445
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,480
Switzerland and the mentality of Swiss

446
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:47,059
people and can't just storm in and say

447
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:50,000
hello Here I am and I do it's nasty

448
00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:53,029
scenes so just you have to be slow and

449
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,610
cautious what you are doing and another

450
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:57,320
point here are meeting rules meeting

451
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:59,870
rooms are really really great for

452
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:01,950
penetration testers because there are a

453
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:04,668
lot of them in a company

454
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:07,200
and you can use them for story or device

455
00:20:04,669 --> 00:20:09,570
you take the device go in the morning

456
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,210
early in the morning in the room leave

457
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:15,389
it there and go away if someone finds

458
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:16,559
that device this doesn't mean you did

459
00:20:15,389 --> 00:20:18,809
something bad

460
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,549
it doesn't mean or it doesn't leave a

461
00:20:18,809 --> 00:20:23,039
trace to you itself I mean they've been

462
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:25,260
find the device in a meeting room but

463
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:29,250
your mission isn't blown because of that

464
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:30,779
and otherwise if you're in the room and

465
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,220
someone comes and say hey there's

466
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:35,100
something funny in the network we can

467
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:37,919
say yeah well possible deniability I

468
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:41,158
have my own notebook and as a bad habit

469
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:44,549
I plugged in the network so I'm really

470
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:50,850
sorry so meeting rooms are great to hide

471
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:52,799
your tracks so we are looking in wiki's

472
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:56,340
in SharePoint for sensitive information

473
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:58,950
but it's not just only the start because

474
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:02,850
we research in the network in a Windows

475
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:06,000
network for open shares and quick hint

476
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:08,699
for administrators if you put a share

477
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,639
and a dollar at the end of your share

478
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:13,950
that doesn't mean the penetration tester

479
00:21:11,639 --> 00:21:16,260
can't see the share only the Windows

480
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:19,080
File Explorer doesn't display the share

481
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:21,450
but every other tool finds that chair so

482
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:24,570
protect your information and don't hide

483
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:28,220
it with the dollar at the end we are

484
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:31,049
looking for plaintext credentials in

485
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:34,679
configuration files in PowerShell script

486
00:21:31,049 --> 00:21:38,490
in visual basic script and mostly we

487
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:41,340
find one or two local administrators on

488
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:43,409
servers so we can log on on a server

489
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:45,379
have local admin rights and with local

490
00:21:43,409 --> 00:21:48,570
admin rights we are able to collect

491
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:52,799
credentials of other lockdown users so

492
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:55,799
it just extract passwords hashes from

493
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:59,340
other users and use them to hop from the

494
00:21:55,799 --> 00:22:02,100
one server to another and gain deeper

495
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:04,620
and deeper into the network until we

496
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:10,799
have enough credentials to reach our

497
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:14,668
goals we use different tools for that

498
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:15,690
for the lateral movement usually we have

499
00:22:14,669 --> 00:22:18,750
a combination

500
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:22,529
between me rakaats to extract the

501
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:25,200
credentials we use power shell or the

502
00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:27,870
powershell version of mimic arts to run

503
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:32,490
mimic ads in the memory and don't leave

504
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:36,719
any traces on discs and we have remote

505
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:39,690
power shell or VMA exec a titan tool to

506
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:42,720
send a command to a remote server and

507
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:45,029
instruct them to download the powershell

508
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,669
script from our own device which is

509
00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:50,129
maybe or maybe not in a meeting room and

510
00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:54,179
extract them and give back the

511
00:22:50,129 --> 00:22:56,418
credentials of user to us but sometimes

512
00:22:54,179 --> 00:23:00,299
sometimes when you are in a company

513
00:22:56,419 --> 00:23:03,320
which did an assessment before or they

514
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:06,600
have where people which are looking for

515
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:10,019
plaintext credentials then you have to

516
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:14,399
go to other tactics to other paths to

517
00:23:10,019 --> 00:23:16,769
get your information and in 2018 many

518
00:23:14,399 --> 00:23:21,178
middle attacks in networks still work

519
00:23:16,769 --> 00:23:24,029
and mostly they are undetected so here

520
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:27,149
one of the great tools is responder PI

521
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:31,470
because respondent is able to poison

522
00:23:27,149 --> 00:23:36,418
network multicast requests and redirect

523
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:40,639
all the clients to your own system and

524
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:43,769
then you are able to get a challenge

525
00:23:40,639 --> 00:23:48,240
random domain hashes which you are able

526
00:23:43,769 --> 00:23:51,590
to crack these hashes afterwards you get

527
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,759
them and it has also an SMB

528
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:57,449
authentication server so every user

529
00:23:53,759 --> 00:24:00,149
which goes to your server then windows

530
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:03,330
automatically authenticates him and you

531
00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:07,500
get his hash as well and a nice trick

532
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:10,830
here is just create SEF files put them

533
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:13,980
on globally available shares like a

534
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:16,168
transfer directory and every user which

535
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:18,389
just open this directory will

536
00:24:16,169 --> 00:24:21,269
automatically connect to your box and

537
00:24:18,389 --> 00:24:26,070
leave his credentials there it's really

538
00:24:21,269 --> 00:24:29,140
really useful but sometimes you have the

539
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:33,220
hash and then you get the password

540
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:35,710
but oh no the user or the company uses

541
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:38,710
multi-factor authentication they have

542
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:41,530
small carts and of course the pin code

543
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:44,740
of the smart card is not equal to the

544
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:48,030
password so you can't directly login

545
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:52,450
into computers without the smart card or

546
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:54,790
the pin code but again we have the anti

547
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:58,750
Elam hash the anti hash of the user and

548
00:24:54,790 --> 00:25:00,730
this gives us access to web backs web

549
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:03,820
apps which don't have multi-factor

550
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:07,330
authentication per default like Outlook

551
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:10,450
Web Access or you can access shares or

552
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:13,270
maybe we can access an eccentric portal

553
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:18,400
which streams application to users and

554
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:21,540
go on from there so without smart cards

555
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:24,940
we are still deep in the network we can

556
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:27,010
get mails we can get files and we can

557
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:30,370
maybe start applications so we don't

558
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:32,290
need logon directly to a computer when

559
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:37,389
you get all the other information out of

560
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:41,080
the ante hash password then sometimes

561
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:43,180
you don't have the possibility to get

562
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:46,240
user accounts but there are technical

563
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:48,880
accounts in the network as well and a

564
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,120
lot of companies they once set up an

565
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:54,940
account to run a service then they set

566
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:57,850
up the service on one or two or more

567
00:25:54,940 --> 00:26:00,220
systems and then they leave it they

568
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:01,659
don't change the password because when

569
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:04,540
you change the password of a service

570
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:07,660
account and something breaks every time

571
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:09,909
and then you have to trouble to debug to

572
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:11,470
find the right server so you better

573
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:14,650
leave it alone you have your password

574
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:18,900
and you leave it there don't change the

575
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:21,430
password ever again and maybe you use

576
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:23,370
not strong passwords you have a simple

577
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:26,830
password because you set up the user

578
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:28,389
just for testing a simple password then

579
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:30,399
you set it all up and then you don't

580
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:35,080
have the time to change the password and

581
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:39,040
we can use a technique called Kerberos

582
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:41,510
thing to get Kerberos tickets of service

583
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:45,560
accounts which are which you

584
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:49,190
kerberos authentication to run so as a

585
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:52,490
normal domain user we can get a careless

586
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:54,740
ticket office service account and from

587
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:58,340
there we can try to crack the password

588
00:26:54,740 --> 00:27:00,290
of a service user and afterwards we have

589
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:02,629
service user on most of the time the

590
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:05,389
server user has local admin rights on a

591
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:07,820
server and then the history repeats

592
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:09,890
itself we can go to the server use

593
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:14,899
password credentials for lateral

594
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:17,750
movement until we reach our goals there

595
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:20,120
are other possibilities to get service

596
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:23,990
accounts maybe you have a group policy

597
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:27,080
which creates a scheduled task or you

598
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:31,250
change the administrator password on all

599
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:34,250
clients with a group policy I mean not a

600
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:37,640
very wise idea and Microsoft published a

601
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:41,240
patch to three years ago about that

602
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:44,750
because the password is encrypted in

603
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:48,170
those files with a globally known key on

604
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:51,860
the MSDN library so everybody can

605
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:55,280
decrypt these passwords storts in group

606
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:59,209
policy preferences files you just get

607
00:27:55,280 --> 00:28:01,940
rid of them but don't forget to use long

608
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:06,440
strong random passwords for your service

609
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:09,650
accounts and then usually you're always

610
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:12,560
hey we go in we have ten different ways

611
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:14,120
to get to main admin the main administer

612
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:16,550
is the key for everything it's a

613
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:23,199
solution and it's the best thing you can

614
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:27,040
do but when you did once audit in

615
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:31,130
network and you get to management rights

616
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:34,190
you can imagine that the Active

617
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:36,290
Directory team will be pissed and they

618
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:37,760
are really pissed and they do everything

619
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:41,120
they can

620
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:43,820
and everything they know to catch you

621
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:46,489
the next time you do from stuff in their

622
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:50,030
network so the domain controllers will

623
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:53,630
be protected Active Directory groups

624
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:54,780
with domain admin permissions will be

625
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:57,810
monitored

626
00:28:54,780 --> 00:29:02,010
maybe they place honey accounts there

627
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:04,919
for you just to light traps so you

628
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:07,770
better leave domain controllers alone

629
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:10,950
maybe you don't go for domain admin I

630
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:13,200
mean if you get access to payment server

631
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:15,780
or customer system with normal user

632
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:19,650
accounts so why don't you need to mail

633
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:23,070
admin rights and this is a real-world

634
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:27,240
example we had a project two years ago

635
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:29,730
where we get a nice shiny new Windows 10

636
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,470
client and we found out hey there's a

637
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:34,890
privilege escalation on this client

638
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:37,860
which gives us local admin rights and

639
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:41,220
then we figured out hey we can use this

640
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:44,010
local admin rights to extract the

641
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:47,570
password of the local admin which is the

642
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:51,780
same on all other Windows 10 clients and

643
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:55,470
they're around 2000 Windows 10 clients

644
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:57,950
in the network so we can use these

645
00:29:55,470 --> 00:30:01,770
credentials to connect to each of this

646
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:04,980
clients wrong mimic hearts tear extract

647
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:10,230
the password of a logged in user and go

648
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:13,920
on and after we did this for two days we

649
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:16,800
had more than 400 active user accounts

650
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:19,530
and as you can see we have accounts from

651
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:22,500
business leaders from department

652
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:26,610
management business unit managers and

653
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:29,100
some accounts of members of the board so

654
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:33,060
we had access to all sensitive

655
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:37,649
information in that network just after a

656
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:39,899
quick two day run of a little tool we

657
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:43,440
programmed it's specific for that

658
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:46,860
purpose we used invoke mimikatz the

659
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:52,560
powershell version but built around a

660
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:55,050
tool to give just to use a host list and

661
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:57,690
then go from there read every host

662
00:30:55,050 --> 00:31:00,570
connect them roam mimic cards save the

663
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:04,320
output in a log file and after then we

664
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:07,439
had a bunch of log files and every every

665
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,610
one here which used miracles knows the

666
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,950
log files are big

667
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:16,250
and it's quite a pain to extract all the

668
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:20,160
nice little passwords out of these files

669
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:23,070
so we had another tool which just

670
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:25,650
extracted all the essential information

671
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:28,470
like the domain like the username and

672
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:31,230
the password or the anti hash and so

673
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:34,049
afterwards we could do everything we

674
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:36,450
wanted in that network but when you

675
00:31:34,049 --> 00:31:40,918
reach the technical goal your project

676
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:43,429
isn't finished there right that's

677
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:45,059
horrible timing to drink water but sure

678
00:31:43,429 --> 00:31:47,370
I'm really sorry

679
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:49,549
that's fine now that is all fun and

680
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:52,770
games but I mentioned before that

681
00:31:49,549 --> 00:31:54,450
penetration testing shouldn't be about

682
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:56,040
you know you're running in the company

683
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:59,130
doing all this cool and then just

684
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:01,520
like you know be like okay done okay so

685
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:03,780
raise your hand if you were a defender

686
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,590
you don't have to be afraid it's fine

687
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:08,070
really

688
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:10,110
it's quite a lot of you do you think

689
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:12,720
that you could detect you have the

690
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:16,969
technical capabilities to detect most of

691
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,970
that self you

692
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:33,689
I'll take dozen oh but generally you

693
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:36,780
could that's the answer you mostly get

694
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:37,350
like none of this stuff is rocket

695
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:39,780
science

696
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:41,550
like I will guess that all of you have

697
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:43,470
heard Mamie cuts before all of you have

698
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:46,980
seen this sort of thing happening before

699
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:49,020
and it still works somebody at the

700
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:50,820
speaker's dinner yesterday asked me when

701
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:52,950
was the last time you actually used no

702
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:55,590
day in a project I was like I don't know

703
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:57,080
2009 something like that because you

704
00:32:55,590 --> 00:33:00,570
usually don't need them it's

705
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:02,010
non-essential for to reach a success but

706
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:04,290
what this is all about in the

707
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:07,320
penetration test which is by all means

708
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:10,139
not a realistic attack it is still a

709
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:14,070
simulation it's all about the attacker

710
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:17,660
defender interaction this is where we

711
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:21,750
generate the value like that all before

712
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:23,730
it's just foreplay this is how you set

713
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:26,670
up improvement this is where you set up

714
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:27,990
growth for your company and you have a

715
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:30,990
couple of things that I want to talk

716
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:33,870
about in regards to that before you

717
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:36,000
start define how you're going to work

718
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:38,760
with your penetration testers that you

719
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,880
let inside your company there are two

720
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:43,710
modes that we generally use one is

721
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:46,350
concealed which is the mode where

722
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:48,690
usually there are only two or three

723
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:51,300
people involved on the customer side

724
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:54,180
everybody else is completely in the dark

725
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:57,480
sock doesn't know a thing admins no clue

726
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:59,670
you just enter you start you try to stay

727
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:02,310
selphie and in the end you sort of like

728
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:04,980
try to figure out what happened this the

729
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:06,750
other way in which is open which is fine

730
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:09,360
like a lot of people are afraid of them

731
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:11,610
open means you say from the get-go

732
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:14,130
we're running - we're going to run a

733
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:15,840
simulated attack we're going to see how

734
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:17,669
you can react to this it's going to

735
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:20,940
happen from then to then and we're going

736
00:34:17,668 --> 00:34:22,440
to do this side type of thing a lot of

737
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:24,060
customers are super afraid of that

738
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:27,630
because they don't trust their own

739
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:30,600
employees which is weird like if you

740
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:32,490
don't trust your own defenders what are

741
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,168
you still doing like you can close up

742
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:36,418
shop it doesn't matter anymore you don't

743
00:34:34,168 --> 00:34:39,029
need defenders if you don't trust them

744
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:41,009
if you do trust your defender so they're

745
00:34:39,029 --> 00:34:43,139
not going to fake what's wrong with

746
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:44,700
their defending capabilities they're

747
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:46,200
probably going to be very realistic

748
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:48,178
about they didn't have the capacity they

749
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:50,219
still need to deal with daily basis as

750
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:51,960
they do the test and you can still

751
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:54,299
simulate a lot of the things that we did

752
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:55,918
before and you can have daily touch

753
00:34:54,299 --> 00:34:58,200
meetings where you sort of see like well

754
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:59,430
we did see that you did this we didn't

755
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,288
see that you did this is a super

756
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,740
interesting let's let's go back to that

757
00:35:01,289 --> 00:35:05,369
later

758
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:09,149
see how we can improve on that we now

759
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:12,779
advise customers to schedule at least 10

760
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:15,200
to 40% of the entire engagement for post

761
00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:19,769
engagement interactions and workshops

762
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:22,109
and I mean all the stakeholders I mean

763
00:35:19,769 --> 00:35:23,729
the shock especially of course is the

764
00:35:22,109 --> 00:35:25,558
first line of defense in most companies

765
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:27,480
and enterprises but also mean the

766
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:30,390
administrators oh I also mean client

767
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:33,480
engineering really take into those

768
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:35,819
results work with those results and then

769
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:37,319
from that trough report that you

770
00:35:35,819 --> 00:35:39,089
probably gave them to sort of deal with

771
00:35:37,319 --> 00:35:43,970
like you know the sheer facts of what

772
00:35:39,089 --> 00:35:47,339
you did then draft the final report

773
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:49,618
we'll go back to that before that when I

774
00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:52,740
said like open tests concealed testing

775
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:55,410
when you do concealed testing what you

776
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:58,379
want to do from the get-go is you want

777
00:35:55,410 --> 00:36:02,930
to define when you are going to increase

778
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:06,299
noise levels because in some scenarios

779
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:08,038
you do your work at some point somebody

780
00:36:06,299 --> 00:36:10,230
knows this is something is off in the

781
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:12,420
network which it stuff is going on

782
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:14,069
maybe you triggered something maybe you

783
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:16,259
access to share you shouldn't have and

784
00:36:14,069 --> 00:36:17,700
then the right way starts where we sort

785
00:36:16,259 --> 00:36:19,589
of try to figure out like you know can

786
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:22,348
we be caught before we actually walk out

787
00:36:19,589 --> 00:36:24,710
with data in a lot of cases though or

788
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:27,960
more cases than I would like personally

789
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:31,019
the defenders especially on long term

790
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:34,339
engagements don't catch on very soon

791
00:36:31,019 --> 00:36:37,049
in those cases it's super interesting to

792
00:36:34,339 --> 00:36:40,140
increase the noise level of your

793
00:36:37,049 --> 00:36:42,269
activities in the network first you

794
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:44,038
start off by just increasing you know

795
00:36:42,269 --> 00:36:46,348
the rate of access that you're doing

796
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:49,049
maybe you access more shares in a short

797
00:36:46,349 --> 00:36:50,140
period of time and you just like keep

798
00:36:49,049 --> 00:36:51,819
going go

799
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:54,519
nuts with it like in the end like we had

800
00:36:51,819 --> 00:36:56,170
one project in a sort of a smallish

801
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:58,328
company who was a bit overwhelmed with

802
00:36:56,170 --> 00:37:00,849
what we were doing we ended up doing

803
00:36:58,329 --> 00:37:03,039
like a Metasploit Hail Mary attack on

804
00:37:00,849 --> 00:37:05,019
like the server segment like okay let's

805
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:09,460
see what triggers it did actually

806
00:37:05,019 --> 00:37:12,129
trigger something so all Scott cool and

807
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:13,539
last one is like when you attack when

808
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:16,779
you define attack scenarios as a

809
00:37:13,539 --> 00:37:19,000
penetration tester you don't want to

810
00:37:16,779 --> 00:37:21,069
have parallelism like it can be very

811
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,990
tempting and it's also a hallmark of

812
00:37:21,069 --> 00:37:25,150
real attacks that a lot of stuff can

813
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:27,220
happen at the same time especially when

814
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:29,890
you're working with more than one tester

815
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:33,129
at the same time but try to keep your

816
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:37,558
activity strictly serialize and for the

817
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:40,839
love of God time stamp everything you do

818
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:42,760
your customers sock will love you so

819
00:37:40,839 --> 00:37:44,920
much more if you can provide them

820
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,619
specific bit specific time stamps of

821
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:49,569
that particular privilege escalation

822
00:37:47,619 --> 00:37:51,730
that you did on that host that they may

823
00:37:49,569 --> 00:37:54,490
not have caught because then they can go

824
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:56,109
back and maybe they'll see ya there was

825
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:57,959
an alert actually for an access and

826
00:37:56,109 --> 00:38:00,578
there should have been an another alert

827
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:02,289
that didn't trick it because the timeout

828
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:03,670
was too long something like that you can

829
00:38:02,289 --> 00:38:05,200
only get that if you have valid

830
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:07,630
information about the timing you have

831
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,399
been using also if you see realize that

832
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:12,039
you can repeat those attacks together

833
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:15,009
with the sock and then you can see if

834
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:16,509
improvements have actually been made as

835
00:38:15,009 --> 00:38:18,670
bad as that before that you should

836
00:38:16,509 --> 00:38:20,819
collaborate with all these parties and

837
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:25,210
sort of craft the final report together

838
00:38:20,819 --> 00:38:29,558
as sort of a team then you get to my

839
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:32,769
core point whatever you find in such an

840
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:34,839
engagement whatever your core findings

841
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:36,640
are like maybe you need more money maybe

842
00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:39,328
you need more resources maybe you need

843
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:42,788
to tweak the resources you already have

844
00:38:39,329 --> 00:38:45,700
to better be able to cope with the

845
00:38:42,789 --> 00:38:47,259
demands of your fret situation maybe you

846
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,970
need to spend those five hundred bucks

847
00:38:47,259 --> 00:38:51,970
on training or five thousand bucks on

848
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:55,450
training on somebody whatever it is make

849
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:59,799
sure your report that you get in the end

850
00:38:55,450 --> 00:39:01,689
is suitable and you're happy enough with

851
00:38:59,799 --> 00:39:03,970
it and everybody that is involved is

852
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:06,370
happy enough with it so you can at least

853
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:08,890
bring it to one decision maker within

854
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:11,470
your enterprise if you do a penetration

855
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:14,680
test or red team engagement or any sort

856
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:17,200
of prolonged expensive offensive

857
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:19,480
activity and you don't get it to a

858
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,069
decision maker somebody who actually is

859
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:24,580
in charge of how your company makes

860
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:28,270
business you are wasting money best case

861
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:30,009
you can get it up to a CEO level or CTO

862
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:34,360
level at least and get some actually

863
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:37,290
actual change going there is a very

864
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:41,020
significant change in how we find

865
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:43,810
environments that get support from top

866
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:48,600
level management in their development of

867
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:50,890
their security program versus versus

868
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:52,390
environments that are just left with

869
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:54,330
their existing budget their existing

870
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:56,980
resources because as I said before

871
00:39:54,330 --> 00:40:00,700
defenders do generally the best they can

872
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:03,310
with what they have so if you if that's

873
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:04,990
not enough you need to show that you do

874
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:07,270
need more to do good work

875
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:12,009
so make a count when you do the sort of

876
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:14,080
impact at the sort of testing we have

877
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:16,270
some resources that we put together that

878
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:19,180
sort of sums up the stuff that we used

879
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:20,620
in this presentation again it's not

880
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:22,720
rocket science if you want to get

881
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:25,480
started and like experiment within your

882
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,500
own network you can like we're not

883
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:29,260
smarter than you

884
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:31,720
quite the contrary I think but anyway so

885
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:33,850
you can get started at any point you can

886
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:35,500
do things in your own network and I

887
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:36,970
think you should thanks so much for

888
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:39,990
listening if there are any questions

889
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:39,990
please shoot

890
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:48,770
awesome thank you very much guys that I

891
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:50,390
was really cool talked us into again

892
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:51,680
school just to go back to basics and

893
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:53,330
hear those foundational principle

894
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,430
sometimes like yeah that's exactly what

895
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:57,650
is about is just keeping that puzzle

896
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:59,299
mine something right I love it

897
00:40:57,650 --> 00:41:00,740
do we have any questions we still have a

898
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:02,390
bit of time before the coffee break now

899
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:05,589
so do we have any questions anyone has

900
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:08,150
one they're beautiful

901
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:12,080
keeping me fit today I love it my Fitbit

902
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:15,110
is loving me today thank you yes I have

903
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:19,220
a question if you actually get a

904
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:20,780
contract and work at at a company are

905
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:25,189
you doing your job are you actually

906
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:28,010
getting a job I'm working on it well

907
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:30,800
funny enough Mik here was a professional

908
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:35,080
sa P consultant for nine months at a

909
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:50,420
time can you write this on your resume I

910
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:54,740
wouldn't anyone else so great

911
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:57,200
presentation Thanks you mentioned two

912
00:41:54,740 --> 00:42:01,029
different modes like a red teaming or a

913
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:03,439
purple teaming approach could you

914
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:06,440
explain a bit more what would you

915
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:10,520
recommend to companies the purple

916
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:13,220
teaming or the red teaming approach it's

917
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:15,410
a really tricky question I think it

918
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:18,770
depends very heavily on your environment

919
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:21,799
like I got a similar question recently

920
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:23,930
and the background of that question was

921
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:26,120
what would you do in our specific

922
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:30,109
environment and the reason for the

923
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:32,480
question there was you know talk is like

924
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:34,730
stories from the trenches and more often

925
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,440
than not sadly there are trenches in

926
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:39,620
even in the environments that you go

927
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:42,380
into and there are cases where a

928
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:45,620
concealed approach is just not feasible

929
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:48,110
for various reasons like if internal

930
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:50,720
audit for example starts doing some

931
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:54,200
stuff like that it will sometimes start

932
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:56,029
massive conflicts between you know the

933
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,538
engineering parts of the company the

934
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:59,749
controlling

935
00:42:56,539 --> 00:43:03,140
heart so in those cases we usually try

936
00:42:59,749 --> 00:43:05,149
to get people to the table and get them

937
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:07,009
like on board very early in the process

938
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:09,559
and in that case of proper teaming

939
00:43:07,009 --> 00:43:13,130
approaches he called it it's for me more

940
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:15,130
suitable but in general when I just look

941
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:17,269
at results that we had recently I

942
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:23,559
wouldn't I wouldn't prefer one of the

943
00:43:17,269 --> 00:43:23,558
order personally cool any more questions

944
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:35,239
yeah I'm not not sure how it is in

945
00:43:33,049 --> 00:43:37,038
Switzerland but um in case you were to

946
00:43:35,239 --> 00:43:40,099
that in Germany and also at our

947
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:41,900
companies and then I would expect the

948
00:43:40,099 --> 00:43:44,179
privacy guys to go nuts when you're

949
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:46,099
saying oh we're accessing that driver or

950
00:43:44,179 --> 00:43:47,749
that employee machine and it has data

951
00:43:46,099 --> 00:43:50,229
from the employees or from the customers

952
00:43:47,749 --> 00:43:54,439
on there how much of a problem it that

953
00:43:50,229 --> 00:43:56,509
it's always a discussion point we kind

954
00:43:54,439 --> 00:44:00,379
of take the liberty of leaving that

955
00:43:56,509 --> 00:44:02,419
discussion to the to legal themes of the

956
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:05,089
companies we work for because we are not

957
00:44:02,419 --> 00:44:06,890
lawyers we have a lawyer on retainer and

958
00:44:05,089 --> 00:44:11,449
we try not to use it because it spends

959
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:13,999
our conference budget but the the

960
00:44:11,449 --> 00:44:15,799
general like I can't really answer a

961
00:44:13,999 --> 00:44:18,229
question for you because usually what we

962
00:44:15,799 --> 00:44:19,999
do is we write it out in our like we we

963
00:44:18,229 --> 00:44:21,919
have a disclaimer in our contract that

964
00:44:19,999 --> 00:44:25,339
puts the responsibility on the side of

965
00:44:21,919 --> 00:44:27,979
the contracting company is contracting

966
00:44:25,339 --> 00:44:30,259
us and in the end what I need is a

967
00:44:27,979 --> 00:44:33,229
confirmation from them that we are in

968
00:44:30,259 --> 00:44:35,929
the clear what they do on their side I

969
00:44:33,229 --> 00:44:37,819
assume like you know I just believe

970
00:44:35,929 --> 00:44:40,819
enough in our customers being

971
00:44:37,819 --> 00:44:43,308
professional to actually sort of respect

972
00:44:40,819 --> 00:44:46,849
the privacy aspects of this we on our

973
00:44:43,309 --> 00:44:50,929
side try very very very hard to respect

974
00:44:46,849 --> 00:44:52,999
the privacy of users like we really go

975
00:44:50,929 --> 00:44:55,130
for business data and we try really to

976
00:44:52,999 --> 00:44:56,569
leave everything that might be like in

977
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:59,919
personal folders and stuff like that

978
00:44:56,569 --> 00:45:03,079
alone that's the best we can do really

979
00:44:59,919 --> 00:45:04,929
great final chance for any more

980
00:45:03,079 --> 00:45:07,929
questions anyone with another question

981
00:45:04,929 --> 00:45:07,929
beautiful

982
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:13,830
our customers not afraid of breaking

983
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:16,040
their productive systems and has this

984
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:16,040
happened

985
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:24,300
well nothing sometimes they are afraid

986
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:26,759
and they say ok you don't you're not

987
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:30,000
allowed to touch production system but

988
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:34,260
then well most of the time you have the

989
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:37,890
need to touch them because to access the

990
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:40,950
goal you have to go to longer ways or

991
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:43,560
maybe you need to access how can you

992
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:46,379
prove that you have access to customer

993
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:48,840
data if you don't are allowed to touch

994
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:51,510
production systems or some some

995
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:53,400
companies have only accounts in the

996
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:56,760
production system and some few test

997
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:59,940
accounts in other systems so I think I

998
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:02,510
think we try not to break any stuff and

999
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:06,240
luckily for us we didn't broke any

1000
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:10,200
production service in our assessment so

1001
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:14,339
I think we can say we are lucky enough

1002
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:17,029
to not break stuff and we don't force or

1003
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:19,830
we we don't force our hands to do

1004
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:24,980
complicated things which maybe destroy a

1005
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:28,770
process or so I think we should not

1006
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:31,110
leave the production system alone but if

1007
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:36,800
a customer's really really says ok don't

1008
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:36,800
touch them then then we do that cool

1009
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:43,740
minutes I mean we can keep going I guess

1010
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:45,480
if you're not ready to have your

1011
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:47,129
production systems tested then you're

1012
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:51,540
probably not ready for this kind of

1013
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:53,250
testing yeah I guess I mean the thing

1014
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:56,430
like there's a funny anecdote that comes

1015
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:58,410
with that which is in one case our

1016
00:46:56,430 --> 00:47:01,350
customer made a really strong point

1017
00:46:58,410 --> 00:47:04,410
about like we have identical test

1018
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:06,299
environment but like you know anonymized

1019
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:08,790
state we have that for exactly that

1020
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:12,140
purpose like you know the other yeah all

1021
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:15,960
of that and what ended up happening is

1022
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:17,759
we found quite an easy way into the

1023
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:20,160
production server which would have

1024
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,140
allowed us to directly pivot into the

1025
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,210
test server

1026
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:26,180
like the other day the enormous data

1027
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:28,339
would lay but we couldn't get for

1028
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:30,379
restrictions of the test environment get

1029
00:47:28,339 --> 00:47:32,269
directly into the testing server so

1030
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:33,920
imagine the quality of a discussion

1031
00:47:32,269 --> 00:47:38,569
where you're having where you're like

1032
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:42,819
well I'm not actually on the production

1033
00:47:38,569 --> 00:47:42,819
server I'm just sort of passing through

1034
00:47:43,299 --> 00:47:49,279
so for companies who may not have done

1035
00:47:47,029 --> 00:47:54,319
Red Team testing before at what point

1036
00:47:49,279 --> 00:47:57,589
can you is your security policies and

1037
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:59,990
processes so advanced that you can go

1038
00:47:57,589 --> 00:48:01,788
from occasionally doing scans and

1039
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:03,529
testing to actually doing read tests Red

1040
00:48:01,789 --> 00:48:07,329
Team testing is there a point where you

1041
00:48:03,529 --> 00:48:10,579
can identify that this is the next step

1042
00:48:07,329 --> 00:48:12,559
that's a really good question um we

1043
00:48:10,579 --> 00:48:14,119
usually do like a preliminary talk with

1044
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:16,640
people where we just ask them about

1045
00:48:14,119 --> 00:48:21,109
their security posture sort of a self

1046
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:22,730
assessment but it's hard to tell from

1047
00:48:21,109 --> 00:48:25,519
there because self assessments are

1048
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:27,529
tricky for various reasons I think you

1049
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:33,500
should know that very well to yourself

1050
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:37,190
and we've had situations in which we

1051
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:39,380
started testing we had reserved multiple

1052
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:41,809
weeks of like time span and we had to

1053
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:44,170
stop within like the first two days

1054
00:48:41,809 --> 00:48:47,329
because it was just but there was

1055
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:49,099
basically no resistance and that's a

1056
00:48:47,329 --> 00:48:50,839
point where you should be professional

1057
00:48:49,099 --> 00:48:52,549
enough to take a step back I mean it's

1058
00:48:50,839 --> 00:48:54,380
super cool to just own the entire

1059
00:48:52,549 --> 00:48:56,150
network within a couple of days like

1060
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:58,940
that's fine and all but it just doesn't

1061
00:48:56,150 --> 00:49:01,039
make sense to spend that money I don't

1062
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:03,349
think there is a threshold I think if

1063
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:05,119
you were mature like if you were

1064
00:49:03,349 --> 00:49:07,009
security posture is mature enough that

1065
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:10,309
you employ people multiple people

1066
00:49:07,009 --> 00:49:13,460
full-time whose job it is to secure your

1067
00:49:10,309 --> 00:49:16,339
data your customer data then I think you

1068
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:17,990
should be able to do basic red team

1069
00:49:16,339 --> 00:49:19,730
style testing I'm not saying you should

1070
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:21,558
go like you know nuts into full scope

1071
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:24,950
and everything but you should be able to

1072
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:27,170
like start with that but for like

1073
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:29,450
smaller medium companies who like have

1074
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:30,859
like the one IT guy who runs they're

1075
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:33,288
like you know all their stuff is in

1076
00:49:30,859 --> 00:49:34,400
charge of like making sure that the one

1077
00:49:33,289 --> 00:49:36,500
CD burner

1078
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:38,809
still half in the company works and also

1079
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:41,270
security like maybe it's not the right

1080
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:43,549
type of testing maybe what you need is

1081
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:44,990
somebody that you can train or maybe

1082
00:49:43,549 --> 00:49:47,420
what you need is somebody comes into

1083
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:49,399
your company and helps you secure it and

1084
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:53,390
not somebody who like tries to break

1085
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:56,210
your stuff cool anyone else with a

1086
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:57,470
burning question otherwise we can move

1087
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:59,960
on to the coffee break

1088
00:49:57,470 --> 00:50:01,209
great yeah so thank you very much please

1089
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:04,869
give it up once more

1090
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:06,930
[Applause]

1091
00:50:04,869 --> 00:50:06,930
you

1092
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:10,450
you
