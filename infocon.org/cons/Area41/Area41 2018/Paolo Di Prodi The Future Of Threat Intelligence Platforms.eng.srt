1
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:08,580
afternoon everybody

2
00:00:06,049 --> 00:00:12,570
so I'm Powell and I work for

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:15,059
440 net and the particularism is an

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,369
internal division called 40 guard which

5
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:20,310
focuses on as you can imagine threat

6
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:22,500
intelligence platforms and services but

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,198
I'm not eager to sell any fortunate

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,210
products today and not going to kind of

9
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,760
encourage you to buy our products it's

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:32,250
just like research that I've been doing

11
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:37,350
since joining 40 net last month actually

12
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:39,239
Sisk when you and so so summary of the

13
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:42,090
talk is about you know what is a friend

14
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:45,809
intelligence platform and services

15
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:47,910
what is the cyber threat Alliance I'll

16
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:51,480
do people actually share data in the

17
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:54,029
Alliance how do we manage right now

18
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,349
private sense privacy and anonymity in

19
00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:00,359
the in the Alliance what kind of attacks

20
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:03,930
people are performing the past against

21
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:05,820
anonymity and then the one of potential

22
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:09,960
solutions is to adopt differential

23
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:12,839
privacy and I will put one example just

24
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,270
a very educational example our use

25
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,790
differential privacy there would be an

26
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:21,509
example with federated machine learning

27
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:24,630
and another one with a morphic machine

28
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:26,700
learning right and then we do a brief

29
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,710
overview of walking to which companies

30
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:32,810
are working on differential privacy and

31
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:36,509
some roadmap form for our current

32
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:38,540
platform and then some questions at the

33
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:38,540
end

34
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:48,020
yeah so I'm a big disclaimer I am NOT a

35
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:52,829
crypto expert so I know there are few

36
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:54,899
crypto people in this room so please I

37
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:58,649
apologize the advances some of the

38
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:00,810
formulas are oversimplified I've been

39
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:03,030
working cyber security in the last seven

40
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:06,689
years I work for Microsoft before and

41
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:09,509
other small companies in the UK my

42
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:13,290
previous research was in AI and robotics

43
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:17,190
so I was working on prosthetics

44
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:19,560
artificial gate this was at the MIT in

45
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:22,140
Boston so it was developing I'd not if

46
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,780
you see this nowadays it's those things

47
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:27,809
are damn heavy can you imagine any but

48
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,430
that was like metal and aluminum was its

49
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,959
process it was like I thought it was

50
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,720
like twenty kilo or something so I met

51
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,000
nowadays they've all this leak you know

52
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,340
new materials quite lightweight that

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,989
that was at the title must have been 15

54
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,769
years or something like that you see

55
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:47,190
this today just a big laugh there would

56
00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:49,140
be animation in the slides I just don't

57
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:50,790
like them and yeah there were no

58
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,349
mathematicians where I'm doing these

59
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:57,019
presentations oh I can promise you that

60
00:02:52,349 --> 00:03:00,450
yeah I also worked on swarm intelligence

61
00:02:57,019 --> 00:03:01,950
and this can be somehow that's why I

62
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:04,950
kind of went cyber security the result

63
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:09,349
of applications of swarm intelligence in

64
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:15,000
cyber security but that's not for today

65
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:17,250
so can ever you know I'll ask a few

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,380
slides who raise your hands just to get

67
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:22,709
some few statistics for myself how many

68
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:25,680
people know about actually use a threat

69
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:31,019
intelligence platform in this room okay

70
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,880
what that's good and yeah so you know

71
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:36,480
for people that doesn't know about that

72
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:38,160
it's you know I rather describe it by

73
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,090
the actual functionality rather than

74
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:43,200
using an official definition but the

75
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,329
purpose of a threat intelligence

76
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,929
platform is to aggregate intelligence

77
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:50,519
from multiple sources and you know

78
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:53,669
there's a you know you can pay those

79
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,410
free ones paid ones the different

80
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:56,970
formats and kind of stuff

81
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:58,650
but the idea is to basically curate

82
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:02,280
normalize and they ingest all these

83
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:04,829
external feeds and then integrate those

84
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,530
data with the existing security systems

85
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:10,319
of products do you have so you know you

86
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:12,949
might have your firewall IPS and point

87
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:16,738
products where you say PR in the u.s.

88
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:18,180
CRM solution and obviously there are

89
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:21,839
lots of vendors doing that we are not

90
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:24,719
the only one so so for T net we launched

91
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,760
the T is there was a there was a t

92
00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:30,210
before that they remove it

93
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:33,450
that wasn't very politically correct so

94
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:38,070
1480s was launched last year in 2017 in

95
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:39,300
June so you can register its you want to

96
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:41,909
be honest you won't find much

97
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,140
interesting stuff because quite new but

98
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,820
we're working on that but you know

99
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:46,919
there's there's other vendors which have

100
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,840
been in this market for for a long time

101
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:52,920
so this there's this more data in there

102
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:54,450
I I this is just like a short list of

103
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,640
you know if I missed everybody in this

104
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:58,500
room please don't feel offended it

105
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:01,020
wasn't enough space but you know there's

106
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,420
a normally paloalto erase a lookingglass

107
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:05,250
cyber solutions logarithm fireEye and

108
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:07,560
involved they're not in any particular

109
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:11,640
order so it's not any one better than

110
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:13,260
the other ones and so obviously if you

111
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,909
have a platform it's kind of pointless

112
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:18,180
if you don't have data inside your

113
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:19,860
platform so that's why you need to you

114
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,240
know it depends on your size of your

115
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,890
company so if you're a big company like

116
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,200
when I was working for Microsoft

117
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:28,050
I had telemetry for every possible

118
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:30,170
customer from from desktop to server so

119
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:32,630
it was ingesting a huge amount of

120
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:35,220
telemetry from from you know both

121
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:37,800
internal corporate networks bowels like

122
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,150
external customers but you know if

123
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,190
you're a small company then much

124
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:43,799
visibility yeah you know there's no way

125
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:46,500
you have to buy fright Intel from

126
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,360
somebody and you know I put a few of

127
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:52,350
them so you have virustotal fireEye and

128
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:54,180
a two focuses the providers and then you

129
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:56,070
know you put all these massive data set

130
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,560
you combine them in your platform and

131
00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:01,320
then if you have a sock you know your

132
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,480
sock security team will basically log

133
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:06,599
into this platform and do fret hunting

134
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:08,520
you're discovering new trends find new

135
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,810
stuff and so on and they can write

136
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,940
reports on that when you can publish

137
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:13,890
them for the industry etcetera

138
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,690
obviously some of them are free some of

139
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:19,229
them obviously free stuff is not as good

140
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:21,000
as the one you pay but there's also paid

141
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:24,420
services which are not that good so I

142
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,280
don't want to make any names but big

143
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,840
question is how do you trust you know

144
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,179
how do you actually monitor the quality

145
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,489
of the feeds you get every time you buy

146
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:34,260
for a new cast from a new feed right so

147
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:37,380
it's kind of a big problem in in this

148
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:40,020
kind of market but hopefully there are

149
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,979
some solutions that we talked about you

150
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:46,979
can achieve

151
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:50,370
with the differential privacy so then

152
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:54,810
you have so these are like technologies

153
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:57,870
but you need to find a way for companies

154
00:06:54,810 --> 00:07:01,770
that are possibly in a competitive

155
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:05,729
market to share data by not cooperative

156
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:07,919
environment and so there are a few

157
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:11,070
Alliance Alliance is cyber threat

158
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:15,120
alliance in so this is something that 14

159
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:18,389
I'd basically build how many years ago

160
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:21,900
and there are currently 16 16 partners

161
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:23,850
and I kind of managed to copy and past

162
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:27,539
of the logos they're in no particular

163
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:29,130
order so but they're all of them there

164
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:33,449
are companies and some of them are

165
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:35,039
national telecom companies and you know

166
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:37,169
the the entire point of having an

167
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:40,849
alliance is that there's a relationship

168
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:43,919
of trust a trust between them and

169
00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:47,280
obviously there are policies in place

170
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:49,799
that to avoid collisions or competition

171
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,570
or device and my feed you of bad Intel

172
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,240
and then a good published an article you

173
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:57,479
look like a fool and then maybe you know

174
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,280
I will revenge in the next time you know

175
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:02,699
I will do the same thing so there are

176
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:06,090
policies and boards that you know talks

177
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:07,949
about things like but the interest but

178
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:12,510
always obviously and that's not always

179
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:14,699
true because things up and right so this

180
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:19,740
is a recent example this was an incident

181
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:25,340
that happened in 20 sort of May 2018 so

182
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:25,340
so Cisco Talos anybody from Cisco Taos

183
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:33,120
they they had much more visibility than

184
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:36,630
than us at ISP level and they you know

185
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:39,510
they did some research on what this kind

186
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:42,000
of IOT marvel warm could be on filter

187
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:44,670
and you know they wrote an article and

188
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,020
basically they you know they are part of

189
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:48,390
the Alliance everybody in the Alliance

190
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:50,130
received a document which is not ideal

191
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:52,529
because TBO you will do it with in a

192
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:54,540
machine readable format like sticks one

193
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:56,699
or two and

194
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:58,740
you receive a PDF which said okay this

195
00:08:56,699 --> 00:09:02,099
is what the malware does these are all

196
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:03,690
dc2 domains the IP the second IP is

197
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,160
first three second stage

198
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:07,560
Hoshi's the actual samples and

199
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:10,800
everything but unfortunately when I was

200
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:14,130
looking a telemetry so those samples

201
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,500
were just even to us I think it was

202
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:18,930
midnight in UK time and I was looking on

203
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,880
virustotal right those samples weren't

204
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:22,888
supposed to be shared any anywhere else

205
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,600
it's not but then suddenly you see

206
00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:27,540
somebody uploaded the sample and

207
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,829
virustotal right then you ask must have

208
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,439
been somebody from the Alliance right

209
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:31,920
and so things happened maybe was by

210
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,250
mistake

211
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,920
like the analysts do you know about the

212
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:39,990
policy but you know human error is

213
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,479
always there no this this you know you

214
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:44,880
can't prevent that and I mean if you can

215
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,589
go back and pan and find out who did it

216
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,139
you know because virus to the reason by

217
00:09:46,589 --> 00:09:51,690
Google and maybe Cisco talks to Google

218
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:53,220
and say I can it but yeah nobody did

219
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:54,269
anything it was it wasn't a big deal but

220
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:58,829
you know things happened so it's not

221
00:09:54,269 --> 00:10:00,360
always as perfect as it seems so it

222
00:09:58,829 --> 00:10:02,339
seems like a kind of a paradox where

223
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,750
people say well okay you have you know

224
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:06,089
you have a data sharing platform but

225
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:08,490
like I mean why do you talk about

226
00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:10,050
privacy because well I mean it's meant

227
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:14,089
to be open and everybody needs to share

228
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:17,339
but for very good reasons because

229
00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:19,709
obviously you know if there are no

230
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:22,649
privacy or like guarantees in place

231
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:25,829
people are not going to share the you

232
00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:31,980
know samples or or audit logs and I kind

233
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:34,109
of made a sort of a ranking of file

234
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,029
types and how sensitive they are and

235
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:38,579
many people in this room maybe will have

236
00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:40,410
different opinions because maybe you

237
00:10:38,579 --> 00:10:42,540
know I mean it's it's very subjective

238
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:45,389
but so on the left side of the spectrum

239
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:47,730
you have you know data that usually when

240
00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:50,399
those consider like low privacy so you

241
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:52,860
know if you have an external IP you know

242
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,259
that that doesn't belong to any customer

243
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:57,269
or you know to any particular vendor so

244
00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:59,250
it's you should be considered to be okay

245
00:10:57,269 --> 00:11:02,100
as long as you don't tamper with the IP

246
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:05,639
which is usually offenses you get you

247
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:07,500
know website domains binary files like

248
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:09,780
binary compiled file although

249
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:12,830
recently we have seen cases where the

250
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:15,420
attacker having for especially for IPT

251
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:17,880
cases the attacker actually had included

252
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:21,810
username and passwords passwords of the

253
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:23,610
from a previous exfiltration stage from

254
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:27,959
the from the target so they were like

255
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:29,880
you know NL TM hashes of the of the you

256
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,650
know of the ordinate Fork of the of the

257
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:35,220
custom they were talking right so like

258
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:37,740
well okay so so so you know so people a

259
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:39,870
little bit cautious now by sharing even

260
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,850
like binary fact because inside the the

261
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:44,070
compiled finally sometimes there might

262
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:46,650
be you know sensitive information that

263
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:47,880
and it's very artful only because there

264
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:50,520
are no tools to do that right now so

265
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,560
it's it's so I put it on load but it

266
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:56,370
might change in the future right sandbox

267
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:59,579
detonation is kind of okay we there are

268
00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:01,800
cases where there are specific attack

269
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:04,140
groups that they they try to fingerprint

270
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,550
the particular sign books that they've

271
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,439
been running to so you you find

272
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:10,079
interesting Springs a string so we're

273
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,180
the Microsoft we had a sandbox solution

274
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:15,000
and they were you know really targeting

275
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:16,800
that that one too so yeah so you know

276
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,460
Excel kind of yeah it's not lobe in the

277
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,770
middle

278
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:22,080
obviously the software versions and

279
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:23,760
policy use internally and oh yeah you

280
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,110
don't really want to release that with

281
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:29,130
everybody knows if you're vulnerable or

282
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:30,960
not then you have emails that you know

283
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:33,270
contains everything inside like

284
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,950
appointments credit cards but I could be

285
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:37,589
everything inside who is sending to what

286
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:40,440
and then on the right side which is what

287
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:42,839
people generally don't share too much

288
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:46,050
with the Alliance is with no windows

289
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:48,089
event logs and I've seen so many things

290
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:50,430
like when I was looking at Windows event

291
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:53,310
logs this everything from well IP

292
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:54,750
addresses obviously you have specific

293
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:56,339
programs when they open a new tab you

294
00:12:54,750 --> 00:13:00,540
can see the URL from the command line

295
00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:03,120
you can see hashes like password dashes

296
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:05,459
in the comment line you can see you know

297
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,500
if your FTP username passwords people

298
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:10,610
are slopping they just put in clear

299
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:13,440
username passed in common line events

300
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:16,020
you know work station names user names

301
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,150
and all sorts of stuff

302
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:20,160
Word documents I didn't mention but in

303
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:21,329
emails you will think wow okay I don't

304
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,160
care about the in

305
00:13:21,329 --> 00:13:24,359
okay I'm not going to give you the the

306
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,339
the word document but there were

307
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,199
examples where the word document the

308
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:32,279
title of the document was something like

309
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:38,099
meeting of the CEO with this government

310
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:40,110
official in Israel date all right so

311
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,579
that was enough to basically see what

312
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:44,459
was going on in the company just by the

313
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:45,420
title of the actual document pickups of

314
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:49,229
course

315
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:50,699
okay IP MAC address URL HTTP tell

316
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:53,100
everything that you know it's not inside

317
00:13:50,699 --> 00:13:55,258
SSL you can you know again you can get

318
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,959
all the information by doea is easier to

319
00:13:55,259 --> 00:14:02,910
anonymize Linux logs obviously audit

320
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:05,670
logs okay so you know so people say okay

321
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:07,709
so what I can do is I can anonymize all

322
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:09,179
this data right so I can just before I

323
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:12,299
send it to the threat intelligence

324
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:15,149
platform I can do some magic I can do

325
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:17,249
something you know I can hash some of

326
00:14:15,149 --> 00:14:19,679
the fields that I know need to then I

327
00:14:17,249 --> 00:14:21,689
send it there there's a bunch of people

328
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:23,339
in the platform they do we that

329
00:14:21,689 --> 00:14:26,099
automatically manually divide I P

330
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:28,199
signatures a V signatures web signature

331
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:31,049
whatever they do internal monitoring

332
00:14:28,199 --> 00:14:32,639
then release it to their customers there

333
00:14:31,049 --> 00:14:35,009
is all the signatures hopefully as fast

334
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,499
enough and then maybe you discover more

335
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:39,179
and then you get this kind of a positive

336
00:14:37,499 --> 00:14:41,699
feedback loop where you get more

337
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:43,850
binaries and yuri anonymize and we put

338
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:46,998
in the path line so this is kind of

339
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:51,059
looks like good in principle but

340
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:54,660
actually it's not as as good as it looks

341
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:56,939
like so this is sorry

342
00:14:54,660 --> 00:15:00,329
so that's a No Limit is this is talking

343
00:14:56,939 --> 00:15:02,549
about privacy there's these two concept

344
00:15:00,329 --> 00:15:04,378
in differential privacy one is local

345
00:15:02,549 --> 00:15:07,529
privacy it's crazy to understand in

346
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:09,929
global privacy and it's the same you can

347
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:12,209
apply the same concept to anonymizing

348
00:15:09,929 --> 00:15:16,799
logs but idea is on local privacy ask

349
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:19,469
this scenario you add noise add source

350
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:22,230
right so you let's say you anonymize is

351
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:26,129
anonymous your data before you send it

352
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:27,660
to a central aggregator okay and in

353
00:15:26,129 --> 00:15:29,339
differential privacy there is a think or

354
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,889
undermines response that help you to do

355
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:34,049
to do that to achieve good current

356
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:35,220
guarantees in privacy then your goal

357
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:36,959
privacy where you put

358
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:39,990
stuff first in the central database

359
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:42,839
right and then Dion Aliso ever has

360
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:46,350
access to that a database can only do

361
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:47,639
queries which are privacy productive

362
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:49,379
right and there's another mathematical

363
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:52,920
object called a blast noise that can

364
00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:55,920
help you to achieve that obviously just

365
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:58,800
raise your hands who thinks the the

366
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:05,569
local privacy approach is better than

367
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:08,089
the the global 102 and the global one I

368
00:16:05,569 --> 00:16:10,589
guess is the opposite

369
00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:12,329
there's different philosophy but the

370
00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:15,290
main problem here is that if somebody

371
00:16:12,329 --> 00:16:18,839
hack you if you're using a GoBot privacy

372
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:21,920
setup somebody hacks your you know your

373
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:24,660
main DB everything is in clear right so

374
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:27,329
but with this one right there's no way

375
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:29,600
you go back to the source and find the

376
00:16:27,329 --> 00:16:32,310
original data right but there are that

377
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,500
this pros and cons but generally the

378
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:37,349
left side is more secure the left

379
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,459
approach became so people say well okay

380
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,930
yeah why are you talking about

381
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:40,920
differential privacy yeah you know this

382
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:43,019
this concept

383
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:45,949
okay anonymity how many people have

384
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:53,670
heard of this okay some people wanna see

385
00:16:45,949 --> 00:16:57,719
since 99 98 1998 Italian lady and yeah I

386
00:16:53,670 --> 00:17:00,329
was really to become very big so it was

387
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:02,399
like yeah I was Indian already about

388
00:17:00,329 --> 00:17:04,649
that somebody implement I implemented it

389
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,319
in a public API and then if you remember

390
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:10,079
this was still their website that shows

391
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:11,520
you know if service was act and your

392
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,158
email was in there you can go and check

393
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,589
if your email was act and they were

394
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:20,010
using a knme-tv for for doing that

395
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:21,928
anonymously and and the main concept is

396
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:25,049
you see suppression or generalization to

397
00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:26,429
touchy privacy but that's not included

398
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:28,918
orientation and we see later why it's

399
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:30,390
important so it's and unfortunately it's

400
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:34,169
not a very good method in high

401
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:38,490
dimensional data because it's moveable

402
00:17:34,169 --> 00:17:40,710
to join to joining attacks but it's I

403
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:42,780
mean it's a weak privacy Macanese and

404
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:45,330
there are variations of that they are

405
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:47,760
stronger than the vanilla argue it but

406
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:49,199
it's kind of good to evaluate a privacy

407
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,408
in their ability right

408
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,470
so this is an example from our own log

409
00:17:52,409 --> 00:17:57,210
so this is the AV log is an internal

410
00:17:54,470 --> 00:18:00,269
database where we store information

411
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:01,830
about all the customers that are running

412
00:18:00,269 --> 00:18:04,309
our products so we have antivirus

413
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:11,699
products and obviously this is

414
00:18:04,309 --> 00:18:14,129
anonymized in the slides already but so

415
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:16,889
this is a table we have actually inside

416
00:18:14,129 --> 00:18:18,178
40 net and it's there's a few more

417
00:18:16,889 --> 00:18:20,219
columns but the idea is you have a

418
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:21,799
serial number so the serial number is

419
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:25,139
unique so every time you buy a 40 gate

420
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:26,429
you get a serial number you have the

421
00:18:25,139 --> 00:18:28,258
company name

422
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:30,779
these are fictitious I don't know if a

423
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:33,299
Mac McDonald is name probably we have

424
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:35,429
but you know it's just randomly I just

425
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:38,039
put you have the country of the company

426
00:18:35,429 --> 00:18:41,549
or the industry the company size and how

427
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:43,859
many detections that that that specific

428
00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:45,809
company had right and the detection can

429
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:47,879
be done in this case was just antivirus

430
00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:50,158
so like how many times we blocked

431
00:18:47,879 --> 00:18:53,939
something okay and this is in a period

432
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:57,269
of 24 hours this table right and okay so

433
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:59,489
if you use D you can calculate the K and

434
00:18:57,269 --> 00:19:02,429
the limited for each column and of

435
00:18:59,489 --> 00:19:04,830
course serial number as a kid and on

436
00:19:02,429 --> 00:19:08,309
value of one because it's unique so I

437
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:10,678
can expect that customer name is one

438
00:19:08,309 --> 00:19:12,779
because if I tell you there's only one

439
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:14,730
McDonald for three you know you can only

440
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:18,090
register one company do you ask on

441
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:19,830
McDonald obviously the number of

442
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:22,049
detection is very unique so you get one

443
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:24,149
industry obviously there are more

444
00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:26,399
companies in a few industries it's 45

445
00:19:24,149 --> 00:19:28,258
with interesting thing for me well that

446
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:31,320
I didn't really think about this is that

447
00:19:28,259 --> 00:19:35,450
country code so in our database we only

448
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:39,720
have one company that that belongs to a

449
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:41,909
specific country so that means it's

450
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:46,289
that's bad right because if I tell you

451
00:19:41,909 --> 00:19:48,499
well ok we one of our customers from I'm

452
00:19:46,289 --> 00:19:51,600
making it up from Trinidad Tobago

453
00:19:48,499 --> 00:19:53,669
detections for being infected by Loki or

454
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,820
you know it was under attack then say

455
00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:58,940
all done so I know that Fortinet has

456
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:01,559
only one customer colleagues why's that

457
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:03,060
you know in in since the vodka so you

458
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:06,139
can work out you know

459
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:08,429
from maybe from our sales official sales

460
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:09,870
reports or you know like the one that

461
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:12,900
they give to shed all this you can find

462
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:14,969
out to board that and dang so you can

463
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,860
you know you can associate just by

464
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:18,150
knowing the country you can you can

465
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:20,429
expand your table and you can know

466
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:21,870
everything about that customer right so

467
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:23,840
it's kind of a very good tool to assess

468
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:27,629
on my channel me to UM you on database

469
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:30,090
so uh so how do you use that these two

470
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:33,240
main mechanism so you can use

471
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:36,959
suppression so you can say well okay so

472
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:38,640
if I have a low KN NEMA T score so that

473
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,730
was like serial number was one company

474
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:46,470
name was one so you basically just blank

475
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:48,930
it out okay country is also bad because

476
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:53,010
we saw that was a score of one so it

477
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:55,130
means minimize that's - their industry

478
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:59,580
was not too bad because it would like 54

479
00:20:55,130 --> 00:21:01,590
and company size you can basically round

480
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:04,260
it off you know if he was in a big

481
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:06,320
problem and detections it was also very

482
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:08,220
unique so you can kind of do

483
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,310
generalization so you can break up your

484
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:14,070
numbers into into chunks as you can see

485
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:17,220
this you know you lost most of the

486
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:19,409
information and you can't really do a

487
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:21,120
lot of machine learning on this kind of

488
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:23,460
data set you lose a lot of precision in

489
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:29,070
the process right so I'm but you know

490
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:33,570
it's it works on low dimensional data so

491
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:35,490
you know your examples of how people

492
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:38,929
were thinking about anonymity

493
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:42,000
there was the if you remember this 1997

494
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:45,720
there was this govern or William well

495
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,460
was readin Tiffa cated from by joining

496
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,730
the motor registrations he must

497
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:51,960
associates and the anonymize medical

498
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:55,230
data that the government is published

499
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:57,240
right and nobody thought about you know

500
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:58,710
at the time it was it's anonymous but

501
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,110
they didn't think about what actually if

502
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:04,050
I joined these two just by looking at

503
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:05,939
postcode age and in gender I can

504
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:08,220
actually find unique records by joining

505
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:11,240
these two data sets and they calculated

506
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:14,790
that 87 87 percent of the US population

507
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:16,890
a unique date of birth gender and postal

508
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:20,220
code right so it's crazy to read

509
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:25,110
five people one recent one one was the

510
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:27,570
Netflix challenge 2006 they released all

511
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:29,610
these ratings say okay it's fully

512
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:32,129
anonymized and we even randomized the

513
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:34,860
rating so that it's more anonymous right

514
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:36,570
then some some research

515
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:38,969
I can't remem where this is well what if

516
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:41,460
I take IMDB records right it's probably

517
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:43,230
the same movies inside but there are

518
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,840
like user names and emails right and

519
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:48,030
they find out that yes just with eight

520
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,399
movie ratings and and end dates they

521
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:53,040
were able to recover 99 percent of the

522
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:56,220
record so you can actually see we say a

523
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:58,200
movie was was crap right and then this

524
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:02,040
was a cool one New York taxi rides

525
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:05,520
public data set it was a FOIA disclosure

526
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:07,200
so like by law this was these were not

527
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:11,100
you burn this was the taxicabs

528
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:13,290
by the New York City Council so they had

529
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:15,149
to publish this data and then somebody

530
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:18,000
said well what if I look at this data

531
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:24,780
and going to a paparazzi website I can

532
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:27,390
see if Julia this was Drollet Scarlett

533
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:29,280
Johnson I think yeah and I they

534
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:31,440
basically were correlating pictures from

535
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,149
paparazzi's and they find that well yeah

536
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,280
she was there at like 3:00 p.m. on a

537
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:36,960
Sunday and that was the only taxi that

538
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,000
was down in that area and then they

539
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,760
managed to work out how many tips how

540
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,920
much did they pay to the taxi driver you

541
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,300
know where she was going then we found

542
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,760
some interesting patterns around

543
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:50,909
nightclubs and strip clubs to differ

544
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:53,010
it was not very nice but yeah so that's

545
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:55,440
the stuff we can do mobile phone today

546
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:56,910
is crazy you can you can find you can

547
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:02,460
read NT five three percent to total

548
00:23:56,910 --> 00:24:05,340
users just with a day of a day worth of

549
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:06,810
trace trace data and you know you can

550
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:08,790
read enta Feist and this is a piper

551
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:11,760
research paper so you can say obviously

552
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:14,550
mobile phone data is intuitively it's

553
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:17,330
also not very nonnamous

554
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:20,340
hacks and leaks always offense or

555
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:22,770
actually Medicine Act in 2015

556
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:26,129
I was working Microsoft at that time and

557
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:28,590
there was a data scientist it wasn't me

558
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:30,480
they publish a pie chart of all the

559
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:32,639
major companies like Amazon

560
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,440
bucum Microsoft just by looking at the

561
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,450
domains of the emails and they were

562
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,400
finally like infidelity infidelity rates

563
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:40,950
like who is more infidel you know I

564
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,450
think I think GU uh almonds and I can or

565
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:43,950
Facebook him to remember but they find

566
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:45,450
out you know like it was a nice chart

567
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:46,830
but then what happened was internally

568
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:49,770
right because people had access to the

569
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:51,379
alias I did that's why I was looking you

570
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:53,370
know if people like I knew they were

571
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:55,830
actually maybe some use you can just

572
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:58,709
type your the email alias in your

573
00:24:55,830 --> 00:25:00,809
calendar and unfortunately they were you

574
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:03,270
know managers and other people that were

575
00:25:00,809 --> 00:25:05,190
using the website and I mean nothing

576
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:07,470
happened from an HR perspective but it

577
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:10,260
was a nice yeah people made jokes like

578
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:12,000
every time we walk in the corridor not

579
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:14,309
very nice and some one of the wives

580
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,240
discovered and somebody got divorced so

581
00:25:14,309 --> 00:25:22,379
yeah there's some serious side effects

582
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:26,640
these happens the the 2018 leak was like

583
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:29,130
locations smart had a website web web

584
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,750
survey that was open so you can get okay

585
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:32,820
you can put your phone number or phone a

586
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:34,770
friend you can get all these location

587
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:38,428
history that was pretty bad as well

588
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:41,190
and all these times were companies were

589
00:25:38,429 --> 00:25:43,650
publishing stuff and they didn't do it

590
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:46,679
properly so like you can open the PDF

591
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:49,520
and it was just like a layer of it was

592
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:52,650
you know you and I reverse new stuff

593
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,090
yeah so what do we want so you know

594
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:57,419
differential price is about asking the

595
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:59,699
right questions so um and there's a few

596
00:25:57,419 --> 00:26:02,250
question that we want to know but

597
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:06,240
without disclosing too much information

598
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:07,650
and so for example I want to see for

599
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,049
example how many members of the Alliance

600
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:11,850
and seen a particular fret and for that

601
00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:14,340
you can use differential privacy how

602
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:16,889
many customers were infected you French

603
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:18,780
policy could be combined individual

604
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:21,120
detection from every vendor to build

605
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:23,520
global better one so you can use

606
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,409
federated machine learning and you know

607
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:29,340
how good this the detection that I

608
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:31,380
produce in you know with dataset we have

609
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:35,909
never seen so you can use a morphic

610
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:37,860
machine learning so okay the

611
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:41,730
differential differential privacy was

612
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:43,830
embedded by Cynthia work in 2006 she was

613
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:48,890
working for Microsoft

614
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:51,600
the time in steal now and okay it's a

615
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:53,010
it's pretty basic can we are not I did

616
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,678
that with probability calculus before

617
00:26:53,010 --> 00:27:00,299
but the idea is that you know if I'm

618
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:02,760
doing a survey and and I have two

619
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:05,370
choices want to say yes I'm a smoker no

620
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:10,440
I'm not a smoker I need to have a

621
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:13,590
mechanism in place that allows me to the

622
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:16,559
that essentially introduce a probability

623
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:18,389
error that doesn't allow me to go back

624
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:20,039
to the original question right the way

625
00:27:18,389 --> 00:27:22,709
you do that is basically you introduce

626
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:24,870
noise in your new survey so that the

627
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:28,880
same observation could be could be the

628
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:33,449
outcome of two different two different

629
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:35,639
choices right and you you know you can

630
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:37,850
calculate this bound and you can also

631
00:27:35,639 --> 00:27:41,850
calculate the privacy laws and of course

632
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:43,289
it's not magic so your high privacy you

633
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:45,269
have lock you see you can have high q--

634
00:27:43,289 --> 00:27:47,309
single privacy this is not that's in

635
00:27:45,269 --> 00:27:53,370
tight con cities you lose something you

636
00:27:47,309 --> 00:27:56,340
gain something right mmm-hmm so this is

637
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:59,389
an example so you see an example

638
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:01,769
fictitious example so I want to know if

639
00:27:59,389 --> 00:28:03,209
you know how many customers or like how

640
00:28:01,769 --> 00:28:07,919
many members of the Alliance have seen

641
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:11,580
the entity group 37 this month and you

642
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:13,019
know people like customers or like

643
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:15,779
members they don't really necessarily

644
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:17,610
want to disclose that they're seeing

645
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:20,399
that threat actors in that specific

646
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:23,699
month so the way you do that is

647
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:25,918
basically you have each each members of

648
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:28,169
the Alliance responds individually and

649
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,659
we don't have a central database because

650
00:28:28,169 --> 00:28:33,510
it's not good idea so everybody responds

651
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:35,370
individually and we shuffle the the

652
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:37,139
responses before they go to the central

653
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:39,029
server right and it's a very simple

654
00:28:37,139 --> 00:28:40,979
protocol and you can calculate the

655
00:28:39,029 --> 00:28:44,100
formula by hands quite simple so you

656
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:46,559
flip a coin right I sleep one coin if he

657
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:49,590
goes head I tell the truth then I flip

658
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:52,440
it another time yep so if he's tame then

659
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:56,610
actually a second time and then I say

660
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:57,370
yes if he's it was had or I say no if

661
00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:00,100
you if it was

662
00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:02,169
they rhyme and and so basically our 50%

663
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:06,580
chance in the first one and then 25%

664
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:09,460
chance in the second role right and so

665
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:12,370
the question is okay so everything I got

666
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:14,980
it's in this you can see it's it's Y so

667
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:16,840
this is the percentage of people that

668
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:19,510
have said yes that's a percentage so I

669
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:22,600
could see 25% in the last role or 25%

670
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:24,670
the first role and very simple formula I

671
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:27,040
mean I did this I mean and this correct

672
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:30,240
you can not very simple probability

673
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:32,409
calculus so you can write the direct

674
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:36,760
equation and then adjusting bertie try

675
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:39,910
and so that means if 75% of our members

676
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:44,080
of our customers say yes okay it means

677
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:46,510
that the percentage of people that

678
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:49,559
really said yes is one so everybody said

679
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:53,020
yes right so this is the expected

680
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:55,300
expected outcome right so because it's

681
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:57,100
it's probably it doesn't mean it's

682
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,928
hundred percent it doesn't mean it was

683
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:01,030
actually under percent it means that if

684
00:29:58,929 --> 00:30:03,120
you do this experiment this survey many

685
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:05,440
many times like infinite at the limit

686
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,959
after many many times you will converge

687
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,360
that value but every time you do a

688
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:12,610
survey it will not be that yeah so you

689
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:14,110
have to understand right okay and you

690
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:15,219
can calculate these probabilities and

691
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:19,449
you can say okay this is the

692
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:22,059
probabilities above sir being a yes so P

693
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:25,270
or equal to one let's say it was like

694
00:30:22,059 --> 00:30:27,610
sixty percent in that case and then the

695
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:31,570
conditional probability of having that

696
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:34,959
servation being yes given the fact that

697
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:37,899
the actual response was one it was 82

698
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,780
percent but the opposite is the pro

699
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:45,040
video that I said yes but I didn't say

700
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:47,440
yes is point dot 33% what that means is

701
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:49,120
that there is a skew hey this is really

702
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,700
art when the survey is basically it's

703
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,770
more likely if I say yes that you

704
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:57,309
actually have said yes for real

705
00:30:53,770 --> 00:31:01,270
rather than you say no okay so it's it's

706
00:30:57,309 --> 00:31:03,129
it's a symmetric by still a promise you

707
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:05,830
know you can still do any petroleum

708
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:08,530
feelings right because you can still say

709
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:10,720
under percent that I said yes

710
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,870
I mean this'll be I mean it takes time

711
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:15,309
too

712
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:17,350
just that well yeah we have examples

713
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:21,700
from fidelity learning so this is I took

714
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:22,480
DNS logs and the idea is you have three

715
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,640
vendors

716
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,550
I put Cisco power tonight one fourth net

717
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,710
and everybody sees a different you know

718
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:34,120
they have different feeds from for DNS

719
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:36,280
logs and I kind of imagine that cisco is

720
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:38,379
seeing alexa and cripple is seeing like

721
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:39,790
Alexa domains you know top and Alexa

722
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:43,330
domains but he's also seeing

723
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:45,490
cryptolocker right and you can build his

724
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:48,309
own logistic regression classifier on

725
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:50,950
that one Palo Alto may be seeing Alexa

726
00:31:48,309 --> 00:31:52,990
and in gods which is a botnet and

727
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:55,720
fortunate in the same period was seeing

728
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:58,120
Alexa and new gods right so everybody

729
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:02,050
has their own classifier that is able to

730
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:04,419
tell if if a domain was good or bad and

731
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:08,379
the idea is that you come you can

732
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:11,679
combine all these local classifiers you

733
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:13,870
can produce a big a global classifier

734
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,730
and then you can feed it back right and

735
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:19,239
the way it works it's you train your

736
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:21,660
classifier in plain text you encrypt the

737
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:25,260
the weights or the logistic regression

738
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:28,480
and you use specially this pie layer

739
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:31,480
crypto that we was in 1999 you combine

740
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:34,600
these weights with which are encrypted

741
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:37,210
you decrypt them you decrypt them you

742
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:39,040
build a tree or text gradient and you

743
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:40,950
send it back to each partner right

744
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:43,389
they sum it up again and then they

745
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:45,130
retrain the classifier so did he have

746
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:47,650
better predictions okay

747
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:51,400
so trust me it works and to show that I

748
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:57,040
actually implemented it one version and

749
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:59,800
I took 4400 DNS record logs 4000 word

750
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:03,070
from Alexa top under domains well the

751
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:07,270
top domains Open DNS were 52

752
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:09,070
cryptolocker domains 167 gods and new

753
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:11,920
gods roughly on the same in the same

754
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:13,419
proportion I trained to split eighty

755
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:16,630
twenty percent pretty common machine

756
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:19,330
learning and a usual regression with

757
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:21,040
gradient descent for like 50 durations

758
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:24,428
we learning you know these are all

759
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,700
parameters and I I'm using a key signs

760
00:33:24,429 --> 00:33:27,190
of

761
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:28,660
twenty-four 1024 bits which is kind of

762
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:30,880
enough for the kind of precision you

763
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:33,760
need for logistic regression and you can

764
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,830
see that so before this is you know on

765
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:38,140
that slide before it means every partner

766
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:40,860
building on classifier to classify those

767
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:43,360
logs and they they achieved a certain

768
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:47,229
precision recall right so you know C

769
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:49,840
squared 84-76 86-82 cetera after you

770
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:51,370
combine all these models the idea is

771
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:54,669
hopefully you get something better which

772
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:57,429
did happen so you know Cisco now get 86%

773
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:59,920
for both freezing precision recall Palo

774
00:33:57,430 --> 00:34:02,650
Alto it was very like he lost a little

775
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:05,140
bit on precision by gain something to be

776
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:07,780
more on Rico in Fortinet where you know

777
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:10,300
we got one percent point more and you

778
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:12,400
know a three percent more on Rico and

779
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:14,560
although they seem like small

780
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:16,510
percentages when you talk about volumes

781
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,730
it's quite a lot right I mean I mean

782
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:19,990
even in vision machine learning like if

783
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:21,580
you have any improvement like you know

784
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:24,339
it's quite a lot right

785
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:26,620
and obviously homomorphic encryption so

786
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:29,500
Pylea is a form of semi I'm not fully

787
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:31,989
marking encryption and it just takes

788
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:34,030
more time you know it's so you know with

789
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:36,729
with pal year it took me nine around

790
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:40,060
nine seconds and this MacBook Pro to

791
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:41,800
train to do the entire training loop but

792
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:48,310
you know if I was doing it without it

793
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:50,110
was 196 times faster right so then cool

794
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:52,840
things you can also use a morphic

795
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:57,850
machine learning for email filtering and

796
00:34:52,840 --> 00:35:00,310
this time I took a public domain from

797
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:04,060
that I don't know if anybody remember

798
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:08,529
this but Aaron was there was an

799
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:12,279
investigation many minutes ago by the US

800
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:15,160
government because they were involved in

801
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:17,440
various let's say not very legitimate

802
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:19,120
activities unfortunately so what they

803
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,460
did after the investigation they

804
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:23,200
published everything right and the funny

805
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:25,060
thing is like all the emails that they

806
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:28,770
publish from from the internal corporate

807
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:31,330
network they forgot to anonymize them so

808
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:32,410
so when I at the time when I was looking

809
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:36,640
today I found all the credit card

810
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:38,259
numbers social security numbers you know

811
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:41,020
people go into the doctor

812
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:43,230
with cancer I kind of stuff and then you

813
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:44,950
know and then after a month later Oh

814
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:46,540
somebody said well I actually got

815
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:48,669
condoms oh okay

816
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:50,770
it's and they they took it back so you

817
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:53,110
can find the original data set I am one

818
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:56,200
but you can if you go now it's not

819
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:58,150
anymore there was a company who wrote

820
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:00,430
regular expressions to remove all the

821
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:02,830
craic and kind of stuff but you can

822
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:05,890
download now the unknown the one without

823
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:08,350
private information so the cool thing

824
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:13,720
you can do it morphic machine learning

825
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:16,750
is so yep so Cisco when our partners say

826
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:19,060
oh uh I have I want to be the logistic

827
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:21,970
regression model for classifying ham or

828
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:23,590
spam okay or fishing whatever but I

829
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:25,870
don't want to you know I don't want to

830
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:28,900
give that to you know I want to try if

831
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:32,049
this this model performs really well on

832
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:33,580
data that I'll never seen before but you

833
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:36,280
know I don't want to ask Fortinet to

834
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:38,100
send all their email like because it's

835
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:43,000
pretty sensitive so how do I do that

836
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:45,670
so you take all your data set which is

837
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,590
private you build your classifier you

838
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:50,380
encrypt it with your private key which

839
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:53,610
is the red key then you send the

840
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:59,380
encrypted model to the fortunate

841
00:36:53,610 --> 00:37:02,500
fortunate then apply the get get your

842
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:05,170
prime public key and take all these

843
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:08,350
emails and produce predictions with that

844
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:10,330
okay with the encrypted model and your

845
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:13,630
public key so what you get out of that

846
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:17,020
you have an encrypted score so Fortinet

847
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:19,480
can see if a particular a email was ham

848
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:22,420
or spam because he's encrypted okay then

849
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:25,270
14:8 slimmy laborious but it works you

850
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:27,850
send back the the vector of encrypt this

851
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:30,700
course back to cisco cisco takes again

852
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:32,830
is private key decrypted and is able to

853
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:35,200
see how many emails were classified the

854
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:36,759
span or hand right and then you can tell

855
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,830
for tonight oh I'm pretty cool do you

856
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,120
want to buy this right because you know

857
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:41,740
it's quite cool like a I don't know

858
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:44,279
eighty percent ninety eight percent

859
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:46,089
accuracy or you can say oh well actually

860
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,590
you know fourteen I can do the same

861
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:49,900
thing and they can compare and say oh

862
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:51,220
it's a mine is better and I don't know

863
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,089
do you want to share the model or

864
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:54,038
something so you know you can

865
00:37:52,089 --> 00:37:57,269
you know many things with and this was

866
00:37:54,039 --> 00:38:01,329
again with very basic poly crypto

867
00:37:57,269 --> 00:38:03,609
algorithms and again real example so I

868
00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:06,009
took eleven thousand emails from the

869
00:38:03,609 --> 00:38:10,299
Enron dataset it was a little bit

870
00:38:06,009 --> 00:38:12,880
unbalanced so like 25 27 percent spam

871
00:38:10,299 --> 00:38:15,519
and sent a hand you do blah blah blah

872
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,289
training test pleat I had seven thousand

873
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:20,618
nine hundred ninety seven words from the

874
00:38:17,289 --> 00:38:22,539
tax and obviously classify is fast

875
00:38:20,619 --> 00:38:25,479
prediction is fast is basically less

876
00:38:22,539 --> 00:38:27,699
than a second you calculate your when

877
00:38:25,479 --> 00:38:29,739
you encrypt your weight takes time 115

878
00:38:27,699 --> 00:38:31,449
seconds because you have a lot of

879
00:38:29,739 --> 00:38:35,279
weights there it's like almost eight on

880
00:38:31,449 --> 00:38:38,229
the wards it it doesn't words you then

881
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:40,569
send it to forty net fortunate needs to

882
00:38:38,229 --> 00:38:42,999
predict that with encryption so it takes

883
00:38:40,569 --> 00:38:44,829
a little bit of time so 44 seconds send

884
00:38:42,999 --> 00:38:47,410
it back to Cisco Cisco the hip this

885
00:38:44,829 --> 00:38:48,819
again takes time 19 seconds but most

886
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:51,009
importantly you can see the error rate

887
00:38:48,819 --> 00:38:53,439
is the same because okay it's basically

888
00:38:51,009 --> 00:38:56,109
the the key sizing is enough to

889
00:38:53,439 --> 00:38:58,449
guarantee the same precision right so

890
00:38:56,109 --> 00:39:01,779
yeah and all of these was with default

891
00:38:58,449 --> 00:39:03,819
I've used a very common library that if

892
00:39:01,779 --> 00:39:07,509
you want you can ask me later doing that

893
00:39:03,819 --> 00:39:09,939
and so is doing this that actually not

894
00:39:07,509 --> 00:39:13,509
many companies doing that and I made a

895
00:39:09,939 --> 00:39:16,420
list so Google released a paper a tool

896
00:39:13,509 --> 00:39:18,849
in 2014 called rapport which is

897
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:21,099
randomized aggregate it's like nicknames

898
00:39:18,849 --> 00:39:23,949
stuff very good for three men with that

899
00:39:21,099 --> 00:39:24,640
and then you use the federal learning on

900
00:39:23,949 --> 00:39:29,439
G board

901
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:31,359
last April 2017 and rapport is basically

902
00:39:29,439 --> 00:39:33,670
used to detect unwanted software in

903
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:35,890
Google Chrome as for parent Lee I know

904
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:37,869
if you through but there's a rap or

905
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:40,328
there's a module inside chrome that is

906
00:39:37,869 --> 00:39:42,369
using differential encrypt differential

907
00:39:40,329 --> 00:39:43,739
privacy to tomorrow it or what kind of

908
00:39:42,369 --> 00:39:45,519
software people are installing right and

909
00:39:43,739 --> 00:39:48,160
basically what you have you have an

910
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:50,049
Instagram and you know you can see the

911
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,339
actual one which is the blue one so you

912
00:39:50,049 --> 00:39:52,809
can see it's kind of an exponential bomb

913
00:39:51,339 --> 00:39:55,749
and then you have the one you get which

914
00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:58,269
is privatized it's you can see slightly

915
00:39:55,749 --> 00:40:00,069
different but still follow the same

916
00:39:58,269 --> 00:40:02,769
distribution right so you can still you

917
00:40:00,069 --> 00:40:06,009
know it's it's part private but you can

918
00:40:02,769 --> 00:40:06,660
still understand things right and it's

919
00:40:06,009 --> 00:40:10,380
very good for is

920
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:13,080
and Counting and so that's one module

921
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:15,330
and then they they using federated

922
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,799
learning to train a global model from

923
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:18,450
local models and what they do on the G

924
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,670
board which is the the keyboard on your

925
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:22,859
phone will suggest your key when you're

926
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:24,540
typing something they use the same

927
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:26,670
approach so you have a local model on

928
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:28,590
your mobile phone you get sent to the to

929
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:30,000
the cloud which is all encrypted they

930
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:31,860
mix it back they send it back and

931
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,390
everybody get you know it basically gets

932
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:38,100
better every time more people you have

933
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:39,450
on the system I Paul December 2017 this

934
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,950
kind of a war now everybody every

935
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:44,009
company it's like oh yeah you're doing

936
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:48,180
differential privacy the they have three

937
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:50,730
main algorithms account me sketch

938
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:53,009
essentially and they use it for them in

939
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:56,250
very frivolous use case specially

940
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:58,140
discovering popular emojis right and you

941
00:40:56,250 --> 00:41:01,890
can see they wanted to compare both

942
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:04,560
spoke in English in French I guess for

943
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:06,930
marketing this is not why these are few

944
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:09,180
differences there by also they also use

945
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:11,970
it for identify high energy and memory

946
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:15,899
usage in Safari and for discovering new

947
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:17,609
words that kind of stuff you burp they

948
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:19,170
believe me or not but they're actually

949
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:21,560
working on differential promising

950
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:25,890
they're very cool tool called

951
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:29,910
chorus and only does is to rewrite

952
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:31,830
queries in to add some noise and get the

953
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:34,319
results already privatized so you

954
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:38,279
basically have a proxy that rewrites

955
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:40,650
your SQL queries before you send it to

956
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:42,810
your SQL database so you can put that in

957
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:44,820
between and there's a few parameters we

958
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:47,100
had to it's in Java Scala is not very

959
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:49,110
easy to use I have to warn you by works

960
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:53,130
I've tried it and it's pretty cool they

961
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:55,260
put lot of effort behind this Microsoft

962
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:58,200
web I knew this because I was working

963
00:41:55,260 --> 00:42:01,260
right before the two code pink pink pink

964
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:03,779
you it's based on c-sharp and you can do

965
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:06,960
sum count average median for aggregation

966
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:08,460
supports machine learning and there's an

967
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,730
example there so it's quite easy if you

968
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:13,230
if you use link before it's it's pretty

969
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:15,570
intuitive so you just use the same

970
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:18,870
interface with a few

971
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:20,310
modifiers open mind this is cool there's

972
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:22,109
a guy from Google

973
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:24,240
who came up with this idea to combine

974
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:26,550
everything it sounds awesome like oh

975
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,689
let's combine it you know federated

976
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:29,250
machine learning with homomorphic

977
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:31,590
encryption blockchains and smart

978
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:35,010
contracts and the building is amazing

979
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:37,740
toolset that allows to build models and

980
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:40,350
keep get paid for that with privacy and

981
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:43,439
you know anti tampering solution it's

982
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:45,180
it's I've tried to use it's not it's

983
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:47,400
still pretty much a work in progress but

984
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:50,339
these quite clever so I think there

985
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:52,340
would be something soon working but this

986
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:54,810
is these combines everything together so

987
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:56,280
right now I'm not really interested in

988
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:59,460
this because we're not using blockchains

989
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:02,550
a not a platform so it's almost 44

990
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:05,550
minutes yeah the conclusion is we you

991
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:08,660
know the in terms of our platform so I'm

992
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:10,800
basically trying to build an API where

993
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:13,020
everybody in the Alliance can use

994
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:15,480
differential privacy federating machine

995
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:17,310
learning morphic machine learning and

996
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:19,050
you know so that if it's an API you

997
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:20,490
don't really have to implement your own

998
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:23,040
solution because you know it takes time

999
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:24,569
and you know it's pretty early stage so

1000
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,950
you know people might use different

1001
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:27,960
libraries in the future because

1002
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:30,029
everything is quite new so there's

1003
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:34,800
nothing like really production level

1004
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:38,490
right now and then yeah so you know if

1005
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:40,530
you want access to our platform I can

1006
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:42,899
just give me an email I can open you an

1007
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:44,640
account and if you want to play with the

1008
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:47,010
data we already have in our system then

1009
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:49,220
yeah just just just send me an email

1010
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:49,220
yeah

1011
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,550
do we have any questions

1012
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:03,339
[Music]

1013
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:10,419
no he's the creep toys okay that was an

1014
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,730
amazing talk so I'm not a machine

1015
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:14,920
learning expert actually I'm barely even

1016
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:17,619
understand it sometimes okay what I'm

1017
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:20,160
trying to understand is is do do some of

1018
00:44:17,619 --> 00:44:22,570
these these anonymization methods

1019
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,799
privacy protection methods work for all

1020
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:25,869
machine learning methods because I

1021
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,790
understand there's a lot of different

1022
00:44:25,869 --> 00:44:30,700
ways you can build models so how

1023
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:34,540
flexible is this yeah so he's basically

1024
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:40,060
asking can I apply a morphing encryption

1025
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:42,520
to every algorithm you can yes there is

1026
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:45,820
no reason why you couldn't because okay

1027
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:47,980
so it depends on the so the pioneer

1028
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:52,150
scheme only supports multiplication a

1029
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:54,369
dish and some okay and products some

1030
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:57,280
protection some right so if you're doing

1031
00:44:54,369 --> 00:45:00,850
something like a noodle Network that

1032
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:03,910
requires a logistic function it's tough

1033
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:06,190
you have to approximate that into Taylor

1034
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:09,520
expansions so you can't do everything

1035
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:12,190
right now but the way I'm using it is

1036
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:15,340
that I'm just encrypting the weights of

1037
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:18,070
the of the model so I'm not really

1038
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:20,140
training the actual model Whittemore you

1039
00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:23,260
can do that and you can do that but just

1040
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:24,879
takes a lot of time so this is just

1041
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:26,440
encrypting the weights and then there

1042
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,210
are encrypted that send it back and the

1043
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:31,090
guy is basically ripped in the model and

1044
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:33,760
using that so this people have done it

1045
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:35,050
with neon networks like the almost the

1046
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,410
you know the actual full implementation

1047
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:40,180
in by just takes just takes too much

1048
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:42,368
time because you have to approximate all

1049
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:44,529
these operations in some and additions

1050
00:45:42,369 --> 00:45:46,930
and constants and you have to you know

1051
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:49,060
and you know neon that was are big so if

1052
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:51,399
you have like an image if you do deep

1053
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:54,070
learning it's not something you can do

1054
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:55,030
in a you know with you know it's

1055
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:57,280
something like that you put in

1056
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:58,090
production for security locks it's just

1057
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,960
forget it right

1058
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:00,960
yeah so yeah

1059
00:46:03,079 --> 00:46:14,200
and other questions we have some time no

1060
00:46:11,749 --> 00:46:19,919
okay okay

1061
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:19,919
[Applause]

1062
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:24,970
you
