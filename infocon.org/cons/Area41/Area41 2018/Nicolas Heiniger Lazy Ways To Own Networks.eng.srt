22
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:04,069
stuff this might show a bit in the

23
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:07,290
presentation

24
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:09,869
let's go the idea of this talk well

25
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,360
actually from my boss side yeah well we

26
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:15,119
can do a talk at RAF 41

27
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:18,539
would you like to and present this stuff

28
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:21,960
and as a pen tester basically what I

29
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,729
want to do is find for fun the highest

30
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,798
privileges I can get and for the client

31
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:29,070
all the ways I can do that such that he

32
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:33,799
has all the material he can have to fix

33
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:37,619
the most yeah the most issue he can and

34
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:40,560
since I'm only a pen tester and not a

35
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:43,320
red teamer most of the time I can be as

36
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,990
loud as I want as unsteady as I want

37
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,758
that's no issue and in this regard I can

38
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,658
use all the old lame easy

39
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,610
well-documented

40
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,189
you name it vulnera cheese path

41
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,200
escalation ways I want to and that's

42
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:57,059
very cool because yeah I just don't care

43
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,430
about stuff I don't need to remark to

44
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,829
penetrate any an incorporation just

45
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,469
going and use the tools and that's

46
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:06,329
perfectly fine for them they know that

47
00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:09,899
don't need to use low yeah live off the

48
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:13,650
land 0 days or whatever just yeah to

49
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:18,000
what needs to be done and get get

50
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:20,849
the fruit what you will see is all real

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,190
anonymized examples that have been

52
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:26,420
happening in the last two years that's

53
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:28,440
none of the best or the most quick or

54
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:31,679
whatever that's just the one I've

55
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:34,500
personally seen or that close colleagues

56
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,690
have seen at other companies they are

57
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,360
ordered from let's say the least

58
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:41,519
privileges required to towards the

59
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,950
highest fields you can get basically

60
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:48,349
dominant means mostly window stuff and

61
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:51,358
some mitigations are proposed as well

62
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:55,230
mana shall we go

63
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:58,230
first part just when you have no access

64
00:02:55,230 --> 00:03:03,000
like yeah just the name of the company

65
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:07,828
or some IP ranges from outside what can

66
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:12,000
you do this is our obvious first go-to

67
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:14,849
because it works in that case we had no

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,769
real scope just a chisel saying yeah

69
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:18,418
well I would like to show that my

70
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:20,099
predecessor was not good enough and

71
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:22,139
would that we need more budget and

72
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:23,849
basically do what you want to the

73
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:27,590
company I just want to show that we're

74
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:30,298
not good enough at security so yeah

75
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:32,160
standard phishing campaign starting with

76
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:34,650
email address collection from awesome

77
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,418
sources or LinkedIn basically lots of

78
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:43,370
scraping the websites of the society and

79
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:46,290
and more and afterwards we prepared some

80
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:48,480
clone page that looked like that or

81
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:51,660
something like that because this was

82
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,698
present on the internet and we also

83
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:56,190
collected from open source intelligence

84
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:57,810
the IT manager and IT provide the names

85
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:00,829
this will have some imports in soft

86
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,970
words and of course purchase the

87
00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:05,280
certificates valid such that you have

88
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:07,440
the nice crane lock in the bar and don't

89
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,799
raise any suspicion and look like domain

90
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:13,650
because again once more it works

91
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:15,239
afterwards we provide this mail or not

92
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,340
exactly this one it was in German but I

93
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:21,570
not so good at German so this one is in

94
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:23,340
English saying okay we've been doing an

95
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:26,710
update there should be no downtime for

96
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:28,479
you know whatsoever but

97
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:30,870
yeah well just check in case you

98
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,520
encounter an issue please report to us

99
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:35,380
to check click on this link use the

100
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,440
sign-in button and that's it

101
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:40,719
signed by IT department so this is what

102
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,630
you need this this information and

103
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,550
afterwards we send this to all the email

104
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:47,530
address we have accept all the IT guys

105
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:49,120
because of course those may have some

106
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:51,359
clue more than here and their users and

107
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,680
we don't want to be detected so soon

108
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,199
then you send this you got creds

109
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,110
basically what the page does it will

110
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:01,960
store credentials and redirect to the

111
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:03,729
real page showing then an error but you

112
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,280
don't care just use it tries again and

113
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:08,409
it's fine afterwards you get creds and

114
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,419
the reason we did that specifically for

115
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:12,460
this company is because we found some

116
00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:15,549
kind of page that looked like that again

117
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:17,919
it was not Salesforce but CRM online no

118
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:22,229
two-factor authentication and we were

119
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:25,568
lucky because after yeah somehow ours

120
00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:29,139
someone enter credentials and this was a

121
00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:31,840
CFO or maybe some high HR related guy so

122
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:33,460
we had access to this with almost the

123
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,530
highest privileges we could hope to get

124
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:38,590
and get all the information of the

125
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:41,289
company so more than enough to do the

126
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:43,780
match and show that secretary was that's

127
00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:46,419
a not so good enough in case you don't

128
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:47,979
have the Sierra online which to my from

129
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:50,500
my point of view is already some kind of

130
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:53,139
an issue you could go for physical

131
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:55,570
access remote VPN just see what's inside

132
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:58,599
the mailbox is already enough to do some

133
00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:01,810
problems or fish from yeah for remote

134
00:05:58,599 --> 00:06:02,320
access instead of credentials would work

135
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:07,990
as well

136
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:10,900
and mitigations yeah well not all issues

137
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:13,509
are for users you need to click you need

138
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:16,000
to open documents so in that case you

139
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:18,190
cannot do much you have security best

140
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
practices disabled macros and so on so

141
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:23,979
forth but at some point user will click

142
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,599
but you can still raise awareness this

143
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:27,630
is very important it will come back

144
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:31,479
several times in the presentation you

145
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:32,949
may also want to avoid exposing you see

146
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:35,639
error on the internet or at least at a

147
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:35,639
second factor

148
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:41,008
in first case done now we are allowed to

149
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,740
go in

150
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:49,620
this comes interesting what can we do

151
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:53,729
here that's the second case I want to

152
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:56,190
present yeah you probably know the the

153
00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:58,620
acronyms and what you can do with that

154
00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:01,110
usually when starting in pen tests we

155
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:03,479
start with ports can involve already

156
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:06,599
scans again we know we don't need to be

157
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:09,240
stealthy while doing this it takes

158
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:11,909
usually lots of time this small end map

159
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:15,360
command is a quick win it will just look

160
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:17,729
for within your scopes or targets for

161
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,560
the eternal blue vulnerability if you

162
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:22,830
find this very good for you you have a

163
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,380
good start of a pen test not so good

164
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:28,349
good for the client

165
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:30,360
in that case specifically we had a whole

166
00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:33,240
network to assess we could not scan

167
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,360
everything we found six hosts that

168
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,639
Webber logo one was a domain controller

169
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,740
sad for a customer but he didn't want us

170
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,319
to exploit this because of course yeah

171
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:45,690
you don't want to compromise your domain

172
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:47,550
controller at once and if by mistake the

173
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:50,190
exploit crashes then you're in some

174
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,990
serious trouble but customer is nice and

175
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:53,520
he said yeah well you can explore

176
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:55,110
something else and I will ask a domain

177
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,419
admin to connect on this server such

178
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:58,529
that you can get the creds and

179
00:07:56,419 --> 00:07:59,909
afterwards maybe just a quick question

180
00:07:58,529 --> 00:08:03,599
who knows what this is

181
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:05,940
mini cuts okay so I don't need to

182
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,060
explain basically I could get credit

183
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:12,750
with this very nice tool

184
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:14,250
and once the DC or if the domain

185
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,409
credentials were very compromised we had

186
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:18,029
not tend to jump on other hosts and go

187
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:22,190
further in the networks but that's a

188
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:22,190
story that needs to be told another time

189
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:29,789
mitigation for this one

190
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,529
yeah Asset Management's it seems easy

191
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:35,338
lame but it's hard to do in a real

192
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:38,510
company it's yeah you can do that you

193
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:43,469
should definitely it's a very good start

194
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:44,880
but we always find hole studs we are

195
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:46,740
said afterwards yeah well we don't know

196
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,870
what this is I have no clue I have to

197
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,850
look nothing in my inventories

198
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:53,070
I have to find out what this is

199
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:55,590
and this leads to those issues of

200
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:57,900
unpatched host and for the credentials

201
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:59,820
in memory there are so-called Mt Mme

202
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:02,760
cuts mitigation starting in Windows 10

203
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:05,730
in Windows Server 2016 if you have those

204
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:19,140
versions you can definitely use those

205
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:21,270
medications as well maybe you know this

206
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:23,340
this kind of page when you find this

207
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:25,770
usually you're just like yeah well this

208
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:28,770
is of no use to me you can just try the

209
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:30,380
credentials in that case it worked

210
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:34,230
obviously otherwise it wouldn't be here

211
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:36,660
it was an old development server in a

212
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:39,330
corner no one knew it was still here it

213
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:41,699
wasn't maintained and some developers

214
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:45,510
just left credentials by default on this

215
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:49,170
tomcatting tomcat instance yeah

216
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:53,880
afterwards the path is using Metasploit

217
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:55,380
MSF venom generate this is war file once

218
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,420
you've done that you can deploy this on

219
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:59,430
the Tomcat console and this will

220
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:01,829
basically generate a reverse shell to

221
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:05,099
your machine and you get the shell

222
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:07,650
afterwards you may be lucky as it was

223
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,870
the case here and the Tomcat was running

224
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:12,630
a system so you don't need to do more

225
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:15,150
you just again from mimikatz get the

226
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:17,430
creds and in that case I privileged

227
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:20,730
account not domain admin but still you

228
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:22,949
can go a long way with this if you

229
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:25,650
cannot run mimikatz because you have

230
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:28,200
nice antivirus or ids/ips that would

231
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:30,510
block this I remember you can just dump

232
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,850
the SS process get the file back to you

233
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:34,350
and do that offline I once lost like

234
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:36,810
probably in this pen test by the way

235
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:38,670
like four hours trying to run me me cuts

236
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:42,619
on the server where I afterwards in five

237
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:46,469
minutes I could just download Prague and

238
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:48,810
mitigations again yeah again Asset

239
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:51,810
Management's again awareness security

240
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:54,089
culture there's no yeah no silver bullet

241
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:55,829
here or at least I don't know any if you

242
00:10:54,090 --> 00:11:00,450
do please come back to me after the

243
00:10:55,830 --> 00:11:01,740
presentation next case is a bit more

244
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:03,810
technical it has been mentioned

245
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,529
yesterday already in the red team talk

246
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:09,209
from

247
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:11,369
skip guys yeah you may know what

248
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:14,429
responder is when you read this on their

249
00:11:11,369 --> 00:11:17,729
github page it's kind of scary

250
00:11:14,429 --> 00:11:21,509
all those acronyms I don't know all of

251
00:11:17,729 --> 00:11:23,549
them most of them yes so I figured out I

252
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:27,719
will do a small explanation of how this

253
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:30,449
works in network if you want to get the

254
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:33,479
IP often a first name you just ask the

255
00:11:30,449 --> 00:11:36,718
DNS server but he was this IP for the

256
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:38,369
hostname I'm trying to query but what if

257
00:11:36,719 --> 00:11:40,019
the DNS doesn't know the answer

258
00:11:38,369 --> 00:11:43,859
you mistyped it or it just doesn't exist

259
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:45,599
in that case default behavior in in

260
00:11:43,859 --> 00:11:48,059
Windows is to fall back to wall

261
00:11:45,599 --> 00:11:52,079
protocols those a laminar and laminar an

262
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:53,488
NB TNS and multicast DNS good thing for

263
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:57,149
the attacker

264
00:11:53,489 --> 00:11:59,249
this is broadcast or multicast meaning

265
00:11:57,149 --> 00:12:01,469
you will see it as not occur if you're

266
00:11:59,249 --> 00:12:03,929
on the same broadcast domain or

267
00:12:01,469 --> 00:12:09,749
multicast domain and you can poison the

268
00:12:03,929 --> 00:12:14,519
answer saying okay that's me I see some

269
00:12:09,749 --> 00:12:16,979
so the internal joke so basically that's

270
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:19,919
me and that the user or the computer

271
00:12:16,979 --> 00:12:21,329
will now try to connect to you and in

272
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:23,009
case you need any authentication

273
00:12:21,329 --> 00:12:25,138
basically responder has rogue

274
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:27,509
authentication servers on several

275
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:29,429
protocols and he would ask for the

276
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:32,519
credentials to do a computer and the

277
00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:36,029
computer will comply send usually auntie

278
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:40,619
em auntie ellen SSP hashes more on this

279
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:43,369
later but while you need to wait until

280
00:12:40,619 --> 00:12:46,829
someone makes a mistake it sounds like

281
00:12:43,369 --> 00:12:49,199
yeah not so optimal actually you can do

282
00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:53,569
better you can force your luck there are

283
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:55,919
several ways to make this request happen

284
00:12:53,569 --> 00:12:58,139
an easy one would be to send an HTML

285
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:00,509
email and if the user clicks on loads

286
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:03,659
images it will try to load something

287
00:13:00,509 --> 00:13:05,039
from this file handler and basically you

288
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:06,839
can put anything as long as it's not in

289
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:08,999
the dns it will fail you can square it

290
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:10,409
and fall back and do the broadcast and

291
00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:13,139
you get the connection to the responder

292
00:13:10,409 --> 00:13:15,569
same some bad PDF attack was plain

293
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:18,090
present in some weeks ago I did also

294
00:13:15,569 --> 00:13:19,949
with as a seraph in web applications

295
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:21,510
works very well because it's repeatable

296
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:24,420
you can do it as many times as you want

297
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:26,760
and there are other ways one was or

298
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:29,550
already presented yesterday this kind of

299
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:32,189
SEF files basically this SCF file is a

300
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:34,020
text file plugged into any windows

301
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:38,610
directory and it tells the Windows

302
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:41,310
Explorer to use this icon for this for

303
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:44,340
this folder and of course the folder

304
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:46,560
share does not exist and we get back to

305
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:50,520
responding more connections more ways to

306
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:53,130
get hashes and maybe more credentials at

307
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:56,430
the end issue is that what you get with

308
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:58,620
responder is hashes but not ntlm hashes

309
00:13:56,430 --> 00:14:02,040
basically you cannot pass the hash with

310
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:04,320
those you can crack them but let's hope

311
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,959
your company have a good password policy

312
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:10,170
and you cannot crack them but you can

313
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:12,600
ntlm relay so that's one more step with

314
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:15,689
responder or actually with multi relay

315
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,160
or another tool that exists I would

316
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:19,980
advise you to have a look at multi relay

317
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:22,490
or enter ng Ln relay X that's part of in

318
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:23,940
packet if you want to do more is that

319
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:26,220
how it works

320
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:28,860
again we have the user the attacker and

321
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:31,680
then we have any arbitrary target in

322
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:33,810
this specific dentist we tolerated the

323
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,099
main file server because if you can get

324
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:37,410
access to this you have lots of

325
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:41,010
interesting data and lots of users

326
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:42,839
connected so the user will try to access

327
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:45,060
anything that doesn't exist

328
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:48,840
so again DNS fallback and connection to

329
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:51,300
responder we open the connection man in

330
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:54,420
the middle this connect ourselves to the

331
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:58,979
valuable target which will send

332
00:14:54,420 --> 00:15:01,709
challenge is falling down and we

333
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:03,810
propagate this user signs the challenge

334
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:05,760
or computer science the challenge we

335
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:07,709
Forge challenge this works very well and

336
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,110
the good thing is that once we have this

337
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:12,720
authentication by default again in

338
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:15,060
Windows there is no need to sign the

339
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,280
further messages so basically now we can

340
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,849
keep the connection and the user doesn't

341
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,730
know about it

342
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:22,560
for him it fails no issue for us but you

343
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:24,600
can go on and we don't need to sign any

344
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,520
further challenges so basically we have

345
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,980
access with the rights of the user in

346
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,930
the best case we are locally mean on the

347
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:34,920
server which was the case luckily in the

348
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:37,859
spendest and in that case well you get

349
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,899
with multi relay by default some kind of

350
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:42,180
shell on the server not exactly your

351
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:44,070
shell but some kind of and then you can

352
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:46,229
again run mini cards to whatever you

353
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:49,500
want on the server it's very nice when

354
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:52,470
it works it's yeah at this point it

355
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:54,839
requires a part of luck what would be

356
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:56,279
best there are tools that actually allow

357
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:58,380
you to keep the connection open

358
00:15:56,279 --> 00:16:00,209
afterwards even if it's not the local

359
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:01,500
admin meaning you could browse the

360
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,959
shares on the file server using the

361
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:06,959
rights of this user instead of yours you

362
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:09,989
might get more access more files more

363
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:14,520
stuff to look at and go on iterate this

364
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:17,100
process as much as you can medications

365
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:18,569
here that's purely technical disable

366
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,610
those all protocols most of time you

367
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:24,690
don't need them so you can just drop

368
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:26,700
this and enforce SMB signing there is to

369
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:29,070
invest my knowledge most of the time no

370
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:31,140
reason not to do that it's not done by

371
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:33,450
default I don't know exactly why but

372
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:36,600
this would completely prevent the ntlm

373
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:38,480
relay not true to prevent the SMB relay

374
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,779
you could ntlm relate to other protocols

375
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,650
mssql

376
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:46,140
IMAP LDAP and maybe one more how did I

377
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:51,680
forget but it would already prevent this

378
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:54,660
most obvious issue next then

379
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,310
we go forward we have more credentials

380
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:59,040
now we have maybe a user credentials or

381
00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:02,099
a work station sometimes in a pen test

382
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:04,309
you assume that you will start as a

383
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,179
malicious user and in that case you get

384
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:08,699
credentials account

385
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:11,189
yeah well workstations all you need or

386
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:12,839
just as malware it has compromised the

387
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:15,150
station and that case again you get the

388
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:18,208
station you get some creds of the user

389
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:21,209
and you can go from here what we do in

390
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:24,209
that case first step is dumpster-diving

391
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:27,870
users has access to lots and lots and

392
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:30,390
lots of shares the first ones net logins

393
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:32,520
is fall where some scripts are usually

394
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:34,410
hosted if there is any sensitive

395
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:37,590
information these scripts grab it it's a

396
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:40,050
quick fix a quick win sorry easy easy to

397
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:43,770
get if there is passwords and run

398
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:44,520
scripts easy again to do that we have a

399
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:46,320
custom basket

400
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,900
it's written by one of the guy in the

401
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,510
assembly here this can be done with

402
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:54,570
power view as well or other tools just

403
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:57,360
use whatever suits your needs and once

404
00:17:54,570 --> 00:18:00,720
you get let's say passwords you can just

405
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:02,250
iterate again and if by chance you

406
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,800
encounter files

407
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:06,929
sorry shares that are writable remember

408
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:09,149
what we talked about before these SEF

409
00:18:06,929 --> 00:18:10,650
files we just drop them here and get

410
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:13,350
more connection to the responder that is

411
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:17,340
still running in the background again

412
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:19,080
increasing your odds in your favor this

413
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:21,570
is not one case actually there are

414
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:25,409
several so it happens a lot in the pen

415
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:28,379
test you find many information in those

416
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:31,920
shares he we have SQL credentials for

417
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:34,380
examples so server user password just

418
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:36,179
all you need to connect then if you're

419
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:38,160
lucky this is a system account again or

420
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:40,320
some good account and you can maybe

421
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,120
escalate this is out of scope for this

422
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:47,399
table because it's not for lazy people

423
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:49,350
and I usually don't do that but you can

424
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,450
find even easier stuff domain

425
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:54,570
credentials in that case some transfer

426
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:57,390
user kind of admin I can't exactly

427
00:18:54,570 --> 00:19:00,450
remember what this what access this one

428
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:03,410
had but again you get more privileges

429
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:06,600
you can go on in that case and find more

430
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:09,750
one current finding as well disk images

431
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:13,620
backups this allows you to go very quick

432
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:15,780
again specifically here your files you

433
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:18,600
can download it will just mount it

434
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:21,928
locally and then extract something from

435
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:23,580
the some files and GLM hashes in that

436
00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:26,429
case those are the ones you can pass the

437
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:28,409
hash with so then since you have the

438
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:30,840
names of the server it's very nice nice

439
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:33,300
it's ordered you can just get the hashes

440
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:35,189
pass the hash to the server can in local

441
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,990
admin on the server and if you're lucky

442
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:38,850
this works for several of them because

443
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:41,610
they are reusing the same credentials

444
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:43,139
and you can propagate that way you don't

445
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:46,919
need to crack this hash you can just

446
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:48,660
pass the hash so basically yeah maybe

447
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:51,450
who knows what is pass the hash because

448
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:54,929
I don't need to explain maybe okay maybe

449
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:57,510
I will explain a bit passing the hash is

450
00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:57,900
basically using the ntlm hash instead of

451
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,970
the

452
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:02,340
Shell's of the user because Windows will

453
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:03,540
accept this as an authentication method

454
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:06,209
so you don't need to crack the hash you

455
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:09,090
can use this just almost as a password

456
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:11,400
this works remotely you can do that with

457
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:14,070
several tools or locally you can do that

458
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,410
as well with other kind of tools and by

459
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:18,960
the way thanks to Tom at the Beast that

460
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:20,790
presented yesterday because in one of

461
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,530
those pen tests I used exactly one of

462
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:24,450
the tool he presented one of the

463
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:26,480
compiled by the Python script just to do

464
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:28,890
exactly that

465
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,230
going on for the photo shares you can

466
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:33,120
find more you can find use the data yeah

467
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:35,310
we don't care as a pen tester you can

468
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,110
find salaries passwords as I shown

469
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:39,389
vacation pictures music theme

470
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:42,060
collections backups yeah lots and lots

471
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:46,650
of stuff mostly not useful for you but

472
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:50,190
sometimes were throg yeah okay so I

473
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:52,200
already talked about that mitigation

474
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:54,120
here yeah once more

475
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,410
you see raise awareness security culture

476
00:20:54,120 --> 00:21:00,090
who is putting those passwords on shares

477
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:03,180
yeah well this one should know that it's

478
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:04,800
a bad idea don't do that don't first

479
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:07,380
don't have credentials in script if you

480
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:09,270
can avoid it but then don't put it on

481
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:11,430
shares for everyone in your company has

482
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:14,940
access or is this everyone group in

483
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:16,260
Windows and for the a specifically disk

484
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,000
and backups you can limit this to

485
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:21,540
administrator no one else need to access

486
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,010
those there's no reason for this maybe

487
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:24,629
an additional measure that would be

488
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:26,760
interesting if you have some kind of

489
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:28,500
tool some script that would look for all

490
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:31,170
the shares open to everyone in your

491
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:33,480
company and grab rag apps or whatever

492
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:36,600
you want to look for sensitive stuff

493
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,980
like passwords again might be cool you

494
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,199
would probably get lots of false

495
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:43,310
positive would require some tweaking but

496
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,310
might be a cool stuff to do

497
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:56,959
this one is maybe self explanatory for

498
00:21:53,510 --> 00:22:01,400
lots of you if you can boot from CD or

499
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:04,550
USB and that the disc is not encrypted

500
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:06,920
then you are already winning quickly

501
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:10,280
because you can escalate to local admin

502
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:13,070
you can come again this some file or

503
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:16,310
more exactly ntlm hashes that are

504
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:19,000
present in the sun file or you could as

505
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:23,169
well replace this util man that axial

506
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:27,860
executable here Oh No where is it here

507
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:30,500
by the CMD taxi some might remember this

508
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:33,080
sticky key backdoor that was pregnant

509
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:35,270
some years ago to say exactly what it

510
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:37,250
does you replace this and then when you

511
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:39,620
boot a computer on the login prompt you

512
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:42,110
can just type Windows you for the util

513
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:44,689
man and the binary that will read that

514
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:47,149
will be run by Windows a system is this

515
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:49,670
CMD instead of the utili basically you

516
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:52,610
get a shell as system on the login front

517
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:54,710
just by clicking from windows you and

518
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:58,010
then of course your system you can do

519
00:22:54,710 --> 00:23:00,050
whatever you want again by the way i've

520
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:02,840
presented some I've written some blog

521
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:04,129
post some month ago that showed how many

522
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,919
of those you find on the Internet

523
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:09,200
actually in Switzerland where more than

524
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:11,330
100 hosts where you could do this that

525
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,670
connect to a repeat to Windows you or

526
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:17,179
ship ship ship ship ship shift and get a

527
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:19,430
shell so it works it's used in the wild

528
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:22,100
yeah well as a pen tester use it as well

529
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:23,750
it works balloon I once more you can

530
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:30,409
also dump the hash pass the hash again

531
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:32,360
and you get access and mitigation here

532
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:35,120
that's not rocket science

533
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:37,969
hardened abuse you should not be able to

534
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,790
boot on USB and encrypted disk this is I

535
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:41,060
would say mandatory especially for

536
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:43,460
notebooks

537
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:45,500
this one is encrypted if it's not

538
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:47,330
opening unlocked like that it's

539
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,890
basically brick you cannot get any data

540
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:52,389
because you need a password and a token

541
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:52,390
to unlock this

542
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:59,290
and this one is my favorite as you've

543
00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:01,330
seen on the title slide um

544
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:03,250
custom susan scripts for the crypto

545
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:09,010
people it's exactly the same don't do

546
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:12,370
custom crypto well same for our for the

547
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:14,860
year for the security tools here the

548
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:17,770
there are two cases actually the first

549
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:19,629
one is this hotline help to that was

550
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:21,129
very nice it's a tool to give

551
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:22,990
information about the computer that's

552
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:24,460
presented in a nice way to the user such

553
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:26,200
that when the user calls the support

554
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:27,850
support can just ask or well please

555
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,430
could who could you go to this line and

556
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:32,560
tell me what's written here and user

557
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:35,020
doesn't need to do windows CMD type

558
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:38,950
ipconfig and enter more information just

559
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:42,120
read what's written here issue is that

560
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:47,190
you had some kind of lines like that

561
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:50,080
well sad folder for the tool especially

562
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:52,780
much more sad is that this user was

563
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:55,360
member of a building group in windows

564
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:58,510
called account operators and that's what

565
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:01,060
he can do it means you can add any user

566
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:03,490
to any group except domain admins

567
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:06,100
so you are admin of whatever you want

568
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:08,380
but not a domain when you get that yeah

569
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:13,240
it's only one more small step to get the

570
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:16,720
domain itself next tool we encountered

571
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:21,310
in this case several time that's the

572
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:23,290
level yeah this tool was designed to run

573
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:26,350
binaries as administrator on a computer

574
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:28,090
and it worked offline so basically the

575
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:30,580
idea is okay then must be the

576
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:31,419
credentials somewhere in the to sounds

577
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:34,270
like a challenge

578
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:39,100
I said maybe before that I liked puzzles

579
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:41,830
and challenge so first easy bypass for

580
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:43,030
this one it was a colleague of mine yeah

581
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:46,840
basically you could write in the

582
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:48,820
directory so yeah well no use just put

583
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:51,189
something in a common line in that case

584
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:54,040
it was something like net user compass

585
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:57,430
some password add net local group

586
00:25:54,040 --> 00:26:00,520
administrator add and yeah we are local

587
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:03,220
admin ok that was level one then

588
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:05,520
sometimes later we had a new pen test at

589
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:07,500
this company or maybe hardening

590
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,150
and we had no write access to the

591
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:11,130
directory but the binary rested here

592
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:13,830
although we said yeah well this is bad

593
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:16,740
idea on the principle please think about

594
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:19,350
that and yeah someone want to guess

595
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:22,500
what's the next bypass not the compost

596
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:24,419
guys because you know that knowing that

597
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:28,250
I come from the web world what would I

598
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:33,480
try no okay

599
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:33,960
that's the bypass yes and it works very

600
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,730
fine

601
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:39,780
so same command line we just put it

602
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:42,300
somewhere else add some dr. slash worst

603
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:44,760
thing is that they trying to fix it

604
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:47,520
during the same time test very quick fix

605
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:51,480
so some stuff were blocked but not this

606
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:57,810
one so yeah let's say cool for us let's

607
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:59,610
go and do it again yeah next time

608
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:02,179
because we had lots of projects with

609
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:07,409
this company they seem to realize that

610
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:10,680
somehow no write access no pass through

611
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:12,450
saw so this starts to be a bit less lazy

612
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:15,540
but that was not done by me by a

613
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:18,330
colleague static analysis dotnet binary

614
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:22,950
no obfuscation he compiled its CD

615
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:24,389
password in the code okay fine and there

616
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:26,670
is the last level

617
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:28,560
up to now maybe we'll get more pen test

618
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:29,730
I don't know I would like that I have

619
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:33,840
more batches for the next presentation

620
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:36,210
if if I can do that yeah again code

621
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,699
obfuscation and in that case I don't

622
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:41,040
want to do either reversing stuff I

623
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,570
usually first I have no time during the

624
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,870
pen test I would like to have time and

625
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:48,770
do that but yeah well you don't do that

626
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:51,780
so I kind of bypass this this way

627
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:53,970
monitor Windows API there's a tool that

628
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:55,860
works very well so you launch the binary

629
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:57,840
in the tool and you monitor this

630
00:27:55,860 --> 00:28:00,870
specific API call create process with

631
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:03,449
logon W and you run it there is exactly

632
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:05,159
exactly one call to this API and in the

633
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:07,440
parameters of the coil you see the user

634
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:10,590
yeah lots of information and the plain

635
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:13,260
text password so we'll see next time if

636
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:16,040
we go to them how we can do that this

637
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,040
should be interesting

638
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:22,780
yeah only mitigation I see here too

639
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:24,370
to remove this because you basically you

640
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:26,410
have the credentials in the binary if

641
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:28,090
someone takes enough time to analyze the

642
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:32,080
binary he will find them it's just a

643
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:34,230
matter of time yeah and I'm really not

644
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,939
so good at pen test reverse and so on so

645
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:38,350
yeah well next time maybe I ask a

646
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:43,840
colleague to do that for me for him for

647
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:46,270
me should work okay I stated this

648
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,840
already several time and this was in a

649
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:50,950
presentation

650
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:54,309
I found image very telling actually not

651
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:56,049
so bad for the pen testing I don't mind

652
00:28:54,309 --> 00:29:01,090
being like Rambo instead of James Bond

653
00:28:56,049 --> 00:29:04,120
works well as well yeah so we don't need

654
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:05,709
to be stealthy that's mostly

655
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,809
presentation of this tool that I've been

656
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:11,309
using successfully several times in the

657
00:29:07,809 --> 00:29:16,450
last month years crack map exact it's

658
00:29:11,309 --> 00:29:20,080
described as a Swiss Swiss knife for

659
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:22,960
post exploitation something it does lots

660
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:25,260
of stuff I don't know half of it look at

661
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,630
the github this is the actively

662
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:32,530
maintained by a guy called marchello

663
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:34,570
something by Twitter on Twitter I show

664
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:37,870
the references drinks afterwards if you

665
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:40,210
want to to have look what we've been

666
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:42,520
doing in that case what this comment

667
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:44,860
does is you specify the protocol you

668
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:50,590
want to work it with craft map exact

669
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:52,600
supports SMB mssql LDAP or yeah some of

670
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:55,840
those but mostly SMB is the most useful

671
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:58,510
when you specify the target for this

672
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,590
it's very flexible you can have lots of

673
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:01,570
fun ones we'll see this later

674
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:03,909
the authentication you want to use in

675
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:06,939
that case user password on the local

676
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:09,580
computer and this - - Sam basically

677
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:12,100
tells to dump just the hashes from the

678
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:14,620
some files so if the user and the pass

679
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:16,870
are valid you have local admin it just

680
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:20,379
does this remotely just dump the hurts

681
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:24,879
for you very useful and once you have

682
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:27,100
this in that specific industry we had

683
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:30,340
this access we could just get hashes and

684
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:31,750
then we did that we sprayed because

685
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,720
again we don't need to be stealthy who

686
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:34,970
can do this on the

687
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:38,030
all Network crack map exactly allows you

688
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:40,460
to do that you tell the subnets you want

689
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:43,039
to get you used user you can use the

690
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:46,190
hash very convenient so that's the hash

691
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:49,100
again this time on scale local oath

692
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:52,700
because password are used this works and

693
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:55,939
this comment will just specify to list

694
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:57,320
the list currently logged on users this

695
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:59,090
is where you can have a look at what is

696
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:02,240
interesting and you can run the next

697
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:04,850
comment so you choose what's interesting

698
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:07,600
you put this in the file specify this as

699
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:10,250
targets crack map exact kids is very

700
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:12,889
yeah very flexible in that case even

701
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:16,970
here you would miss the SMB typos on my

702
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:20,690
side but then again user hash local all

703
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:22,700
and you can do that this is a module in

704
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:25,460
crack map exact it's already built-in it

705
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:28,090
has been updated like one week or two

706
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:30,740
weeks ago to bypass a MSI on Windows and

707
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:31,610
this will run actually the partial

708
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:33,789
version of mimikatz

709
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:36,408
remotely so in memory no trace on disk

710
00:31:33,789 --> 00:31:38,030
kind of stealthy actually but yeah well

711
00:31:36,409 --> 00:31:41,150
since you do this on a whole domain you

712
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:43,250
don't care and it will just dude it's on

713
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:44,929
every host and you will get the answer

714
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:46,760
and crack map exactly is very cool for

715
00:31:44,929 --> 00:31:49,100
this because it has an integrated

716
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:51,440
database and it will store all the

717
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:53,360
answers he gets so all the creds then

718
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:57,020
you just use this tool crack map exact

719
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:59,809
TB and list all you have for this one I

720
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:02,650
can't remember probably 50 to 60 creds

721
00:31:59,809 --> 00:32:08,389
and then do whatever you want with this

722
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:10,429
probably you should report at this point

723
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:13,520
when when you've been doing that you

724
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:16,039
have so many creds that you basically

725
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:17,780
don't need more if you really want to go

726
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:20,840
to the domain admin there are some tools

727
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:22,908
that can be used that help you win a lot

728
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:25,459
of time this would be Power View and

729
00:32:22,909 --> 00:32:29,120
bloodhound this is very nice project

730
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:31,309
that actually builds a whole graph of

731
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,489
the active directory and the

732
00:32:31,309 --> 00:32:37,428
relationship between the groups between

733
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:39,530
yeah some more less obvious

734
00:32:37,429 --> 00:32:42,169
relationships like ACLs where you can

735
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:44,299
escalate and we'll present you all of

736
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:45,950
this analyze graphing interface you can

737
00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:48,110
do queries like how do

738
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:51,320
to get the shortest path from this user

739
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:53,360
to domina mean or which are all the

740
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:56,450
users recursively included in that group

741
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:59,500
this allows you to do that very quickly

742
00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:01,909
it should be first run such that you get

743
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:04,250
all the data collected then you import

744
00:33:01,909 --> 00:33:07,070
this in graph DB and you can exploit it

745
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:08,870
off today all the data you have here you

746
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:11,870
could go one step further actually this

747
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:14,959
guy pipe leader developed to know one

748
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:16,549
tool based on Empire so Empire is some

749
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,789
kind of post exploitation framework

750
00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:22,519
world coded in Python a portion can't

751
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:23,960
remember it will deploy agents on the

752
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:26,630
machines that you have compromised and

753
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:28,730
this pipe leader has developed some tool

754
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:33,649
called Death Star that will actually

755
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:36,139
basic based on Empire as soon as you can

756
00:33:33,649 --> 00:33:37,969
deploy an agent it will connect back to

757
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:39,260
death star and that star will use

758
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:41,419
actually the same kind of data as

759
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:44,210
bloodhound and try to automatically

760
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:46,789
exploit this put a new agent on the new

761
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:49,220
horse it can compromise and iterate

762
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:51,320
until it it basically compromise the

763
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:53,419
whole network I usually don't use that

764
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:55,668
because you never know where it will go

765
00:33:53,419 --> 00:33:58,309
what it will do and how it will end up

766
00:33:55,669 --> 00:34:04,519
but if you want to try it's probably fun

767
00:33:58,309 --> 00:34:08,029
to run in the network you have

768
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:09,819
mitigation gained credit reuse laps I've

769
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:13,040
mentioned this just in the meme here

770
00:34:09,819 --> 00:34:15,500
this is local and insulator password

771
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:18,109
solution it's developed by Microsoft

772
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:20,359
it's really targeted at those local

773
00:34:18,109 --> 00:34:22,339
administrator to avoid having them being

774
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:24,259
identical all over the network or all

775
00:34:22,339 --> 00:34:26,319
over this specific golden image that

776
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:29,750
you've been used to deploy your stations

777
00:34:26,319 --> 00:34:32,389
it will allow you to change the password

778
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:34,339
regularly and use random unique

779
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:36,950
strengths strong passwords and this will

780
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:39,828
be stored as far as I can judge securely

781
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:42,290
in the active directory and this way

782
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:44,240
will basically remove completely

783
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:47,029
discretionary use at least for the local

784
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:48,828
admins then for all the rest if your

785
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:51,349
users are using same passwords for the

786
00:34:48,829 --> 00:34:53,240
email for the CRM application whatever

787
00:34:51,349 --> 00:34:55,280
then of course you're in trouble

788
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:56,668
but then again awareness security

789
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:01,890
culture

790
00:34:56,668 --> 00:35:06,390
no more drip tips here and now since we

791
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:09,598
have time I have a bonus one we call

792
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:12,390
this internally printed trick we did

793
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:17,400
this first as my brother like one and a

794
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:19,799
half year ago we basically found web in

795
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,710
printer with the web interface open and

796
00:35:19,799 --> 00:35:26,430
default credentials so at first sight

797
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:28,799
nothing problematic but this printer was

798
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:32,069
a multi faction function was allowed to

799
00:35:28,799 --> 00:35:35,519
do scanning to lane and scanning to file

800
00:35:32,069 --> 00:35:38,460
and to do that it would look into Active

801
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:40,019
Directory through LDAP to get all the

802
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:42,569
emails of the users so you could

803
00:35:40,019 --> 00:35:44,519
conveniently go to the printer look for

804
00:35:42,569 --> 00:35:47,240
the user you want to send mail to with

805
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:50,430
the scans and then it will just do that

806
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:53,879
but big issue here the account used to

807
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:56,308
create the LDAP was a domain admin so

808
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:59,490
when you see that yeah well ok this

809
00:35:56,309 --> 00:36:01,980
feels like yeah well we should exploit

810
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:02,459
it's definitely what we could do in that

811
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:04,289
case

812
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:06,259
we couldn't export a configuration or at

813
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:09,450
least we weren't able to do that easily

814
00:36:06,259 --> 00:36:12,240
couldn't read this as we would like to

815
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:13,828
but we could do that we configure the

816
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,808
local LDAP server you could also use a

817
00:36:13,829 --> 00:36:17,220
responder for this you change the

818
00:36:15,809 --> 00:36:20,279
printer configuration remember we have

819
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:21,808
access on the web interface you say when

820
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:24,900
you want to query the LDAP data you

821
00:36:21,809 --> 00:36:26,730
connect to my own laptop and then you go

822
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,920
to the printer you say I would like to

823
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:32,400
do some scan to mail and it will search

824
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:34,849
for your for your user on your laptop

825
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,289
and sends you the credentials once more

826
00:36:34,849 --> 00:36:38,700
we have access to the admin interface we

827
00:36:37,289 --> 00:36:40,650
can say that this is done in plain text

828
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:43,410
that this doesn't require SSL

829
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:47,700
certificate whatever so yeah you can

830
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:49,890
just read the password in the in the TCP

831
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:52,740
dump or in responded hierarchy or view

832
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:55,200
you prefer so this one allowed for

833
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:57,209
nothing to do may not mean in one step

834
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:01,490
very cool when you can do that not that

835
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:01,490
often or hopefully

836
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:07,920
quick recap about the mitigations that's

837
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:09,630
all I've mentioned up to now so

838
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,120
basically security awareness for me this

839
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:14,850
is the most important stuff here because

840
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:18,140
all I've presented today is easy stuff

841
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:21,060
low-hanging fruits mistakes of people

842
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:23,400
that should be avoided at all cost

843
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:25,040
because it will allow for escalation

844
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:29,130
path and in the worst case dominant mean

845
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:31,920
so user where awareness would help not

846
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:34,290
for ya would not fix completely but

847
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,840
would help for fishing for this custom

848
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:39,750
tools for those passwords on shares the

849
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:41,580
credits reused lease privileges and so

850
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:43,560
on so forth this is basically for

851
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:45,330
everyone not only for the users for

852
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,820
developers for sysadmin for you CEO as

853
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:51,360
well if you can manage this this is very

854
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:53,460
cool then asset management as I said

855
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:55,650
it's not easy but once you know what you

856
00:37:53,460 --> 00:38:00,270
have it's very much easier to protect it

857
00:37:55,650 --> 00:38:02,460
and yeah we always find stuff that is

858
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:04,290
not known and this is not only hosts it

859
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:06,300
could be an old modem that is lying in

860
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:08,970
the corner and allowing connection

861
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:11,250
bypassing your whole firewalls and stuff

862
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:13,890
like that just know what you have in

863
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:15,750
your network then disabling what doesn't

864
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:18,240
need to be here this is basic security

865
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:21,120
principles and force SMB signing this is

866
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:24,419
not so hard to do and it will completely

867
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:25,859
remove this SMB relay and to me because

868
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:28,110
if you can if you had infrastructure

869
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:31,380
that supports this just Harling and

870
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:34,170
fully entangled encryption sorry yeah

871
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:36,750
again if you can do that if your user

872
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:38,550
will accept the extra burden of having

873
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:40,890
to plug a token put a password when

874
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:43,020
starting the disk it's definitely worth

875
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:45,180
it and I would say almost mandatory for

876
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:48,660
laptops because as soon as you got your

877
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:51,149
laptop stolen lost then someone could

878
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:52,620
just extract the disk and read what's on

879
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:55,620
it if it's not encrypted then you're

880
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:59,009
done yeah you're basically screwed

881
00:38:55,620 --> 00:39:01,759
and finally this Microsoft labs for the

882
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:05,490
credential reused and local admins would

883
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:10,310
personally it would be yeah a sad

884
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:14,009
situation on the network it would yeah

885
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:17,940
reduce my possibilities a lot or make it

886
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:21,300
harder yeah thanks for your help for

887
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:22,860
your attention I have still this list of

888
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:24,600
tools I mentioned here if you want to

889
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:26,880
take a picture is maybe that right and

890
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:30,450
now otherwise you probably can see the

891
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:33,600
video if you have questions I'm writing

892
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:36,540
time according to the network this small

893
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:38,130
lies here please ask them now because

894
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:40,200
afterwards I have to jump in a train I

895
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:43,500
go to a wedding this afternoon and I

896
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:44,990
won't be flying it wrong well thanks a

897
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:50,950
lot

898
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:50,950
[Applause]

899
00:39:55,130 --> 00:40:01,499
okay thank you very much

900
00:39:57,299 --> 00:40:05,038
are there any questions anyone we still

901
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:14,359
have time I will be sad if Exxon doesn't

902
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:14,359
ask a question that's too bad

903
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:20,700
hi thanks for the presentation I have

904
00:40:18,779 --> 00:40:23,599
you run bloodhound on any of your

905
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:26,399
engagements and did you have any bad

906
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:28,559
things happen performance issues or

907
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,440
anything you know no issues I've been

908
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:32,900
running this three times I think - now

909
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:36,089
any real engagement

910
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:39,569
engagements of the Testament locally

911
00:40:36,089 --> 00:40:41,670
no no issue sometimes issues to get the

912
00:40:39,569 --> 00:40:44,910
sessions of the users connected on the

913
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:46,680
on each host this somehow if I

914
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:49,348
understood correctly the blog articles

915
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:51,450
on the papers I've read you carried the

916
00:40:49,349 --> 00:40:53,809
active directory and it will just list

917
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:56,848
the sessions that have been opened in

918
00:40:53,809 --> 00:40:58,589
some time span before and this is not

919
00:40:56,849 --> 00:41:00,329
that long so you should run it in a loop

920
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:02,940
such that you get all the sessions back

921
00:41:00,329 --> 00:41:05,819
to you not except from this no no if you

922
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:07,470
want to know maybe use the sharp hound

923
00:41:05,819 --> 00:41:10,288
this is the initial version it's very

924
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:11,970
much faster and less never footprint if

925
00:41:10,289 --> 00:41:12,739
your environment is big enough it will

926
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:16,669
matter

927
00:41:12,739 --> 00:41:16,670
thanks welcome

928
00:41:23,609 --> 00:41:29,200
six for a presentation in a long-term

929
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,450
you is it more difficult or less

930
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,848
difficult to get into a system for

931
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:35,859
example a windows then I so it should be

932
00:41:33,849 --> 00:41:38,380
possible to get just into safe mode

933
00:41:35,859 --> 00:41:42,430
click around a bit and one gets also a

934
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:44,710
root shell I would say personally it's

935
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:47,009
easier because I'm learning a lot since

936
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:51,070
some years and then the more you know

937
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:53,349
the easiest it gets but at customers it

938
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:56,080
improves if that's the sense of your

939
00:41:53,349 --> 00:41:57,670
question yeah so hopefully it improves

940
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,740
that's also why we do that otherwise it

941
00:41:57,670 --> 00:42:05,650
makes no sense and custom I wouldn't pay

942
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:09,700
for this if it doesn't improve Awards ok

943
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:11,380
another question great a great

944
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:13,509
presentation quick question

945
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:15,960
did you do any purple teaming with this

946
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:18,280
and if so like how many defender tools

947
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:21,040
spot the typical low-hanging through

948
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:23,920
attacks and do they take action like

949
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:26,170
what percentage or roughly and I've

950
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:29,380
never done purple teaming or maybe this

951
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:33,280
depends on your definition yeah well I

952
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:36,010
would say I didn't do red teaming either

953
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:38,109
because for me if you don't have a real

954
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:40,630
blue team in front of you that will

955
00:42:38,109 --> 00:42:43,299
really be dedicated to monitoring what

956
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:45,550
happens looking at the logs analyzing

957
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:47,710
this developing tools for this reading

958
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:50,800
papers doing best practices and so on so

959
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:53,500
forth it's me it makes to my mind no

960
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:55,480
sense to call this red teaming so now

961
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:58,900
I've never done purple teaming I've been

962
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:01,330
caught at least one time like someone

963
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:03,490
just sent an email to the whole project

964
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:05,920
saying well someone is running mini cuts

965
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:08,709
on our server if you don't answer we

966
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:11,230
will just isolate this server and be

967
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:13,510
done with it yes good for them it's cool

968
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:15,609
it happens but it's really not that

969
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:18,130
often so I couldn't say it on purpose

970
00:43:15,609 --> 00:43:23,950
you know I would like to of course I

971
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:26,940
would like but not yet thank you

972
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:26,939
any questions

973
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:33,339
nice okay if nobody has any questions

974
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:34,740
anymore we can go to the coffee break

975
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:39,420
thank you very much

976
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:39,419
[Applause]
