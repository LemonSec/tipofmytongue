00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,730
group and last year they focus on the

16
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:51,449
fine they keep attacking the financial

17
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:54,300
Institute in South Korea and around the

18
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:57,718
world so I will talk about how they

19
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:00,629
attacked especially the cryptocurrency

20
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:05,189
agency and how they configure the

21
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:07,860
seedings infrastructure before moving on

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,420
a vo-tech researching and critical

42
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,359
infrastructure and banking thread and

43
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,569
some kind of sophisticated targeted we

44
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:20,109
found it off

45
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:23,040
on 2008 our CEO using Kaspersky's order

46
00:02:20,109 --> 00:02:28,780
to make this kind of team and he's a

47
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:32,620
keynote speaker costing layer and you

48
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:36,579
already saw this this slightly yesterday

49
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:40,530
but at the costings sliding his slide

50
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:47,459
does not include 2017 case but i had

51
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:51,010
2017 case you last year is very sorry

52
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:54,430
Esther it's a very busy year for me

53
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:56,828
because you can see blue not off we

54
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:58,959
published over top lunar of this curve

55
00:02:56,829 --> 00:03:01,540
is a behind the Bangladesh banking heist

56
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:04,359
at a still the 81 million u.s. dollar

57
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:07,000
from the Bangladeshi bank and they also

58
00:03:04,359 --> 00:03:09,669
attacked a whole many many Bank around

59
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,519
the world for example the Polish Bank

60
00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:14,949
and they also attacked some casino in

61
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:17,620
Latin America and they also attacked us

62
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:21,129
some crypto currency exchange last year

63
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:23,500
so we and they are still at weight very

64
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:26,608
activate cool-blue not off and the other

65
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:30,189
thing is the interesting such shadow pad

66
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:34,599
Costin is introduced about this group

67
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:36,728
yesterday when they doing some supply

68
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:39,399
chain attack last year they compromised

69
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:43,060
the one South Korea software vendor they

70
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:46,329
named Nessa so I contact them to

71
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:50,109
mitigate their combined compromised mods

72
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:52,509
they are very sophisticated group and so

73
00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:55,750
last year is very interesting year for

74
00:03:52,509 --> 00:04:01,589
me and in this presentation I will show

75
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:01,590
focus on just the disk group Lazarus and

76
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:08,139
anyone heard about the latter school yes

77
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:10,719
many people already know about this very

78
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:14,859
infamous group very not as apt blue and

79
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:17,529
many not only the security vendor but

80
00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:19,900
many governments around the world is

81
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:21,940
focus on this group it's very not horse

82
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:23,679
apt group definitely they are the

83
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:26,210
state-sponsored apt group they have a

84
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,759
well resource and

85
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:32,388
keep attacking some group and today I

86
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:35,690
think they have a many another team

87
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:37,430
member and the big groups and at the

88
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:39,770
first time they usually focus on the

89
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:42,470
cyber espionage and the cyber sabotage

90
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:46,008
but recently their main intention is a

91
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:48,590
financial profit and we divided this

92
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:51,349
group at the several groups they are big

93
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:54,919
entity Lazarus is a very big entity and

94
00:04:51,349 --> 00:04:57,440
we try to divide that group to another

95
00:04:54,919 --> 00:05:01,130
several sub group the first one is a and

96
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:03,139
Arya and and Ariel is the one of the sub

97
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:05,900
group of ladders they keep they just

98
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:07,550
focus on the South Korea last year they

99
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:10,099
attacked the South Korean Ministry of

100
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:13,070
National Defense and after that attack

101
00:05:10,099 --> 00:05:15,560
they attacking the South Korea o total

102
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:18,560
emotion they compromised in some ATM and

103
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,479
still some money this interesting at

104
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:25,550
first and they attacked the military and

105
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:27,949
next day or take the ATM so they steal

106
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:29,569
some military intelligence not only to

107
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:33,530
military intelligence they steal money

108
00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:36,440
and intelligence so and they are very

109
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:40,580
very long about the South Korea IT

110
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:42,650
environment they usually using the South

111
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:46,849
Korea software vulnerabilities just

112
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:49,400
using in South Korea so the very special

113
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:52,789
group for South Korea and the blue neuro

114
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:55,789
frizam the group sub T sub group is

115
00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:58,580
behind the Bangladesh bank heist so they

116
00:05:55,789 --> 00:06:01,150
only focus on to steal some money from

117
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:05,539
the financial institute around the world

118
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:08,359
the famous attack case is 2013 attack so

119
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:11,599
Lata maybe somebody already heard about

120
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:14,630
that at that time the ladders wiping out

121
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:18,740
medium and the bank hosting South Korea

122
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:21,199
so as I remember more than 6-thousand

123
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:23,719
hostess and wiping out this is in this

124
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,240
attack so it's very huge Seibert in

125
00:06:23,719 --> 00:06:28,759
south korea and after that 2014 the Sony

126
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,820
Pictures Entertainment is which they

127
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:33,530
steal some information from Sony

128
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,960
Pictures Entertainment and they are so

129
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:40,219
wiping out to so many hosting the Sony

130
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:43,159
Pictures and I think at from this time

131
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:45,260
many security vendors had a focus on

132
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:48,110
dastan ladder screw because he's a huge

133
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:50,000
incident and after that the blue

134
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:53,540
nerd-off is attacked by Bangladesh Bank

135
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,530
and last year is some famous wine some

136
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:59,690
wanna cry outbreak so is very famous one

137
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:02,659
of the famous curability we keep

138
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:04,730
tracking at this groom Lazarus so this

139
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:08,060
is the hour so that intelligence report

140
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:11,120
published the last year and you can see

141
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:14,330
that we described that this moral

142
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:17,120
framework and they keep attacking the

143
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:20,539
electronic cryptocurrency agency

144
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:23,180
operator and they hit casino last year

145
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:27,230
and they are definitely Korean speaking

146
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:29,000
actor so at every 3d intelligently forty

147
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:31,220
you can see the mario named of

148
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,680
manuscript we call this marius

149
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:35,570
manuscript as i know another one is

150
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,450
called it another name for example the

151
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:41,719
asset is called this maria may be

152
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:45,140
nuclear speed and us assert is called

153
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:47,660
another name the bank shot were with the

154
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:50,690
day before yesterday published a type of

155
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:52,700
frame something like that so but we

156
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:55,580
called this mario family system

157
00:07:52,700 --> 00:08:00,680
manuscript so in this presentation i

158
00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:03,200
will focus on this mafia framework so

159
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,350
what is some manuscript is the day

160
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:09,260
starting using the manuscript mario

161
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:12,260
around the 2013 it's a five years and

162
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:15,530
they still use it this mario families

163
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:17,900
very actively and this maria is many

164
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:20,359
over a veto all the largest code style

165
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:23,539
you know somebody know about operation

166
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:27,650
plot poster should report white paper

167
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:29,479
that we when we compare the manuscript

168
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:31,609
and the operation blockbuster mall where

169
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:34,189
there is many cobra and the scenes

170
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:36,950
infrastructure and at the first time

171
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:38,990
they using this mario family to attack

172
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:41,510
the national intelligence but recently

173
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:45,680
they using the dis maria family to

174
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:47,810
attack a financial sector this is only

175
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,180
stage of manuscript yet at the first

176
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:53,689
time they start to using this on 2013

177
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:54,120
and they have they using the many kind

178
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:56,970
of the

179
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:59,430
- what what a comet and a PDF document

180
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:04,410
and you can see that the first one is

181
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:07,500
that the union invitation decoy document

182
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:09,900
and the the sentence disguises the

183
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:12,779
university at South Point South of

184
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:16,140
California a second one is a some

185
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:18,210
invitation to seminar but the center is

186
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:22,110
a Korean military Ministry of a foreign

187
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:24,710
affair and third one is the same traffic

188
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:28,680
tell gender and then last one is says

189
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:31,290
this guy says sent from Stratus Division

190
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:34,979
United State a fourth Korea United

191
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:37,199
States US Army so at early stage they

192
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,330
using the dis Moria frame occur to steal

193
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,390
some military intelligence who are

194
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:44,220
government intelligence but now they

195
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:50,189
using the dis Mario family usually

196
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:52,860
attack the Crypt cross agency and from

197
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:57,029
now on let's see the otter case in South

198
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:58,830
Korea you know last year isn't

199
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:01,830
everybody's crazy about the

200
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:04,830
cryptocurrency I I hope nobody's losing

201
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:07,740
your money in this loom but it's the

202
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:09,900
same in South Korea many people invest

203
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:14,420
their money to cryptocurrency

204
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:18,510
some housewife made some money and

205
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:21,750
invest their money so and South Korea

206
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:24,750
has the many big huge cryptic insist

207
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:28,220
ginger icicle last year the length is

208
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:31,220
changed but we have a huge so many

209
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:35,459
cryptocurrencies change in South Korea

210
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:38,420
so you can see the many news from the

211
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:41,959
media there are so many cyber attack

212
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:44,339
aimed at South Korea cryptic exchange

213
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:47,160
for example this

214
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:49,650
CNN news is talk about a you beat is a

215
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,630
secure encrypted exchange the Ubud is a

216
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:55,020
bankrupt last year because of cyber

217
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:58,439
attack but I'm not sure the larger seal

218
00:10:55,020 --> 00:11:01,650
is related to this bankrupt but anyway

219
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:04,800
it is this exchange is bankrupt last

220
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:07,769
year and this news and this news is I

221
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,899
talk about another it

222
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:12,379
an exchange called up Islam they

223
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:15,329
attacking from last year in some

224
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:17,069
reinforcements and the media said news

225
00:11:15,329 --> 00:11:20,969
cries behind the discotheque

226
00:11:17,069 --> 00:11:24,420
Costin so some people said Lazarus's

227
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:27,089
attack Tabassum keep attacking and less

228
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:29,399
maybe last week another cryptocurrencies

229
00:11:27,089 --> 00:11:33,089
changed name the coin bail is bridge

230
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:37,589
they lost their money so us 40 million

231
00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:39,420
dollars last week and it means that they

232
00:11:37,589 --> 00:11:42,600
still attacking the South correct

233
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:47,429
exchange from the last year and until

234
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:49,049
very recently and this is the infection

235
00:11:47,429 --> 00:11:52,199
vector how they attacked our crypto

236
00:11:49,049 --> 00:11:54,809
currency exchange is the coming from the

237
00:11:52,199 --> 00:11:57,748
law enforcement announcement and our own

238
00:11:54,809 --> 00:11:59,850
investigation there is a silly initial

239
00:11:57,749 --> 00:12:03,209
infection vectors the first one some

240
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:06,449
malicious hwp file I know you are not

241
00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:09,238
familiar with hwp file I will talk about

242
00:12:06,449 --> 00:12:13,290
this one later and they also using the

243
00:12:09,239 --> 00:12:16,290
malicious of his file weaponized in what

244
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:19,790
document and the day also using the

245
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:24,149
malicious apk file they try to infect

246
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:27,449
operator Android machine and I'm not

247
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:29,670
sure what they did to infect the Android

248
00:12:27,449 --> 00:12:33,868
machine but they are anyway they using

249
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:36,449
the malicious apk file so in this attack

250
00:12:33,869 --> 00:12:40,799
case I will focus on the malicious HTTP

251
00:12:36,449 --> 00:12:43,740
file case the hwp file format is a stem

252
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:46,439
for the Hangul water processor Hangul

253
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:48,689
what the processes what the processing

254
00:12:46,439 --> 00:12:52,379
application developed a South Korea

255
00:12:48,689 --> 00:12:55,919
company made the Hangul and it's a water

256
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:57,449
processing program but usually using the

257
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:00,779
government agency and the government

258
00:12:57,449 --> 00:13:01,799
office in South Korea by law I can

259
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:04,470
understand that

260
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:06,600
is a national software activation policy

261
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:09,209
in South Korea so government agency and

262
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:13,100
always have to using the this water

263
00:13:09,209 --> 00:13:16,018
processor it means that is very good

264
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:18,720
attack vector photons threat actor soon

265
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:21,150
they usually focusing on that this file

266
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,670
format to attack the South Korea

267
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:25,770
and you can see that it tests a very

268
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:29,189
similar structure with an OpenOffice

269
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:31,319
word processor it tests on many streams

270
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:33,930
and binary data you can see that

271
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:37,710
document info it also support a Java

272
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:40,589
Script and it has each sections and it

273
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:43,800
has a file header but we will focus on

274
00:13:40,589 --> 00:13:48,510
this session that PS it stands for the

275
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:53,729
PostScript this hwe file also support of

276
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:55,800
PostScript the PostScript ISM at the

277
00:13:53,730 --> 00:14:00,570
first time TC is using for the printing

278
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:02,520
where document imaging but this

279
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:05,850
PostScript also support of all features

280
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:08,189
so for example using by this process

281
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:10,740
critter you can call the window API so

282
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:14,130
you can do anything by this poster squid

283
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:16,770
so so those ladders essentially they

284
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:23,150
usually using the chests of PostScript

285
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:28,230
to impact the potential reading so I

286
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:31,230
analyzed that maybe almost more than

287
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:36,240
fifty five-year-old sample hwp malicious

288
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:38,520
HW sample and as first one I categorize

289
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,970
the Tico document for student days

290
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:45,209
usually using the resume to send their

291
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:46,830
manuscript payload the legitimate

292
00:14:45,209 --> 00:14:50,339
contents of the resume is mainly

293
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:52,890
financial elated a person and some decoy

294
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:56,070
document include the picking company's

295
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:58,830
name so for example I will apply your

296
00:14:56,070 --> 00:15:01,230
company name to blah blah so it's easily

297
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:04,350
to know the attacked of each

298
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:06,900
cryptocurrency agency and they also

299
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:09,029
using the cryptocurrency contents they

300
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:11,640
click the currency related and use of

301
00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:14,900
our contents and cryptocurrency market

302
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:18,170
expectations and last one is that a you

303
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:22,829
also using the legal issue to threat

304
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:25,650
receiver and so the sender some low

305
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:30,240
were audit and forum about a legal issue

306
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:33,990
to make some people is executed this

307
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,810
more rare it's a whole will attack HTTP

308
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:38,740
finds

309
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:41,800
temples and I extracted whole metadata

310
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:45,100
from the hwp file it also has the other

311
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:49,959
name and less disable by a specific user

312
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:52,690
name so I asserted just a metadata or

313
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:54,760
the name and let's say you journey and

314
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:57,010
you test many connections so you can see

315
00:15:54,760 --> 00:16:00,580
the yellow one is a less stable Janine

316
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:03,279
and blue one is over the name and let

317
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:05,920
the point is malicious HTTP file because

318
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:08,680
the many connection is over and this

319
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:11,829
case it does redactor usually using the

320
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:13,719
this username Aloha Aloha I don't know

321
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:14,250
what is Marie Minton is not a South

322
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,230
Korean

323
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:19,870
elosha and they also using the default

324
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:22,330
username administrator so we strongly

325
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:26,070
believe that once redactors made this

326
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:31,150
whole malicious H debris samples and

327
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:33,300
from now on I will show each the poster

328
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:35,439
script type how they change their

329
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:38,949
strategy how they changed their post

330
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:41,890
discrete type a first one I analyzed the

331
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:44,770
fifty sample and categorize it as the

332
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:46,900
sixth type of poster script at the first

333
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:51,040
one they starting using the very simple

334
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:54,670
things is very is a real posts type it

335
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:56,770
has a ask X type payload at the end of

336
00:16:54,670 --> 00:17:00,579
the poster screech it's very simple just

337
00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:02,740
you can see the 45 AMG header you can

338
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:06,850
see that this is the exact exact window

339
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:09,609
P file and just leave this one and drop

340
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:12,369
the file at this pass in those Tata

341
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:15,129
folder spread it very simple just

342
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:17,649
dropping and drop the manuscript the

343
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:19,480
payload and execute it at the early

344
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:22,750
stage they using the disk and of course

345
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:24,329
discrete but you know it's very easy to

346
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:27,160
detect it because

347
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:31,780
PostScript has a some ass next time

348
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:34,120
exact also they after a few months later

349
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:36,178
they change their strategy and this

350
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:39,189
PostScript does not using the

351
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:40,150
vulnerabilities it's a function of the

352
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:44,080
PostScript

353
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:46,980
so it's very easy to use it but from the

354
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:49,549
type 2 they starting using the

355
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:52,260
but on ability about the poster script

356
00:17:49,549 --> 00:17:56,129
so you can see that they at the word

357
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:59,400
type 2 and starting using specific 4x2

358
00:17:56,130 --> 00:18:03,360
xwiki and this one then they started

359
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:06,000
using some strange Chinese variable name

360
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,428
I'm not sure what it means the Yahoo she

361
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,549
EEMA indeed is kind of a Chinese name

362
00:18:08,429 --> 00:18:14,940
and they're using the DS for white key

363
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:17,070
and decrypt this encrypted the

364
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:20,160
PostScript and the shellcode is the

365
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:23,129
email and just using decrypted this

366
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:27,179
email variable using that this kind of 4

367
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:30,210
by 2 XOR key at when you then I

368
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:33,980
decrypted this encrypted posters

369
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:37,590
credential call you can see that this

370
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:39,150
includes a shellcode and PostScript on

371
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:41,699
additional PostScript

372
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:45,270
this PostScript is used for triggering

373
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:48,320
the vulnerabilities and decreased data

374
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:50,820
contents this record and shellcode is a

375
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:56,120
dissolute image using for the hip spray

376
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:59,610
and you can see HGS TLS or e2 is the

377
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:02,209
PostScript handling module so they're

378
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:05,820
using the dis modules vulnerability and

379
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:12,230
making some Arabic asset and triggering

380
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:17,220
the exploit so this is type 2 of the

381
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:19,880
poster script when if this is Floyd is

382
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:23,160
working well social code adjust

383
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:25,710
shellcode just decrypt embed in the

384
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:28,860
manuscript depend on the windows person

385
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:31,580
32-bit and 64-bit and inject this

386
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:35,520
manuscript to the legitimate process

387
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:40,770
explorer that easy and the is Q T so

388
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:44,040
this ok and on the next that they change

389
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:46,830
their strategy they change I categorize

390
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:49,770
is just as three and four and they

391
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:51,928
remove the decryption process you know I

392
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:54,240
said that at that height to they using

393
00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:56,280
the four by 2x walkie and to create the

394
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:00,160
view share coat and poster screen but

395
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:03,490
from this type they just remove that

396
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:07,210
decryption process and they elaborate

397
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:10,360
the exploit code for executed reliably

398
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:13,150
and it's the same structure but just the

399
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:14,889
PostScript execute is a real check on

400
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:17,350
and the district order is just the

401
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:21,270
decrypt encrypted manuscript

402
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:24,520
depend on the Windows version so they

403
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:29,050
slightly change their posture scripts

404
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:31,540
full excuted very reliably and and I

405
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:35,230
categorize it it three and four because

406
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:37,000
they when they decrypt the encrypted

407
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:41,380
manically today using the another

408
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,390
techniques from at the type three they

409
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:46,240
using the four by textual description

410
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:49,420
but from the Typho they started using

411
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:53,770
the AES decryption so they change their

412
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:57,070
strategy and ty5 they add one line one

413
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:59,530
more function to evade me maybe

414
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:03,070
detection to evade detection this is a

415
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:05,710
XO Alateen just this routine is just the

416
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:08,230
X world is share code to create just

417
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:13,210
share code so it means that they add

418
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:18,060
some D of decryption routine at the type

419
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:21,820
v just they had a one byte XY key and

420
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:24,669
you know until now they whole PostScript

421
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:29,230
has an embedded manuscript payload it

422
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:32,470
means that it is sizes to be to just

423
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:34,810
folder document file but so they change

424
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:37,420
their from the PI SIG's and don't allow

425
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:40,750
they using the disk I know of a poster

426
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:43,870
script they the function of the shell

427
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:46,320
code is very simple it has us in postage

428
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:49,810
script to trigger the vulnerability and

429
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:52,240
but no more embedded payload embedded

430
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:54,220
manuscript more where the shell code is

431
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,080
just download more reaffirm the limit

432
00:21:54,220 --> 00:22:00,250
Osakis limit the server

433
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:04,889
sorry so until recently they using the

434
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:09,580
dis strategy so let's I know it's a very

435
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:11,950
complicated but let's summarize day at

436
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:13,439
the Taiwan they drop the embedded ask a

437
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:15,630
sty payload

438
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,450
at the type - they started using the

439
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:21,060
PostScript vulnerability and decrypt the

440
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:23,940
shellcode and we spray posters quickly

441
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:26,159
using the full byte X walkie and to keep

442
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:29,640
the payload with the four by 2x walkie

443
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:32,190
and from the type three they limit the

444
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:36,000
shellcode PostScript decryption routine

445
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:40,800
and the polishing their poster script

446
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,840
and until the type three when they

447
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:45,030
decrypt the payload that they using the

448
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,860
four white X walkie but the front of

449
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:49,790
Thai food they started using the AES

450
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:52,439
algorithm to decrease the payload and

451
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:54,780
Typho they add a shellcode

452
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:59,160
encryption post on by the decryption

453
00:22:54,780 --> 00:23:01,470
looting to decrypted rear shellcode and

454
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:04,380
type six they change their shellcode

455
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:08,220
type to download the real manuscript

456
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:10,110
from the limit server so it's a early

457
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,810
over last year and the recently they

458
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:15,899
keep changing their strategy to deliver

459
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:16,909
the manuscript payload to the potential

460
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,620
beacon

461
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:22,350
this is structure I just summarized that

462
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:24,530
you can see the type two and three four

463
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:27,510
and five is very similar structure and

464
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:30,780
Taiwan is all it stage very different

465
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:33,300
time it doesn't use any vulnerabilities

466
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:36,300
but you can see that they changed their

467
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:39,030
strategy from the Thai too and they keep

468
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:41,580
changing slightly and at the time

469
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:44,460
five-day just using the 1 by 2 X for

470
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:46,470
decryption routine and from the type 6

471
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:49,050
they start to remove the embedded

472
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:51,350
payload and they start to download we

473
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:55,860
are manuscript from the limited server

474
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:59,250
so I think they are very diligent they

475
00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:03,800
are very more keep walking to polishing

476
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:09,390
their attack vector and let me see the

477
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:12,000
each type / the functions for example

478
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:15,210
shellcode the decryption routine just

479
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,140
tied to using the four byte X 1 and type

480
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:18,930
5 & 6

481
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:21,330
add some own by text file decryption

482
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:23,790
routine and check all the triggering is

483
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:26,770
such a using the same same

484
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:29,560
vulnerabilities I don't know why people

485
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:32,320
does not patch but the government people

486
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:34,929
who does not want to patch so yes all

487
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:39,159
it's not a new vulnerability is not a

488
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:43,080
charity as I heard the Hangul software's

489
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:45,760
add some security module to prevent some

490
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:48,550
for example some Arabic a day where

491
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:52,660
their memory protection so it's not easy

492
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:55,450
to find us some Jared a from the Hangul

493
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:58,410
file so they keep using the old herbal

494
00:24:55,450 --> 00:25:02,050
ability but this excel they keep

495
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:03,850
attacking and payload the decryption at

496
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:06,250
the first time they using the full by

497
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:08,800
text while but they change it to AES

498
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:12,280
decryption more complicated one and

499
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:15,639
share code type is until the tie file

500
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:17,770
they embedded it they decrypt embedded

501
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:20,740
payload and they inject their payload

502
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:23,860
through the normal process but from the

503
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:28,060
type 6 they start to download it from

504
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:29,070
the limit server ok let's think about

505
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:31,629
this

506
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:35,110
changing from the attacker side and

507
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:37,990
defend the side at the first time I on

508
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:41,189
this hunger sample is to start from the

509
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:45,130
April of last year and until recently

510
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:51,220
the type 1 they just dropped ask X type

511
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:53,890
it's very easy to add is defended for

512
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:56,530
example the antivirus researcher is very

513
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:59,800
easy just detecting embedded ask X type

514
00:25:56,530 --> 00:26:01,480
poster script so they start to change

515
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,220
their strategy they started using the

516
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:06,180
exploit and the X while the shellcode

517
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:10,930
and is for retrieving triggering script

518
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:13,450
but X Y you know the poster script is

519
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:17,200
using the X Y key and the decrypt one

520
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:19,600
isn't really suspicious one post quickly

521
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,360
why post quickly using the decryption

522
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,879
between so they start to you detected

523
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:27,250
this routine so they change they'll

524
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:32,200
remove their detection duty and they

525
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:33,940
polishing the exploit code and they they

526
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,400
also change their

527
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:38,510
pelo the decryption routine from the XY

528
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,030
to the AES

529
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:44,450
so they start to detect the embedded

530
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:47,149
shell code at the poster script soul to

531
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:55,520
attacker added the one-bite XY

532
00:26:47,150 --> 00:27:00,260
decryption duty and a table company just

533
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:02,480
start to detect embedded huge size of

534
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:05,390
encrypted payload it's very suspicious

535
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:08,540
post the script is using for the imaging

536
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:11,630
were printing but it has a huge binary

537
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:13,610
data it could be some suspicious one so

538
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:15,919
they started detecting embedded in

539
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:18,799
creative payload so they start to

540
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:21,860
download it from the limata so so it's

541
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:24,080
very cat-and-mouse game of what echoing

542
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:26,659
defender it's just my private opinion

543
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:29,418
but when I analyzed that this whole

544
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:31,870
process create type it is interestingly

545
00:27:29,419 --> 00:27:34,880
is keep changing like this one

546
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:37,850
add some defender add some features and

547
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:40,940
they attacker change their strategy so

548
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:44,090
it's very interesting for me but after

549
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:46,669
this posters critic has a shell called

550
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:48,918
time I categorize the whole poster

551
00:27:46,669 --> 00:27:51,380
script as six tight but it has the same

552
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:54,320
shell code it means the same thread

553
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:57,140
actor is using the dispositor script it

554
00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:01,520
has almost the same basic block a

555
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:03,260
similarity is very high and when the

556
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,540
shellcode is processed searching it

557
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:08,840
using the same time is maybe his type -

558
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:12,950
shellcode is type 5 or 6 shellcode so

559
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:15,020
using the same shellcode when and if the

560
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:18,169
shellcode want to get handle it also

561
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:20,270
using the same circle the shellcode is

562
00:28:18,169 --> 00:28:22,250
very simple at the first time the

563
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:26,330
shellcode is fine at the coefficient key

564
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:29,990
from them they try to search a a BB CC

565
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:35,049
DD marker and read the decryption key

566
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:39,070
and get API address buying the hash and

567
00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:42,980
cut handle using the window API anti

568
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:45,980
duplicate objects APN and just decrypt

569
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:48,580
will payload the old manuscripts these

570
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:52,720
cases using the x1 but

571
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:55,090
they change to AES algorithm and finally

572
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:58,899
they inject the this manuscript to the

573
00:28:55,090 --> 00:29:01,750
explore that exe process that's a whole

574
00:28:58,899 --> 00:29:04,750
feature of the circle it's the same

575
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:10,090
whole whole post discrete type has the

576
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:12,519
same Shaka and payload is also as I

577
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:14,830
mentioned these of manuscripts but it's

578
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:18,179
a two type of manuscript the first time

579
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:21,639
is IP basis since communication time it

580
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:24,370
only using the up to type to post the

581
00:29:21,639 --> 00:29:26,590
script it's the old one but nothing

582
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:30,090
after the November last year November

583
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:32,439
and it includes a fake Assessor

584
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:36,189
communications if you have an interest

585
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:38,620
of a large tools is definitely one of

586
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:42,130
the characteristics of ladders they

587
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:44,830
embedded a whole Moomin domain name and

588
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:49,269
when they start to assess communication

589
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:51,970
they using the this domain name to

590
00:29:49,269 --> 00:29:54,309
making some encryption channel but they

591
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:56,230
does not using the ssl encryption when

592
00:29:54,309 --> 00:29:59,110
they really send some data and a

593
00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:02,769
receiver they just using the fake SS

594
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:05,529
communication and feature is just a full

595
00:30:02,769 --> 00:30:08,289
feature packed or taken handling file

596
00:30:05,529 --> 00:30:10,779
and processes could command on send some

597
00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:13,029
data to see the server and the other

598
00:30:10,779 --> 00:30:15,820
type is HTTP based the scenes

599
00:30:13,029 --> 00:30:18,909
communications they usually using the

600
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:21,460
disc type of manuscript and using the

601
00:30:18,909 --> 00:30:24,789
compromised server in South Korea and

602
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:29,679
sometimes in China and they using the

603
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:33,100
day they unload their own CNC script to

604
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:35,470
the compromised over and this manuscript

605
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:37,209
also has a full feature packed or he can

606
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:40,929
control the whole senses the impact to

607
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:42,909
the host and at the CNC infrastructure

608
00:30:40,929 --> 00:30:49,210
introduction I will focus on that these

609
00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:53,080
kind of manuscripts and as I say I

610
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:55,299
analyze it on 50 sample when but the

611
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:58,240
type of CNC server is just a theory type

612
00:30:55,299 --> 00:31:01,120
so first one is a compromise over the

613
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:04,460
Lazarus is compromised

614
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:07,129
so all around the board and is the

615
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:09,710
direct connect to the IP address it does

616
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:11,840
not using the domain II and they start

617
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:14,810
to using the encrypted channel as I

618
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:17,179
imagined the fake SSL channel and the

619
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:18,740
other type is they compromised the web

620
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:21,890
server in South Korea just in South

621
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:26,050
Korea they usually compromise the iis

622
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:28,550
server and they all know their own JSP

623
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:31,460
script to the compromised server and

624
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:33,260
they maybe they using the specific both

625
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:35,540
vulnerabilities the South Korea both

626
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:37,820
this one is also using only using in

627
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:42,530
South Korea and they also using the word

628
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:44,870
process for an ability and you know we I

629
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:47,990
working closely with law enforcement in

630
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:50,479
South Korea so when I found that this

631
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:53,150
kind of compromise over I just sent the

632
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:58,000
information to law enforcement so it's

633
00:31:53,150 --> 00:32:00,140
easy to react so fast because he

634
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,930
disobeys in South Korea so law

635
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:04,820
enforcement just contact administrator

636
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:07,370
and remove this script

637
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:10,429
it's very easy so recently they started

638
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:13,969
using the sovereign in China there is

639
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:17,780
not easy to react too fast in China you

640
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:22,550
know the China policy is not and I don't

641
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:25,910
know but he started using the compromise

642
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:30,730
that is over in China so they unloaded

643
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:34,940
their PHP script and this to of the

644
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:38,240
website using the same CMS I see that

645
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:39,680
that a CMS maybe is a China CMS and they

646
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:43,460
also using the word process for

647
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:45,500
abilities so they using the Silk I'd say

648
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:48,140
type of scene server and I will show

649
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:52,040
those sensible configuration about that

650
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:54,080
this kind of system and then does not

651
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:56,270
only using the hwt why are they using

652
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,040
the word process file you can see that

653
00:32:56,270 --> 00:33:02,690
this is what process file or take the

654
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:04,940
South Korea Exchange and they using the

655
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:08,090
macro file and I will show this one

656
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:09,830
later and this is the one of the case

657
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:13,010
that how they persist on to attack

658
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:14,220
Taiwan B team I saw this case in from

659
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:16,350
the body escape

660
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:22,049
scanner service you know the buyers

661
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:24,629
total they this is a hwp file is this in

662
00:33:22,049 --> 00:33:28,168
the water file but it has a same violent

663
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:30,090
Bitcoin wallet address and transaction

664
00:33:28,169 --> 00:33:34,110
number but it has the same decoy

665
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:35,668
document but one is the malicious hwp

666
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:38,010
and the other is the malicious water

667
00:33:35,669 --> 00:33:41,580
file it unload the from the same source

668
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:44,789
from the South Korea I I think is the

669
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:47,970
b-team potential beat him but they

670
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:50,539
unload this one at the same day the same

671
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:53,880
filing and from the same source and

672
00:33:50,539 --> 00:33:56,908
after four days later another malicious

673
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:59,309
file between transaction history that

674
00:33:56,909 --> 00:34:01,470
excel file is unloaded from the same

675
00:33:59,309 --> 00:34:04,620
source it means that they keep attacking

676
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:06,929
the one became in South Korea at the

677
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:09,598
first time they sent the malicious hwp

678
00:34:06,929 --> 00:34:12,240
file and next two days in the water file

679
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:14,790
and they send the manages the excel file

680
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:21,239
they keep attacking the one beating just

681
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:24,000
using the same strategy and let's let me

682
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:26,279
see there another countries case they

683
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,469
just know they just usually focus on

684
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:30,330
South Korea but they also attacked on

685
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:34,020
another countries all around the world

686
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:36,210
and at that at this time they using the

687
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:38,550
sphere fishing case on that same per

688
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:41,280
fish case and they you know you guys

689
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:44,040
does not using the hwp you didn't so

690
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,409
they using the malicious Office document

691
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:49,739
and the it's not has done some

692
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:54,450
vulnerability they using them macro

693
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:58,950
embedded malicious water file and this

694
00:34:54,449 --> 00:35:01,319
macro is a really awful skated but is

695
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:04,230
very simple it has adjusted to function

696
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:06,390
one macro so just create a payload this

697
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:09,420
payload is a very similar with a

698
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:12,569
manuscript we call it for sure but is a

699
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:15,780
man script type and the other macro is a

700
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:21,720
created real decoy document and to

701
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:26,930
deceive the user and then whose target I

702
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:29,430
I categorize that I just a suspect

703
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:33,379
based on the contents of the decoy

704
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:35,879
document I try to figure out who is the

705
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:39,270
target at first time they are usually

706
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:41,520
using the finance-related decoy document

707
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:45,780
you can see that this is Citibank in

708
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:50,630
Mexico and this is a BBB a bank name and

709
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:53,880
this tactical document is hav C in

710
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:56,280
United Kingdom and this decoy document

711
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:59,160
is also a Chevy's insurance in Hong Kong

712
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:02,220
so they usually using the discount of

713
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:04,980
decode document and the other is some

714
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:08,339
kind of contents of engineering first

715
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:11,510
one is Blizzard Entertainment's project

716
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:17,250
manager is possibly a project manager

717
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:21,450
the other is own I as I've from the

718
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:25,250
googling is a Polish city name I don't

719
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:29,250
know how can i express this water so

720
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:32,190
Michele thank you and they using the sum

721
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:35,490
CIB operation project manager for this

722
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:37,320
operation center and last thing is that

723
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:41,310
they also using the crypto currency

724
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:44,880
decoy it's a investigation investment

725
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:50,330
proposal from some fin tech company and

726
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:54,300
this one is will a crypto currency

727
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:57,650
exchange name you know I forgot which

728
00:36:54,300 --> 00:37:00,869
countries and this one is a coin base

729
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:02,640
where crypto currency exchange name and

730
00:37:00,869 --> 00:37:06,690
they're using that this kind of decoy

731
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:09,450
document and it has this malicious macro

732
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:12,060
embedded water file has the same payload

733
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:14,399
this pehla pehla doors is a

734
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:16,380
full-featured packed one also known as

735
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,859
the Ford Shale many bender is a call

736
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:21,180
this one as fortune and research cert is

737
00:37:19,859 --> 00:37:23,220
also called a fortune

738
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:26,220
this is IP based communication it also

739
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:28,770
using the fake SSL communications and it

740
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:30,839
using the compromises over T the ladders

741
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:35,490
already compromised on many servers and

742
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:38,040
using the dis payload to steal some data

743
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:39,350
and they also using the HTTP based

744
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,750
deceit communication

745
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:45,110
is the same the South Korea not the case

746
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:47,710
and another country so the case and it's

747
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:50,750
a full-featured backdoor it can be the

748
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:52,430
file handling the file or process or

749
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:54,820
collect some system information is a

750
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:58,580
full feature the backdoor

751
00:37:54,820 --> 00:38:03,380
then let's see the C&C server

752
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:06,500
configuration how they configure the ec2

753
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:09,380
server I don't have them anytime soon

754
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:12,260
less moving quickly I I started this

755
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:14,600
invocation from the one malicious hwp

756
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:16,130
file I found the phone scenes over from

757
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:18,830
the South Korea so I shared this

758
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:21,380
information to the investigation agency

759
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:23,900
in South Korea that they look up they

760
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:26,570
they're compromised over and the found

761
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:28,970
the one proxy module and next hope is in

762
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:30,890
France so it's not easy to more

763
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:34,220
investigation so they just share this

764
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:37,940
proxy module to meets and I did some

765
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:40,490
aromatic I made a terrible and keep to

766
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:43,310
expanding my research from our telemetry

767
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:45,859
and I found many compromise over around

768
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:50,060
the world and how they configured as a

769
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:52,870
server so at the conclusion day using

770
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:55,340
the multistage process severity

771
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:56,900
configure the many compromised over and

772
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:59,360
when the man script is thought to

773
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:01,130
connect the first top this hope is just

774
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:03,200
for the trapping another hope and

775
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:05,420
finally the traffic is go to the final

776
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:08,450
stage of the city so they configure

777
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:13,160
their whole city server like this one

778
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:15,680
and when I extracted a whole they I made

779
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:16,520
this map using our telemetry they

780
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,919
attacked

781
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:21,320
citrus over her around the world it does

782
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:23,750
not focus on the one region or world 1

783
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:28,400
continental they attack many many server

784
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:30,290
in South Korea USA Europe reason and I

785
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,840
found the main tools from the city

786
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:34,820
server they using the back to a variant

787
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:37,400
they also using the active backdoor and

788
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:39,590
passive style backdoor and HTTP back

789
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:42,440
tour it's the same manuscript when they

790
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:44,600
attack the crypto currency agency they

791
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:46,490
using the dead tools when they configure

792
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:48,890
to see to server is the same

793
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:51,770
full-featured back door and the other is

794
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:53,160
approximately more where they configure

795
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:56,009
their multi stage of

796
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:57,868
see servers so they're using the main

797
00:39:56,010 --> 00:40:00,390
component of the server is the proxy

798
00:39:57,869 --> 00:40:03,210
motion and they also using the

799
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:05,509
information harvester they extract a TCP

800
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:10,020
connection from the inbound and outbound

801
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:12,900
connection and if they if they conclude

802
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:15,450
that host is valuable they start to

803
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:18,690
compromise the corporate network I saw

804
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:21,078
that one case at Latin America so they

805
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:24,089
start to gather some information at

806
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:27,210
compromised OMA and the other choice

807
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:29,640
that they also using some wiper to erase

808
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:33,569
their evidence where specific files

809
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:36,569
securely and important thing is a proxy

810
00:40:33,569 --> 00:40:39,680
measure is this is just a simply for the

811
00:40:36,569 --> 00:40:42,599
incoming traffic to the next hole they

812
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:45,569
configure the multi staging proxy module

813
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:47,480
taste or the configuration at the space

814
00:40:45,569 --> 00:40:50,730
village is tricky

815
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:55,549
after this speaking I will publish this

816
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:58,559
presentation on the internet so just to

817
00:40:55,549 --> 00:41:00,839
quickly move they'd save the

818
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:02,940
configuration as a specific file TCP

819
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:05,069
beep that IME and they keep attacking

820
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:09,630
this configuration file from the another

821
00:41:05,069 --> 00:41:11,788
hole and they also add all of the pot

822
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:14,910
lists using the Windows command using

823
00:41:11,789 --> 00:41:17,520
the nasha comment and add to the allow

824
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:19,649
the list to proxy motion and if they

825
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,890
also using the same fake SSL

826
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:24,750
communication it's definitely one of the

827
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:27,118
big characteristics of larger smoocher

828
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:29,460
they keep using that these fake SSL

829
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:32,490
communication I heard from I saw the

830
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:35,190
Twitter last last ain't some polish

831
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:37,680
researcher polish about that this one

832
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:40,740
fake SSL communication so you can't

833
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:43,950
found it and I found out another

834
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:47,569
interesting proximity they keep changing

835
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:51,930
their strategies and the this one is a

836
00:41:47,569 --> 00:41:55,109
lately used this module and this this is

837
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:58,078
a very interesting this ttv proxy has to

838
00:41:55,109 --> 00:42:01,170
hold this c2 server as a global p2p

839
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:04,460
maybe it is a pathway back to module D

840
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:08,480
install that is color board p2p

841
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:11,300
this in fact p2p proxy infecting host

842
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:14,330
has a twister and once that is receive

843
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:16,670
data from the global p2p receive data

844
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:19,580
and right hip to the listened to name

845
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:22,130
the pipe it just communicate using the

846
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:23,839
named pipe and through is a list data

847
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:26,060
from the external name the pipeline

848
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:28,369
descended to the global p2p server it

849
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:30,890
means that they want to communicate it

850
00:42:28,369 --> 00:42:33,230
internal in fact Li the host and send a

851
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:36,950
data just one channel to the internet

852
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:39,740
internet host I think that they can use

853
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:42,680
this kind of a proxy at the to type the

854
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:45,140
one is the isolate network you know the

855
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:47,210
either it at a isolated network just off

856
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:50,150
you host the can connected to the

857
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:52,640
Internet so they using the pit this kind

858
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:55,250
of little bit proxy just this host if

859
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:58,700
this cost can connected to the Internet

860
00:42:55,250 --> 00:43:01,369
they just implant that hosting yeah

861
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:03,439
adhere and the other case is that if

862
00:43:01,369 --> 00:43:08,150
they want to compromise the whole ISP

863
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:11,960
for one ISP they started using one just

864
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:13,970
one hostage that try to receive some

865
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:17,270
configuration from the external host and

866
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:19,279
they using just to using the name the

867
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:21,710
pipe and communicate at the internal

868
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:25,670
host it's very interesting case and

869
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:28,010
active pet tourism CNC servers just has

870
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:30,230
a configuration data in register key

871
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:32,810
like this one and it's all sort of

872
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:35,750
full-featured backdoor and he also has

873
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:37,160
the HTTP based communications it's the

874
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:39,200
same one when they attacked our

875
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,980
cryptocurrency agency so they using the

876
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,040
same backdoor

877
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:45,470
they control that ast2 server and choose

878
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:47,599
the interesting is a choose the HT head

879
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:49,759
or gather are posting land land only and

880
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:52,510
when they communication when they

881
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:55,070
communicated to sit server so and

882
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:58,099
Pacific backed or does not have a city

883
00:43:55,070 --> 00:44:01,790
server you just open the pot and listen

884
00:43:58,099 --> 00:44:03,530
the comment from the attacker and it's

885
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:05,770
the installation process is an

886
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:09,859
interesting scene is that they have

887
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:11,839
their own file naming features so

888
00:44:09,859 --> 00:44:14,000
example they get a Windows service the

889
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:16,460
list and the choose one land on me for

890
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,430
example share the access and get this

891
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:20,440
play name of the service and all

892
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:22,118
and at the end of the subs name as

893
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:24,670
service internet connection sharing

894
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:26,890
service and appended the decrypted

895
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:28,869
string at the service this is a decrease

896
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:31,058
is an essential element of Windows

897
00:44:28,869 --> 00:44:34,510
service bla bla and the changes service

898
00:44:31,059 --> 00:44:37,900
name as a small case this one and

899
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:40,809
appended as we see to share of this SVC

900
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:44,050
and the drop down menu dropped a passive

901
00:44:40,809 --> 00:44:47,920
back to same name share access SVC that

902
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:50,770
DLL and change the file timestamp so it

903
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,809
could be of some kind of IOC the

904
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:55,869
indicator of compromise the your server

905
00:44:52,809 --> 00:44:58,990
so and this passive backed over has a

906
00:44:55,869 --> 00:45:02,140
fire up punching function to open the

907
00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:03,069
allowed open the panel file instead a

908
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:05,589
Windows Firewall

909
00:45:03,069 --> 00:45:08,829
and back to our function is insane at

910
00:45:05,589 --> 00:45:11,020
active backdoor and the other three

911
00:45:08,829 --> 00:45:13,059
statistic connection harvester depending

912
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:17,160
on the West version that using a

913
00:45:13,059 --> 00:45:19,450
choosing the a piane and add the whole

914
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:22,990
inbound and outbound connection to that

915
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:25,270
is this file and and local VIPRE

916
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:27,868
generate a random number and override of

917
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:31,329
whole pile and data repeatedly for

918
00:45:27,869 --> 00:45:36,460
prevent the forensic investigation and

919
00:45:31,329 --> 00:45:38,380
delete file and I found the many chosen

920
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:40,960
from the or around the world and you can

921
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:42,819
see the test in the server compromised

922
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:46,270
over Indonesia just has an active

923
00:45:42,819 --> 00:45:49,480
backdoor and India sober has many many

924
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:52,569
tools and and Korea also has a main

925
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:57,210
tools it means that they implant many

926
00:45:52,569 --> 00:45:57,210
their truth depending on the situations

927
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:03,189
so what cases I found the active effect

928
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:05,710
world and this vector is a founder from

929
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:08,589
the many countries Columbia Indonesia

930
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:11,619
German India South Korea Sri Lanka

931
00:46:08,589 --> 00:46:12,308
so they means that they compromised all

932
00:46:11,619 --> 00:46:14,650
sober

933
00:46:12,309 --> 00:46:16,930
land on me around the world and the

934
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:19,210
other thing is the I found the one

935
00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:22,029
passage impassive backdoor from the

936
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:24,970
Panama sober and Vietnam server but it

937
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:28,420
at the Panama so they install the proxy

938
00:46:24,970 --> 00:46:30,220
and HTTP back to but bitten observer

939
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:30,790
they only have the TCP connection

940
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:34,390
happiest

941
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:37,210
in mr. testa to some information from

942
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:39,910
the if this is the early stage and this

943
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:41,980
disobeys I already installed the proxy

944
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:46,330
server we started using this and one of

945
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:48,220
the proxy and then what was the Borland

946
00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:51,370
ability to compromise the t's servers

947
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:54,790
and I extract a whole server information

948
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:57,250
to stay using the Windows Server 2003

949
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:59,080
very old one and is a high so John this

950
00:46:57,250 --> 00:47:04,240
is 6.0 very old one

951
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:06,580
so they're using the CVE 2017 seven two

952
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:09,549
six nine below nobility fortunately I

953
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:11,410
found a one tool they using they using

954
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:15,990
the disabled honorable key scanner and

955
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:18,490
the scandal and it's over randomly this

956
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:22,540
exploit this vulnerability is published

957
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:24,490
on March of last year and after five

958
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:28,810
days later the Pierce code is on no to

959
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:31,419
the metas flow in motion and after two

960
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:34,020
weeks later tort actually build the

961
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:36,250
ladder assist to attack and the

962
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:40,509
Microsoft is polished I have the two

963
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:42,160
months later and let's potentially that

964
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:44,110
the ladders guru is configured their

965
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:46,089
city infrastructure as a C&C server

966
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:48,310
infrastructure and they using the many

967
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:51,670
kind of truth active passive and

968
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:53,590
proximity semester and sometimes they in

969
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:56,700
fact a cooperator host from the server

970
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:59,770
and they send some weaponized the

971
00:47:56,700 --> 00:48:02,009
malicious hwp firewall document what

972
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:04,330
document and the b-team if the b-team

973
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:07,120
infected a manuscript they start to

974
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:11,200
communicated one of the hope of a proxy

975
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:13,710
server this is a whole feature of the

976
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:15,970
how they attacked

977
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:19,750
cryptocurrencies changing and another

978
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:22,870
financial institute and this is the

979
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:24,730
conclusion they keep trying to

980
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:27,339
compromise the horse over around the

981
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:30,070
world so if you search where if you

982
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:32,440
security operator never let you a server

983
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:35,380
to compromise this please update and

984
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:37,990
take a keep polishing their tools so

985
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:39,820
they're very diligent guy I think and

986
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:42,370
their favorite attack vectors is

987
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:43,920
spearfishing so it's very important to

988
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:45,750
educate the person

989
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,760
please don't click the suspicious want

990
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:50,609
to please don't open the such malicious

991
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:54,630
file and be simply they keep changing

992
00:48:50,609 --> 00:48:59,848
their TTP's they start to adopt the

993
00:48:54,630 --> 00:49:03,180
PowerShell to their framework so so we

994
00:48:59,849 --> 00:49:04,680
have to head up of their TTP's keep head

995
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:07,799
up it's very important I think the

996
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:11,569
intelligence is not a scenario of the

997
00:49:07,799 --> 00:49:14,460
movie like a cold war loss chart actors

998
00:49:11,569 --> 00:49:17,700
yes it's not important things that I

999
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:20,910
think that this kind of a tactic full

1000
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:22,859
and procedure no so each other technical

1001
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:28,348
person is very important I think so

1002
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:31,288
that's my conclusion and if you can

1003
00:49:28,349 --> 00:49:33,210

00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:43,799
thank you very much are there any

1008
00:49:41,789 --> 00:49:47,369
questions yeah we don't have much time

1009
00:49:43,799 --> 00:49:49,950
that's probably one or two question I'm

1010
00:49:47,369 --> 00:49:52,289
not familiar with the angle software but

1011
00:49:49,950 --> 00:49:54,240
is it is the PS going to execute

1012
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:56,309
automatically or is there like a

1013
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:58,529
Microsoft it asked you or there's a

1014
00:49:56,309 --> 00:50:03,420
macro marker that you won't run it like

1015
00:49:58,529 --> 00:50:06,150
is it just running I'm sorry I can't

1016
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:12,390
understand right so when when the victim

1017
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:16,859
is opening hhw does the PS file inside

1018
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:18,269
execute automatically uses QT

1019
00:50:16,859 --> 00:50:21,000
automatically it's the one of the

1020
00:50:18,269 --> 00:50:23,939
functioning feature of the Hangul file

1021
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,890
yeah so it's not like what you basically

1022
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:27,869
they ask you there is a market you

1023
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:31,200
yesterday doesn't ask him on this great

1024
00:50:27,869 --> 00:50:34,220
so it's cute automatically I'm not sure

1025
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:39,299
what that kind of feature is include

1026
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:41,680
okay another question you can send a

1027
00:50:39,299 --> 00:50:45,970
question by email

1028
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:48,399
I was just wondering do you expect that

1029
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:50,589
the attacks that you are seeing focusing

1030
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:53,680
on the South Korea will change and be

1031
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:56,230
broader or they stop targeting you now

1032
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:59,038
that politically things are also

1033
00:50:56,230 --> 00:51:01,990
evolving yes I just talked about

1034
00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:04,839
financial focus attack but they just not

1035
00:51:01,990 --> 00:51:07,660
attacked South Korea because another

1036
00:51:04,839 --> 00:51:09,490
country I saw more money so they keep

1037
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:12,299
attacking to another many countries and

1038
00:51:09,490 --> 00:51:15,700
they are not just a focus on the

1039
00:51:12,299 --> 00:51:20,349
financial attack and they something

1040
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:23,049
recently they attacked some political

1041
00:51:20,349 --> 00:51:24,880
issue related intelligence you know the

1042
00:51:23,049 --> 00:51:27,970
North Korea and South Korea summit and

1043
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:29,920
