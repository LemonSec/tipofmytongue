1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:09,500
cool my name is Dave Lehmann Berg I am

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,179
for a senior threat analyst at Tallis

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:15,240
Telus is the threat intelligence arm of

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:17,490
Cisco within Telus I'm on a team called

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,490
the threat interdiction team which is

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:23,519
basically a hunting team and within that

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:26,759
team my team focuses on the asia-pacific

8
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:30,299
and my work specifically focuses on

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:33,899
China and the reason for that is is that

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:36,120
I speak read write Chinese lived in

11
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:37,469
China for several years and have worked

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,860
on China

13
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:42,930
for a long long time and very happy to

14
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,940
be speaking to you all today and it's

15
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:49,370
great to be in Switzerland in Zurich

16
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:52,099
beautiful city so thanks for having me

17
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:54,480
today we're going to be talking about

18
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:57,390
illicit mining of the cryptocurrency

19
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,910
monaro by Chinese cyber criminals in

20
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,940
many ways this represents sort of a

21
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:04,830
shake-up of a underground market that

22
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,950
was once predominantly geared towards

23
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:10,350
DDoS while using a lot of the same tools

24
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,890
and infrastructure that was used from

25
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:18,509
DDoS to start illicit mining operations

26
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:21,000
I want to issue a caveat up front that

27
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:23,549
when I say Chinese what I mean to say is

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,310
Chinese speaking since it can be

29
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:28,740
difficult to precisely ascertain where

30
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:31,259
the actor is originating from Viet

31
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:37,649
mainland China Taiwan Hong Kong the

32
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:39,750
diaspora etc so here's a brief outline

33
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,210
of what I'll be talking to you guys

34
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:45,329
about today I'm gonna start off with

35
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:47,820
just some basics about mining about

36
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:50,360
mining Manero my threat actors have

37
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:53,908
become interested in Manero recently

38
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:58,350
then we'll look at specifically the

39
00:01:53,909 --> 00:02:00,090
Chinese perspective why and how and when

40
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:03,919
Chinese actors start getting interested

41
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:06,810
in this then since a lot of my job

42
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,300
involves going through Chinese hacking

43
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,849
forums and social media and stuff like

44
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,400
that I'll provide some examples of

45
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:14,560
chatter

46
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,500
I've seen that have sort of demonstrated

47
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,750
this growing trend and monaro mining

48
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:22,420
campaigns we'll also look at some

49
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:25,920
attacks and progress as well as some

50
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:28,510
tools that you can buy on Chinese forums

51
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,518
after that sort of attacker perspective

52
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:32,500
will flip it and get a look at how these

53
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:34,920
attacks play out by looking at some

54
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,569
observations from our Tallis honey pots

55
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:41,159
then to illustrate the scale and the

56
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:44,230
profitability of some of these campaigns

57
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:45,909
we'll take a look at some big Manero

58
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:49,209
mining botnets that have been attributed

59
00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:52,750
to some Chinese speaking cyber criminals

60
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:56,170
and finally we'll end with mitigations

61
00:02:52,750 --> 00:03:02,590
what we do what you guys can do and some

62
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:05,768
major takeaways so high level what is

63
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:08,409
mining mining is basically using system

64
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:10,870
resources to solve complex mathematical

65
00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:13,000
equations the result in some amounts of

66
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:16,090
cryptocurrency being rewarded to the

67
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,060
solver as an example Bitcoin when the

68
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:20,620
most popular cryptocurrencies has been

69
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:24,940
mined since its inception

70
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:26,709
although mining Bitcoin now is well it's

71
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:29,159
difficult because it's so resource

72
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:31,690
intensive basically now it requires

73
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:34,269
application-specific integrated circuits

74
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:37,269
or Asics if you want to actually do any

75
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:39,129
mining on it but of course different

76
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:40,930
cryptocurrencies are partly

77
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:44,500
distinguished based on the algorithm

78
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:47,500
they use to reward or for how they can

79
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:49,569
be mined some of these algorithms are

80
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:52,510
designed in such a way to hinder the use

81
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:55,918
of Asics and to encourage mining on

82
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:59,879
standard systems such as CPU or GPU

83
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,879
currently one of the most profitable

84
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,769
cryptocurrencies that could be mined on

85
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:08,079
standard systems is Manero in addition

86
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:12,579
to this Manero is extremely privacy

87
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:14,739
focused so governments both in the US

88
00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:18,570
and internationally have become better

89
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:21,090
at tracking Bitcoin transactions and

90
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:23,880
because of that maneras

91
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:26,698
increased emphasis on privacy has made

92
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,320
it more attractive to threat actors we

93
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,540
can confirm that several big

94
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,820
russian-language

95
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:35,190
exploit forums and hacking forums have

96
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:37,229
switched from Bitcoin payment systems to

97
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:41,940
Manero payment systems for exactly this

98
00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:44,250
reason and there's a couple ways that

99
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:46,770
you can go about mining Manero should

100
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:48,389
you choose to do so the first one is

101
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:51,120
through the use of a standalone miner

102
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:54,840
you put some mining software on your

103
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,960
machine start it start mining Manero

104
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,729
great that's your standalone the other

105
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,609
way you could do is through pool based

106
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:04,530
mining and through pool based mining is

107
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,580
you'll put the software on a bunch of

108
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:07,530
different machines

109
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:10,500
they'll all be tied together through the

110
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:12,809
same worker ID or wallet so that all the

111
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:15,780
revenue generated goes to the same user

112
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:18,300
and through this way obviously you can

113
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:24,239
maximize the effectiveness of computing

114
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:25,830
resources and standard systems a lot of

115
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,539
these pool based miners work on the

116
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:30,060
command line they have two main

117
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:33,090
arguments the first is the mining pool

118
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:36,570
URL the mining pool is where you will go

119
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:38,280
to get the revenue then there's the

120
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:39,930
worker ID or the wallet

121
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,760
that's what as I said earlier ties

122
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:43,560
everything together so if you're on a

123
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,389
bunch of different machines it's all

124
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:48,240
tied to the same person that can go grab

125
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:52,260
it there's additional arguments you can

126
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:56,310
set you can specify the amount of cores

127
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:58,110
used you can specify sleep periods you

128
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:00,150
can specify the hashing rate and

129
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:02,099
basically what thread actors will do is

130
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:04,710
use these additional kind of arguments

131
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:06,539
to limit the resources used on the

132
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:10,530
system so that's less apparent to a

133
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:12,900
victim what's going on that Alice did

134
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:16,020
some calculations in May of this year

135
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:18,060
and figured that with a average hashing

136
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:20,820
rate that wouldn't catch anybody's

137
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:25,710
attention an actor can make about 25

138
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:28,169
cents a day great all right but you put

139
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:30,570
that on a big botnet and you leverage

140
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:33,060
pool based mining all tied together the

141
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:34,750
same worker ID or wallet and obviously

142
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:43,390
that 25 cents

143
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:45,940
forms into a tidy daily profit so before

144
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:50,050
I start talking about how Chinese actors

145
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:51,700
got interested in an Monaro I want to

146
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:54,250
talk about what the marketplace was like

147
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,880
beforehand as I mentioned in the intro

148
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:59,920
briefly

149
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:04,000
it was very DDoS focused so this is the

150
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:07,240
tanfa batch pressure testing tool this

151
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,640
is one of the most popular DDoS tools

152
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,860
that you could buy and run on your own

153
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:15,789
machine and this is really a Swiss Army

154
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:19,800
knife of DDoS capabilities not pictured

155
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:23,350
here is a scanning and exploit interface

156
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:26,919
which allows you basically scan find the

157
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:29,440
vulnerable machines drop the ten file

158
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:33,840
malware on it and then you can use this

159
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:36,910
interface where you can manage your bots

160
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:40,570
here you have information about your

161
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:42,880
bots basically their public IP operating

162
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:46,060
system what country they're coming from

163
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:49,360
etc down here you have your target

164
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:52,150
information including the target the

165
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:55,630
ports how much time you want to hit them

166
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:56,590
for etc and over here you can select the

167
00:07:55,630 --> 00:08:01,270
attack style

168
00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:03,549
it's a syn flood UDP flood CC you might

169
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:07,299
see this if you ever study China DDoS

170
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:13,890
type stuff CC means an l7 attack that's

171
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:16,900
just their word for it but regardless of

172
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:18,849
whether it was a DDoS tool that you

173
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,950
could run on your own machine like the

174
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:23,680
tanfa tool there were also other DDoS

175
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:25,840
services that you could buy you could

176
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:30,360
contract out a hit directly with the

177
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:33,098
DDoS group you could rent out a botnet

178
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:36,940
what became really popular starting in

179
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:39,339
2017 and continuing on was online

180
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:41,950
booters which have been popular in the

181
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:43,959
West and Europe for a long time made

182
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:45,190
their way to China beginning in late

183
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:47,130
2016

184
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:49,590
and really began to

185
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:53,580
explode in popularity but the point is

186
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:59,010
no matter what kind of tool you had it

187
00:08:53,580 --> 00:09:02,940
was predominantly DDoS focused now this

188
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:06,140
began to change beginning in late 2016

189
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:10,680
and especially in early 2017 and

190
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:12,720
continuing on through now why was this

191
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:16,349
well the first couple of reasons are not

192
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,960
specific to the Chinese but are more

193
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:20,640
responsible for a general overall trend

194
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:23,430
we've seen towards an increase in men

195
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,370
illicit Mineiro mining operations the

196
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:29,280
first one skyrocketing value of Manero

197
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:31,050
Manero is profitable to mine we're going

198
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:34,260
to see increased activity directed

199
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:36,599
towards mining Manero the second reason

200
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:39,120
is that from an adversary perspective

201
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:42,470
this is a largely hands-off infection to

202
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,580
manage let's compare it to ransomware

203
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:47,510
ransomware you've all sorts of issues

204
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:50,820
that could arise people might not pay

205
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:52,920
that's a big one another one is if you

206
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:55,680
hit a big enough important enough target

207
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,910
law enforcement might get involved you

208
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,130
might have to set up some sort of

209
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:01,079
customer support apparatus to help

210
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:04,680
people who have no idea how to get

211
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:06,390
cryptocurrency to pay you compare this

212
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:09,060
to a Manero miner where you literally

213
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:12,290
drop it on the machine and then you're

214
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:14,969
done it just starts generating revenue

215
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:17,579
so this was one of the big reasons Talos

216
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:20,150
saw a big shift and ransomware serving

217
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:24,240
infrastructure transitioning towards

218
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:26,430
dropping Manero mining malware when

219
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:30,330
China ransomware was never the biggest

220
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:33,750
issue the bigger issue was mostly DDoS

221
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:36,870
as I said earlier but here - and China

222
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:38,970
some problems were arising one thing is

223
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:41,940
DDoS protections were increasing greatly

224
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:46,050
domestically and through my own research

225
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:48,390
I studied China DDoS for a while a lot

226
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:50,459
of Chinese targets were in fact domestic

227
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:55,230
a lot of them were gray market services

228
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:57,710
such as online gambling porn or pirated

229
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:59,940
online game servers but even these guys

230
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:01,420
dramatically increased their protection

231
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:04,120
against DDoS attacks

232
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:08,050
in fact China Unicom when the major

233
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:09,730
China state-owned isp telecoms actually

234
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:13,540
partnered up with Genie networks a

235
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:16,240
Taiwanese company to increasingly focus

236
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,800
on DDoS protection that's becoming much

237
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,380
more of a focus for a lot of these

238
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:23,020
state-owned telecoms and I can confirm

239
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:25,600
through just my anecdotal observations a

240
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:27,579
lot of the DDoS actors I follow have

241
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,710
been describing that they've had more

242
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:31,300
trouble hitting their targets taking

243
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:36,040
down their targets than they have in the

244
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:39,310
past but at the same time you still have

245
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:41,650
a lot of infrastructure still up that

246
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:43,329
was used for DDoS purposes this includes

247
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:45,400
a lot of botnets that are still around

248
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:47,140
they may not be able to take down the

249
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,540
targets but you still got the botnets

250
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:53,580
there's still tons of scanning and

251
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:56,349
exploit tools to grow a botnet etc so

252
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:58,510
basically what some actors were doing is

253
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:00,970
taking this infrastructure that they had

254
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:02,740
been using for DDoS purposes we're still

255
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,780
getting a little bit unsuccessful with

256
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:07,930
it and transitioning so they could use

257
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:12,069
it more for Manero mining now a couple

258
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:14,949
big caveats here caveat number one DDoS

259
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:17,470
has not gone away DDoS is a major issue

260
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:19,150
in China and I do not mean to suggest in

261
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:21,280
any way through this presentation that

262
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:23,800
manera mining has somehow supplanted

263
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:25,900
DDoS that is not the case at all only

264
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:28,510
that this is a growing trend that

265
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:31,300
represents sort of a shifting or a

266
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:34,450
breakup of a marketplace a little bit

267
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:37,030
number two Chinese actors tend to take a

268
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:40,360
spray and pray approach as we'll see

269
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:43,209
when we get to the honeypot section they

270
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:50,980
will often drop a Manero mining malware

271
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:52,410
and DDoS malware in the same attack now

272
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:55,450
in a minute I'm going to give some

273
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:58,300
anecdotal observations from the trenches

274
00:12:55,450 --> 00:13:01,540
of Chinese social media and underground

275
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:03,490
hacking forums but before that I want to

276
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:06,010
give a little bit more of a concrete

277
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:08,860
illustration of this shift that's

278
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:11,280
underway so I looked at a popular

279
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:14,710
Chinese hacking forum it's called Duta

280
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:17,980
that Duta is one of the premier

281
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:21,160
he's hacking forums it has a very active

282
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:23,350
user base it's updated daily I would say

283
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:25,300
this is a place where if someone was

284
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:29,200
looking to buy some malware or a tool

285
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:31,780
here's where they would check first so

286
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:36,480
what I did is starting in 2016

287
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:40,240
I looked for any topics that mentioned

288
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:44,740
DDoS and compared it to topics that in

289
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:48,190
any way mentioned mining in 2016 we can

290
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:52,330
see a whopping 291 mentions of DDoS

291
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:56,740
related topics and 2017 that drops

292
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:59,920
precipitously to 125 and 2018 this was

293
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:03,430
only done through April 10th there were

294
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:08,140
34 so far compare that to the mining

295
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:11,979
story 2016 eve nada 2017

296
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:14,110
you've 18 and in 2018 even though it's

297
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:16,060
only through April 10th it's already

298
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:19,120
doubled what has been the year before

299
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:21,579
and in fact at this point in time is

300
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:25,330
already more than DDoS related offering

301
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:27,670
so far again I am in no way suggesting

302
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:30,580
that illicit Manero mining is taking the

303
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:32,949
place of DDoS I think in many ways the

304
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:35,500
drops that we see here in DDoS related

305
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:37,510
topics are probably related to the rise

306
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:40,450
in the popularity of online booters

307
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:43,030
which don't necessitate that you buy

308
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:45,820
tools or malware from a forum you just

309
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:49,390
go on to the booter login hit your

310
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:52,540
attack it's very easy but I think this

311
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:55,030
illustrates the growing trend in Manero

312
00:14:52,540 --> 00:15:00,219
mining illicit monaro mining offerings

313
00:14:55,030 --> 00:15:03,850
at least on underground marketplaces so

314
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:05,890
now I would like to show you some of

315
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:10,300
what I found in Chinese underground

316
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:13,330
forums that little penguin over there

317
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:16,000
that's a symbol for QQ I used QQ a lot

318
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:20,410
in my work QQ is a sort of social

319
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,420
networking Chinese app and up here

320
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:25,990
that's Duta that's the forum I was just

321
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:28,270
talking about these are some of the

322
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:30,880
terms that I searched on when I go

323
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:32,800
hunting for this type of stuff and I

324
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:36,160
think the slides will be made available

325
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:38,709
but if not I'm happy to provide this to

326
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,530
anybody who wants to hunt for themselves

327
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:46,840
a lot of these are self explanatory

328
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:49,060
self explanatory a few I will explain a

329
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:52,540
little bit because they're not the first

330
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:57,069
is Quan ma Huang ma literally means

331
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:59,819
mining horse or mining Trojan what this

332
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:03,670
means is basically a miner with the

333
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:05,980
adversaries wallet hard-coded in it and

334
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:09,610
implanted surreptitiously on a victim's

335
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:11,260
computer mining Trojans and mining

336
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:15,310
church and generators represent the

337
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:19,569
cornerstone of the of the illicit Manero

338
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:22,630
mining market another one that requires

339
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:25,240
a little bit explanation as chole

340
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:27,760
that's defi what they mean by that in

341
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:31,450
this case is either fees charged by

342
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:34,030
exchanges or a tool that's sold on like

343
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:36,670
a hacking forum that for some amount of

344
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:39,550
cryptocurrency that at mines it sends it

345
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:42,699
back to the tool developer and finally

346
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:44,530
to Eaton that means Bosch that means

347
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,660
something that manages a lot of

348
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:48,870
different bots at once so for instance

349
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:51,579
this is a batch tool because you can

350
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:55,390
manage a lot of different BOTS all at

351
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:59,740
the same time so now let's take a look

352
00:16:55,390 --> 00:17:03,970
at what some of these guys are saying so

353
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:06,459
this was in a DDoS forum that a DDoS

354
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:08,620
group chat that I frequented and this

355
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:10,900
guy is complaining that all his Linux

356
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:12,489
BOTS have now been infected by other

357
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:16,950
people's mining Trojans

358
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:16,950
it's complaining about that poor guy

359
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:23,140
earlier I talked to you about the tanfa

360
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:25,690
tool so I spent a lot of years

361
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:28,150
researching tanfa extremely extremely

362
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:33,310
popular and well used DDoS tool in China

363
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:37,420
well this here is their founder Mui here

364
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:40,020
he is noticing the good price of XMR

365
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:41,890
compared to the renminbi right now and

366
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:45,280
deciding that perhaps the

367
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:48,700
use some of his vast infrastructure that

368
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:54,610
he's acquired there is DDoS practices to

369
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:56,910
start doing some mining as well now one

370
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:59,530
thing you should know if you start to

371
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:01,510
play around in this space or if you want

372
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:04,090
to buy some hacking tools and Chinese

373
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:06,910
marketplaces everything and I do mean

374
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:08,980
everything is backdoored whether that's

375
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:10,990
the person who sells it to use

376
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:12,490
backdoored or the person who sold it to

377
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:14,920
them and they just couldn't get rid of

378
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:18,210
that backdoor either way it's all

379
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:21,220
backdoored to go back to ten Fah again

380
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:22,900
that guy Moy Yi and his group Chad one

381
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:26,020
time somebody complained and said hey

382
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:27,850
the free version of the tanfa tools back

383
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,840
the word what gives he said of course

384
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:30,280
it's backdoored

385
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:35,770
there's no such thing as a free lunch

386
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:37,899
but anyway when you're buying mining

387
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:39,730
Trojans or whatever a lot of people will

388
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,950
advertise that they've gotten rid of the

389
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:44,320
backdoors they have not as I will

390
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:45,670
demonstrate when I show you what

391
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:51,399
happened when I actually bought one of

392
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:54,790
these so I was a member of a lot of

393
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:56,500
these legitimate Manero mining forums

394
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:58,210
and these were guys who they didn't want

395
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,700
to do anything illegal they just want to

396
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:03,670
discuss which standalone system was best

397
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:06,190
for mining Manero and discussed the

398
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:09,430
fluctuations in the price of Manero etc

399
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:11,800
when all the Sun in mid 2017

400
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:13,720
all these DDoS actors started flooding

401
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:17,919
these forums talking about their

402
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:19,360
nefarious deeds so for instance here's

403
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,850
the guy talking about his nice

404
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,500
standalone miner when mr. Java pops in

405
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:25,750
and says hey doesn't matter how good

406
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:27,850
your standolyn is it'll never be as good

407
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:34,060
as using pool based mining with a bunch

408
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:35,439
of bots you own and just to hammer in

409
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:38,190
the point that a lot of these more

410
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:41,020
legitimate miners were unhappy and

411
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:43,540
somebody later responded that saying hey

412
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:48,430
using pots to mine is legal I don't

413
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:51,280
think they cared and of course if you're

414
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:53,110
going to use a bot to a botnets

415
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,330
to do your mining you got to know which

416
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,719
bots are gonna work best the eternal

417
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:58,269
question

418
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:03,429
window spots or Linux spots which is

419
00:19:58,269 --> 00:20:04,980
better for mining you also have to know

420
00:20:03,429 --> 00:20:07,870
how much money you're gonna make

421
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:09,490
so here's the guy suggesting that with a

422
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:13,000
high enough hash rate you can make about

423
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:15,429
a dollar per day and that's probably a

424
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:20,649
little too high a hash rate for a victim

425
00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:24,519
not to notice maybe he doesn't care one

426
00:20:20,649 --> 00:20:27,219
thing I love about my job is that in

427
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:30,220
these forums Chinese speaking actors

428
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:33,429
love to show their work and that

429
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:36,909
includes just demonstrating attacks in

430
00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:38,889
progress taking screenshots of tools

431
00:20:36,909 --> 00:20:41,169
they're using with compromised machines

432
00:20:38,889 --> 00:20:43,269
and the badge aspect of them which is

433
00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:45,940
great because it leads to customer

434
00:20:43,269 --> 00:20:48,580
notifications I identify the compromised

435
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:51,100
machine I can talk to whoever owns it

436
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:53,230
earned a lot of goodwill it's excellent

437
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:55,539
but either way it's so fantastic that

438
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:58,029
they love to post screenshots and here's

439
00:20:55,539 --> 00:21:00,669
an example of a person doing just that

440
00:20:58,029 --> 00:21:01,269
showing how he's using an HTTP file

441
00:21:00,669 --> 00:21:05,080
server

442
00:21:01,269 --> 00:21:08,440
HFS to serve some XM rig miner

443
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:13,600
on to somebody it's got a lot of HFS

444
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:16,870
running HFS is extremely popular among

445
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,519
Chinese actors we've observed a lot of

446
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:20,500
Chinese wrap building kits that include

447
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:24,429
instructions on how to set up your own

448
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:28,419
HFS so very common to see HFS used in

449
00:21:24,429 --> 00:21:32,019
these types of attacks and here's some

450
00:21:28,419 --> 00:21:34,360
more HFS here's a guy serving XM rig

451
00:21:32,019 --> 00:21:36,970
miner and something else onto the victim

452
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,769
but complaining that Linux feeds are too

453
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:46,450
slow that downloaded onto the victim

454
00:21:38,769 --> 00:21:49,570
machine again poor guy now besides

455
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:52,659
getting tools and forums or group chats

456
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:54,908
you can also get them on hacking forums

457
00:21:52,659 --> 00:21:57,850
where you can purchase them I'd already

458
00:21:54,909 --> 00:22:02,110
told you about do too so here's a type

459
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:04,869
of tool that you can purchase on Duta so

460
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:06,908
this is an XM are mining batch remember

461
00:22:04,869 --> 00:22:08,530
batch manage a lot of different victims

462
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:10,600
all at once

463
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:13,420
no back doors addition Yeah right

464
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:15,429
there's definitely back doors he says

465
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:16,720
this is a hot seller I got hold of the

466
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:19,960
source code and got rid of the back

467
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:22,600
doors no he didn't the trojan uses ltk

468
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:27,540
too in fact what this is possibly a

469
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:30,760
reference to is a well-known Chinese

470
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:33,970
technique wherein you name your malware

471
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:35,620
lbk dll make it so it's spreadable

472
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:37,390
throughout any directory with an

473
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:40,810
application or compressed file

474
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:43,450
LPK dll is same name as the windows

475
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:45,639
language pack file which gets called by

476
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:46,800
applications if a user interface and

477
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,540
some that don't

478
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:51,460
it took advantage of Windows module

479
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:56,680
loading where and it would look for lbk

480
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:58,600
dll in the applications directory so

481
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:01,870
this was famously used by the night all

482
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:04,449
botnet that Windows took down and wrote

483
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:08,699
about in 2012 and actually has its own

484
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:12,700
page on Chinese Wikipedia Baidu Baike

485
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:15,850
he says it's undetectable by AV etc etc

486
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:18,220
and just I think it's interesting to

487
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:19,719
take a look at how some similar some of

488
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:24,010
these batch tools can be

489
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:25,930
here's your DDoS one here's your Manero

490
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:27,700
mining one where of course here you're

491
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:31,740
having targeting info and here you're

492
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,740
entering info about your mining pool

493
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:38,500
here's a another tool that uh for

494
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:43,209
another forum this is the hold on on

495
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:45,690
trend Wong or hl0 day again we see some

496
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:49,540
similar type of stuff and advertising

497
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:54,220
undetectable by AV no command line

498
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:57,280
needed persistence after restarting etc

499
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:59,110
but I just wanted to note here this kind

500
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:02,710
of interface because this type of

501
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:07,719
interface is extremely common for Manero

502
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:10,900
for mining trojan generators and in fact

503
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:14,200
a lot of these Manero mining trojan

504
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:16,750
generators are actually PE wrappers that

505
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:19,000
call XM rig with command-line arguments

506
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:22,150
supplied to the generator by the user

507
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:25,120
through a GUI such as this

508
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:27,130
and then here you can enter in what kind

509
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:30,159
of you know innocuous name you would

510
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:32,350
like to give the malware so it doesn't

511
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:35,950
say you know XMR minor it says whatever

512
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:38,740
and here you can enter in your mining

513
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:42,700
pool enter in your worker ID you can

514
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:44,950
also kill some malware if you want kill

515
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:47,710
other miners that are on the system and

516
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:49,060
just kill some legitimate functionality

517
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:52,720
that might alert the user to what's

518
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:54,550
going on and if you'll notice this actor

519
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,520
is using this in conjunction with an

520
00:24:54,550 --> 00:25:01,960
HTTP file server as well as a DDoS

521
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:04,660
botnet management tool now I bought this

522
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:07,330
tool and it was a huge hassle and the

523
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:10,660
reason why is they would not accept

524
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:13,510
monaro which was insane to me how are

525
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:15,160
you gonna sell me a Manero mining Trojan

526
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:18,760
generator and you're not going to accept

527
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:21,160
a Manero as a payment form and said he

528
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:23,920
wanted to use like legitimate Chinese

529
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:25,360
payment services like Ali pay or QQ

530
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:28,810
bucks or something like that which

531
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:30,399
obviously is not a great idea finally we

532
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:32,679
were able to work something out whereby

533
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,090
through the use of a middleman we were I

534
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:36,550
would gave him the Monaro

535
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:41,250
he gave him whatever and then I got the

536
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:44,350
tool fine it was a RAR file called XMR

537
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:48,160
mining trojan generator dot RAR i'm

538
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:52,139
translating it he opened it up you had

539
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:55,900
an interface just like this you could

540
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:58,570
enter in the tools enter in information

541
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:01,660
about the miners etc generate some

542
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:06,100
miners great right worked exactly as

543
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:09,610
advertised except i talked about

544
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:11,740
backdoors right so there's an additional

545
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:15,100
sample that isn't extracted and launched

546
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:19,690
with the filename 1 dot exe it checks

547
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:22,240
for the existence of net six dot dll and

548
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:26,950
if it doesn't find it it downloads it

549
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:29,020
from this Chinese IP that IP in fact

550
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:32,530
resolved to a domain called chinguga

551
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:35,920
club which was in fact registered to the

552
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:37,960
guy who sold me the tool truly know

553
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:44,110
among thieves and everything is

554
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:46,350
backdoored alright let's talk about the

555
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:46,350
honeypot

556
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:54,310
so the first honeypot we're going to

557
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:56,260
look at is struts two struts two we had

558
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:58,629
two vulnerabilities for this honeypot

559
00:26:56,260 --> 00:27:01,750
five six three eight which allows

560
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:06,130
arbitrary command execution via crafted

561
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:09,190
HTTP header and nine 805 which is an XML

562
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:12,070
D serialization vulnerability struts to

563
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:14,860
is an extremely popular target among

564
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:17,889
Chinese actors I can confirm that within

565
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:21,399
literally hours of five six three eight

566
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:23,980
being publicly disclosed group chats

567
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:26,530
that I was a member of started selling

568
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:29,620
or sometimes giving away exploit tools

569
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:32,500
to their members and basically saying

570
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:35,260
use these to go attack South Korea

571
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:38,950
because at the time South Korea had just

572
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:41,890
deployed a US missile defense system and

573
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:44,200
China was unhappy about it so became the

574
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:49,000
target of a lot of patriotic hacking

575
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:51,670
campaigns so let's look at some examples

576
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,560
from the struts to honeypot the first

577
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:55,660
thing we see here is the same

578
00:27:53,560 --> 00:28:00,370
infrastructure being used to deliver

579
00:27:55,660 --> 00:28:04,720
both a minor and DDoS malware here is an

580
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:06,550
extremely common Chinese attack pattern

581
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:10,510
wherein you try to shut down the

582
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:14,550
firewalls issue W get requests for your

583
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:16,900
payload and here we see the same ip

584
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:23,680
getting W get requests for two different

585
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:28,810
payloads XM Raz and Linux a Z W so XM r

586
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:30,690
AZ was detected by around 30 or so AV

587
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:33,610
engines on virustotal

588
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:36,700
it makes most detecting it as a coin

589
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:39,550
miner it makes a DNS request for get by

590
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:43,270
- ty comm which is a Chinese mining site

591
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:45,310
that's closely related to according to

592
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:48,040
Cisco umbrella closely related to a

593
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:49,010
bunch of other different XM are mining

594
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,409
sites

595
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:54,170
for those not familiar with that term in

596
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:55,790
the umbrella context that means

597
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:58,700
basically a domain that was requested

598
00:28:55,790 --> 00:29:00,980
either a minute before or after a given

599
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:04,910
domain and not frequently associated

600
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:07,550
with any other domains Linux azw was

601
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:10,250
detected by around 40 or so AV engines

602
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:13,220
on virustotal most describing it as a

603
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:16,340
linux DDoS backdoor and this in fact

604
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:19,490
made DNS requests to this Chinese

605
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:21,409
website which in turn upon later

606
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:25,790
research turned out to be registered to

607
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:28,070
a Chinese speaking DDoS actor here's

608
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:29,870
just an example of how common that sort

609
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:31,850
of attack pattern is this is a guy

610
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:36,260
basically saying what do i do on an own

611
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:38,659
struts to server and here he is and Lib

612
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:41,629
this says Moo mah teacher basically

613
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:45,980
Trojan location so just enter in your

614
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:49,250
Trojan location plug and play notice s2

615
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:51,830
very common Chinese shorthand for struts

616
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:59,360
to which we'll see in this next example

617
00:29:51,830 --> 00:30:03,649
boom boom s2 again so we saw a request

618
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:08,389
to download this s2 dot txt from this

619
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:10,730
Hong Kong IP and s2 dot txt turns out to

620
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:12,290
be a malicious bash file that basically

621
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:16,850
determines the architecture of your

622
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:19,250
system if it's 32 bit versus 64 bit

623
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:23,510
either get boom boom or boom boom to the

624
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:26,570
both corn miners and both make DNS

625
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:28,760
requests for pool mine XMR comm if

626
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:30,950
you're familiar with the Mario Brothers

627
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:34,220
franchise you might recognize this

628
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:37,040
little fella as boom boom I took him and

629
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:39,830
I implanted the Monaro symbol on his

630
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:41,330
face which is the only design element

631
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:44,120
that I can take credit for in this

632
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:48,280
presentation so shout out to Telus

633
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:48,280
design for doing a lot better than this

634
00:30:48,820 --> 00:31:00,100
so we also have a web honeypot that sees

635
00:30:53,210 --> 00:31:02,300
WebLogic attacks against CVE 2017 102 71

636
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:04,730
which is another XML

637
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:07,220
serialisation vulnerability this again

638
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:11,150
is oracle weblogic again is an extremely

639
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:16,430
popular target among Chinese actors as

640
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:19,880
well so here too in these honey pots we

641
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:23,720
can see the same infrastructure being

642
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:27,400
used to deliver both minor and DDoS we

643
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:30,530
observed about three IPs trying to

644
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:34,310
download a malicious bash script from

645
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:37,899
this domain right here ipfs fu TK dotnet

646
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:41,030
and I was called transfer dot Sh and

647
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:43,160
what transferred sh did basically was

648
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:46,250
try to install some standard libraries

649
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:49,730
an issue W get requests that same domain

650
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:52,160
for two different payloads one was minor

651
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:55,070
D which is a coin minor which mines

652
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:58,160
Manero among other things and other was

653
00:31:55,070 --> 00:32:00,919
Linux in Linux in turned out to be a

654
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:04,850
bill gates DDoS variants if you follow

655
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:07,400
China DDoS attacks at all you'll know

656
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:14,870
that bill gates variants are extremely

657
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:16,970
common payload among DDoS actors so

658
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:18,379
here's some other examples of what we've

659
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:21,650
seen you may have heard of the Jenkins

660
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:25,100
minor the Jenkins minor was a campaign

661
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:27,290
that basically targeted vulnerable

662
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:32,540
Jenkins servers dropped him a narrow

663
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:34,580
minor on them I think checkpoint wrote

664
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:38,389
about them possibly in a February of

665
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:40,550
2018 and they attributed them to Chinese

666
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:42,350
speaking actors and also said that these

667
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:45,110
guys had made millions off of this

668
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:46,699
campaign and we'll talk more about the

669
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:50,000
scale and profitability of some of these

670
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:52,430
big botnets later but we can confirm

671
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,770
through our web logic honeypot that

672
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:57,910
these guys were also hitting WebLogic on

673
00:32:54,770 --> 00:33:00,560
that vulnerability discussed earlier and

674
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:02,480
basically post exploit they'd start a

675
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:04,490
PowerShell they'd keep window style

676
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,540
hidden so the user wouldn't be able to

677
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:08,750
see what's going on

678
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:10,850
it creates a web client object and use

679
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:14,900
it to download a miner from another IP

680
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:15,110
and then start it up so basically so we

681
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,360
can

682
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:20,240
also confirmed that the Jenkins miner

683
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:22,399
guys besides hitting WebLogic through

684
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,110
Cisco telemetry they were actually

685
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,940
hitting our customers on a bunch of

686
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:33,860
different other Chinese favorites

687
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:36,920
including JBoss PHP myadmin etc so

688
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:38,689
that's not the only widespread campaign

689
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:49,540
we observed that was leveraging

690
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:53,330
PowerShell here's another one it was

691
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:55,610
widely geographically distributed this

692
00:33:53,330 --> 00:34:00,918
is a sort of heat map of the source IPS

693
00:33:55,610 --> 00:34:04,820
of the exploits as of March 29th 2018

694
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:07,130
and these are continuing on throughout

695
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:11,090
today as we monitor our honeypot so this

696
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:12,619
is a still ongoing campaign as you could

697
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:14,840
see there from all throughout the world

698
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:19,730
but largely concentrated in mainland

699
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:22,429
China and post exploit these guys were

700
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:25,490
sort of all doing the same thing they'd

701
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:28,609
start up PowerShell they turn on and

702
00:34:25,489 --> 00:34:30,830
turn off no profile so tell the console

703
00:34:28,609 --> 00:34:34,219
not to load current users profile

704
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:37,340
scripts they turn off nan I to prevent

705
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:40,489
the creation of interactive prompts they

706
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:42,889
would bypass power shells default script

707
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:44,479
execution policy to again prevent them

708
00:34:42,889 --> 00:34:47,690
from doing anything they wanted to do

709
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,730
turn on window style hidden again so it

710
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:53,629
runs in the background and then they

711
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:57,430
would decode this base64 base64 blob

712
00:34:53,629 --> 00:35:00,560
which would decode do some more

713
00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:03,618
PowerShell instructions they create a

714
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:06,290
variable OS to get some information

715
00:35:03,619 --> 00:35:08,840
about the victim operating system create

716
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:11,090
a web client object then they've set up

717
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:13,100
their HTTP headers setting the user

718
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:15,020
agent to PowerShell along with

719
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:17,960
information gathered from the OS

720
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:20,119
variable and basically if you didn't

721
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:22,460
have your HTTP headers set up exactly

722
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:26,720
like this you wouldn't be able to

723
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:28,820
download the payload which was called DL

724
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:35,959
dot PHP

725
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:38,740
from this c2 right here steel PHP for

726
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:41,450
anyone who is perhaps unfamiliar with

727
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:42,729
American culture this man right here is

728
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:45,649
named DL Hughley

729
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:48,080
that's why his picture is up there DL DL

730
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:51,230
now we at TELUS don't like to do

731
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:56,450
attribution but I'm 99% certain that

732
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:59,170
he's behind this campaign so DL dot php'

733
00:35:56,450 --> 00:36:01,520
executes an embedded PowerShell script

734
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:04,520
which basically downloads a bunch more

735
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:10,190
files from that same c2 this includes

736
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:14,090
run exe exe and x86 rc4 run exe exe

737
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:17,990
opens and reads x86 that rc4 it calls

738
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:22,250
Cal lock twice because x86 rc4 is going

739
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:24,529
to be divided the first 256 bytes appear

740
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:26,870
to be an array that rc4 uses to decrypt

741
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:29,060
the remainder of the file the Mandurah

742
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:32,569
the file is you guess that the

743
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:35,120
executable for XM rig we can also

744
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:37,130
confirm that through cisco telemetry

745
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:39,170
that these guys were downloading these

746
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:45,590
files on a bunch of our customers is

747
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:49,280
pretty widespread so you may have heard

748
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:54,800
about the campaign wanna mine wanna mine

749
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:56,930
basically was a I was targeting Windows

750
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:00,020
systems that would try to use me me cats

751
00:36:56,930 --> 00:37:01,250
to nab credentials to break in if it

752
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:05,410
couldn't do that I would try using

753
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:08,360
eternal blue hence the name lot of mine

754
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:11,720
but according to Chinese cybersecurity

755
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:16,160
firm firm 360 there was a one of mine

756
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:19,160
situ located at that same IP as rc2

757
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:21,980
which could suggest that the actors

758
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:24,740
could be related and by the way we found

759
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:27,440
three other c2s related to this campaign

760
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:30,950
and if anybody is interested I'll have

761
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:32,780
my email Twitter etc at the end of this

762
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:36,490
so hit me up or just come find me in

763
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:36,490
person and we'll talk

764
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:42,750
so now I just want to quickly

765
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:44,760
illustrates how much money these guys

766
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:46,020
can make because it's rather impressive

767
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,300
because sometimes during these

768
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:49,650
presentation I get us so what well the

769
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:53,270
so what is that some of these major

770
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:53,270
botnets are making millions of dollars

771
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:59,460
so for instance there was a bond net

772
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,530
bond nets

773
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:06,150
I think garda core wrote about them in

774
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:07,980
2018 there were scanning servers in Hong

775
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:10,619
Kong they're using the Chinese scanning

776
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:12,780
tool win egg drop TCP scanner if you

777
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:14,579
ever follow any sort of Chinese hacking

778
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:16,770
operations you've probably heard the

779
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:20,819
name wind egg drop very popular tool

780
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:23,220
among cyber criminals and apts as well

781
00:38:20,819 --> 00:38:24,329
that's used throughout so they would

782
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,919
scan for a bunch of different

783
00:38:24,329 --> 00:38:30,480
vulnerabilities all the Chinese

784
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:34,910
favorites PHP myadmin JBoss tomcat my

785
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:37,470
sequel etc and then they break in

786
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:42,180
install some VBS scripts which would

787
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:43,859
download some miners but the important

788
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:47,069
thing is is that these guys were

789
00:38:43,859 --> 00:38:51,990
everywhere throughout the world Fortune

790
00:38:47,069 --> 00:38:54,690
500's governments even like city

791
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:56,339
governments just all throughout large

792
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:59,540
scale and they're pulling in around

793
00:38:56,339 --> 00:39:02,250
twenty five thousand dollars a week

794
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:03,779
another very popular Manero mining

795
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:06,030
botnet you've probably heard of is known

796
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:09,290
by a lot of names I prefer my kings

797
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:14,849
because it's the easiest to pronounce

798
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:19,740
but these guys they also targeted

799
00:39:14,849 --> 00:39:21,569
Windows servers with a MS 1701 oh and

800
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:23,430
they also used windows management

801
00:39:21,569 --> 00:39:26,220
instrumentation as a file list

802
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:29,328
persistence mechanism I would drop and

803
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:31,740
run a backdoor install some WMI scripts

804
00:39:29,329 --> 00:39:34,410
which would connect to a situ and then

805
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:37,500
download some miners now according to

806
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:39,480
bleeping computer who interviewed some

807
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,760
an expert from net one who said this

808
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:45,960
campaign may have comprised over 1

809
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:49,380
million hosts and by february of 2018

810
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:52,130
these guys had pulled in 2.3 million

811
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:52,130
dollars

812
00:39:53,750 --> 00:40:00,090
so what does towelettes do about it well

813
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:02,490
as you can see we've set up a lot of

814
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:05,570
honey pots to monitor this situation and

815
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:09,000
through the honey pots we are able to

816
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:11,160
analyze for instance new trends such as

817
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,140
showing that Jenkins Minor isn't just

818
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:16,170
hitting Jenkins servers but it's hitting

819
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:17,520
WebLogic then pivoting to our telemetry

820
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:20,190
to show that's hitting a lot of other

821
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:23,400
stuff as well but beyond that the

822
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:25,470
attacks the malware dropped information

823
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,840
we attend obtained through humans and

824
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:30,450
open source allow us to write snort and

825
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:34,560
clam AV coverage and also to blacklist

826
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:39,720
things such as source IPS of exploits c2

827
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:41,990
and the malware that's dropped itself we

828
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:45,660
have a lot of partnerships with

829
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:48,810
intelligence organizations especially

830
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:52,230
throughout East Asia as Asia is our

831
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:56,130
focus and this includes government cyber

832
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:57,780
organizations as well as certs so we can

833
00:40:56,130 --> 00:41:01,530
coordinate them when we're seeing

834
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:03,540
something bad and you know they can go

835
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:07,290
on their side and help take down some of

836
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:11,310
the infrastructure etc so you know let's

837
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:13,830
say per se I'm seeing some HK some

838
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:17,670
infrastructure in Hong Kong that's you

839
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:19,470
know delivering a lot of these that's

840
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:21,690
participating when these PowerShell

841
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:23,700
manera mining campaigns I can talk to HK

842
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:27,420
cert we can work together to address the

843
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:30,839
problem in addition I told you how much

844
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:33,840
I love screenshots because you know they

845
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:36,840
post basically compromised machines so

846
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:39,300
that allows me to go ahead and inform

847
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:40,860
our customers if the any of them are

848
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:42,660
owned with Cisco customers I can go

849
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:44,460
directly through our sales contact and

850
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:46,440
be like hey you've got an own machine

851
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:48,540
here's a screenshot as proof you may

852
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:51,180
want to go take care of this but we

853
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:53,730
don't just do customers either basically

854
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:57,240
any kind of compromised machine we find

855
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:59,970
we try to go out and inform the person

856
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:01,410
who owns it it's just easier with

857
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:04,430
customers because we have a direct

858
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:06,080
contact setup already and when you're

859
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:07,700
cold calling someone to say they have a

860
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:11,110
compromised machine that doesn't always

861
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:11,109
work as plans

862
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:16,549
finally language capable analysts as

863
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:20,000
myself because I always like to do a

864
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:22,070
plug for myself too we can help with

865
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,800
these types of investigations especially

866
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:27,020
if they're capable in ascent because

867
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:29,150
they can go ahead and use various

868
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:31,610
tactics to get their hands on tools and

869
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:34,670
malware which we can then analyze and

870
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:36,890
use that to get a hand at new trends and

871
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:42,620
write new coverage and all sorts of good

872
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:43,129
stuff like that now what can you do

873
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:45,620
about it

874
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:50,000
well the most important thing you can do

875
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:52,670
is patch so once again to bring up that

876
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:56,440
anecdote when that struts to five six

877
00:42:52,670 --> 00:43:01,310
three eight vulnerability was disclosed

878
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:02,600
they within hours of that public

879
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:04,970
disclosure they started releasing

880
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:07,310
exploit tools and having you know very

881
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:09,770
organized targeted campaigns taking

882
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:12,170
advantage of those exploit tools so it's

883
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:13,520
very important to patch especially if

884
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:18,580
you're running anything that's a Chinese

885
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:22,930
favorite JBoss struts to oracle weblogic

886
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:25,509
tomcat my sequel etc patch patch patch

887
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:29,390
the second thing you can do is shut down

888
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:34,280
unnecessary services so my colleague

889
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:37,009
Rick he basically found hundreds of

890
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:39,560
thousands of anonymous FTP servers that

891
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:40,670
were linked to consumer-grade a lot of

892
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:42,920
them were linked to consumer grade

893
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:45,620
digital devices like external hard

894
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:48,320
drives that FTP enabled by default these

895
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:51,859
things were hosting millions of Manero

896
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:55,520
miners a lot of them related to a Manero

897
00:43:51,860 --> 00:44:00,110
miner worm called photo miner so keep be

898
00:43:55,520 --> 00:44:03,490
aware of that remember - I just like to

899
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:06,410
remind people not all miners are malware

900
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:08,149
mining has legitimate use cases pool

901
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:11,000
based mining has legitimate use cases

902
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:13,730
the second it becomes now where is when

903
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,560
it's is the question of consent is

904
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:16,510
installed on a victim machine without

905
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:18,210
their knowledge

906
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:21,960
if not

907
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:24,900
then that's an hour so in conclusion

908
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:28,080
there's a general global trend towards

909
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:29,760
Manero mining operations we've seen this

910
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:31,470
in a lot of global ransomware

911
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,080
infrastructure that has now been

912
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:35,939
transitioned to use either for dual use

913
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:38,400
or to also include Manero mining

914
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:40,109
operations as well this is true for

915
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,790
Chinese speaking threat actors although

916
00:44:40,109 --> 00:44:43,950
we're seeing more of DDoS tools and

917
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:46,230
infrastructure being transitioned to use

918
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:48,480
for mineiro mining there's lots of

919
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:50,820
evidence of this new trend both what I'm

920
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:54,450
picking up anecdotally and social media

921
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:57,930
chatter and also what we're seeing in

922
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:59,790
our Telus honey pots and these things

923
00:44:57,930 --> 00:45:01,700
can make Bank as I hope I've

924
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:03,960
demonstrated some of these bigger

925
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:06,839
botnets can pull in millions of dollars

926
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:08,640
and reach wide scale and finally

927
00:45:06,839 --> 00:45:10,830
language capable analysts can always

928
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:15,210
help in identifying tools tracking

929
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:18,779
actors etc and with that I will take QA

930
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:20,280
that's my email that's my Twitter if you

931
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:22,440
don't feel like asking a question or

932
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:25,220
you're shy hit me up on that or find me

933
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:25,220
after thank you

934
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:31,450
awesome thank you very much Dave yeah

935
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:33,300
that was an amazing talk very

936
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:35,740
interesting as I'm sure you all had

937
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:38,619
anyone have any questions like to open

938
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:41,069
the floor great we have a bit of time

939
00:45:38,619 --> 00:45:44,109
still before lunch so should be good

940
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:45,970
when I conduct research the gfv at

941
00:45:44,109 --> 00:45:48,400
grateful well the Great Firewall of

942
00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:52,029
China and the specific ease of the

943
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:53,470
Chinese Internet are posed or other post

944
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:55,720
restrictions to my research the

945
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:57,368
connectivity is very bad so from where

946
00:45:55,720 --> 00:46:03,310
do you actually do you research

947
00:45:57,369 --> 00:46:06,400
physically here or inside China well I

948
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:08,619
mean basically I'll usually when I'm

949
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:15,160
visiting any kind of Chinese site I'll

950
00:46:08,619 --> 00:46:17,890
do it from Hong Kong but you can run the

951
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:20,379
social media you know like a QQ app you

952
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:24,040
can just spin up a VM and run that from

953
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:26,619
wherever so that's not necessarily an

954
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:28,660
issue one question I do get a lot though

955
00:46:26,619 --> 00:46:31,450
is with all the censorship that goes on

956
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:34,089
how is this stuff allowed to continue

957
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:37,060
basically and to that I don't have a

958
00:46:34,089 --> 00:46:41,490
great answer other than that either they

959
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:44,970
don't care or it's somewhat allowed cool

960
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:44,970
any more questions

961
00:46:51,450 --> 00:47:00,069
sorry who's looking you said you're

962
00:46:57,790 --> 00:47:02,950
informing your clients after you find

963
00:47:00,069 --> 00:47:05,140
some successful attacks how do you hide

964
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:11,379
yourself in these forums that you are

965
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:13,210
not kind of lagged well I mean in any

966
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:15,760
one of these group forums there could be

967
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:18,760
thousands of members and usually I'm not

968
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:21,130
posting myself unless you know I'm

969
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:24,250
trying to do some social engineering get

970
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:26,200
something for myself so they post a

971
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:30,400
screenshot you know it's out there it's

972
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:33,368
open for anyone to see it's a I don't

973
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:36,310
know if why they do that because it's

974
00:47:33,369 --> 00:47:38,230
such poor operational security but from

975
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:40,810
my standpoint it would be difficult to

976
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:41,290
detect me just taking a screenshot of

977
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:43,420
something

978
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:46,509
an app and sending it to the customer

979
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:48,220
they have thousands of members so they

980
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:50,110
could suspect anyone them took it down

981
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:52,149
and some people have started to get

982
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:55,120
smarter I'd say and are starting to blur

983
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:57,930
out the victims there's still a lot of

984
00:47:55,120 --> 00:48:07,930
people who just don't care

985
00:47:57,930 --> 00:48:10,509
great any more questions yes if you look

986
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:12,520
at the price of Manero it went up but

987
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:14,860
now it went a little bit down already

988
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:18,070
so what is your outlook how good the

989
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:21,850
price of monitor influence the trend of

990
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:24,760
these Chinese taking groups in my

991
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:29,770
opinion the trend is going to follow the

992
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:32,170
price of an arrow but even if it goes

993
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:34,420
down let's say you make 10 cents a day

994
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:36,370
instead of 25 cents a day it's still an

995
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:39,400
easy profit so it's not going to go away

996
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:41,830
but when Manero skyrockets that's when

997
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:48,630
you're gonna see a bigger increase of

998
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:52,509
these type of attacks any more questions

999
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:53,680
no everyone hungry for lunch it yeah yes

1000
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:55,420

1001
