1
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:09,059
thanks everyone for still being around I

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:11,460
know it's been two days and a long night

3
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:13,079
for a few and for those who try to go

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,880
back to winter tour probably an even

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,000
longer night as there were some train

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,369
issues sorry according to us we don't

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,560
know if anyone had to train but if it

8
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:26,009
wasn't us but thanks for being at the

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:29,279
closing ceremony we definitely want to

10
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:32,189
thank you for coming here and of course

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,079
we were sold out which was awesome so

12
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,239
there was really high demand we had lots

13
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,329
of requests from people trying to come

14
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:43,169
in for the last two weeks so thanks for

15
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:45,989
the big interest the talks will be

16
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:48,899
uploaded to the YouTube channel of Def

17
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:51,809
Con Switzerland this Sunday at least

18
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,800
most of them two of them they still want

19
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:55,379
to delay it a little bit because

20
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,750
presented at our conferences after hours

21
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:59,160
as well so there might be a delay but

22
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,489
most of them should be uploaded to

23
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:05,369
Sunday thanks also for sticking around

24
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:07,830
for the BBQ yesterday we managed to get

25
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:12,450
about four on five yeah five hundred

26
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:15,210
bottles of beer so appreciated that we

27
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:17,250
expect it's even worse but of course

28
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:20,339
there's a few bonds of wines as well so

29
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,439
yeah I know you guys have fun and of

30
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,650
course we hope that you had fun with the

31
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:28,619
talks with the workshops with all the

32
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:31,259
engagements that we had with the batch

33
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:34,710
and so on should you want to get some

34
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:36,360
more fun and Harry 41 usually is every

35
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,770
two years so that might take a while to

36
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,600
the next one

37
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:42,149
watch out for Twitter notices on that

38
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,820
one but there's two other conferences

39
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:47,009
besides Erick and black Alps both in

40
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:50,490
Switzerland they both have to call for

41
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:52,259
papers open till June 30th so definitely

42
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,539
give them a go and check them out as

43
00:01:52,259 --> 00:02:03,390
well and with that let's hand over to

44
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:06,689
the batch if it work not really ok so

45
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:09,660
not the batch now let's do two tracking

46
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:12,859
cuz of course well batch it is about

47
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:15,260
tracking right is it oh I know

48
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:17,900
so we didn't put any tracking device in

49
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:20,090
the batch itself but we all know it's

50
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:22,540
Wi-Fi right so as with every other

51
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:26,150
smartphone it's actually trackable and

52
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:29,359
the sponsor 40 net put up a few passive

53
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:31,850
Wi-Fi scanners as in tracking every MAC

54
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,850
address and triangulating with different

55
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:37,010
hotspot or access points to see who

56
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:38,780
moved where and you can actually see

57
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:41,299
here some of the parents of people

58
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:43,700
moving around so every half an hour they

59
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,140
pinpointed the locations of course we

60
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,989
don't know who it is

61
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:50,899
just tracking a device copy a smartphone

62
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:52,220
who's still on there's about two

63
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,930
thousand three hundred and eighty seven

64
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:56,660
devices being tracked over the two days

65
00:02:53,930 --> 00:03:01,430
a few of those probably people passing

66
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:03,920
back and forth outside of the venue but

67
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:06,980
as you can see here someone probably

68
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,480
went to the hotel but the funny one is

69
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:11,179
all to your right

70
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,799
hello kind of walking up and down so

71
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:15,730
probably on the phone having a long

72
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,110
discussion outside or someone who's

73
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:20,060
really dying for a smoke and every half

74
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:24,440
an hour actually went out for smoking or

75
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:27,200
a little freaky thing well yes luckily

76
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:30,079
it's just tracking and not snapshotting

77
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:33,619
any videos or pictures as well but the

78
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:36,070
most frequented time frame was yesterday

79
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:39,440
during lunch where we tracked about 511

80
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:40,970
people walking around so definitely

81
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:45,070
interesting but let's go back to the

82
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:47,660
batch now back to tracking you mean yeah

83
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:50,180
as an introduction let me explain a

84
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:53,329
little bit about the the patch what it

85
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:57,080
did and and a little bit of architecture

86
00:03:53,330 --> 00:04:00,530
there's for max of flash memory in the

87
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:05,209
batch the one on the right the last one

88
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:07,489
Mac is spiffs spiffs is a special file

89
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:10,519
system and we put everything in there

90
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:14,180
the files your web server if little web

91
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:18,680
server and on the batch delivered the

92
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:21,739
the time table stuff yeah and some audio

93
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:24,590
stuff I will come back to later and the

94
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:25,429
first part of the of the flash is filled

95
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:29,900
with the firmware

96
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:32,419
and our original idea was to have a tiny

97
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:35,388
tiny little piece of firmware on the

98
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:38,840
batch and then do the flashing

99
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:43,729
over-the-air right here on the last or

100
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:45,919
that day yes just in time and test it

101
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:49,550
and it's somewhat functioned or worked

102
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:52,430
the firmware was installed and the

103
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:56,870
spiffs wasn't installed so at the end we

104
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:58,820
flashed everything by hand yeah in all

105
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:00,830
fairness it worked doing the testing

106
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:02,479
because we had just a small file of

107
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:04,729
spiff and at the time it worked

108
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:07,219
seamlessly and without any issues but

109
00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:10,430
yes we learned out later with a larger

110
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:12,380
file there's some issues so yes do the

111
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:14,419
proper testing first definitely would

112
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:17,300
help yeah yeah the problem was time

113
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:23,599
lacking so if you end the development on

114
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:26,900
Wednesday and on Thursday anyway there's

115
00:05:23,599 --> 00:05:29,060
also a flash over-the-air mode on the

116
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:33,609
firmware you have now on your batch and

117
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:37,910
you probably first clicked on cancel

118
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:41,300
well chicken chicken yes if you clicked

119
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:46,010
ok there were quite a few who tried that

120
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:48,169
write their own access points tried to

121
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:51,500
get some connection something well

122
00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:55,310
there's a bug in the firmware it's good

123
00:05:51,500 --> 00:06:00,260
we didn't want it anyway but there was

124
00:05:55,310 --> 00:06:02,930
quite a creative way to since the ok

125
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:07,490
button doesn't work probably I could

126
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:15,139
hack the farmer why a dhcp or something

127
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:21,560
and this brings me to that trying to add

128
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:24,560
some shellshock code to DHCP server good

129
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,750
idea having the root to execute it

130
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:34,490
itself

131
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:37,800
okay thanks Floyd to eat 2 Easter eggs

132
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:40,050
there were two with audio and you

133
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:43,290
probably saw that something with audio

134
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:46,320
somebody played the file which was on

135
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:48,480
the batch to me I'm not sure if they

136
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:53,190
extracted it and then play it or just

137
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:56,400
google it or whatever yeah that by the

138
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:57,930
way a mod file mod if you ever used an

139
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,659
Amiga if you were old enough to ever

140
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:04,080
used an Amiga it's a common format from

141
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:08,490
there the cool thing is it plays on on

142
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:10,560
that on that firmware on that chip but

143
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:14,310
they had to double the speed because it

144
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:18,240
needs quite to access the flash and it

145
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:20,190
needs 160 megawatts instead of 80 and we

146
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,230
knew that this could be difficult

147
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:24,420
because it uses double power

148
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:28,620
so batteries are going down faster

149
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:32,220
obviously because there is no real what

150
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:36,240
your thingy on the hardware it

151
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:40,620
we found a I square s based Delta Sigma

152
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:43,080
software based software based tach if

153
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:46,410
you connect that one we will see it

154
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:51,150
probably in the in the next slide if you

155
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:54,420
connect a headset to our X and ground

156
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:57,510
you can hear something this one tiny

157
00:07:54,420 --> 00:08:00,990
little problem I found out after three

158
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:05,909
nights of debugging you can't flash

159
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:10,950
anymore because Eric's anyway there's

160
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:13,250
even a better mode you have some holes

161
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:16,050
which aren't set or which aren't

162
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:17,730
what's the used in solders yes not just

163
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:21,090
because I forgot it in the morning it's

164
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:23,640
actually is there so laughs now that if

165
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:25,650
you had the transistor there the the the

166
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:28,590
to model is is in there it should work

167
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:33,279
better because the power on these pins

168
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:36,309
on the ESP aren't supposed to power a

169
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:41,169
a headset or a loudspeaker yeah it's

170
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:44,228
probably safer to go that way and yeah

171
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:48,189

264
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:54,680
is we've had this in the past we didn't

265
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:56,960
have it for a while and we're really

266
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,910
happy to have the workshops back and I

267
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:02,240

268
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:04,219

275
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:30,079
something more right

276
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:30,949
there's the raffle but well I think we

277
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:34,040
forgot something

278
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:36,590
so if you three guys Adrian this Eric

279
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:41,599
and it could take center stage for a

280
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:47,120
second maybe only because of the camera

281
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:49,340
slowly it will be fine um so we as

282
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,010
Stephan Switzerland we've been running

283
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:54,470
this conference for a while and I think

284
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:56,390
you all know how much work how many

285
00:14:54,470 --> 00:15:00,020
hours how much sweat and tears

286
00:14:56,390 --> 00:15:02,120
especially tears actually go into

287
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:05,120
running this conference I think we can

288
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:09,050
all agree that this year's edition was

289
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:11,240
one if not the best so far and the

290
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:14,300

354
00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:18,080
sounds like a man-in-the-middle attack

355
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:20,360
there all right so next one is a book in

356
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:33,049
O'Reilly book for defensive Security

357
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:44,240
handbook with a signature of Amanda and

358
00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:48,470
there will be one Ramos and there's

359
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:51,879
another book about the same so she

360
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:51,879
signed actually more than one thank you

361
00:19:52,149 --> 00:20:06,580
well that's gonna be difficult

362
00:19:55,009 --> 00:20:06,580
it says Stefan no last name any takers

363
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:22,879
what would have been your chance I would

364
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:26,509
have asked it pH or F so that's B R so

365
00:20:22,879 --> 00:20:28,969
just initials really do like nicknames

366
00:20:26,509 --> 00:20:31,190
but it helps to be fill in your full

367
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:32,960
name here absolute initial match so it

368
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:36,620
could definitely be you and it was only

369
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,000
one person filming up in front or he's

370
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:47,000
actually really good in the social

371
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:49,340
engineering part and the last one is a

372
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,470
Bosch bunny with an introduction manual

373
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:53,779
if you need it sponsored by entity

374
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:56,929
security so for those who want to play

375
00:20:53,779 --> 00:21:04,129

376
00:20:56,929 --> 00:21:11,440

378
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:18,470
