1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:12,090
so good morning everyone so we are going

2
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:17,430
to talk about secure messengers this

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:21,948
morning and I will be used as we cool

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:25,890
spearfishing lecture so I'm really glad

5
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:28,980
that we can have loan in your ears this

6
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:31,050
morning we are both from french-speaking

7
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,770
Sudan and yeah how did you present

8
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,870
yourself so I am lolene and I'm a

9
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:40,350
freelance consultant which means I'm

10
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:44,849
open to job offers and I recently

11
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:46,940
graduated HIV D well security and that's

12
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:50,219
pretty much it

13
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:53,149
okay so about myself used to be a

14
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:57,289
developer cover of security solutions

15
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:59,600
now coach chapter leader of OS Geneva

16
00:00:57,289 --> 00:01:03,570
really likes wet moly

17
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:06,330
not everybody is perfect I work from a

18
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,820
young company which means well I can say

19
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:11,780
what I want so that's cool and you can

20
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,779
follow me on Twitter

21
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:20,009
ok so well you know

22
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:23,520
although secure messengers like 2 years

23
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:25,890
ago especially we sing all the old

24
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,039
switch to end to an encryption there was

25
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,930
really really great first around that

26
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,060
which is really good because it means

27
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:36,810
that five privacy has become a

28
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:39,320
requirement so it's really for the end

29
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:43,409
users that's really really nice progress

30
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,820
and yeah except for governments because

31
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:46,950
they started to say well that's really

32
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:50,369
bad because you know terrorist we don't

33
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:54,979
see the message blah blah blah but what

34
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:58,439
it means for that's a general population

35
00:01:54,979 --> 00:02:01,500
you can feel that well even if

36
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:03,148
governments say that they need backdoors

37
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,460
because otherwise they can't read those

38
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:08,580
message and all that it should be really

39
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,919
really super secure and if you have a

40
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,970
look at the crypto it really looks super

41
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:17,480
secure some diagram here of

42
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:19,760
we won't go in detail and we won't try

43
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:25,250
to attack that I'm not crazy

44
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:28,220
so yeah the crypto is really good but

45
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,910
maybe when you use a telegram signal

46
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:32,000
what's up

47
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:33,950
you could have you ask yourself but you

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,530
know you don't create any login and

49
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:40,880
password or whatever so I will do this

50
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:43,670
up authenticate myself well somehow you

51
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,950
just have a provisioning done by SMS you

52
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:48,980
type like four digit or six digit code

53
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:51,350
and then that's it and then it's somehow

54
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:54,619
linked to your device or phone number

55
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:57,890
you don't know well but the other

56
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:59,930
important point is how does it was some

57
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:02,000
ticket the people you are talking to

58
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,920
well somehow it gets the contact

59
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,010
automatically from the address book and

60
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,780
then that's it you don't have to manage

61
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:11,359
explicitly your contacts except for some

62
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:13,730
apps but the most common one yes just

63
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:17,450
inside the app enter an SMS code and

64
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:20,600
that's it which seems a bit light when

65
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:23,570
you see all this crypto but at the same

66
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:25,519
time yeah everything is transparent to

67
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:28,940
the end user so maybe there's something

68
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:33,380
missing I told you I like sweat modeling

69
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:35,150
so try to do simple diagram there so

70
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,920
when we are talking about sexual

71
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:41,570
messengers what you have in practice

72
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:43,578
this is really oversimplified but this

73
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:45,650
is this should be enough to understand

74
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:48,010
what's happening so here you have the

75
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:51,980
messaging back-end almost in the cloud

76
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:55,578
you exchanged messages with the app all

77
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:57,768
that is super secured with end-to-end

78
00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:59,390
encryption yes sometimes you have

79
00:03:57,769 --> 00:04:02,360
backups there are questions around

80
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:05,119
backups which we won't discuss today and

81
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:10,700
the first time you have this SMS any

82
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:13,790
code that sent and basically is just two

83
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:16,010
more spam protection to be sure that

84
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:17,988
people are not creating too many fake

85
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:24,770
accounts or whatever there are being

86
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:27,409
foreign attacks via SMS provisioning ss7

87
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:30,169
things like that so we are really SMS is

88
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:34,690
and especially for or for that case then

89
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:38,420
if we have deeper dive on the mobile OS

90
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:40,219
what you are one whether if it's iOS or

91
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:43,280
Android you have really good sandbox in

92
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:45,470
so clearly on mobile OS you have a

93
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,630
better security than on a standard OS

94
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:50,360
because every application with these

95
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:53,630
unlocks running with restricted

96
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:57,140
permission and all that so what I try to

97
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:59,240
show here that you have your messaging

98
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:01,070
app and it's leaving it in its sandbox

99
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,990
and then that's it and it cannot

100
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:05,690
normally disperse with other

101
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:08,180
applications what's shared is somehow a

102
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:12,490
view of the network and the storage but

103
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:15,950
what you see here those two apps well

104
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:20,470
contacts either shirt storage space for

105
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:23,990
them so both of them can read and write

106
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:26,470
and it's super easy for that there's an

107
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:29,600
API because you know some apps need to

108
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:33,250
like manage contacts and do stuff and

109
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,460
calendar reminders and all that so 400

110
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,010
super-easy

111
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:39,620
well darling we maybe will tell you tell

112
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:42,349
ya if you find a correct documentation

113
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:44,420
and if the documentation is up to that

114
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:46,610
it's super easy so few lines of Java

115
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:48,910
code for Android and then you just need

116
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:53,150
to ask for the weed and all right

117
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:56,870
contacts and then that's it and so

118
00:05:53,150 --> 00:06:00,200
exceedingly for me as I look at it I say

119
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:03,110
hmm there may be some room for a side

120
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,969
channel attack and what's really

121
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:07,730
important for what we are going to

122
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:09,890
discuss we don't need a rooted device

123
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:12,110
for that so we are not talking about

124
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:15,469
malware we won't be talking about

125
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:19,490
malware we won't be talking about an app

126
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:24,560
running with full privileges just any

127
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:30,140
app as long as it uses API can read and

128
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:32,660
write so those contacts info so what I

129
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:38,860
did well first I did some basic tests

130
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:38,860
myself and I say oh okay suppose

131
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:44,659
of someone called Bob

132
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:47,450
there is someone in his address book

133
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:50,480
that's called Elise and this is a real

134
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:53,030
Alice and what happens if I create

135
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:56,420
another contact with another phone

136
00:06:53,030 --> 00:07:00,530
number but I call I name it white space

137
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:03,620
Alice what happens well just from the

138
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:06,049
notification start to find your

139
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:08,210
difference so this is what's up and why

140
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:10,190
what will happen you will see two

141
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:15,650
different conversation but both of them

142
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:17,510
seems to come from Alice and if you just

143
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:19,880
follow this poem okay this can be

144
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:25,250
misleading yeah

145
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:27,890
telegram some stuff of course signal

146
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:30,400
some stuff well I can do in screenshot

147
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:32,840
because you can do screenshot on the

148
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:42,679
Android version yeah why not

149
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:45,349
okay this is bad because you know front

150
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:48,460
end users making a difference between

151
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:51,320
that and that if you are not purchase

152
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:53,000
and if you click on the conversation

153
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,880
yeah well you just get the message so

154
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,460
this one is approved by default this one

155
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:00,620
seems real and you don't get any warning

156
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:05,479
so any pop-up that say maybe there has

157
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:09,260
been a crypto change or whatever so why

158
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:12,310
does this stupid treat works well for me

159
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:15,440
yeah wow there's a poor design solution

160
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:17,300
you shouldn't trust by default those

161
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:22,400
phone numbers but they need to do that

162
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:24,710
for usability okay for me what really a

163
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:28,460
bad choice is yeah they are using tofu

164
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:31,130
yeah you know it's Easter tofu all that

165
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:33,860
yahwah in fact is here it means trust

166
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:35,270
and fell on first use so they didn't do

167
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,789
like one you know when you connect the

168
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:39,770
ssh you get those from that the head

169
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:43,339
this is the first time do you trust this

170
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:46,160
key or whatever the same you know we are

171
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:48,140
competing with apps from facebook or

172
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,500
whatever we don't want to know the end

173
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:54,530
user so first time we don't

174
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:58,100
anything and then we keep the key and if

175
00:08:54,530 --> 00:09:00,050
the key changes later on we will show

176
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:04,010
pop-ups and warning sign and whatever

177
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:06,349
but the first time a contact is sending

178
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:11,330
a message yeah don't bother the end user

179
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:13,580
with that which is really bad choice and

180
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:16,160
then what you what we do well we just

181
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:18,650
then we use a same trick that you know

182
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:22,490
spans Unicode characters in URL and all

183
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:24,740
that so just take the hacks from the web

184
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:28,130
ten years ago and then play with that

185
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:30,290
and do it in the mobile era and then you

186
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:35,240
get something working and we D for me

187
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:37,880
what's missing here you see the answers

188
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,950
of the vendors afterward we they don't

189
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,230
put the end user and the mobile app in

190
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:44,540
the threatened L what they care they

191
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:45,790
want to protect the back end they want

192
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:48,920
to protect the network protection

193
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:51,680
because they want to protect from NSA so

194
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:54,709
somehow they say yeah it well I I want a

195
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,959
if NSA spying and NSA spying all the

196
00:09:54,710 --> 00:10:00,710
fibers connection and all that so they

197
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:02,750
don't want NSA from those fiber atoms to

198
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:05,990
be able to see those messages and they

199
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:09,140
also don't want if I come back here they

200
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:11,180
also don't want NSA to go and take the

201
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:13,910
servers and find interesting stuff in

202
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:16,160
them so here they say well we don't have

203
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:17,870
any keys we can do anything messages for

204
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,350
encrypted end-to-end we can do it

205
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:28,850
anything with that so somehow they just

206
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:32,300
care about this part but gee the end

207
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:35,450
user the mobile is totally forgotten is

208
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:38,300
totally out of of the threat model so

209
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:40,550
which means that well first they

210
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:44,109
expressed for for a side channel attack

211
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:47,750
and this is something that's interesting

212
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:51,440
you have a paper published by academia

213
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:56,050
that shows well

214
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:58,250
why single protocol is a secure is

215
00:10:56,050 --> 00:11:01,819
formally secure from a mathematical

216
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:04,170
point of view so guys from academia did

217
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:07,330
stuff like that

218
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:09,339
like 20 pages with math all around and

219
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:12,570
all that the conclusion is that yeah the

220
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:16,900
protocol is super secure and all that

221
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:19,420
but like after five pages you can read

222
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:21,220
some assumptions and what it says when

223
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:23,800
you sweeten signal it's not signal the

224
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:26,670
application its signal the protocol and

225
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:31,300
this is ambiguous and you will see that

226
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:33,219
yeah we're bad thing is so when he says

227
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:35,500
signal specify you run a mandatory

228
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:38,560
method for participants to verify each

229
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:43,990
other identities through an out-of-band

230
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:45,930
channel maybe this is SMS but SMS is

231
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:48,220
just when you install it's not when you

232
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:52,180
describe for the first time with a new

233
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:54,790
contact but most implementations do not

234
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:57,930
require such verification before

235
00:11:54,790 --> 00:12:00,280
messaging can occur so really so for me

236
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:02,459
okay this paper is good

237
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:06,689
we know the mass and the crypto is good

238
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:10,930
but the implementation is bad because

239
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:12,550
they don't do that so basically they

240
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,829
have a sexual protocol but they know

241
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:17,109
that they built the application without

242
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:21,370
the assumptions to have this from all

243
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:24,190
security so there's room for

244
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:28,770
exploitation and it's something also

245
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:31,720
cool which we will see we will be using

246
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:33,490
those messengers they've decided I don't

247
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,130
know for whatever reason they also

248
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:39,640
destroy their own identity failures in

249
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:41,950
the contacts and you saw that those

250
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:44,980
contacts are shared by all applications

251
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:48,339
or somehow from whatever application you

252
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:50,350
can see if the user has whatsapp

253
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:53,320
telegram or signal installed something

254
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:55,600
which you shouldn't be able to because

255
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,890
your are Europeans and dogs and you

256
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:02,050
should not see what's happening around

257
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:06,460
so somehow it's already leaking data so

258
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:10,870
I won't go in detail in this scenario

259
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:13,150
but I was giving a talk some time ago at

260
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:15,580
that concept or village and I saw how it

261
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:17,590
will be using theory to set up

262
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:21,340
man-in-the-middle attacks

263
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:25,000
because of that we demonstrate you

264
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:27,520
another use case which is a easier to

265
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,790
follow and quicker but somehow it works

266
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:32,710
so yeah let's suppose and you will see

267
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:36,160
what loneliness done I create some

268
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:39,160
stupid social game the other test food

269
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:42,610
contacts and then I am able to convince

270
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:46,540
Alice and Bob to install this game this

271
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:48,130
game has some hidden features that send

272
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:50,529
all the contact data to a malicious

273
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:53,860
server and from this malicious server I

274
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:57,640
can crack fetch whitespace alleys and

275
00:13:53,860 --> 00:14:00,610
fake whitespace Bob contacts and then I

276
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:02,260
can go through my evil number for what

277
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:05,050
all the messages and I see everything

278
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:07,930
just Alice and Bob are talking to each

279
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:12,390
other but via a third party and they

280
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:14,949
don't see it which is really bad because

281
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:17,050
yeah well they are using Antwan

282
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:19,120
encryption but they are not talking to

283
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:22,780
the good person and they can't no see

284
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:26,950
notice it so for me is this this is

285
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:29,829
somehow worrying so I say ok I feel it

286
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:31,960
bad that let's try to put like some with

287
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:33,760
this simple methodology on it and say ok

288
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:36,820
I do really really like to add security

289
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:40,270
assessment where I say somehow from me

290
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:42,370
the risk is let's say how difficult is

291
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:45,370
the attacks to set up and watch the user

292
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:49,660
impact to set up such an attack and you

293
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:51,730
will see what lowliness done my

294
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:55,569
confusion was well from a technical

295
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:57,520
point of view it's easy well you have

296
00:14:55,570 --> 00:15:00,040
code you have a PS and you are supposed

297
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:03,490
to have documentation how to use those

298
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:04,360
API to have access to contacts and for

299
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:08,560
me it was ok

300
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:11,110
getting the social game approved on Play

301
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,689
Store should be easy because you are not

302
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:15,630
trying to hide my malware features or

303
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:18,970
whatever you are just a game that

304
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:21,640
contacts a web server via HTTPS just to

305
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:23,709
have some to sing some social data to be

306
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:26,470
able to play with it so shouldn't be an

307
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:29,410
issue from a logistic point of view I

308
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:31,000
say ok a bit more difficult to set up

309
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:33,280
well what's good is you

310
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,140
just need one phone number if you want

311
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,670
to attack thousands of users and all

312
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:40,150
conversations will go through one a

313
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:42,430
console this is chip that the only point

314
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:49,050
is yeah somehow you need to convince

315
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:49,050
users to install this stupid game sorry

316
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:56,200
but now let's say it was somehow funny

317
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:59,530
because when I saw that I'd Vegas I had

318
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:01,440
one guy from big Chinese manufacturer

319
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:05,939
you know one of the big Chinese

320
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:08,710
manufacturer or smartphones move somehow

321
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:11,230
you know the share data with Facebook

322
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:12,580
and all that and he had many many

323
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:15,250
questions after the talk

324
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:17,560
two hours of question and you say you

325
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:20,800
know we are working at this company he

326
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:22,869
gave me his card and we are trying to

327
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,270
add applications to give more value to

328
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:27,790
our phones well somehow he was just

329
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:31,240
trying to find some good excuse to steal

330
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:36,280
data and at one point his question was

331
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:38,740
that it walk with WeChat can we also spy

332
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:40,510
users on WeChat with it and then you of

333
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:44,080
course I stopped talking with him and

334
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:47,230
and that was it so for me I was somewhat

335
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:50,110
convinced that this can have a really

336
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:52,600
impact because yeah well you can spice

337
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:55,180
thousands of users with those three

338
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:58,540
popular messenger gaps and it could work

339
00:16:55,180 --> 00:17:03,719
so for me in the under whispers I so I

340
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:06,670
contacted the vendors telegram yeah well

341
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:09,010
they have some secret email address they

342
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:10,750
never answered even even if you tweet

343
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:14,050
you do whatever I just don't care

344
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:15,689
I wasn't surprised about telegram but

345
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:19,750
that's it

346
00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:21,339
okay so what's up being bought by

347
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:23,490
Facebook so somehow you use the

348
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:25,958
secretive process of Facebook which

349
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:28,690
somehow walks well you create a ticket

350
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:30,490
and you get some feedback but I was

351
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:32,620
disappointed by the feedback and the

352
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:34,270
feedback was basically yeah well you

353
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:37,600
know if you have malware it's game over

354
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:41,500
so we don't care and you know

355
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:43,820
well the whatsapp conversation worked

356
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:46,010
for probably born to the son number so

357
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:51,590
that's okay for us we don't care if

358
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:54,050
users get tricked we did our job from

359
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:56,480
number a was conversation a that's fine

360
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:59,629
I love it so we won't make any change

361
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,280
and please let me know if you feel we

362
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:04,760
think we've misunderstood something so I

363
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:08,600
try to explain them they did not answer

364
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:10,970
then send them the slides from left on

365
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,469
they didn't answer again so yeah I was

366
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:15,200
starting to get pissed off but he was

367
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:16,940
using first part then I wanted to have

368
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,860
feedback from signal because it's really

369
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:21,350
maybe the application while you say well

370
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:23,179
this one is really super secure on the

371
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:25,850
build up protocol and they should really

372
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:29,780
care about privacy because it's why it's

373
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:33,459
our DNA so they have some support forum

374
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:37,970
I couldn't have any answer so I started

375
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:40,910
tweeting got some answers first

376
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:44,000
and at some point moxie answer me so

377
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:46,850
obviously yes that's cool so yeah so

378
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,100
easy answer was yeah you know well II

379
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:50,870
didn't really in fact my description of

380
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:56,300
the issue assay yeah you have safety

381
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:59,060
numbers new safety numbers it's totally

382
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:01,129
different use case you are discussing

383
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:03,919
with the same contact but this contact

384
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:06,170
is changing is mobile is phone and

385
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:08,630
because it's changing his smartphone he

386
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:11,000
gets another key so the other user gets

387
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:12,860
a notification that say wow you know

388
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,170
something something strange happening

389
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:18,320
you should we do a pairing out whatever

390
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:20,510
but this is for some user different

391
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,200
smartphone here we are talking some

392
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:23,270
smartphone

393
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,240
different users but that looks to be the

394
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:29,030
same user so I try to explain again to

395
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,920
moxie and era was his answer

396
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:33,370
yeah well signal is not designed to

397
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:35,660
protect your device against malware

398
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:39,379
thanks for getting in touch good luck

399
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:44,120
with everything which means yeah for me

400
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:47,930
it was f something I was really really

401
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:50,629
pissed off and well luckily well you

402
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:53,810
know I need to do some consulting job

403
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:55,220
and icons man save all weeks walking a

404
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:56,370
new tune and all that because somehow I

405
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:58,770
need to pay

406
00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:03,090
but luckily I was giving security

407
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:04,860
courses engineer school in in

408
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:08,909
french-speaking Sweden where they have

409
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:11,189
really good security courses and so I

410
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:14,520
say ok maybe this could make a nice

411
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:19,830
internship topic and I was lucky because

412
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:21,750
loading accepted the challenge and she

413
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:23,909
did it and so the goal is to show you

414
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:25,440
that yeah what happens in real life and

415
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:30,810
maybe people change your mind

416
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:35,720
one two okay folks yes so grad students

417
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:35,720
are cheap and really efficient turns out

418
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:43,650
so I implemented a small like

419
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:45,540
rock-paper-scissors game it's available

420
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:50,580
available on the Play Store you can

421
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:53,460
download it do it please it's been there

422
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:56,449
since like July 2017 when I first did

423
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:58,890
the demo for like getting my grade and

424
00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:01,080
nothing happened it's still there

425
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:04,470
I kid I even pushed update like two days

426
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:05,730
ago and yeah the biggest challenge was

427
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:10,140
the contacts API because the

428
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:16,260
documentation is the TNC servers like

429
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:24,590
Django app like easy mode and oh let's

430
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:24,590
do a demo because yes thank you

431
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:33,480
Firefox so you can see it's our page

432
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:38,760
it's beautiful isn't it say I'm an

433
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:41,520
artist so we have two VMs one to like

434
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:46,200
yes which is which and we're gonna

435
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:54,960
install the app yep I can I can watch

436
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:57,060
this screen okay you can no I pick a

437
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:00,150
really meaningful company name because

438
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:04,710
it's easy to search for so it's totally

439
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:06,840
up on the on the gullible user and it's

440
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:09,440
faster it's verified by PI protect by

441
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:15,120
the way so it's totally safe don't worry

442
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:18,620
no problems so look at the contact book

443
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:23,629
we have night angel and mr. Donald Trump

444
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:27,840
and like he has only one phone number

445
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:31,410
for sure so we're gonna play a game of

446
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,060
rock-paper-scissors do you know well of

447
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:36,750
course I do I want to play with my

448
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:39,560
friends so if you want to try the game

449
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:42,420
do it on your own time because it's like

450
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:47,550
it's really easy there is even a in AI

451
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:49,440
like okay you install the app then I'm

452
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:56,040
gonna go on my awesome come to a panel

453
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:59,010
and boom he's there so you get

454
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:02,879
everything you know who's using the app

455
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:05,310
and everything like I basically married

456
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:09,660
the payload in the game because it was

457
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:14,040
easier i thing you need this button say

458
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:20,760
oh well duplicate Donald Trump and Link

459
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:28,020
it to evil do it wait a second then go

460
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:35,750
back and mystery we're gonna go oh hello

461
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:40,139
there send it now I said send it and oh

462
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:41,970
it's a message from Donald Trump it

463
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:47,250
doesn't say anything bad

464
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:53,480
oh it's encrypted good but wait it's not

465
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:56,280
the right one and so it does the thing

466
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:58,890
contacts are confused but when you have

467
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:02,310
like a huge address book it doesn't

468
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:07,830
matter because like I need to sort mine

469
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:13,310
there's like 200 entries and whatsapp

470
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:13,310
gets confused you can you can talk

471
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:21,590
it's okay and everything works fine but

472
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:24,730
you're not talking to the right person

473
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:24,730
[Music]

474
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:37,700
[Applause]

475
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:44,050
okay so now why you can imagine lots of

476
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:47,420
scenarios but that's something special

477
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:49,970
because I went to an encryption well

478
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:52,040
they can't see by definition they can't

479
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:56,810
see any of your message on the back end

480
00:24:52,040 --> 00:25:02,210
so now we sent nice messages here now

481
00:24:56,810 --> 00:25:05,750
let's suppose I'm sending malicious HTTP

482
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:08,050
link a signal what's up whatever they

483
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:10,370
can't do any like spam detection

484
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:12,230
filtering or whatever on the backend

485
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:13,310
because they don't have a clue what's

486
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:18,290
inside on message

487
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:20,870
so now let's suppose you've convinced a

488
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:23,210
CEO to install this program because he

489
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:25,909
has nothing to do during the day or

490
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:30,200
during meetings or whatever install this

491
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:33,650
su program and then yeah and you control

492
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:37,160
Johan Johan then is contacts your C&C

493
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:39,620
server you see all the users with a name

494
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:43,550
and one of them you figure out that it's

495
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:46,159
like the CFO you decide to clone it to

496
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:49,270
clone the CFO contact and then while you

497
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:53,050
go you can have the CEO receiving some

498
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:56,210
malicious link just coming from the CFO

499
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:58,430
yeah it's really really highly likely

500
00:25:56,210 --> 00:26:00,680
because you know it's coming from secure

501
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:02,360
messengers and all that that he will

502
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:04,550
click and you know that nowadays more

503
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:08,899
and more people are having those desktop

504
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:10,790
versions of mobile messenger so we are

505
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:14,420
really convinced that it's you have

506
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:16,220
really good success if you try to do

507
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:18,530
spearfishing with that because it really

508
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:21,230
seems to come from someone you know and

509
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:23,270
it comes out super sexual channel so

510
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:25,700
it's highly likely that people will

511
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:28,220
click on it and rather than you can do

512
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:33,480
fishing you can do

513
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:34,530
downloading malware I know that if there

514
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,960
are any volunteers

515
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:38,850
which I have been people crazy enough to

516
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,100
install this application we can discuss

517
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:43,590
afterward and you can see live that it's

518
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,520
working I wipe the database tonight

519
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:48,840
don't worry

520
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:51,000
yeah and well you know gdpr yeah it's

521
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:55,799
compliant don't worry yeah we'll wipe

522
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:58,140
off the data after the demo for sure so

523
00:26:55,799 --> 00:27:00,418
it's open source you can just go and

524
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:07,020
github it's there and I just need to

525
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:11,429
push like then last update yeah Anders

526
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:15,990
so now our answer is yeah well we can do

527
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:20,240
it you can do it to play with it share

528
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:22,950
it use it responsibly but please yeah

529
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:26,100
spread the word

530
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:29,669
of course yeah so nowadays yeah well

531
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:32,280
it's just a social game and now let's

532
00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:34,409
imagine yeah maybe yeah let's suppose

533
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:37,889
you're the NSA and you want to start

534
00:27:34,409 --> 00:27:40,140
massively spying on those users well you

535
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:44,460
just have to go and see the editors of

536
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:45,900
Pokemon of whatever glam they just add

537
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,590
these modules they don't have even to

538
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,860
cut anything

539
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:52,520
sungkyu lowliness they will save money

540
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:56,520
added as Pokemon to put that in the app

541
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:59,010
it will just be on abroad you see Google

542
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:00,658
says yeah you know we are scanning apps

543
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:02,309
for malware and whatever yeah for sure

544
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:04,559
they would never detect that because

545
00:28:02,309 --> 00:28:07,289
it's just standard behavior it was pure

546
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:09,360
Java is calling documented and public

547
00:28:07,289 --> 00:28:11,700
API so they cannot catch it

548
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:14,370
what's done with back-end well it's

549
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:16,049
legitimate because we didn't show you

550
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:18,360
that you can really play

551
00:28:16,049 --> 00:28:19,740
rock-paper-scissors with it but you can

552
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,570
have fun with that so it's normal that

553
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:25,460
we have a back-end server because we

554
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:30,000
need to sync data between endpoints so

555
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:33,090
could be really easy for massive spying

556
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,220
so I'm a bit concerned by that and we

557
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:39,330
was disappointed by the on sort of

558
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:41,510
vendor so yeah the actual like malicious

559
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:44,480
part of it is maybe 20 lines

560
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:47,750
code the rest is just required to make

561
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:50,540
the game work so it's like really small

562
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:59,150
to find and it looks like legitimate

563
00:28:50,540 --> 00:29:02,379
good so okay so but what can we do about

564
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:06,260
that you say what somehow side-channel

565
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:10,720
slash social engineering slash but with

566
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:13,129
two choices or whatever so for end users

567
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:17,330
well you know they say hey well you

568
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:19,850
shouldn't install crap of course but as

569
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:22,810
we just tell yeah maybe they would hide

570
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:26,570
this extra feature in a popular app for

571
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:28,129
espionage or whatever and say yeah well

572
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:30,050
you should not give access to your

573
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:32,420
contacts to any application but you know

574
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:35,270
it's a social game by definition you can

575
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:37,640
play with friends so you need to have

576
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:39,440
access to your contacts and people are

577
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:41,990
used to giving access to those contact

578
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,790
because well so sick your messenger asks

579
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:45,740
for that so now people are used to

580
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:48,680
accept Amy insuring access to contacts

581
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:52,520
so I don't think we can put the burden

582
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:55,420
on the end user then we can say yeah

583
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:57,680
maybe once I design those mobile

584
00:29:55,420 --> 00:30:01,160
operating systems I miss something so

585
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:04,820
they put really good Sun boxing you know

586
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:06,950
how to jailbreak a device iPhone it's

587
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:09,409
complex and we you need to find exploit

588
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:14,030
for that so somehow they did a good job

589
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:17,120
for application but some of the that

590
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:19,670
access to contacts totally open so you

591
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:22,760
could say okay maybe they could add

592
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:24,290
features to sandbox access to contacts

593
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:27,920
which we will for sure

594
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:29,810
break all current integration so maybe

595
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:31,820
helpful at some point is able to do it

596
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:35,360
and they will say well developers now

597
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:37,189
next next iOS version you don't have

598
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,629
this API and you need to do something

599
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:42,050
else and if you want to prove your

600
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:43,670
remove okay from Android for sure they

601
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:45,830
won't be able to fix it because I was

602
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:50,630
such a huge legacy

603
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:52,399
maybe what they could do they could be a

604
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:55,730
bit more strict when you are working

605
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:57,710
data in the address book so let's say

606
00:30:55,730 --> 00:31:00,530
what's lowliness shown when she

607
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:03,890
duplicated Donald Trump she somehow

608
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:06,830
created a contact on there what's up ie

609
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:10,610
but it's not owned by whatsapp it's

610
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:13,370
owned by this game so somehow maybe they

611
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:14,870
could say okay when you have maybe you

612
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:17,090
have read permission but when you have

613
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:19,399
write permission you have more control

614
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:22,370
on what can you write and under which

615
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:24,230
name under which control probably like

616
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:25,790
just showing the prompt like these

617
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:27,230
applications about to write in your

618
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:30,920
contacts because I do it in the

619
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:33,110
background so it's invisible to users if

620
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:35,780
there was like a huge text box saying

621
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:40,580
this is gonna write to contact probably

622
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:43,910
pricks flow of the app so it won't be

623
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:46,000
easy but yeah for sure mobile OS will

624
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:48,500
improve on that because yeah it's just

625
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,060
you you have this big hole in the middle

626
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:53,090
of something that's really well secured

627
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:54,830
so somehow it's a shame but for me it's

628
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:57,860
really a job that has to be addressed by

629
00:31:54,830 --> 00:32:00,050
sexual messengers because you know in

630
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:02,179
sexual messengers you have secured so at

631
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:04,490
some point means because they should

632
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:05,930
care about the security of an users and

633
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:08,600
you when I see the answers of those

634
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:11,150
Vandor it was hey I give my job you know

635
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:14,899
I implemented the specs fine with it and

636
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:16,910
then that's that's over I'm I did a

637
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:20,420
little more in signal because I was

638
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:24,050
really upset and what I saw is like wow

639
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:25,760
all this protocol implementation is

640
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:28,850
super clean or whatever but for the

641
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:33,410
mobile app you see that it's really not

642
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:36,230
the same let's see it politely to some

643
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:37,760
level of expertise for those developers

644
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:40,370
mobile apps you don't even have a

645
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:45,770
consistent experience between the iOS

646
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:50,570
signal up and it and with signal up one

647
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:53,389
shows you the the phone number each time

648
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:55,220
the other one doesn't with one you can

649
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:57,740
make screenshot with the other ones you

650
00:32:55,220 --> 00:33:00,710
can you see that it's it's bit a mess

651
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:03,530
and you can only see that they don't

652
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:05,540
really care much about the UI for them

653
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:07,730
it's not you know it's just UI so yeah

654
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:10,909
let us outsource it and it's yeah

655
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:12,500
don't touch with it it's it should be

656
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:14,990
easy simple

657
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:17,120
there's no crypto in it so yeah don't

658
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:19,100
lose any time playing with that which

659
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,919
means that all the user experience part

660
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:23,840
is out of the loop which is something

661
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,640
you absolutely need if you want to

662
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:28,270
design a sexual system for me it means

663
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:30,740
should be sexual for the end users and

664
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:32,690
when you talk about end-to-end while

665
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:35,690
just talking about from mobile to

666
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:38,330
back-end for me what what I expect for

667
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:42,380
something that engine is starting from

668
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:45,110
the human user so what they could do

669
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:47,510
well either the ouija all the way some

670
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:49,250
apps are doing so well but you have to

671
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:52,460
add your contacts manually and then with

672
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:54,770
that you can't get spoofed because you

673
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:56,720
are by yourself like you know all

674
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:58,760
scalped and all that you have to first

675
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,580
people one by one at them find them as a

676
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:04,280
login or whatever so this is not

677
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:08,210
convenient but in this case it's more

678
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:09,980
secure Oh something which I discuss with

679
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:12,830
the vendors which should take them like

680
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:14,960
maybe 15 minutes to implement okay

681
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:17,870
that's something we discussed about tofu

682
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,668
say okay this is what we first you first

683
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:23,418
time you start a conversation with a new

684
00:34:19,668 --> 00:34:26,600
phone number a key is action and the

685
00:34:23,418 --> 00:34:29,239
user is not aware of that so what I say

686
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:32,449
really from a user experience point of

687
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:34,520
view is okay you're starting a

688
00:34:32,449 --> 00:34:36,049
conversation with a brand new contact so

689
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,659
you're starting to talk with someone

690
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:42,140
you've never talked before this is

691
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:46,580
unusual this shouldn't happen often so

692
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:48,859
for that doesn't cost much yeah just put

693
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:53,870
like a danger sign or whatever in the UI

694
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:56,210
that say hey user be careful we are

695
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:58,640
forcing a trust boundary you are

696
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:59,300
receiving or talking to this guy for the

697
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,330
first time

698
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:05,270
please check be careful with it so there

699
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:08,480
are some editors that do some other like

700
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:10,580
I the only good feedback I had with

701
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:13,250
those vanload of sexual messengers were

702
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:14,930
either German or Swiss German I won't

703
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:17,240
give them they had really good security

704
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:19,279
support and say yeah for sure either

705
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:21,549
they somehow did that like if I say

706
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,740
about FEMA they already

707
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:25,300
like you know the contact is red orange

708
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:28,390
or green depending on the level of

709
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:29,980
stress which is nice and easy to for the

710
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:32,259
end-user to see what's happening I

711
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:34,210
discuss about wire and they say yeah

712
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:36,450
we'll change something and they include

713
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:39,700
also the UI to make it clear that

714
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:41,560
something unusual is happening so this

715
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:45,279
is the only fix I was expecting from

716
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:48,310
signal or what's up or whatever but no

717
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:54,430
don't care maybe if you spread the word

718
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:58,210
I will camera but it's video PG so we're

719
00:35:54,430 --> 00:36:00,339
over so well I think you are now

720
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:03,130
convinced that our internal corruption

721
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:04,990
is really cool for privacy but if you

722
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:08,620
are not talking to the good person yeah

723
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:13,299
is it really privacy anymore for me yeah

724
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:17,259
it's no and what I really dislike in

725
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:20,350
what's up maybe you didn't see it I know

726
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:23,110
you told it first time you have a new

727
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:25,390
conversation you have this yellow sign

728
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:27,520
but instead of saying a beautiful this

729
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:29,759
is a new conversation you should take

730
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:32,830
care of this if your connection your

731
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,930
conversation is now sexual and to and

732
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:40,210
basically is message this is super

733
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:41,589
sexual so you feel safe but you should

734
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:43,930
not because this is really risky

735
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:46,300
situation and they show you this message

736
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:51,549
si yeah now you should be safe so this

737
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:55,300
really yeah the secret team model around

738
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:58,180
contacts is really bad so if for

739
00:36:55,300 --> 00:37:00,610
whatever reasons you are working on

740
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:02,230
mobile solutions or you are auditing

741
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:06,430
mobile solution and they have access to

742
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:08,950
contacts yeah be careful just saying

743
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:13,870
something like that didn't test maybe it

744
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:16,149
would be the next round with the latest

745
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:18,759
version of iOS you can send money via

746
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:20,800
Pompeii with iMessage there's no reason

747
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:23,860
why it's not this attack is not working

748
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:27,340
for for iOS so now you can send money

749
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:28,570
just by sending a message so imagine

750
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:30,460
what you could do and they're also

751
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:33,430
banking apps where you know you can say

752
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:34,860
ok you are too restaurant you can your

753
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:36,450
friend pairs and you give

754
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:39,660
20 bucks just by your message so you

755
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:42,660
imagine the impact you can have so I

756
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:43,890
know everybody is like using contacts

757
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,720
because you know well what's happened

758
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:48,629
signal are using it and it's sexual so

759
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:51,060
yeah let's do like them which is really

760
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:54,980
dangerous and yeah Wow

761
00:37:51,060 --> 00:38:02,400
you have this tool that's open sourced

762
00:37:54,980 --> 00:38:04,770
and I'm really public that they would be

763
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:07,350
targeting attacks via those sexual

764
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:10,380
messengers because people really feel

765
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:12,480
safe with them and you know companies I

766
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:14,940
work for I see this changing the process

767
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:18,120
to exchange password or whatever they

768
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:20,190
say well don't send you an email with an

769
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:22,740
encrypted d file or whatever just share

770
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:24,750
it via whatsapp of your signal this is

771
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:28,979
far better than SMS this is far better

772
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:33,120
than internal chat or whatever which

773
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:36,030
mean that people are educated to trust

774
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:39,060
blindly so secure messengers and my

775
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:42,450
cannot and yeah and by design they

776
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:44,120
cannot filter anything so I will even be

777
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:48,330
surprised if at some point you have

778
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:51,870
really big attacks using this vector I

779
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:54,350
know yeah we have question time yeah

780
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:56,490
time for questions or time for demos if

781
00:38:54,350 --> 00:39:04,830
people want to test like what's

782
00:38:56,490 --> 00:39:07,109
happening awesome thank you very much

783
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:10,170
guys very again very informative and

784
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:11,700
interesting topic there for sure do we

785
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:13,910
have any questions we still have a bit

786
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:15,830
of time before lunch will kick off so

787
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:20,730
please don't be shy

788
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:22,850
anyone awesome who's gonna download the

789
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:22,850
app

790
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:32,140
we can see it I can actually understand

791
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:34,060
the answer from the messengers but I

792
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:36,390
don't think the problem here is the

793
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:38,710
messengers that you allow an application

794
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:39,970
read access to your context and it's

795
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,770
writing I think it should be the

796
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:43,990
operating system showing you and warning

797
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:46,330
that some third-party app has written to

798
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:48,759
your contacts even if you secure the and

799
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:52,240
secure messengers you can still write

800
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:53,950
SMS or I met such I think the main

801
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,479
problem is not the messengers here I

802
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:57,370
think the main problem is that a

803
00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:01,480
third-party application is writing to

804
00:39:57,370 --> 00:40:04,900
your colony we can argue with that where

805
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:07,630
maybe I disagree this formal security

806
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:10,270
evaluation and the assumptions of the

807
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:13,720
single protocol the crypto assumption is

808
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:16,480
that you have an out-of-band channel to

809
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:18,310
a change identity identity keys and they

810
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:21,520
don't implement that so somehow they are

811
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:23,170
lying to users or using an engine that

812
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:28,500
not supposed to work on others

813
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:31,540
assumptions that's my point but I agree

814
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:35,500
if mobile OS we do something with us it

815
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:36,970
will be great also a couple hands yeah

816
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:39,100
keep them up if you have a question for

817
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:42,520
me it's great thanks

818
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:46,690
but three more which implements such an

819
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:49,000
out-of-band verification if you you

820
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:51,640
doesn't force you to use it you can use

821
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,370
it with people you have in your contacts

822
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:56,529
you get the orange symbol and most of my

823
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:58,330
contacts are orange because they're

824
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:59,920
people who also happen to have three

825
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:02,470
members I haven't met them in a while

826
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:06,580
you could easily trick me with the same

827
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:09,189
effect so I don't think the fact that

828
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:11,440
you don't do a lot of band verification

829
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:13,480
makes it a problem of the messenger

830
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,520
application it's still a problem that

831
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:17,920
somebody has that you've granted

832
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:21,700
somebody right access to your contacts

833
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:24,700
and not of the messenger so I'm not sure

834
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:27,160
than it's a good bottle to the previous

835
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:29,290
question and comment yes so then my

836
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:31,210
point will be if you're building your

837
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:34,779
sexual messenger it is smart to use

838
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:36,730
contacts if you know that again we can

839
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:37,450
discuss like there are I think they

840
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:40,570
fixed it in

841
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:43,480
newer version with when you if you saw

842
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:45,579
the dialog when the app launched it says

843
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:46,180
this app would like access to your

844
00:41:45,579 --> 00:41:48,550
contacts

845
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:51,910
it doesn't say read all right access

846
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:54,040
just says access and that's maybe just

847
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:57,368
saying wants to read and write your

848
00:41:54,040 --> 00:42:02,500
contacts would probably raise some red

849
00:41:57,369 --> 00:42:07,000
flag no wrong button like that probably

850
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:09,510
raise red flags easier on more users and

851
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:13,660
that's also an easy fix

852
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:15,579
ok another question I spoke with my wife

853
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:18,910
this morning and I know she has a

854
00:42:15,579 --> 00:42:21,490
picture and another person with the same

855
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:24,339
name comes to me and starts speaking

856
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:31,419
with me but with a different picture or

857
00:42:24,339 --> 00:42:34,930
a default pictogram I pretty sure I can

858
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:38,890
get the avatar from whatsapp like the

859
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:43,240
picture show of it in mine make it like

860
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:45,129
this is my avatar now and it's like I

861
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:47,709
didn't do it because it was a pain in

862
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:49,720
the butt to do it but you can get the

863
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:51,849
avatar information from whatsapp yeah

864
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:57,569
it's freaking for your wife's pictures

865
00:42:51,849 --> 00:42:57,569
if we have our number it will show up

866
00:42:57,869 --> 00:43:03,880
any other questions

867
00:42:59,829 --> 00:43:05,290
scary yeah I like you're not making it

868
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,619
easy for these guys it's what we like

869
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:09,400
yeah

870
00:43:05,619 --> 00:43:11,410
come on but a challenge it's good not a

871
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:15,250
question but a really market first of

872
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:17,609
all a very great talk and as usual also

873
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:20,290
in the physical physical security area

874
00:43:17,609 --> 00:43:23,950
security is always a combination of

875
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:27,579
technology and behavior or organization

876
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:32,020
so you can't get around to teach the the

877
00:43:27,579 --> 00:43:36,910
user and it's not only on OS level it's

878
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:39,970
also on application level thank you yeah

879
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:41,500
users are the weak link and like no

880
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:43,209
matter how much you idiot-proof your

881
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:50,789
thing there's will always be a bigger

882
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:54,599
idiot so science you're attacking

883
00:43:50,789 --> 00:43:56,880
open-source messenger if you plan to

884
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:58,529
design a man-in-the-middle using that

885
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:02,160
technique because you could use two

886
00:43:58,529 --> 00:44:08,849
different telegram accounts and target

887
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:12,928
both victims with your yeah yeah we can

888
00:44:08,849 --> 00:44:15,599
set it up so and we when we showed you

889
00:44:12,929 --> 00:44:18,989
half the attack yeah that's basically it

890
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:21,499
but it could be with not a big effort

891
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:25,589
automatic to do full man-in-the-middle

892
00:44:21,499 --> 00:44:27,649
so you saw this evil smartphone you have

893
00:44:25,589 --> 00:44:29,609
something full that for web.whatsapp.com

894
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:32,189
which is somehow linked to the

895
00:44:29,609 --> 00:44:36,058
smartphone and this website it's easy to

896
00:44:32,189 --> 00:44:37,709
automate you know you could use from

897
00:44:36,059 --> 00:44:40,349
extensions now that you not use anymore

898
00:44:37,709 --> 00:44:43,169
but with the Firefox extension you could

899
00:44:40,349 --> 00:44:44,669
easily do evil in the middle that

900
00:44:43,169 --> 00:44:46,650
receive messages could be passed

901
00:44:44,669 --> 00:44:48,058
automatically to the good contact and

902
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:50,669
doing all this for running and all that

903
00:44:48,059 --> 00:44:52,140
and this big Chinese manufacturer was

904
00:44:50,669 --> 00:44:54,538
really interesting by this kind of

905
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:57,538
feature and maybe they already

906
00:44:54,539 --> 00:45:01,349
implemented it there's also I found a

907
00:44:57,539 --> 00:45:03,959
github repo with like an API that can

908
00:45:01,349 --> 00:45:05,880
handle whatsapp traffic entirely in

909
00:45:03,959 --> 00:45:07,799
background give it the QR code and it

910
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:12,779
does you can do it on the server no

911
00:45:07,799 --> 00:45:14,429
problem so yes you can automate it I

912
00:45:12,779 --> 00:45:22,069
didn't have time I was a graduate

913
00:45:14,429 --> 00:45:22,069
student cool any final questions for ya

914
00:45:22,099 --> 00:45:26,430
great okay thank you again guys once

915
00:45:24,809 --> 00:45:26,510
more please give it up for them
