1
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:07,410
so hello everybody last talk of the day

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:12,030
is everybody having a good time at area

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:13,530
41 yeah I'm super happy that they

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:20,160
invited me to come speak here's is my

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:23,279
first time in Europe it's been very very

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,939
fun and also I realize I need to learn a

7
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:30,090
lot more German but I'm glad most of you

8
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:33,300
speak English very well it's really

9
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:36,180
helped me out so far so well how many

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:39,269
times have any of you at any point in

11
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:41,519
time whether you're doing offensive

12
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,040
security or defensive or working in a

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,160
sock or doing whatever many times have

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:49,260
you walked into an environment and

15
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,959
everything's on fire you know they have

16
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,940
they have no patch management they have

17
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,030
never had a pen test they've no

18
00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:01,108
vulnerability management they have you

19
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:03,350
know 50 domain admins they have you know

20
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:07,560
no firewall rules everything like that

21
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:12,119
also a lot right the reason that this

22
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,470
talk is a thing is because it's been so

23
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:15,210
many times that I've walked into an

24
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,280
environment like that and I just got

25
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,919
really super frustrated with the fact

26
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,799
that they want a pen test even though

27
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,560
they don't even have the basics down so

28
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,000
with the fast pace of Technology growing

29
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,119
and growing and growing over the last

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:35,610
ten years all of the businesses have

31
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:37,650
been more worried about creating

32
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,210
whatever they're creating or providing

33
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,549
their services they've not really ever

34
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:43,380
focused on security up until more

35
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:47,130
recently and now we're trying to play

36
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:49,259
catch-up one of the the jobs that I get

37
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:51,119
a lot of experience in I would said men

38
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:54,270
that admin stuff for a hospital in

39
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,740
northern Ohio which none of you have

40
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,560
ever been never been to Ohio you're not

41
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,630
really missing anything it's very flat

42
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,380
if you've seen corn and cows that's

43
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:07,949
that's what's in Ohio but this this

44
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:09,840
hospital was just the biggest disaster

45
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:13,290
that you've ever seen as far as a

46
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,630
network goes and you know

47
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:20,200
through fixing all of the issues there I

48
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:22,990
was able to to learn a lot to become you

49
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,899
know going to defensive security where I

50
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:28,750
am now so while there's a lot of

51
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,730
different standards you can follow for

52
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:33,580
doing security program so you can follow

53
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:34,780
COBIT or there's miss standards there's

54
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:37,480
there's a lot of different stuff out

55
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:40,440
there that you can follow to create a

56
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:43,090
program from scratch that doesn't always

57
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,880
fit very well into a lot of

58
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:49,830
organizations and you either have to you

59
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:53,970
know modify it or the person that's

60
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:57,580
implementing that security program

61
00:02:53,970 --> 00:03:00,190
really may not even know where to even

62
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:02,440
start right it's this huge standard but

63
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:05,890
it doesn't tell you in what order to do

64
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:09,579
things and you know if you're running

65
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:11,500
around putting out fires because you're

66
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,000
hitting ransom right every day it's very

67
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,490
hard to know where to start with your

68
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,270
you know if you have any free time

69
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:21,190
during that period so in this

70
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:22,780
presentation I'll go over a high-level

71
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:25,840
of some of the principles that we try to

72
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:29,110
do in our book I wrote this book with

73
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,900
Lee brother Stan through O'Reilly and it

74
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:35,200
was for those people the people that

75
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:37,890
either are beginning insecurity you know

76
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,359
if it's if you're a student or are

77
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:43,570
transitioning to security from an IT

78
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:45,310
role and because of all of this booming

79
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:48,670
technology that we now have a lot that

80
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:52,000
we see our companies seeing breaches on

81
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:54,609
the heat on the news and they're like

82
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,250
okay mr. helpdesk guy you're great at

83
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,810
technology tada here's security you're

84
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,730
now the security director or now you

85
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,540
have to fix all of our security because

86
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:04,480
that's what we're supposed to be doing

87
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:06,400
right they have no idea where to start

88
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,709
you know they've been doing firewall

89
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,190
management and have no idea what's on

90
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:15,580
the network or they you know just got

91
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:17,798
hired because you know their security

92
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:19,239
dubs popping up everywhere and they walk

93
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:21,429
into that environment and they don't

94
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:24,419
really know where to start so this is

95
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:27,350
the book that I wish I would have had

96
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:29,880
10-15 years ago

97
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:32,460
because we were just kind of grasping at

98
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,050
straws and hoping things would stick and

99
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:37,169
then we had eventually had a really good

100
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:39,330
team to work through all of that so we

101
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:41,850
did everything and Lee was in the same

102
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:43,830
situation he had a very complimenting

103
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:45,840
set of skills I did a lot of windows

104
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:47,280
admin firewall admin backups that kind

105
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,060
of stuff while he did a lot of

106
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,349
development and firewall management and

107
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,420
Linux management that kind of stuff so

108
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,620
it really well together to kind of cover

109
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:58,080
a whole bunch of different verticals

110
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:05,480
that we see very insecure a lot of the

111
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:08,310
time so let's begin with the unknowns

112
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:12,870
the unknowns in any environment or going

113
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:16,440
to be very scary and how will you know

114
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:19,050
what level of success that you have you

115
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,730
know a year five years ten years down

116
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:24,090
the line if you really don't know where

117
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:27,090
you've started at the beginning of any

118
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:28,619
new security program or any deep dive

119
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:32,000
into like if you have an existing

120
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:35,040
security program that just sucks

121
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,400
discovery phase should be one of the key

122
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:40,950
points you do when you start so things

123
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:45,270
like current documentation if there is

124
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:47,300
any no matter if it's bad documentation

125
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:49,950
or if it's incorrect documentation

126
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:53,220
gathering all of that into one place you

127
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:55,500
know you even if like I said even if

128
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:59,520
it's incorrect knowing what you have

129
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:01,590
that other people have seen and knowing

130
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:05,070
you know what is out there if it is

131
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:06,960
correct so you kind of have a base

132
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:10,950
starting point things like policy and

133
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:13,020
some procedures no matter how simple

134
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:15,500
they are like password policy resets you

135
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:17,789
know that the whole organization has

136
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,200
you'll now know you know if you're if

137
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:21,720
you're coming in as an outsider you'll

138
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:25,469
now know what everybody else has been

139
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:29,190
taught thus thus forward to is end

140
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:32,940
points you want a list of desktops and

141
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:34,680
servers including things like when they

142
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:37,380
were implemented what software is on

143
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,139
them the software and harmer versions

144
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:41,860
the licensing

145
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:47,930
that software there's nothing worse than

146
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:51,860
you know someone leaving or just

147
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:53,779
forgetting about software licenses green

148
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:56,659
holes that are coming up and you finding

149
00:06:53,779 --> 00:07:00,110
out that you've now been running a

150
00:06:56,659 --> 00:07:01,969
software package that has been out of

151
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:03,259
warranty or out of support for years

152
00:07:01,969 --> 00:07:06,349
because you haven't gotten in the

153
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:11,090
licensing licensing emails

154
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:15,259
what's your internet footprint so what

155
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:17,000
is what is shodhan see right I mean I'll

156
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:19,310
go into a little bit later but you

157
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,680
should not really have much on jodan

158
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:24,020
I've had so many customers where I've

159
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:28,990
gone and tried to help them realize that

160
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:33,020
their 3/18 shouldn't all be showing up

161
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:34,759
or they've you know publicly addressed

162
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:37,789
all of their desktops on the insider

163
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:39,680
network and all of those show up so

164
00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:44,389
knowing what the rest of the world can

165
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:46,550
see on your ingress and egress points is

166
00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:48,860
very helpful you'll know you know where

167
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:52,310
your threats are coming from what

168
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:56,509
perimeters you have to secure networking

169
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:58,580
devices so routers switches AP's ids/ips

170
00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:02,270
if there is one a lot of people don't

171
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:05,628
have that and and what's happening over

172
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:07,008
the network there's a great free program

173
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:09,529
I've used a couple times before called

174
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:12,319
NAT disco that I've implemented several

175
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:14,629
times now and it is free and open source

176
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,969
and all it does is pull all of your

177
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:20,479
over SNMP and it brings it in this great

178
00:08:16,969 --> 00:08:23,210
nice graph and will tell you what device

179
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:27,139
is on what port on what switch and what

180
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:30,318
software and firmware devices that

181
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:31,520
everything is in the network ingress

182
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,599
egress points already kind of talked

183
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:38,860
about and and the contacts for those

184
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:42,440
points so if you have a cable provider

185
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:44,839
you know knowing who to contact if

186
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,870
something happens to that that cable

187
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:49,399
line or if you know if you have to

188
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:51,230
contact them for any other reason having

189
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:52,370
that in your documentation is also a

190
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:55,190
good idea

191
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:58,279
and then external vendors especially

192
00:08:55,190 --> 00:09:01,400
favored note access a lot of people

193
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:03,080
cannot tell you who has access to what

194
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:08,930
externally on their networks which is

195
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:13,100
very scary just like any other

196
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:16,339
department there are virtues in having

197
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:20,210
the correct staff and the crack teams in

198
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:22,279
regards to security so you'd want to

199
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:24,500
open up cross team communication have

200
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:25,820
teams like well you're gonna have an

201
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,830
executive team or hopefully you have an

202
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:30,110
executive team having somebody on that

203
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:32,690
team that knows a little bit about

204
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:46,580
technology is always very helpful and

205
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:49,010
hard for some people to to gain sorry

206
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:52,070
about that so in the executive team

207
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:53,900
you'd have a CSO CIO or whatever they're

208
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:56,570
not just there to sign your paychecks or

209
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:58,939
you know buy you fancy equipment they

210
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:02,120
can be your executive champions if you

211
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:05,080
need something changed or you need it

212
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,970
physically changed or if you'd have

213
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,860
policies in place that aren't secure

214
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:11,839
they're going to be the first ones that

215
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:15,230
can really get some traction in an

216
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,230
organization next is the risk team a lot

217
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:19,940
of organizations already have risk teams

218
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:22,670
for actual like their business risk

219
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:25,300
they don't really include security in

220
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:27,890
that risk and they should whether

221
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:29,750
whether you already have a risk team and

222
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:31,580
they're taught about security and and

223
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:33,740
given a little bit of a security mindset

224
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:37,730
to know that that should be built in to

225
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:42,740
whatever risk model they have or you can

226
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:46,820
have a security role within within that

227
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:48,589
risk team let's see here next is

228
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,150
security team obviously that's why we're

229
00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:52,730
all here

230
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:54,800
auditing team it's a good always a good

231
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:59,270
idea to have a system of checks and

232
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:02,209
balances several times also I've had

233
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:04,130
customers that have had like net admin

234
00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:05,949
security admin or whatever saying

235
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:08,870
everything's fine

236
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:11,740
but really everything's on fire and

237
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:15,050
they're just like pretending they have

238
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:17,150
they have everything under control so

239
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:20,890
having somebody that can call them on

240
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:20,890
that it can be very helpful Oh

241
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:26,719
next up asset management I'm not gonna

242
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,910
go over the entire little asset

243
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,880
management wheel this is just one way

244
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:34,219
that you can go about it and really as a

245
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:39,820
whole asset management isn't so much of

246
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:42,080
an info SEC function but it should be

247
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:44,060
rarely do I see people get asset

248
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,310
management right it's pretty impossible

249
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:51,140
to secure what's on your network when

250
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:55,160
you don't know what's there and in the

251
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:57,170
last ten years I've seen maybe 2 to 3

252
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,510
percent of customers actually doing

253
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:03,229
asset management correctly for a long

254
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:05,660
time I did like sim management I did a

255
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:07,940
lot in Splunk and any of our customers

256
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:09,079
that would have to like give us their

257
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:13,700
information when we were setting up

258
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:15,740
sprung out of that 3 years I had one

259
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:18,440
customer when I asked what their domain

260
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:19,880
controllers and DHCP servers and you

261
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:23,450
know all the other you know application

262
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:27,640
servers all that one person when I asked

263
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:29,900
for that stuff they had it ready which

264
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:32,720
was very impressive kind of knocking

265
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:36,770
knock me back I was just in awe I almost

266
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,180
cried but how can we get some of this

267
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:40,579
information if you're starting from

268
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:47,630
scratch things like our patience which

269
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:50,150
is DHCP and map commands PowerShell SNMP

270
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:52,880
WMI via vulnerability management

271
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:56,240
software that can scan all of that can

272
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:59,060
kind of come together to give you a main

273
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,530
list and that is the list that you're

274
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:02,989
gonna want to go off of something that

275
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:06,800
can be scripted and automated and is

276
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:09,500
your golden golden list hopefully it's

277
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,479
not in SharePoint because I swear to God

278
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:16,040
if I see another asset management list

279
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:20,440
in SharePoint I'm gonna scream so a lot

280
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:23,480
of lifestyle G's life cycle

281
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,529
stages between delivering the

282
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:28,190
commissioning that you have to worry

283
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:31,910
about so knowing where your assets are

284
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:34,640
coming from so if you have like shipping

285
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:37,760
and receiving that are getting assets in

286
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:39,439
sending them to different departments

287
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,450
and they're just plugging in into a

288
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,680
network jack

289
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:45,079
hopefully eventually you'll have it to

290
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:47,390
the point where you don't know some you

291
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:48,979
don't you will be alerted if something

292
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:52,579
that you don't know was plugged into the

293
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:53,600
network or connects to Wi-Fi a lot of

294
00:13:52,579 --> 00:13:57,229
times that doesn't happen as well

295
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,880
knowing that it's possible to come in

296
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:00,890
from shipping and receiving means that

297
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,680
they should be on your asset management

298
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:13,670
team and able to see that list as well

299
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:18,229
oh so going to shodhan again that is on

300
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:19,370
the bottom right hand side it's created

301
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:21,350
by John Mather Lee it's one of my

302
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:24,079
favorite tools to go into see random

303
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:27,709
 that's on the internet but that's

304
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:31,609
what you should be doing to your your IP

305
00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:33,768
space as well up here on the upper left

306
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:35,690
hand side is a tool called ocean

307
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:39,230
framework it's actually website ocean

308
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:40,670
framework comm and it will give you a

309
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:41,510
whole bunch of different ways you can

310
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:44,000
perform

311
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:47,089
Osen which you should be doing against

312
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,949
your own employees your own devices your

313
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:51,589
own you know whatever anything that has

314
00:14:48,949 --> 00:14:54,589
- anything that you would do to attack a

315
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:58,310
client you should be doing for your own

316
00:14:54,589 --> 00:15:03,170
network I've also started to do this

317
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:04,729
before I take jobs because he then kind

318
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:07,430
of know maybe what you're getting into

319
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:09,589
if you can see you know there's 30

320
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:11,149
devices on on that company's network

321
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:12,649
that I've just already P open to the

322
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:16,070
Internet you might not want to take that

323
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:19,910
job if you really don't want to go great

324
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:25,070
earlier build with calm is very helpful

325
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:27,140
if you don't really have the control in

326
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:28,790
your web presence you can see what

327
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:31,279
vulnerabilities you have out there based

328
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:32,279
on what it's built with it'll tell you

329
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,339
like it's

330
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:36,540
running Apache version whatever and that

331
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:37,490
gives you a little bit of idea of those

332
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:41,998
assets as well

333
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:47,610
recon ng is a tool written by Tim tomes

334
00:15:41,999 --> 00:15:49,319
and it's kind of used like Metasploit so

335
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:51,300
all from the command line and it will do

336
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:53,219
things like look for what email

337
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:56,189
addresses are out there on Google or

338
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:58,860
LinkedIn or whatever and those end up

339
00:15:56,189 --> 00:16:02,069
being the highest targets when it comes

340
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:07,309
to phishing attempts right so you know

341
00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:09,628
you have marketing yeah VP's you have

342
00:16:07,309 --> 00:16:11,550
people on Finance those are always

343
00:16:09,629 --> 00:16:15,720
really really top targets when it comes

344
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:17,790
to fishes you will know who those top

345
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,410
targets are based on his email address

346
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:21,809
is out there on the internet because

347
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:23,399
that stuff is super easy to script and

348
00:16:21,809 --> 00:16:25,230
that's where the script kiddies are

349
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,059
going after and that's if there's an

350
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:34,050
active attack that will be in their list

351
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:36,750
as well you need to assess eustress

352
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:39,660
threats and risks so if you don't know

353
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:45,329
what your risks are it's very hard to

354
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:47,370
defend against them things like so

355
00:16:45,329 --> 00:16:51,120
hopefully there isn't anybody that does

356
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:52,709
like GRC risk compliance stuff in the

357
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,519
audience because I'm not gonna really

358
00:16:52,709 --> 00:16:59,388
cover this very much in depth but it's

359
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:03,209
often split up into four different steps

360
00:16:59,389 --> 00:17:05,789
identify assess mitigating monitor so

361
00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:08,639
identifying organizations should be

362
00:17:05,789 --> 00:17:12,319
concerned with identifying the large

363
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:15,780
risks posed to them either if it's there

364
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:17,369
if it's a banking specific risk or if

365
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:20,299
it's things like ransomware which

366
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:23,339
everybody is usually concerned about

367
00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:24,599
you'll want to take an account internal

368
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:27,418
and external vulnerability scans

369
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:30,959
firewall rule audits and all of that

370
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:32,460
will kind of lend a larger picture to

371
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:39,860
the type of overall risk that you're

372
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:43,169
exposed to second is assess so you can

373
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:45,149
after those risks have been identified

374
00:17:43,169 --> 00:17:46,680
you want to assess them to

375
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:48,570
if they actually apply to the particular

376
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:52,590
environment there's nothing worse than

377
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:54,419
having alerts come in for you no you're

378
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:56,309
you're being attacked with this Apache

379
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,540
struts vulnerability thing from the

380
00:17:56,309 --> 00:18:01,530
internet when you don't have a patchy

381
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:03,720
running three is mitigate so mitigation

382
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:05,730
of risks is kind of meeting bones of why

383
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,500
we're all here and the purpose of the

384
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:09,510
majority of this talk and the book is

385
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:12,890
mitigating all and defending against

386
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:15,960
these risks options include avoiding

387
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:18,870
remediating which we want to do both of

388
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:21,210
those first off and then transferring or

389
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:22,830
finally accepting which that makes all

390
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:27,059
of a shudder is when people just accept

391
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:29,370
the risk and then four is monitor you

392
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:31,470
want to keep track over time with like a

393
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:35,280
schedule scheduled quarterly or yearly

394
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:36,570
review meeting throughout the year a lot

395
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,500
of changes are gonna happen to the

396
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:42,600
network and it's gonna affect the type

397
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,820
of data that you have it's gonna affect

398
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,659
what your inner you know all of those

399
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:48,000
things that we already talked about

400
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:50,190
finding it's gonna possibly affect all

401
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,880
of that and you want to take take that

402
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:59,550
into account with these reviews when it

403
00:18:53,880 --> 00:19:02,490
comes to your risk I like to recommend

404
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:04,409
this as a first technical step so

405
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:07,559
starting a security program from the

406
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:09,270
ground up can be extremely daunting with

407
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:11,910
so many different facets to consider to

408
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:13,590
consider mm-hmm

409
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:15,390
the more initial thought and planning

410
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:17,879
that's put into the creation of that

411
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:20,809
program the easier it will be to do in

412
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:23,760
the long run you're not going to want to

413
00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:26,370
do things for the sake of routine or

414
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:30,030
because with the mindset of we've always

415
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:33,800
done it this way that's where a lot of

416
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:36,210
security vulnerabilities and and

417
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:41,760
mismanagement come into play is when

418
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:46,559
there's thoughts like that so things

419
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:47,879
like patch management taking just taking

420
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,550
devices off the network that don't need

421
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,650
to be there it's very very low hanging

422
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:54,200
fruit things that are that are gonna be

423
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:56,700
caught in mostly by script kiddies

424
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,870
turning off ports that are exposed to

425
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,950
the Internet all that stuff is

426
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:05,189
low-hanging fruit that you want

427
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:10,620
take a look at first so a lot of what we

428
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:12,540
clever now will be free right a lot of

429
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:17,010
it's covered in security frameworks like

430
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:19,260
a wasp PCI and I and I highly recommend

431
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:24,840
recommend using all of those as

432
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:27,720
checklists and yeah a lot of that can be

433
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:31,110
up to interpretation as well things like

434
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,490
piece like PCI and and HIPPA and all of

435
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:34,219
the other compliance frameworks that are

436
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:36,840
out there sometimes get a lot of flack

437
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:41,040
but it's very hard to have an overall

438
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:43,560
list that works for everybody and a lot

439
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:47,159
of what they recommend I mean like the

440
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:48,450
the CIS security controls a lot of what

441
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:51,450
they recommend can be implemented for

442
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:54,300
free not necessarily when you have to

443
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:55,980
consider in your time but the

444
00:20:54,300 --> 00:21:01,080
technologies themself you don't have to

445
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:03,710
have a giant security budget to do so

446
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:07,710
first up is segmentation and networking

447
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:08,990
things like access control lists oh my

448
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:12,060
god what a concept

449
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:14,600
how many times have I seen people not

450
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:17,610
filtering to their traffic outbound and

451
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:20,189
trying to convince people to alter their

452
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:22,500
traffic in general seems to be a huge

453
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:24,990
struggle sometimes they're like oh well

454
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:26,400
oh all threats come from the outside so

455
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,660
why should I have to filter anything

456
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,560
outbound people are just accessing

457
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:33,570
websites right it's very hard to kind of

458
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,750
get in the mindset that the threats can

459
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:40,800
be on the inside as well

460
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:44,190
geo blocking I mean most of our US

461
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:46,050
customers block China Russia Netherlands

462
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:47,340
so sorry if any of you need to access

463
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:50,879
any of my customers websites you might

464
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:54,570
not be able to but that's where a lot of

465
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:56,670
the threats come from you know if right

466
00:21:54,570 --> 00:22:00,450
now I do a lot of stuff in a different

467
00:21:56,670 --> 00:22:05,510
sim for my company and even though we

468
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:09,770
have only US customers that are doing

469
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:11,580
business only with other US customers

470
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:14,660
ninety percent of the hits on their

471
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,659
firewall are coming from China

472
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,590
turning on geo blocking will pretty much

473
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:21,360
automatically stop all of that and just

474
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:24,030
drop it dead and you don't have to worry

475
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,770
about that is a risk anymore unless

476
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:28,850
they're yeah VPNs all that kind of stuff

477
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:32,120
but all they automatic stuff anyways

478
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:34,980
segmenting with VLANs one of the largest

479
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:39,330
complaints and the most often I see on

480
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:42,330
pen test reports and vulnerability scans

481
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:43,610
whatever you want to call them is the

482
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:46,470
fact that there's a flight Network

483
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:48,270
anytime that there's malware that

484
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:50,220
spreads throughout a network it's

485
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:52,830
because they have one VLAN and

486
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:54,570
everything is on it and it's it's just

487
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:56,010
Traverse their network like that because

488
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:57,929
they have nothing else in place they

489
00:22:56,010 --> 00:23:00,420
have not only do then I have VLANs

490
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:03,120
there's no access control between the

491
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:05,520
VLANs are there's like one firewall that

492
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,620
is still allowing everything outbound

493
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:12,139
and sometimes everything inbound which

494
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:15,750
is also scary role based servers so

495
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:18,630
things like not having a domain

496
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:21,030
controller also be a sequel server that

497
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:26,850
is the back end to your external facing

498
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:29,910
websites which has happened because you

499
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:33,090
know you you don't want any external you

500
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:35,490
don't want any additional stress on your

501
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:38,970
you know primary roles if you if you're

502
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:41,370
in a Active Directory domain you don't

503
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:42,780
want that Active Directory server to do

504
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:47,010
anything more than what it's supposed to

505
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:52,110
be doing for resources purposes and for

506
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:55,320
security purposes Windows OS that

507
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:59,550
everybody loves to hate I kind of have

508
00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:04,919
to admit that I was a huge windows like

509
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:06,720
ger policy geek for a while it's not

510
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,490
something that anybody really enjoys

511
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,750
doing because it's a gigantic pain

512
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:12,750
especially when it's implemented

513
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:15,810
incorrectly first off I actually went

514
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:18,030
into an environment that had about 20

515
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:20,610
different group policies applied

516
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:22,440
randomly with random settings no really

517
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:26,459
rhyme or reason behind it

518
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:28,019
and again I don't want to admit it but

519
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,639
it was really fun going through all of

520
00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:32,940
that and just picking and choosing and

521
00:24:29,639 --> 00:24:34,559
redesigning all of that and and I mean

522
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:36,360
there's so many different security

523
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:39,480
settings and your policy and you can

524
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:41,129
lock down the system to really do only

525
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,559
what it's supposed to do which is a

526
00:24:41,129 --> 00:24:46,199
novel concept without having to have an

527
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:47,639
endpoint protection I mean yeah endpoint

528
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,399
protections are still nice and it's

529
00:24:47,639 --> 00:24:53,870
going to be really important but you

530
00:24:50,399 --> 00:24:58,639
know reducing the risk that it has to

531
00:24:53,870 --> 00:25:02,340
combat is also you know defense-in-depth

532
00:24:58,639 --> 00:25:06,299
things like disabling llm in our and

533
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:10,019
that bios if you're an offense you know

534
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:11,789
like if you're on a Windows network 99%

535
00:25:10,019 --> 00:25:15,389
of the time you're gonna be able to

536
00:25:11,789 --> 00:25:17,850
capture credentials over over the

537
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:20,729
network with responder and it's super

538
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:24,418
easy it takes like three commands and

539
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:25,919
boom you already have credentials and

540
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:27,659
disabling it is not that difficult the

541
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:31,500
only only problems that I've had with

542
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:35,460
disabling that is older systems that

543
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:38,279
don't seem to know how to use dns so if

544
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:40,590
there are like a s400 mainframe type

545
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:43,440
stuff sometimes there are printers that

546
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:46,199
kind of thing that have no idea DNS is a

547
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,360
concept that can really mess up things

548
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:52,139
sometimes but what like with all of this

549
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:54,600
you're gonna want to test all of that w

550
00:25:52,139 --> 00:25:58,469
South's very important to have updated

551
00:25:54,600 --> 00:26:00,389
patches getting rid of open chairs at

552
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:02,970
the hospital that I have worked at we

553
00:26:00,389 --> 00:26:06,209
actually had open chairs with Excel

554
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:10,379
documents with passwords in them there's

555
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:12,840
an nmap scan and there's also powershell

556
00:26:10,379 --> 00:26:15,000
command that you can run to just search

557
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:21,449
your entire network for open shares that

558
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:24,149
are out there multi-factor off and

559
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:26,100
authentication we all know multi-factor

560
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:27,719
authors great something else to think

561
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:29,779
about is how often you see it

562
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:32,429
implemented on systems internally and

563
00:26:29,779 --> 00:26:33,840
how it really really messes up red

564
00:26:32,429 --> 00:26:37,250
teamers when you do have it implemented

565
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,250
internally and correctly

566
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:43,410
you can also implement multi-factor off

567
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:46,170
incorrectly there was a program that I

568
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:49,110
will remain nameless that instead of

569
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:51,000
getting a push notification to your

570
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:52,709
phone it would just call you and you

571
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,559
could hit pound and that was your second

572
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:59,090
factor off technically it is that is

573
00:26:55,559 --> 00:27:02,520
another factor but what we had was

574
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:06,049
external offices not with cell phones

575
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:09,240
they just had 50 people use the

576
00:27:06,049 --> 00:27:12,480
receptionist phone so anytime that they

577
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:13,919
logged in they would know the phone

578
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,179
number it was coming from she wouldn't

579
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,270
even listen anymore she would just pick

580
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:21,030
it up hit pound and hang it up it's

581
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:23,129
nothing easier but bypassing that for

582
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:24,660
multi-factor off it's technically

583
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:27,540
implemented and you will get nice

584
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:32,610
compliance check mark but it's not

585
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:36,480
secure in any way shape or form laughs

586
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:39,330
so it is the local admin password

587
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:42,390
solution for Windows I actually

588
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:45,299
implemented this for the first time the

589
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:48,960
beginning of last year and it was one of

590
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:50,540
those things like with a company that I

591
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,130
was working for they always had it on

592
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:56,250
all of their reports you know implement

593
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:58,080
laps have you know different so what it

594
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:59,549
does is it changes all the local admin

595
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:03,600
passwords to be different so you can't

596
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:06,570
pivot very easily but nobody on our team

597
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,370
had ever implemented it before and it's

598
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:09,809
just one of those things where you know

599
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:11,428
it's a good idea you've never done it

600
00:28:09,809 --> 00:28:15,168
before but you tell everybody else to do

601
00:28:11,429 --> 00:28:17,250
it nobody that I know has ever done it

602
00:28:15,169 --> 00:28:19,740
because it's kind of a pain in the ass

603
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:21,630
for your helpdesk people or whoever's

604
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,890
admin in your boxes it's way easier just

605
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:24,570
to memorize with the local admin

606
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:28,169
password is and go up and you're done

607
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:29,370
right well what I didn't know when I

608
00:28:28,169 --> 00:28:32,070
implemented didn't thank God it wasn't

609
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:33,418
the customer first time I did it is it

610
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:36,540
actually changes your domain I'm an

611
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:38,520
admin password as well so thank God for

612
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:42,210
VM snapshots because I myself had to

613
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:44,400
rebuild my lab all over again at least

614
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:47,100
privileges are anywhere segmentation of

615
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:49,050
Rights so like donut domain admins

616
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,990
should there should only be one maybe

617
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:52,450
two

618
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:56,140
people in domain admin schema admin

619
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:57,910
power user groups and the use of those

620
00:28:56,140 --> 00:29:01,690
should be audited it shouldn't be

621
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:03,460
here's your your sis admin group they

622
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:05,590
log into their everyday machines with

623
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:06,610
domain admin that's not something that

624
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:08,590
should be done and they should be

625
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:10,300
logging in with their own least

626
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:11,470
privileged accounts and only doing the

627
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:13,570
things that they need to do with that

628
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:15,880
not running services with it not

629
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:18,330
installing software with it that's that

630
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:20,260
can actually lead to way more problems

631
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:21,490
wait around the on the line when you

632
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:30,400
have to take some of that domain admin

633
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:33,990
rights away it's a little bit about

634
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:36,790
system hardening we already mentioned

635
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:39,059
endpoint detection whatever right

636
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:41,379
there's a million of them out there

637
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:42,940
creating a golden image is very

638
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:45,820
important when you're trying to harden

639
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:47,410
your endpoints I recommend a lot of

640
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:50,830
times if it's a Windows box that you

641
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:52,570
should nist has some already pre harden

642
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:54,820
group policy out there that you can

643
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:57,370
download and install I recommend putting

644
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:59,470
that on the golden image that way if a

645
00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:01,239
computer can't access the domain or is

646
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:04,570
removed for some reason there's already

647
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:05,830
a standard of security in place that you

648
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:09,220
don't have to worry about if it can

649
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:13,570
contact the domain application

650
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:16,000
whitelisting as anybody i've talked to

651
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:18,840
one person so far that has gone into an

652
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,800
existing environment that didn't have

653
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:23,379
application whitelisting and actually

654
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:25,960
successfully implemented it it was a

655
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:28,360
larger company and they had the backing

656
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:30,280
and the resources to do it I see a lot

657
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:32,709
of times people not wanting to put in

658
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:34,059
the effort just because it takes a lot

659
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:37,360
of work especially if you're doing it

660
00:30:34,059 --> 00:30:39,428
retro actively but having a golden image

661
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,840
also makes it much easier to do

662
00:30:39,429 --> 00:30:43,059
application whitelisting because you're

663
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:47,169
no you know what's going out on onto the

664
00:30:43,059 --> 00:30:49,480
network in the beginning things like

665
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:51,550
using encryption and BitLocker patching

666
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:53,530
your Linux boxes removing unneeded

667
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:57,280
software how many people actually need

668
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:58,899
Java I mean some of us probably do but

669
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:02,080
for our end users how many people

670
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:04,240
actually need to have Java or Adobe

671
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:08,530
Acrobat or all the other

672
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:11,380
you know 10,000 super unpatched software

673
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:14,980
that are out there there's and there's

674
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:16,780
there's third-party management patch

675
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:20,110
management systems that you can use for

676
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:21,639
the people that do need that well things

677
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:26,709
like upgrading the firmware is also on

678
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:34,840
there for the love of God implement TLS

679
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:37,780
1.2 as you know from SSL version 2

680
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:40,720
version 3 tell us one one one and one

681
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:43,960
two are all very insecure and this is

682
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:50,400
why we see all of this at one point I

683
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:52,720
saw that it was something like 48% of

684
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:56,220
SSL sites on the internet we're

685
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:58,390
vulnerable to one of these that's a lot

686
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:00,970
especially considering some of the more

687
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:05,710
important ones that you know disclosed a

688
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:07,720
lot of information there sites like SSL

689
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:10,120
labs that you can do as tests against

690
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:11,740
anything that you have to see if it's

691
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,209
vulnerable to any of these as well as

692
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:16,840
like vulnerability scanners will tell

693
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:19,840
you you can use URL scan which it

694
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:22,240
actually screens incoming requests to

695
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:27,760
the server by filtering based on rules

696
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:31,270
so it's kind of like Oh F 4i is there's

697
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:33,370
fail to ban that scans logs looking for

698
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:36,280
potentially malicious traffic both of

699
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:38,459
those are free mod security is like a

700
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:43,540
wife for Linux boxes and Apache you

701
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:45,610
should be doing like full HTTP traffic

702
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:46,899
logging eventually right that's

703
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:50,320
something that you can get to eventually

704
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:53,650
it's that's not free for the most part I

705
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:56,080
mean there are log management solutions

706
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:59,530
out there that are free most of them

707
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:02,080
aren't great so one of the first things

708
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:03,490
that I'll recommend is when you actually

709
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,110
do have a budget after you've completed

710
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:07,750
all your free stuff and done your due

711
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:12,659
diligence that you actually get a really

712
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:12,660
good sim and log management utility

713
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:18,340
so extra stuff one of my favorite things

714
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,320
in the book was the fact that we got to

715
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:22,270
dry tan extra stuff chapter that didn't

716
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,789
really fit in anywhere else they didn't

717
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:26,889
let me use the picture of a unicorn but

718
00:33:24,789 --> 00:33:30,190
it was stuff like blocking DNS zone

719
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:33,760
transfers from anything that's not your

720
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:37,059
own DNS server because attackers can use

721
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:40,390
that to gain insight information into

722
00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:43,480
the network the means you use close open

723
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:44,770
mail relays this isn't so much of an

724
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:49,720
issue now that people have started to

725
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:51,639
move to Google Mail and officer 65 and

726
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:53,260
everything in the cloud because I don't

727
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:55,780
think it's really possible to have open

728
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:59,020
mail relay at that point it was usually

729
00:33:55,780 --> 00:34:00,668
all of the exchange admins that were out

730
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:02,379
there just popping their exchange boxes

731
00:34:00,669 --> 00:34:05,950
on the internet and not configuring them

732
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:07,539
with anything and they were just open to

733
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:10,810
send an email on to the rest of the

734
00:34:07,539 --> 00:34:14,440
world no matter who you were and gets

735
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:16,779
you on blacklist super quick you disable

736
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:18,369
telnet and other secure protocols and if

737
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:20,740
you can't you should alert on their use

738
00:34:18,369 --> 00:34:26,320
again that's a that's a good thing for

739
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:28,509
like an IDs sim solution because just

740
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,310
like just like saying you need a patch

741
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:32,470
you need to patch your and and

742
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:34,960
really getting on the case of system

743
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:36,069
admins when they don't if you've ever

744
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,290
been in an enterprise security

745
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:40,629
environment sometimes it's impossible to

746
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:43,300
do that you have multi-million dollar

747
00:34:40,629 --> 00:34:44,949
contracts on a box it's Windows 2000

748
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:47,169
that's been sitting there for years and

749
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:50,618
years and years and you will lose that

750
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:52,710
support and you can't you don't have the

751
00:34:50,619 --> 00:34:56,379
budget to have a new piece of software

752
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:59,109
replace that one it happens a lot in

753
00:34:56,379 --> 00:35:02,319
medical industry you know that Windows

754
00:34:59,109 --> 00:35:05,619
2000 box is hooked up to a three million

755
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:08,190
dollar CT scanner and you can't replace

756
00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:10,630
that CT scanner right now and you can't

757
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:12,400
replace the box and you can't update it

758
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:17,230
because then it will break you don't

759
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:22,960
wanna brick a CT machine DNS servers

760
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:24,550
should also not be openly recursive some

761
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,560
other extra stuff shown here is that

762
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:27,420
tool that I mentioned earlier that NAT

763
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:32,549
disco

764
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:35,250
it shows you the name of the port what

765
00:35:32,549 --> 00:35:36,869
VLANs are on what's actually connected

766
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:37,670
you can run reports and it's a great

767
00:35:36,869 --> 00:35:40,020
free tool

768
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:43,859
don't forget your printers anybody ever

769
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:46,799
remember when all of the Nazi stuff got

770
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:49,220
printed out from what's a face to a

771
00:35:46,799 --> 00:35:51,210
bunch of the printers on the internet

772
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:52,558
you don't don't want to free your

773
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:55,829
printer so a lot of red teamers that I

774
00:35:52,559 --> 00:36:00,059
talked to actually will get domain admin

775
00:35:55,829 --> 00:36:02,069
creds off of printers quite often you

776
00:36:00,059 --> 00:36:04,530
want to locate and detect sorry locate

777
00:36:02,069 --> 00:36:08,460
and destroy plaintext passwords turn off

778
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:10,280
it turn off your open Wi-Fi when I again

779
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:14,790
when I worked at the hospital that was a

780
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:16,170
gigantic disaster I got a call from the

781
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:17,549
helpdesk saying hey there's a lady that

782
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:19,770
can't connect to the wireless we can't

783
00:36:17,549 --> 00:36:21,030
figure it out can you help her talk to

784
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:23,250
this lady she was actually down the

785
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:26,339
street she had been using her Wi-Fi for

786
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:29,549
years and now couldn't connect anymore

787
00:36:26,339 --> 00:36:31,259
so you'll find out real quick people

788
00:36:29,549 --> 00:36:33,299
that shouldn't be using your Wi-Fi if

789
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:37,440
you actually secure it how you should be

790
00:36:33,299 --> 00:36:39,720
and instead of you know NIST came out

791
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:43,440
with the new you shouldn't have to

792
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:47,009
change your password now very very often

793
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,240
if it's of a certain length and they're

794
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:50,059
changing all of their standards when it

795
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:54,359
comes to what you should be doing for

796
00:36:50,059 --> 00:36:56,220
your password security right instead of

797
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:59,940
worrying about that I've done my best to

798
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:01,890
start preaching password safes and the

799
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:03,660
use of those either across the

800
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:05,400
organization there's a lot of good tools

801
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:09,569
out there that you can do role based

802
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:11,010
password management and not have you

803
00:37:09,569 --> 00:37:12,599
know people having them on sticky notes

804
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:16,530
and all the other problems that we

805
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:18,569
always see with passwords and password

806
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:24,210
reuse right outside of an organization

807
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:26,880
as well oh I have to hurry up I have a

808
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:28,650
lot more slides left so now we've gone a

809
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,270
little quite a lot of information that

810
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:32,819
can mostly be implemented within the

811
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:34,440
first year of the security program once

812
00:37:32,819 --> 00:37:37,020
those threats and risk is a risks have

813
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:39,390
been identified and assessed you also

814
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:40,640
should prioritize them you don't want to

815
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:43,549
always take

816
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:45,848
a tools like the vulnerability

817
00:37:43,549 --> 00:37:48,279
management or an outside vendors

818
00:37:45,849 --> 00:37:51,829
recommendation when it comes to

819
00:37:48,279 --> 00:37:54,680
prioritizing these because what might be

820
00:37:51,829 --> 00:37:56,480
a priority one in any other system may

821
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:59,029
not be because of compensating controls

822
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,640
where you're at so it's it's it's a good

823
00:37:59,029 --> 00:38:04,519
idea to put a lot of thought behind your

824
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:09,308
prioritization and that can differ

825
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:13,359
greatly from organization organization

826
00:38:09,309 --> 00:38:15,230
um create some milestones things like

827
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:17,119
separate them up into tears

828
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:20,150
so tier one will be quick wins that you

829
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:21,349
can just do now like I said before you

830
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:23,299
know turning on some firewall rules

831
00:38:21,349 --> 00:38:25,730
taking some stuff off the network tier

832
00:38:23,299 --> 00:38:27,019
two like this year what you can what can

833
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:30,559
you accomplish in the next three nor

834
00:38:27,019 --> 00:38:32,269
sixty five days that isn't going to make

835
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:34,539
huge disruptions it isn't going to be a

836
00:38:32,269 --> 00:38:37,160
complete redesign of your entire network

837
00:38:34,539 --> 00:38:39,829
it's not gonna cost you know a lot of

838
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:44,598
capital money what can you do in that

839
00:38:39,829 --> 00:38:48,259
year yeah is the next step that you want

840
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:49,640
to take next year would be tier three so

841
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:52,309
in the next two years what you can you

842
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:55,160
accomplish good examples are like

843
00:38:52,309 --> 00:38:59,799
implementing two-factor off upgrading

844
00:38:55,160 --> 00:39:02,799
major systems you know major device

845
00:38:59,799 --> 00:39:07,038
replacements so like any any head end

846
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:09,650
equipment whether it's like main

847
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:11,509
firewalls or your Wi-Fi access or

848
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:14,720
wherever and then Tier four is a long

849
00:39:11,509 --> 00:39:16,369
term a lot of times this stuff will take

850
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:20,779
years and years to accomplish especially

851
00:39:16,369 --> 00:39:22,940
like I said with that CT machine that

852
00:39:20,779 --> 00:39:24,109
might just be a year five goal you're

853
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:27,259
gonna have to put compensating and

854
00:39:24,109 --> 00:39:28,460
controls in place to deal with the fact

855
00:39:27,259 --> 00:39:32,450
that you can't do anything with it

856
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:33,589
Windows 2000 Vox and like new datacenter

857
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:35,689
builds you're not gonna be able to spend

858
00:39:33,589 --> 00:39:36,140
spent up a new like dr site like that

859
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:41,089
either

860
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:43,190
oh another thing it's really good to tie

861
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:47,288
those milestones to critical controls or

862
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:49,789
if you're under any compliance standards

863
00:39:47,289 --> 00:39:52,579
because then you can say hey I have to

864
00:39:49,789 --> 00:39:54,970
do this because otherwise I won't be PCI

865
00:39:52,579 --> 00:39:54,970
compliant

866
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:59,850
and then you want to work with your

867
00:39:56,070 --> 00:40:03,150
stakeholders present your research let

868
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:05,520
them know you know what what the risks

869
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:08,190
are in the other departments you know if

870
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:10,710
it's if it's HR and they want to know

871
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:12,750
all right well I used to have access to

872
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:14,310
all this stuff and now I don't work with

873
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:15,450
them and let them know why you know you

874
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:20,790
don't want to just be another face

875
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:24,270
behind no face by this computer screen

876
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:26,460
and then you can also explain the cost

877
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:28,500
avoidance of you know what would happen

878
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:30,869
if they did get breached and you lost

879
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:35,160
all of that customer data what that

880
00:40:30,869 --> 00:40:36,720
would actually look like oh this is one

881
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:39,450
of my favorite things to recommend to is

882
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:41,399
an IR bug-out bag so has anybody ever

883
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:44,970
liked or is is anybody hear us anybody

884
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:46,859
ever met a proper we're like there's TV

885
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:48,419
show about prepping like you're you're

886
00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:50,819
waiting for the next Dombey apocalypse

887
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:54,300
you have a gun and extra socks and

888
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:56,190
clothes and you know water for so many

889
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:57,300
days and all that kind of stuff this is

890
00:40:56,190 --> 00:41:04,380
what you should have if you're doing

891
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:07,380
your own IR because I mean so you want

892
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:11,900
bootable USB drives or images or

893
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:14,070
whatever your golden image offline so

894
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:17,490
you don't want your golden image to be

895
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:19,290
hacked and exploited and then you're

896
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:21,089
like after you after you do all of your

897
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:24,810
IR you're now rolling out your golden

898
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:28,200
image that also was you know has malware

899
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:30,570
on it or ever laptops not under main if

900
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:33,540
you're on a Windows domain because if

901
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:35,340
you're Active Directory gets hacked or

902
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:37,109
accessed really it's Microsoft's

903
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:40,170
recommendation to start over start over

904
00:41:37,109 --> 00:41:43,230
from scratch which is any Microsoft

905
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:44,940
admins might like worst nightmare

906
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:47,490
loads of storage for like memory dumps

907
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:49,890
and dis forensics

908
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:51,359
I should have my book up here too but it

909
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:54,390
I think I wrote this before I wrote the

910
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:58,710
book there's actually the blue team

911
00:41:54,390 --> 00:42:02,100
handbook was what I thought my book was

912
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:04,590
so I bought this thinking that okay this

913
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:06,630
is the book that all blue teamers need

914
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:07,290
to fix other turns out it's just

915
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:08,580
entry

916
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:11,670
months which it does a really really

917
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:13,440
good job of it already has like lists of

918
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:15,660
stuff you should do in IR situations and

919
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,700
templates and all that kind of stuff

920
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:22,920
sans has some really good templates you

921
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:25,500
always want to have snacks and MiFi that

922
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:27,270
kind of stuff if if you don't have the

923
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:30,110
best network connection because of

924
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:30,110
something happening

925
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:38,280
a purple team I'm a huge proponent of

926
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:42,570
purple teaming instead of network one of

927
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:45,660
my new favorite things to do is use the

928
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:48,870
mitre attack framework and just go

929
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:52,710
through all of it internally if you ever

930
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:54,540
use a Kanban tool it's very nice to put

931
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:57,630
all of the mitre attack framework in

932
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:59,670
internally and see what you can detect

933
00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:02,250
on your own network and see what you can

934
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:04,140
break on your own network you know

935
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:06,900
within within reason you don't want to

936
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:09,990
be you know shutting down a bank or

937
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:14,340
anything like that but this right here

938
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:17,790
is an example of us internal purple

939
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:20,670
teaming in art in our network and this

940
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:21,560
is I don't think it shows know this is

941
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:24,660
event ID

942
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:27,570
46:25 which is failed login attempts

943
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:29,779
does anybody know what is gonna generate

944
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:34,920
something that looks like this

945
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:38,240
anybody Red Team so this is an SMB brute

946
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:40,380
force on Metasploit and it has different

947
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:44,160
thresholds right there's different speed

948
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:48,390
settings it's 5 to 1 5 being I think

949
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:51,210
it's 5 being the most aggressive yeah so

950
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:54,319
this is 5 3 & 1 this is just brute-force

951
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:56,330
SMB password reset password attempts

952
00:43:54,320 --> 00:44:00,210
this is something that is extremely

953
00:43:56,330 --> 00:44:01,740
easily detected if you're doing your log

954
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:05,280
management correctly and you have that

955
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:07,950
log coming in the first one being the

956
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:10,680
default that I've always seen red

957
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:12,509
teamers use they're wanting to do as

958
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:16,950
fast as possibly because nobody ever

959
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:18,990
detects this the second one it's gonna

960
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:20,160
take them a little bit longer and the

961
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:20,830
slowest speed setting they're never

962
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,140
gonna really do

963
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:26,410
because otherwise it's gonna take them

964
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:28,660
months to finish their attack somebody

965
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:33,700
malicious or their their report if

966
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:35,970
they're doing it on purpose oh let's see

967
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:35,970
here

968
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:41,170
Oh things a couple things already talked

969
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:45,940
about using responder if you haven't

970
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:47,290
turned off lMNO lMNO are you can see how

971
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:51,340
easily that works on the inside of the

972
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:52,870
network Metasploit and map masks and any

973
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:54,550
any of the free tools that are out there

974
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:56,339
there's a million different things you

975
00:44:54,550 --> 00:45:01,060
can do internally to red team that

976
00:44:56,340 --> 00:45:03,960
doesn't really impact you know

977
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:03,960
day-to-day operations

978
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:11,350
not just compliance but secure

979
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:12,970
compliance again like that

980
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:15,790
two-factor off program that was

981
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:18,580
implemented it was cool it was compliant

982
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:21,790
right they they were definitely Petar

983
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:24,490
yeah pci compliant in that case but it

984
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:26,050
wasn't secure so having having some

985
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:27,910
secure thought behind the compliance

986
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:29,890
compliance isn't bad it's really good to

987
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:33,009
use as a standard sometimes if you know

988
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:39,520
what you're doing and can put some like

989
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:40,900
intelligent design behind it huh and

990
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,370
then show me the money do we have a

991
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:46,870
budget yet after you've done all of that

992
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:49,720
due diligence you should hopefully get a

993
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:51,279
budget if you don't have one already and

994
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:53,830
you know everything that we had gone

995
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:57,700
over yes it's gonna take a lot of time

996
00:45:53,830 --> 00:46:00,580
but it's also free things like buying a

997
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:03,460
real vulnerability scanner getting an

998
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:04,660
expensive Sam one of the IDS IPS that

999
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:08,800
are out there that are free are good

1000
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:12,250
anyways two-factor off advanced cyber

1001
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:14,140
buzzword blinky boxes password safe

1002
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:16,630
stuff like that anything that's gonna

1003
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:18,430
cost you a large license endpoint

1004
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:22,660
protection there's always you know high

1005
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:24,600
license that's up there I could probably

1006
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:26,470
talk for a long long time about logging

1007
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:28,630
I'm just going to show you a little bit

1008
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:30,939
here though this is what I talked about

1009
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:33,550
earlier the first ones Netherlands this

1010
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:34,740
is just one of our customers over it was

1011
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:36,510
over 24 hours

1012
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:39,029
where all of the external traffic was

1013
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:42,619
coming from they only do business in

1014
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:44,850
Michigan it's like a sandwich shop

1015
00:46:42,619 --> 00:46:46,500
they're not selling sandwiches than

1016
00:46:44,850 --> 00:46:49,230
other ones I guarantee it

1017
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:53,730
so turning on geo blocking for the top

1018
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:55,560
oh they could do all of those so let's

1019
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:58,710
see here it's uh Switzerland's number

1020
00:46:55,560 --> 00:47:02,279
three some of your wanting sandwiches

1021
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:04,890
really bad I guess China Russia all that

1022
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:08,400
kind of stuff this is another thing that

1023
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:11,160
I've I got from a friend of mine that

1024
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:13,950
runs if you have ever seen the windows

1025
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:19,580
logging or Linux logging cheat sheets

1026
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:22,529
this is hacker Hurricanes thing this is

1027
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:26,819
advanced file auditing you can turn that

1028
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:29,430
on on Windows and awed it when files are

1029
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:32,580
accessed so when you do that you can

1030
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:34,649
actually see you know this is normal

1031
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:36,810
file access normal file access and I'll

1032
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:38,670
give you one guess as to where the

1033
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:40,049
malware started accessing all the the

1034
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:43,619
ransomware started accessing and

1035
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:45,720
encrypting all the files something also

1036
00:47:43,619 --> 00:47:53,670
that's super easy to threshold and alert

1037
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:56,069
it on and finally user education this is

1038
00:47:53,670 --> 00:48:03,150
from that same hospital after we had

1039
00:47:56,070 --> 00:48:05,609
already fixed so much stuff you know

1040
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:07,350
user education gets a bad rep sometimes

1041
00:48:05,609 --> 00:48:10,980
because you know there are only users

1042
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:14,130
they're not you know they they don't

1043
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:16,080
care you know but I've actually seen

1044
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:18,840
correctly implemented user education

1045
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:22,830
that makes those users your first line

1046
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:24,720
of defense it's you know having whether

1047
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:27,540
it's one hundred two hundred thousand

1048
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:28,980
different sets of eyes on something

1049
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:32,310
weird going on in the network if they

1050
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:34,920
have an easy Avenue of reporting

1051
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:37,230
whatever is weird or fishy in this case

1052
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:40,350
because we did that one completely on

1053
00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:42,450
fish puns because I love puns even

1054
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:46,618
though they do cause international

1055
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:47,990
incidents for me sometimes it's it's

1056
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:49,940
very important to have the

1057
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:54,319
users kind of on your side because it's

1058
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:57,920
not just our job for security it's it's

1059
00:48:54,320 --> 00:49:00,920
everybody's job and if they can say yeah

1060
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:02,810
I I had to type in my email address and

1061
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:05,350
password twice to the site and I

1062
00:49:02,810 --> 00:49:07,430
normally only have to do it once

1063
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:10,790
something like that is gonna really

1064
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:14,660
really aid in this in the how speedily

1065
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:19,940
you go through your IR and then it's not

1066
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:22,009
like that so in summary we've just

1067
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:25,220
covered a whole lot of stuff very

1068
00:49:22,010 --> 00:49:27,640
generally and again this wasn't meant to

1069
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:30,410
be dropping owed a talk or some

1070
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:34,009
incredible threat research because

1071
00:49:30,410 --> 00:49:36,440
that's not really what's needed in the

1072
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:39,170
majority of cases right a lot of a lot

1073
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:41,780
of what we see is the same that

1074
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:43,520
we've seen the last ten years and that's

1075
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:46,400
exactly what this talk is for that's

1076
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:49,160
exactly what the book is for it is for

1077
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:51,190
you know trying to trying to make it a

1078
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:56,180
little bit more difficult for all of us

1079
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:58,700
to break in or doing blue team stuff I

1080
00:49:56,180 --> 00:50:01,100
would love to do colors as opposed

1081
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:04,669
to just the same recommendations over

1082
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:06,529
and over and over and over again if we

1083
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:09,140
can improve that security standard

1084
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:13,970
across the board that's you know that

1085
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:18,049
was our big and lofty goal and we're

1086
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:22,189
doing good so far I think having the

1087
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:24,050
porcupine would be is is great for you

1088
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:25,660
know in general it was a lot of people

1089
00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:29,840
asked me if I got to choose the animal

1090
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:31,190
and no I didn't I could have but we

1091
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:32,840
spent way too much time going back and

1092
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:34,310
forth trying to figure out what it

1093
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:36,290
should have been and they're like here

1094
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:41,350
have a porcupine so that's why there's

1095
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:43,850
porcupine on the cover and this is me

1096
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:45,710
that's my Twitter handle co-author

1097
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:48,020
co-host on breaking down security

1098
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:50,000
breaking is spelled correctly because

1099
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:50,740
the other co-hosts last name is break b

1100
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,510
ra ke

1101
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:54,799
i've heard of people that don't want to

1102
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:57,470
listen to podcast because I thought we

1103
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:59,730
spelt breaking wrong I blog and I love

1104
00:50:57,470 --> 00:51:01,109
unicorns and I have three awesome kids

1105
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:03,150
and I don't know if I have time for

1106
00:51:01,109 --> 00:51:04,770
questions we got a couple minutes okay

1107
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:08,130
all right so if there's any questions if

1108
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:11,420
not you can catch me later on don't just

1109
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:11,420
don't speak German to me I guess

1110
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:19,078
Wilson yeah thank you very much Amanda

1111
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:21,930
like that was a great hero slot of the

1112
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:23,280
day he'd like to finish on if anyone has

1113
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:24,569
a questions they'll be great we still

1114
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:30,150
got a couple minutes before the barbecue

1115
00:51:24,570 --> 00:51:31,349
starts so let's get in on that thank you

1116
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:34,940
so much for the talk

1117
00:51:31,349 --> 00:51:34,940
we should had your book ten years ago

1118
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:40,589
the when I had to do something similar

1119
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:42,300
ten years ago I didn't start out with

1120
00:51:40,589 --> 00:51:45,089
any of that I started out with security

1121
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:46,410
policy and I in retrospect it may not

1122
00:51:45,089 --> 00:51:49,009
have been the best idea but where does

1123
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:51,690
policy fit into all of the practical

1124
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:52,260
recommendations like do the practical

1125
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:55,140
stuff first

1126
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:58,440
do the policy some balance I think but I

1127
00:51:55,140 --> 00:52:01,859
think balance definitely if you have bad

1128
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:05,369
policies I think starting by fixing

1129
00:52:01,859 --> 00:52:07,500
those is should be it one of the first

1130
00:52:05,369 --> 00:52:08,460
and foremost things that you do a lot of

1131
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,710
times people don't have time for

1132
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:12,180
policies like I said they're running

1133
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:14,940
around putting out all of these fires

1134
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:16,500
whether it's ransomware or you know not

1135
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:18,119
knowing they had an attack but their

1136
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:21,319
intellectual property just ends up

1137
00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:21,319
somewhere on the other side of the world

1138
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:28,589
policies aren't fun procedures aren't

1139
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:30,420
fun I mean there's very very few

1140
00:52:28,589 --> 00:52:33,480
percentage of people that enjoy writing

1141
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:36,000
those I'm not one of them there are a

1142
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:37,859
lot of free templates also out there

1143
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,260
online that you can just kind of

1144
00:52:37,859 --> 00:52:41,549
