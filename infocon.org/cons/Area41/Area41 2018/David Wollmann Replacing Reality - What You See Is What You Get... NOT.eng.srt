1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:08,099
welcome everyone um I just have to

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:11,519
disappoint you if you have that password

3
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:14,519
bingo cart the topic is so new the words

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,680
are not buzzwords yet so maybe next year

5
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:20,160
you will have luck with that so I'm

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,430
talking about replacing reality and at

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,279
first I want to start with the mandatory

8
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:29,009
about me stuff just really quick okay I

9
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:32,488
keep it short I'm active in IT security

10
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,590
students around 13 years and I'm working

11
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:37,250
for entity security as a hacker and

12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:40,770
social engineer and as you can imagine

13
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:43,649
before you give a presentation you

14
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:46,350
practice it with bodies and friends

15
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:49,110
co-workers and so on and one of them he

16
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:51,120
was so blasted by my talk in my

17
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,489
presentation he said hey you know what I

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,500
will give you a short video to just

19
00:00:53,489 --> 00:01:03,718
present at the start of your talk so I

20
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:06,689
just want to show it to you really you

21
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:09,630
know oh no sound no sound there should

22
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:13,048
be some sound wait a moment

23
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:15,298
why is there no sound in the beginning I

24
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:17,400
had no picture now I don't have any

25
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,560
sound maybe it's working now let me see

26
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,770
that again

27
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,770
hold on

28
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:36,330
there's no coming up like that well or

29
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:47,720
something you see there should be some

30
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:47,720
sound no no sound that's a pity

31
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:57,169
why's Paulo Paulo refusing to play any

32
00:01:51,330 --> 00:02:01,429
sound now you should have some audio -

33
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:01,430
it's a party although I want to show

34
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:05,780
anyone got an idea

35
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:16,140
no ok I'll just keep on he would have

36
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:22,260
you would have heard Trump talking with

37
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:25,079
this voice so to keep on obviously I'm a

38
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:27,090
body of Donald Trump I try to get that

39
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,570
working in a moment to show you that

40
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:31,049
again

41
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:32,459
so the agenda for that is I want to tell

42
00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:33,060
you what a deep fake is what that word

43
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:36,650
means

44
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:40,950
a little history of what defects are or

45
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:44,070
how they came into life how they work

46
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:46,230
how defects are made just to show you

47
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:50,130
how easy it is basically then I want to

48
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:52,850
give you a live demo have a little look

49
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:56,430
into the future what might come up to us

50
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:59,670
also the impact on companies and

51
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:02,820
individuals and the solution on how to

52
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:05,309
deal with that so just really quickly

53
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:07,650
what is a deep fake if you look at

54
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,720
Wikipedia deep fake is just a

55
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:13,320
combination of the words deep learning

56
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:15,150
and fake so you create with an

57
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,280
artificial intelligence that's where you

58
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:21,560
can just cross off that word on to

59
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:25,110
Europe on your bus bingo card we

60
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:29,390
changing replacing information in media

61
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:29,390
files like swapping faces into videos

62
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:36,030
you have a look at

63
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:39,899
how that all came into life how it

64
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:42,090
developed well in the first place it was

65
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,650
created out of curiosity how many things

66
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:46,769
were created

67
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:49,349
people were just curious how do deep

68
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:51,269
learning work and how can we do that

69
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:54,290
just as a little programming exercise

70
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:57,060
maybe on how to create stuff and

71
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:59,700
multiple projects were created and

72
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:02,010
they're also published on github a lot

73
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:05,578
of them as open source you get some cold

74
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:08,069
source projects for that and well it's

75
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:09,810
freely available in the past when you

76
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:12,420
looked at swapping faces especially

77
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:14,519
faces in videos you had to go to

78
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,978
Hollywood's into the big movie studios

79
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:18,600
and they had to have the specialists

80
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:21,949
they had to have the equipment they had

81
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:26,060
to have all different kinds of stuff and

82
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:30,600
now they don't need that anymore because

83
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:33,690
here it costs a lot of money but in the

84
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:37,710
year 2017 it started with the neural

85
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:42,780
networks was deep learning on on how to

86
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:46,380
do that on basically any machine as a

87
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:48,359
little trivia maybe you knew that

88
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,039
already but did you know that Nicholas

89
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,930
Cage is the actor with the most

90
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:53,849
appearances in Hollywood movies if you

91
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:56,639
didn't know that now you know it

92
00:04:53,849 --> 00:04:59,130
I guess you at least know the movie face

93
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,410
off of him where his face is swapped

94
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:04,200
with one of John Travolta and like

95
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:08,419
that's a story behind that but that

96
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:11,460
might be the reason why he was used and

97
00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:14,010
maybe some of you have seen the newer

98
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:17,489
Superman movie did anyone see that movie

99
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:20,099
the newer Superman movie no one okay but

100
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:23,190
Nicholas Cage played had a role in there

101
00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:28,919
and I just want to show you which role

102
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:33,060
he played he didn't play Superman but if

103
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:37,169
you wait a moment actually he played

104
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:40,110
Lois Lane or it seems like so there was

105
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:42,120
just like that's the deep fake where his

106
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:44,880
face was put into another movie and

107
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,930
there are several out there just you

108
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:52,300
know to show the face of effect

109
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:55,030
him but another person for instance they

110
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:57,910
thought about like with the newest Davos

111
00:05:55,030 --> 00:06:00,489
movies they had to put Princess Leia in

112
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:02,169
there and some of you might know the

113
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:04,750
actress who played Princess Leia Carrie

114
00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:07,120
Fisher died before the movie so they had

115
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:10,360
to spend a lot of money to put her face

116
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:13,120
into that movie again and another person

117
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,039
thought why not just use a deep fake

118
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,070
application of face Wapping application

119
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:20,740
to just show what it's capable of so

120
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:23,979
here you see a side by side or top by

121
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:26,199
bottom comparison the upper movie is the

122
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:31,469
original one the lower one in the bottom

123
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:31,470
is a deep fake so if you look at that

124
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,940
you might notice a little bit of

125
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:38,859
difference but it's not that you can

126
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:43,570
recognize one was made in Hollywood and

127
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:47,710
the other was not in the end so that is

128
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:49,509
where the curiosity part came into play

129
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:52,659
and where people were just initially

130
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:55,180
doing that but then maybe you have heard

131
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:59,440
about deep fakes because it had some

132
00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:01,180
well bad press that media coverage I'm

133
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,159
not sure if you can read everything you

134
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:05,740
don't have to read all the references in

135
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:09,400
Wikipedia here I just put it there but

136
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:13,030
most of them are about fake porn where

137
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:15,820
faces of Hollywood actresses or singers

138
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:18,369
were put into adult movies or revenge

139
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:21,490
porn so that was at the beginning of the

140
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:25,270
year where that topic got some media

141
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:27,759
coverage at least but it pretty quickly

142
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:31,690
disappeared again from from media and

143
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:34,389
from from new sites and so on so that is

144
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:37,900
just the little history that you know

145
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:41,050
where it comes from so onto the topic

146
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:43,960
how do they work I will go into the

147
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:47,409
theory of how videotape fair deep fakes

148
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:51,969
work in the first place I try to not go

149
00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:54,190
into too much detail but I want to show

150
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:56,469
you basically how machine learning works

151
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:57,760
for instance some of you might have seen

152
00:07:56,469 --> 00:08:00,520
something like that which is a

153
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:03,039
representation of it

154
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,560
machine which is learning something to

155
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:07,750
keep it not too abstract just imagine

156
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,880
you want to have another artificial

157
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:13,450
intelligence which is learning to

158
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:15,969
predict tomorrow's temperature okay so

159
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:18,370
on the one hand you have the input layer

160
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:20,830
with several notes where you just put

161
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:22,930
several information into like today's

162
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:25,479
temperature today's humidity today's

163
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:27,400
probability of rain then you have some

164
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:31,950
hidden layers with nodes everything is a

165
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:33,819
node like each circle and it does some

166
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:36,130
calculations basically and you get a

167
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:38,350
single output where it says tomorrow it

168
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:41,439
will be like 20 degrees Celsius I guess

169
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:44,560
so in order for an artificial

170
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,380
intelligence to learn how or which

171
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,719
result it should be put out you have to

172
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:52,900
train it and you take a lot of data and

173
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:54,730
you feed it to that machine and for

174
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:57,630
instance you take the weather data of

175
00:08:54,730 --> 00:09:01,270
the last hundred years where you know

176
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:03,160
what the input variables are basically

177
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:05,530
what is put into the into input nodes

178
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,839
and you know all through the next day's

179
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:10,540
weather so what the artificial

180
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:12,280
intelligence is doing its learning in

181
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:14,170
the hidden layers how to put the weight

182
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:17,050
on the edges to achieve these results

183
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:19,930
and once you've trained that for a long

184
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:22,689
time or quite some time you will be able

185
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:25,020
to predict or it might be able to

186
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:28,390
predict the weather of the next day that

187
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:30,970
will not help for swapping faces and

188
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:33,880
videos but that's just the general thing

189
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:36,520
what you're using for swapping faces and

190
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:38,640
videos are so-called auto-encoders so

191
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:42,340
that are a little different and

192
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,900
basically their functionality is pretty

193
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:46,270
useless in the beginning if you look at

194
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:49,930
it because what they should do is they

195
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:54,699
should map or take the input nodes each

196
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:56,979
and one of them and basically just put

197
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:59,800
them out again that's the same so if you

198
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:03,010
have say the one in the the first input

199
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:07,689
node their output node should just be

200
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:10,840
one again so how does it help um if you

201
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:13,279
think about images they're just a lot of

202
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:16,069
pixels yeah say

203
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,749
you have a 256 by 256 picture and that

204
00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:19,910
just consists of pixels if you want to

205
00:10:17,749 --> 00:10:21,680
reproduce that image you have to have

206
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,300
not a single output note but you have to

207
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,329
have the same amount of pixels being put

208
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:28,579
out if you look at that right now with

209
00:10:26,329 --> 00:10:31,219
the same amount of nodes in the hidden

210
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:33,229
layers as the input and output layers we

211
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:35,300
might face an issue which is looking

212
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:38,569
like that the machine might learn to

213
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:40,910
just put every note directly out again

214
00:10:38,569 --> 00:10:44,329
and not do any calculations in between

215
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:47,149
in order to prevent that that Auto

216
00:10:44,329 --> 00:10:50,870
encoding is used so you reduce a number

217
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:53,569
of nodes in between basically to just

218
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:55,459
say it simply you have one part the red

219
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:58,128
one is in so-called encoder where you

220
00:10:55,459 --> 00:11:00,979
compress the information to a certain

221
00:10:58,129 --> 00:11:02,779
degree and then you have a decoder which

222
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:05,660
learns to take that compressed

223
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:11,540
information and recreate the original

224
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:13,850
image or whatever you have to show it a

225
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:16,670
little better for images just go ahead

226
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:18,350
and here you can see you have an

227
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:21,079
original image you have the encoder

228
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:23,930
which is creating a so-called latin face

229
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:25,969
there's the the compressed version of

230
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:27,920
that image and then you have a decoder

231
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:31,189
which is reconstructing the face the

232
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:33,439
original image how do we face what now

233
00:11:31,189 --> 00:11:37,009
pretty easy we just create two of them

234
00:11:33,439 --> 00:11:39,740
like you train one of these autoencoders

235
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:43,519
for face a and one of their encoders or

236
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:47,089
machines for face B and initially they

237
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:50,689
just learn to reconstruct the same

238
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:54,069
picture or the same face but the trick

239
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:57,500
is easy you just swap the decoders so

240
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:59,779
you can just say okay we are encoding

241
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,490
each face and then we're just swapping

242
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:02,059
the encoders so if you cannot see it in

243
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:04,309
the back

244
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:07,790
basically original face a is a smiling

245
00:12:04,309 --> 00:12:11,179
girl and original face B is a well set

246
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:14,059
looking guy you just encode it to have

247
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:16,879
the let and face a which is smiling but

248
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:18,920
you use Dakota B to create a smiling guy

249
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:22,670
which was that in the beginning and vice

250
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:25,910
versa so that's the only magic or your

251
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:26,689
trick how that is working on a higher

252
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:31,130
and

253
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:35,140
a little abstract level going over the

254
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:38,960
theory of audio depicts um it's just

255
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:40,850
well there are several papers on how to

256
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:43,130
synthesize voice for text-to-speech

257
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:44,720
systems they are also published by

258
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,950
Google for instance they are very

259
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,320
popular

260
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:50,030
it's called taco Tron version one and

261
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,800
two they're also using it if you're

262
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:53,959
using Google home for instance or Google

263
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:56,750
Maps for finding your way around the

264
00:12:53,960 --> 00:13:00,620
voice there is using that text-to-speech

265
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:05,930
system by republish deep voice which is

266
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:10,280
also pretty well known but if we look at

267
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:17,930
the papers that's even more complex than

268
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:20,180
that image face swapping so just to put

269
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:23,420
in a nutshell basically that machine has

270
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:27,380
to learn to align spoken text inve files

271
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:29,300
to a certain text so if we look at the

272
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:31,730
requirements what is needed to train

273
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:35,500
such a machine you need at least five to

274
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:38,360
six hours of the material of a speaker

275
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:41,510
plus you need a transcript of the autumn

276
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:44,840
audio material so you need a text file

277
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:47,330
where you have everything written down

278
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:50,360
again as sentences basically so that it

279
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:52,970
can learn which spoken text is aligning

280
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:59,690
to which written text so that can

281
00:13:52,970 --> 00:14:02,270
reverse in the end good let's have a

282
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:06,890
look of how defects are made and what's

283
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:09,980
needed for that the components for a

284
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:13,610
video defect are pretty easy to show you

285
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:16,880
at first I had a webcam which was just a

286
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:20,480
regular webcam you can buy at Amazon for

287
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:22,790
instance or in any hardware store no

288
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:26,780
special requirements for that there was

289
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:29,420
a deep green screen involved and a

290
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:32,780
Nvidia graphics card in videos pretty

291
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:35,599
mandatory because you need to use CUDA

292
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:37,970
which allows you to access your graphics

293
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,130
card for programming in it not just for

294
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:43,260
gaming

295
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:46,990
if you have a short look at the costs

296
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:50,380
well a webcam runs around 80 euros the

297
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:53,110
green screen 90 euros graphics card is a

298
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:54,850
little more expensive since that's also

299
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:57,220
used for Bitcoin mining high demand

300
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:59,670
means higher prices that's why it's more

301
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:03,730
expensive than usual

302
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:05,530
ty wick and PIN ran around 30 euro and

303
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:10,270
being the president of the USA is

304
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:12,730
priceless of course and just to give you

305
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:15,310
an imagination on how that looks I have

306
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:17,140
a side by side video the right part is

307
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:21,030
me the left part is this rock fit no

308
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:24,520
sorry and what's the other way around so

309
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:26,530
you can see it's pretty much just it

310
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:29,100
learned how to replace my face with

311
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:29,100
Trump's face

312
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:42,270
and the rest is just some basic video

313
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:45,600
editing with a green screen and so on so

314
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:47,520
you can just use available software for

315
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,010
instance you can rent Adobe Creative

316
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:54,600
Cloud for 20 euros or so a month and

317
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:57,000
just use it to edit the video in order

318
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:01,500
to create an audio deep fake which I

319
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,450
will try to get running in a moment it's

320
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,940
a little different I just want to remind

321
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:08,010
you again of what is needed so we need a

322
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:13,280
model we need to Train

323
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:17,069
basically the machine to be able to yeah

324
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:19,709
learn and output the text but we need a

325
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:23,040
model for that which requires five hours

326
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:25,200
of auto material and a transcript so I

327
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:28,800
thought listening to Tramp for around

328
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:30,810
five hours at least I mean I like my I

329
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,370
really like my company and to work for

330
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:35,839
them but there are certain lights you do

331
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:39,920
not cross I mean that's just no

332
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:43,220
fortunately github came to the rescue

333
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:46,560
there is someone who published that on

334
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:54,080
yeah little it's not even a paper it's

335
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:54,079
just a little text and cue Pyong he also

336
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:59,640
created some some programs like he did

337
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:02,160
some implementations of various like of

338
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:06,410
taco tron of deep voice and DC TTS which

339
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:09,329
I used for for my text-to-speech

340
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:11,850
synchronization and he was asked very

341
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:13,889
often like how much material how much

342
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:16,409
audio source material do we need of a

343
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:18,180
speaker to train a proper model and he

344
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:20,160
got really fed up by that and then he

345
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:22,050
came up with an idea and he said why

346
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,230
don't you just take a pre train model

347
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:27,240
which can output proper voice which is

348
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:29,340
trained for instance for the English

349
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,980
language and then you just take one

350
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:34,350
minute of a speaker's material of

351
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:37,200
another speaker and you just train your

352
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:39,959
existing model with that and you will

353
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:43,040
have a model which is able to yeah

354
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:45,420
basically give out the audio and

355
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:47,460
everything of the speaker you want to

356
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:50,030
train with so I thought okay

357
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:53,000
listening to Trump for a minute and

358
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:54,410
a transcript for that I can do that and

359
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,040
that's not so bad

360
00:17:54,410 --> 00:18:02,150
okay so um that's what I did in the end

361
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:05,030
and I just took one minute of his State

362
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:08,600
of the Union speech trained my machine

363
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:11,629
for that and in like 10 to 15 minutes I

364
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:16,669
got a result which is okay and I try and

365
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:19,280
hope to have in a moment so just to show

366
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:23,180
you life how easy it is to create that

367
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:32,240
basically let me just restart this

368
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:34,700
machine here real quick I will just go

369
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,830
ahead and skip that audio part for for

370
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:44,950
now because I try to restart my

371
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:48,800
presentation laptop in a moment and

372
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:50,360
maybe I'm not sure I think most of the

373
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:55,010
you were in the keynote and you missed

374
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:55,669
Trump this morning at area 41 here yeah

375
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,860
I guess so

376
00:18:55,670 --> 00:19:05,810
so I just want to show you that real

377
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:07,840
quick because I just took a video of

378
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,840
that

379
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:27,499
so let's move that over which side isn't

380
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:27,499
here okay

381
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:34,950
so if you didn't see him that's a video

382
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:40,049
of him at the entity security booth

383
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:42,419
where he was real briefly and said hi so

384
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:45,509
um no I just want to show you basically

385
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:48,539
it's it's quite easy on the creation of

386
00:19:45,509 --> 00:19:51,210
a deep fake so I use something called

387
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:54,629
open face swap which open means you can

388
00:19:51,210 --> 00:20:03,809
just download it if you want to you have

389
00:19:54,629 --> 00:20:05,100
different settings and I was talking

390
00:20:03,809 --> 00:20:06,690
when I was talking about the machines

391
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:09,269
how they work I was always talking about

392
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:12,059
images and not videos I think you might

393
00:20:09,269 --> 00:20:14,460
remind that so in the end the video is

394
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:18,360
nothing more than a set of images just

395
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:20,399
put together into a video so in the

396
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:25,469
first place you're going ahead and just

397
00:20:20,399 --> 00:20:27,389
split a video into single pictures so

398
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:30,480
that was the video I took in the

399
00:20:27,389 --> 00:20:32,699
beginning there's me with a weak looking

400
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:37,230
something like Donald Trump but my face

401
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:39,869
obviously and then you have to align the

402
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:44,369
faces so basically what this software

403
00:20:39,869 --> 00:20:46,769
does is you take the pictures detects

404
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:50,759
where the face is and crops them out in

405
00:20:46,769 --> 00:20:53,190
a certain size because as you might have

406
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:56,249
remembered with the auto-encoders I want

407
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:58,019
to have the same number of input notes

408
00:20:56,249 --> 00:21:01,619
and the same number of output notes and

409
00:20:58,019 --> 00:21:03,990
in order to swap the images in in the

410
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:08,309
end you need to have them to be of the

411
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:10,440
same size so what it does is it just

412
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:13,850
creates you a collection of just the

413
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:17,519
faces and not the entire image so that

414
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:19,799
was my training set for for the first

415
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:22,019
part and then we do have a training set

416
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:25,710
for Trump where I just took a video of

417
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:29,480
him from YouTube and also just split

418
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:32,610
that up into several thousand images and

419
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,240
we also do have the alignment here where

420
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:36,689
you just

421
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:38,580
his face um I can go through that you

422
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:42,720
see it's just a lot of different

423
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:45,409
expressions of him so and then you go

424
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,570
ahead and let the Machine train and

425
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:53,190
create that model for that for swapping

426
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:54,570
the faces I just let that run for a

427
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:55,860
little moment in the beginning it takes

428
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:57,990
a little moment

429
00:21:55,860 --> 00:22:00,919
next time I started it will be a little

430
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:02,940
faster but just to give you an

431
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:24,060
expression of how it looks like it's

432
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:25,520
like very easy in the end so for the

433
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:27,899
ones for you who are interested in

434
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,150
what's under the hood it's just using

435
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:32,640
tensorflow I mean some of you might have

436
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:37,650
heard that and that is what it is

437
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:40,830
looking like in the beginning so here

438
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:43,140
you can see in the first column is the

439
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:46,110
original face which was extracted from

440
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:49,110
from the images so on the left half it's

441
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:52,709
the training set a and on the right half

442
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:56,090
its training set P and you you can just

443
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:58,230
guess what the next two columns are so

444
00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:00,000
you cannot see it right now

445
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:02,160
but I will show you a different set

446
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,120
where you can really see it and what it

447
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:08,760
is is that column here is just showing

448
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:12,449
where the artificial intelligence tries

449
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:15,030
to recreate the original image yeah

450
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:18,210
we're just try set but it's not working

451
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:20,940
that well and the next one or not yet

452
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:23,100
and the next one is showing like the

453
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:27,120
original image decoded with the second

454
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:32,480
decoder for the second person I just

455
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:32,479
stopped that here real quick and we'll

456
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:48,180
open the model I trained for for some

457
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:50,520
time so and if I start that you will be

458
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:52,800
able to see what it looks in the end and

459
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:55,290
I just trained that for around three

460
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:59,820
hours three and a half hours just as a

461
00:23:55,290 --> 00:24:01,560
proof of concept so for you to get an

462
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:04,740
impression how long or how short it

463
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:06,929
takes to create such a thing so here you

464
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:10,410
can see it's it's way better and you can

465
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:12,750
notice or you see what the recreated

466
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:15,690
images look like with the with the

467
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:17,760
different decoders and you see it tries

468
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:24,570
to match the facial expression as good

469
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:28,230
as it can at least good so that's

470
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:30,510
basically how video tape defects look

471
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:32,760
like it's all depending on the source

472
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:36,060
material you have in on which quality

473
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:39,590
you get so you have to of course have a

474
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:42,360
look that both facial expressions are

475
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:47,280
looking the same that they're like

476
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:50,330
similar at least but what that tool for

477
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:52,770
instance also does for you is it

478
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:55,740
automatically adjusts the color of the

479
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:58,620
skin so if you have like Trump and

480
00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:01,040
myself like my first videos I took we're

481
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:05,330
just with me without any makeup on and

482
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:09,840
that well I was a quite pale Trump but

483
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:12,480
yeah that is possible to get a seamless

484
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:17,689
integration of that target face into the

485
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:22,350
original video if you want to okay

486
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:23,730
so let's have a look at what's next and

487
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:27,270
what the next steps might be in the

488
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:28,830
future unfortunately in the sound

489
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:30,300
doesn't work I will just go through the

490
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:32,850
presentation and I will restart the

491
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:35,550
laptop and try to get the audio part to

492
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:39,510
show you about the audio part again so

493
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:43,470
please bear with me what you will hear

494
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:46,550
is that the audio well the one I pray

495
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:49,260
created as a proof of concept

496
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:51,690
you still hear some echo you hear some

497
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:54,629
artifacts in there but what I have here

498
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:57,150
are audio samples from from Google's

499
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:58,530
techo Tron team and I tell you you will

500
00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:00,990
not be able to say these are

501
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:03,210
artificially generated but they sound

502
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:05,580
like a real person and it's the same

503
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:08,820
sentences just sounding totally

504
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:10,590
different so what can we expect well the

505
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:14,490
technology will be used by the good and

506
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:17,909
the bad guys likewise by the good guys

507
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:20,610
sure for entertainment purposes maybe or

508
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:22,830
so or just for research for the bad guys

509
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:26,580
well let's have a look at the impact on

510
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:29,129
us and what that could mean for us I

511
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:31,860
don't think there will be totally new

512
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:34,559
attacks but existing attack methods and

513
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:36,870
scenarios will be enhanced harder to

514
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:39,420
detect and easier to fall for for the

515
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:41,580
people if you think of impersonation

516
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:45,300
especially of c-level fraud see if a

517
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:48,210
fraud where some people employees

518
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:50,370
received an email saying hey please send

519
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:53,670
us 10 million dollars because we want to

520
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:57,870
acquire something in China or so go

521
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:58,470
ahead well employees start to get aware

522
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:01,919
of that

523
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:05,100
but what if you get a call off your CFO

524
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:07,980
or someone who pretends to be the see if

525
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:09,659
Owen has the voice of the CFO well who

526
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:12,570
should detect that if it's good or

527
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:16,950
perfectly executed you won't stand a

528
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:18,629
chance against that and the same goes

529
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:22,290
for blackmailing for instance another

530
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:24,720
scenario we can say okay I want to

531
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:27,120
blackmail a certain individual like a

532
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,190
c-level where I assume he has a lot of

533
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,459
money or if I want just the regular

534
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:34,200
employee to plug in my USB stick or to

535
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:36,840
visit a certain side or to execute

536
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:39,720
something or to whatnot

537
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:43,610
so just think about if you receive an

538
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:46,010
email where it states hey I've seen you

539
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:48,389
being somewhere else on a business trip

540
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:50,520
visiting a different woman

541
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:52,920
for instance you don't want your wife to

542
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:55,800
see that right and you get a video where

543
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:59,570
you can see someone who's having your

544
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,570
face go into someone else

545
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:06,129
that's just one instance and just prove

546
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:08,170
that it's not you who was in the video

547
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:10,420
because if you were sent that video just

548
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:14,790
after you went on a business trip well

549
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:18,730
it's hard to prove that it's not you or

550
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:21,159
you could blackmail entire companies for

551
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:24,010
instance think about sending a company

552
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:26,230
or a company receives an email saying if

553
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:29,410
you do not want these news here that

554
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:31,150
video of your CEO declaring that you're

555
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:34,180
bankrupt or that you lost all your

556
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:36,670
customer data if you do not want that to

557
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:39,550
be sent out to news agencies and all of

558
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:44,500
you know how fast news agencies spread

559
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:49,570
news without even relying or checking if

560
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:53,320
that's true or not your stock could have

561
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:56,770
a very yeah might drop very fast if you

562
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:59,169
remember Elon Musk from Tesla his April

563
00:28:56,770 --> 00:29:02,379
Fool's joke where he declared bankruptcy

564
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:05,680
of Tesla well the the stock fell even

565
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:07,720
further than on that day so these are

566
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:11,230
just a couple of examples on how that

567
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:16,870
technology can be used in context of

568
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:20,200
security or how to attack companies so

569
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:22,239
what is the solution to that well at

570
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:26,080
first I asked my buddy Trump and he said

571
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,760
I have no clue at all so I went ahead

572
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,710
and asked another buddy of mine and I

573
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,020
thought well he's a professor maybe he

574
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:35,740
might know and well he said good news

575
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:38,200
everyone we are all doomed then I

576
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:40,300
thought okay let's think for yourself

577
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:43,870
about how that might work or what

578
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:46,480
solutions could be and in my opinion at

579
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:48,820
the moment the best protection against

580
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,530
those kinds of attacks is just to know

581
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:52,780
that they are possible at all and to

582
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:55,149
have your employees for instance in a

583
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:57,790
company to tell them that it's possible

584
00:29:55,150 --> 00:30:01,300
because if a person doesn't even know

585
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:04,600
that it's possible and just imagine a

586
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:06,940
person gets a call and you cannot create

587
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:09,580
the audio just in real time you have a

588
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:11,980
small delay but you can generate these

589
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:14,230
voice samples very fast

590
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:16,059
and if you say okay I'm going to CEO I'm

591
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:18,850
just on a business trip my reception is

592
00:30:16,059 --> 00:30:21,070
not so good I have a little delay in my

593
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:23,469
voice basically and the person doesn't

594
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:25,570
know that it might be an attack well

595
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:26,830
chances are they will do whatever the

596
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:28,840
person asks for

597
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:31,360
for example transferring some money

598
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:34,418
because it sounded like the CEO and you

599
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:37,178
cannot blame the person basically but

600
00:30:34,419 --> 00:30:39,580
knowing about that is the first step

601
00:30:37,179 --> 00:30:42,070
second one of course is use your brain

602
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:44,678
but sometimes it's hard because if it

603
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:46,299
sounds like a legitimate request well

604
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:48,850
how should you differentiate between

605
00:30:46,299 --> 00:30:51,820
that because these deep breaks will get

606
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:55,299
so good human senses will not be able to

607
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:57,189
do that then you might say hey Dave yeah

608
00:30:55,299 --> 00:30:57,760
there will be a program out there yeah

609
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:00,400
of course

610
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:02,790
on the Munich AI lab for instance there

611
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:05,740
also already researching and developing

612
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:08,340
another artificial intelligence which

613
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:11,110
should be able to detect deep fakes and

614
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:14,530
report that to to use it and say hey

615
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:16,870
this is not the real deal but we will

616
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:20,620
have another situation as with malware

617
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:23,020
and anti-malware that rat-race the

618
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:25,209
creators of defects will know how that

619
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:27,250
detection algorithms and that artificial

620
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:29,290
intelligence works they will improve

621
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:31,840
their artificial intelligence to create

622
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:36,149
deep fakes and we have that red race all

623
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:41,080
over again that's my prediction at least

624
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:43,090
so that's basically about it

625
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:45,100
at first I will just restart my machine

626
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:47,168
in a moment to give you the whole

627
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:49,139
picture and alter the output of the

628
00:31:47,169 --> 00:31:55,360
sound because it's way better with sound

629
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:57,640
any questions so far yeah let's start in

630
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,949
the back or whatever go wherever you

631
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:04,720
want the question I really stuck my my

632
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:06,870
my machine in the meantime okay yeah it

633
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,490
was a work for a previous company where

634
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:12,129
they were quite looking forward these

635
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:14,470
kind of technologies and the enforced

636
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:17,140
you know two-factor authentication for

637
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:19,240
you know for I purchase agreements and

638
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:21,909
you know for sensitive asset so for like

639
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:24,010
the executive boards and obviously

640
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:25,540
people who annoyed because you know

641
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:26,210
sometimes they do you know did you say

642
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,310
Oh any

643
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:29,690
other approved they say oh well you know

644
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:32,060
we need to do two factor authentication

645
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:34,190
of your mobile phone number but it's

646
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:35,720
always the case of what's your risk

647
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:39,110
profile you know if you if you want to

648
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:46,820
do that by guess right yeah of course

649
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:48,290
but if you look at like I mean if you

650
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:51,560
look at what you have to invest

651
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:56,000
basically and what you get out of it so

652
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:59,360
say in order to to create a good fake

653
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,370
yeah one which is really realistic you

654
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,800
don't have to invest like half a million

655
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:05,929
dollar so you can say okay you can run

656
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:09,320
it for about five or ten thousand dollar

657
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:12,380
or Euros yeah and you create a very

658
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:14,810
decent fake which is believable yeah so

659
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:17,360
if you just blackmail someone with that

660
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:21,379
for say half a million or a million you

661
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:24,020
have a good return of invest so it will

662
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:27,260
just make it harder in and harder to

663
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:29,450
detect and I mean we all know you know I

664
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:30,830
know that there's no patch for human

665
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:33,580
stupidity I wouldn't even call it

666
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:36,290
stupidity but the thing is it's just

667
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:38,179
developing so much we have so many new

668
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:40,490
technologies and how should you keep up

669
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:44,830
with that if you're not working in in

670
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:48,290
the IT branch and or in the sector so

671
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:51,770
yeah it's it's really hard to detect

672
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:54,020
that and the the invest to have

673
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:56,240
something like that it isn't so high I

674
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:58,460
mean a lot of people already do own a

675
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:01,250
graphics card or maybe you might have

676
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:03,530
the machine for cracking cracking hashes

677
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:05,360
or so you can use the exact same machine

678
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:08,270
because it's just Python scripts in the

679
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:11,270
end which you can run in you said to to

680
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:13,489
swap faces yeah yeah I mean my point was

681
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:15,440
more that it's kind of you know if you

682
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:17,359
use multiple factors indication would be

683
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,400
to defend as well right because it's not

684
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:24,410
you know unique you don't need to invest

685
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:25,700
a lot in a mobile app with the point

686
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:27,589
even if you have multi-factor

687
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:30,409
authentication or if you add technical

688
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:33,320
layers but as long as you can win can

689
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:35,569
convince a person who has the access

690
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:37,460
rights and that's what you are attacking

691
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:39,679
with these kind of attack scenarios

692
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:41,389
you're not looking to exploit any tech

693
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:44,869
Nicolle flaw but you're trying to

694
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:47,510
exploit a person who has legitimate

695
00:34:44,869 --> 00:34:49,970
access to certain data or something you

696
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:53,389
try to to get a hold of as an attacker

697
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:55,189
and you will not have anything like even

698
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:57,109
with a - or a multi-factor

699
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:59,869
authentication or whatnot you you

700
00:34:57,109 --> 00:35:03,049
implement you will always face the risk

701
00:34:59,869 --> 00:35:05,420
and the problem that you have a user who

702
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:10,630
has a right and who should be able to

703
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:15,550
work with that data and so that is yeah

704
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:15,550
that's the issue there yeah okay okay

705
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:29,540
couldn't you establish something like a

706
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:32,079
protocol over voice so that the CEO that

707
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:35,109
cause actually has to authorize by a

708
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:39,490
code word or something so that an

709
00:35:35,109 --> 00:35:42,140
attacker might not know this password I

710
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:45,379
was having conversation earlier today

711
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:47,900
and there was something like how about

712
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:50,510
you put a watermark in there like

713
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:53,990
something hidden which you can not see

714
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:55,730
or hear by yourself but then but you

715
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:59,270
also have to have any means of detection

716
00:35:55,730 --> 00:36:01,880
of that for instance the secretary

717
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:03,980
whatever who's called she would have to

718
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:07,430
have something to detect that in real

719
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:09,190
life or in real time basically and even

720
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:12,109
if you implement something like that

721
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:14,150
what prevents attackers from then going

722
00:36:12,109 --> 00:36:18,799
ahead and also finding out about that

723
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:20,900
yeah I mean it might make it harder but

724
00:36:18,799 --> 00:36:22,670
I don't believe that like a solution

725
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:24,740
which can prevent it in the end it just

726
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:26,569
makes it harder as with like

727
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:28,520
anti-malware products or so it usually

728
00:36:26,569 --> 00:36:31,730
just makes it harder for an attacker but

729
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:35,089
it's not like really ruling it out

730
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:41,720
entirely before the next question let me

731
00:36:35,089 --> 00:36:45,500
just drive now the sound works nope

732
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:50,330
what what's what's wrong I don't I don't

733
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:54,940
know so we continue with the questions

734
00:36:50,330 --> 00:37:02,480
oh it is over there

735
00:36:54,940 --> 00:37:05,780
yeah should be you know what I have to

736
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:07,430
unplug the might sound strange but we

737
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:10,370
give it a try because it was working

738
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:25,509
when we tried it out with sound I just

739
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:35,480
do unplug the you have some sound now we

740
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:39,350
okay yeah over DisplayPort though yeah

741
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:42,680
let me just I mean you know the video by

742
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:51,700
now so on just just listen to how it

743
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:55,480
would sound like that oh wait that's a

744
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:55,480
wrong presentation

745
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:08,180
ladies and gentlemen I want to welcome

746
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:12,299
you to area for you

747
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:17,209
Switzerland have fun with my friend

748
00:38:12,299 --> 00:38:18,630
Dave's present age replacing reality

749
00:38:17,209 --> 00:38:21,029
house

750
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:24,599
yeah so now you know what I meant with

751
00:38:21,029 --> 00:38:28,519
the echo and the artifacts in there yeah

752
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:31,309
that's just because that publicly

753
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:33,868
publicly available samples or

754
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:36,420
implementations of these papers are not

755
00:38:33,869 --> 00:38:40,259
as far as once for instance of Google's

756
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:42,239
taco Tron group and here the other

757
00:38:40,259 --> 00:38:47,489
samples I want to show you how it can

758
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:49,739
sound like well into a moth-eaten chair

759
00:38:47,489 --> 00:38:51,150
next to the desk there was only one

760
00:38:49,739 --> 00:38:55,579
thing on it apart from his half

761
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:55,579
completed form a large glossy purple

762
00:38:55,999 --> 00:39:00,718
thinking that he should probably wait

763
00:38:58,499 --> 00:39:03,089
for Phillips to come back hairy sank

764
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:06,839
into a moth-eaten chair next to the desk

765
00:39:03,089 --> 00:39:08,459
there was thinking that he should

766
00:39:06,839 --> 00:39:10,650
probably wait for Phil to come back

767
00:39:08,459 --> 00:39:12,839
Harry sank into a moth-eaten chair next

768
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:16,349
to the desk there was only one thing on

769
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:17,999
it apart thinking that he should

770
00:39:16,349 --> 00:39:20,190
probably wait for folks to come back

771
00:39:17,999 --> 00:39:21,089
Harry sank into a moth-eaten chair next

772
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:24,029
to the desk

773
00:39:21,089 --> 00:39:26,308
hey so these were the same sentences

774
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:28,319
just through size was different voices

775
00:39:26,309 --> 00:39:30,869
but they are all artificially generated

776
00:39:28,319 --> 00:39:33,180
just to give you an impression on how it

777
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:35,309
can already sound like that it's not

778
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:37,410
like my proof of concept I didn't spend

779
00:39:35,309 --> 00:39:40,699
too much time on that you can optimize

780
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:42,868
that and doesn't take forever but

781
00:39:40,699 --> 00:39:44,819
basically just to give you an impression

782
00:39:42,869 --> 00:39:46,940
it's not always to have these artifacts

783
00:39:44,819 --> 00:39:49,829
in there but even with a good pretext

784
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:51,809
you could get something which people

785
00:39:49,829 --> 00:39:53,430
believe if you say hey I'm just having a

786
00:39:51,809 --> 00:39:55,680
bad reception here and that's why I

787
00:39:53,430 --> 00:40:00,299
sounded a little bit off I mean you

788
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:02,999
might know like how people sound down so

789
00:40:00,299 --> 00:40:08,910
yeah that was for the audio part so we

790
00:40:02,999 --> 00:40:10,738
had another question do you do you think

791
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:12,859
with enough training we will be able to

792
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:16,700
bypass biometric voice

793
00:40:12,859 --> 00:40:20,390
system with deep break might be possible

794
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:23,328
yeah I didn't try it out myself yet but

795
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:25,400
that's something where it's depending

796
00:40:23,329 --> 00:40:30,039
how good the the detection system will

797
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:30,039
be but you might be able to do that yeah

798
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:39,799
okay you know the question how does the

799
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:42,470
space mop work with facial hair and did

800
00:40:39,799 --> 00:40:44,809
you save just for the demo yes that's

801
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:47,749
why I want to say initially usually I

802
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:50,690
wear I have a parrot longer one but I

803
00:40:47,749 --> 00:40:51,649
shaved exactly for that because if

804
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:53,630
you're having a beard

805
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:55,430
it doesn't really detect it or swap it

806
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:59,930
that well yet I mean they might

807
00:40:55,430 --> 00:41:02,529
implement something but as I mentioned

808
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:04,999
in order to achieve the best results you

809
00:41:02,529 --> 00:41:08,960
basically should take your similar look

810
00:41:04,999 --> 00:41:13,339
in person like me and swapping myself

811
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:16,730
with I don't know Obama for instance

812
00:41:13,339 --> 00:41:18,859
that wouldn't work that well but if you

813
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:20,720
go ahead and look onto YouTube you will

814
00:41:18,859 --> 00:41:23,749
find a video where Obama is talking

815
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:25,459
smack about Trump and after a couple of

816
00:41:23,749 --> 00:41:27,980
seconds they show a side-by-side way

817
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:31,130
they have a different actor who's also

818
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:33,109
black but he's just where you can see

819
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:37,220
where like the one I showed you was my

820
00:41:33,109 --> 00:41:40,670
side-by-side comparison and basically

821
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:43,819
yeah it's just it will be very very hard

822
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:48,619
to detect that in the future and yes I

823
00:41:43,819 --> 00:41:56,589
shave for that for that reason other

824
00:41:48,619 --> 00:41:56,589
questions other questions yeah here one

825
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:03,259
taking this to the extreme two weeks ago

826
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:05,539
federal government proposed the draft

827
00:42:03,259 --> 00:42:07,759
law on Iran ik electronic IDs in

828
00:42:05,539 --> 00:42:10,029
Switzerland and they would imply that

829
00:42:07,759 --> 00:42:12,079
for a strong electronic identification

830
00:42:10,029 --> 00:42:16,970
you will need two factor authentication

831
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:22,680
and one of them needs to be biometric

832
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:25,200
so are we on the wrong track here well I

833
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:29,149
mean the thing is I'm not sure where

834
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:31,799
exactly but they required you for for

835
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:35,339
something online if you register to

836
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:37,200
basically show your ID card you know

837
00:42:35,339 --> 00:42:41,009
just and they would recognize the ID

838
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:43,560
card in your face but yeah in the

839
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:46,650
extreme you could just fake it and the

840
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:49,710
thing is what I read from one of the the

841
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:53,099
German news portals they didn't report

842
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:54,750
about fake porn for there that was cool

843
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:57,750
net was a little different topic but

844
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:59,579
they said in the future we will have to

845
00:42:57,750 --> 00:43:02,579
deal with that there's a different

846
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:06,900
reality which is not our personal one if

847
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:09,510
we act in person but online I mean you

848
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:12,060
all know never trust anyone to be what

849
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:16,349
they pretend to be online but that makes

850
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:19,078
it even harder now and yeah with I mean

851
00:43:16,349 --> 00:43:21,630
it's the question is biometric

852
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:26,339
authentication which is not having you

853
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:29,550
there in person really working and I bet

854
00:43:26,339 --> 00:43:31,950
no it won't because with technology like

855
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:34,349
that which everyone can use it's not

856
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:37,169
that you have to invest thousands of the

857
00:43:34,349 --> 00:43:39,150
light even I mean a lot of younger guys

858
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:41,430
you don't even need the latest and

859
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:43,380
videographic skyress oh but you should

860
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:47,368
have a quite decent video memory on

861
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:50,069
there to to have multiple layers to for

862
00:43:47,369 --> 00:43:54,000
that machine to learn but anyway you can

863
00:43:50,069 --> 00:43:58,500
just do it at home with next to no cost

864
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:01,430
and we have to think about how will we

865
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:04,200
deal with that in the future and I

866
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:07,230
cannot give you a solution or a perfect

867
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:09,509
answer for that what I can do or what

868
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:12,660
our accompany can do for instance is

869
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:14,730
giving security trainings or attacks

870
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:17,220
just showing people that it's possible

871
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:19,230
that there they are at least aware of

872
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:21,450
the fact that what is possible right now

873
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:24,569
it's no Hollywood movie anymore or any

874
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:26,399
any serious where it looks like it's

875
00:44:24,569 --> 00:44:28,710
it's science fiction or so it's just

876
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:33,330
starting to get real

877
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:35,609
and a prediction might be that next year

878
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:37,680
you can read on the the bus word bingo

879
00:44:35,609 --> 00:44:39,720
so you can read deep fakes too or

880
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,790
something like that but because that is

881
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:44,029
just something which will come up and

882
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:45,930
which will also have an impact because

883
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:49,800
basically you have limitless

884
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:51,868
possibilities on and these are not

885
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,790
technical and you cannot just catch a

886
00:44:51,869 --> 00:44:55,740
technical flaw to prevent it from

887
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:59,700
happening and I also had conversations

888
00:44:55,740 --> 00:45:02,310
about yeah what should a company do I

889
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:04,020
mean you cannot just tear down your

890
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:06,529
website you cannot just remove all your

891
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:10,710
on profiles on social networks

892
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:13,500
you cannot just remove your interviews

893
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:15,270
on on YouTube or wherever because you

894
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:18,750
need to do business I mean you cannot

895
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:21,630
just you know remove everything you do

896
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:24,810
in order to create new business so that

897
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:27,540
will be a challenge for for the security

898
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:30,950
sector q in order how to deal with that

899
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:33,869
and how to at least enable people to

900
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:36,419
maybe detect what's going on or that it

901
00:45:33,869 --> 00:45:40,140
might not be true but we're facing very

902
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:42,570
serious challenges with that that's my

903
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:45,210
opinion at least maybe someone else is

904
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:48,450
of different opinions of course why not

905
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:51,330
but that is just what I see in the

906
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:53,189
future coming up and a pretty big

907
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:58,560
challenge which is which is not just

908
00:45:53,190 --> 00:46:02,400
technically possible to solve at all I

909
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:06,690
mean technique or technical stuff could

910
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:09,030
help but yeah we will see how how that

911
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:14,460
develops I cannot really tell you right

912
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:22,470
now and any other questions but the

913
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:24,599
speaker use certificates to sign their

914
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:29,339
videos that we will say this is actually

915
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:32,369
a signed yeah I mean the question is

916
00:46:29,339 --> 00:46:34,290
like can we sign it or just it it goes

917
00:46:32,369 --> 00:46:37,680
into the same direction like can we

918
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:40,440
waterproof in some way our audio files

919
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:42,390
or so that it will be very hard because

920
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:44,970
you not only need to sign them

921
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:48,629
but you also need whoever's receiving

922
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:51,450
that to also be able to verify the

923
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:54,210
signature of it and if you have any news

924
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:56,129
agency who doesn't you know you know

925
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:59,490
they just want to be first to bring out

926
00:46:56,130 --> 00:47:02,309
some some very recent news or the the

927
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:04,769
latest news and they don't check the

928
00:47:02,309 --> 00:47:06,599
source at all so they just spread the

929
00:47:04,769 --> 00:47:08,819
word and other news agencies will pick

930
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:13,289
it up too without checking it and so you

931
00:47:08,819 --> 00:47:15,509
can just like create a disaster I mean

932
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:17,160
and it's it's very hard just imagine

933
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:20,579
like Trump would declare war in North

934
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:22,799
Korea for instance I mean just an

935
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:25,619
example who would know if that's real

936
00:47:22,799 --> 00:47:28,288
and we're not talking about like a

937
00:47:25,619 --> 00:47:31,019
Hollywood clip or anything but give me

938
00:47:28,289 --> 00:47:33,779
like a week of time and I would create a

939
00:47:31,019 --> 00:47:36,660
better result and which is looking so

940
00:47:33,779 --> 00:47:39,150
good that well Kim Jung might just shoot

941
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:43,049
some Rockets in America to have the

942
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:45,240
first strike and this basically is a

943
00:47:43,049 --> 00:47:51,269
very very creepy outlook to the future

944
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:53,640
in my opinion good we have maybe time

945
00:47:51,269 --> 00:48:00,089
for one more quick question is there one

946
00:47:53,640 --> 00:48:01,950
more question looks like not so thanks

947
00:48:00,089 --> 00:48:03,220
again for the talk thank you thank you

948
00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:08,519
for being here

949
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:08,519
[Applause]

950
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:15,800
you

951
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:15,799
you
