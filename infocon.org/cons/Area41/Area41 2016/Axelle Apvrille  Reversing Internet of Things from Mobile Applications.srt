1
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:15,709
yeah hi so thanks for joining<font color="#E5E5E5"> me on this</font>

2
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:18,080
talk on reversing IOT<font color="#E5E5E5"> I noticed that we</font>

3
00:00:15,709 --> 00:00:21,140
haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen that much source code yet</font>

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:25,130
so you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see some today during</font>

5
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:28,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">this session i'm working at fortinet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

6
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:33,039
work there as a security researcher and

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:36,590
mainly and trying to hunt down and seek

8
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:39,499
malware on strange platforms so strange

9
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:42,050
platformers can be embedded platforms

10
00:00:39,499 --> 00:00:46,819
Internet of Things as a matter of fact

11
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:50,589
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is part of my research there so</font>

12
00:00:46,819 --> 00:00:53,839
the usual<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff like why would be we</font>

13
00:00:50,589 --> 00:00:56,120
reversing IOT well one of the most

14
00:00:53,839 --> 00:01:00,019
obvious reasons is that there are really

15
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:03,199
lots of connected objects out there not

16
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:05,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bore you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with figures but the only</font>

17
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:08,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is really interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

18
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,660
is that there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> more connected objects</font>

19
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:15,230
than laptops right I think this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

20
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:18,500
most relevant one and of course because

21
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:22,130
there are numerous well we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> check</font>

22
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:25,010
how secure there are or how insecure the

23
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:29,810
are and as a matter of fact get prepared

24
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:33,110
to viruses that could happen or get<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto</font>

25
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:35,600
those objects exploits vulnerabilities

26
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:37,850
that kind of stuff there and actually

27
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,729
yeah that that's one of the hot

28
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:44,830
predictions<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can make is that</font>

29
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:48,560
yes one day<font color="#E5E5E5"> there will be lots of</font>

30
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:51,380
malware on internet of things right the

31
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">only issue is that i don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know exactly</font>

32
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:55,729
when the one day is there are already a

33
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:59,780
few other there but it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

34
00:01:55,730 --> 00:02:02,240
like a couple we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know how this is</font>

35
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:04,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">when this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be massive is it</font>

36
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,390
in one year and three years or more

37
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:07,390
right

38
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:17,710
so we have plenty of internet of things

39
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:20,650
that we want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look into right and if</font>

40
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:23,230
you start reversing an object well

41
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:26,080
you'll see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know if you</font>

42
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:28,570
tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually but it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult it's</font>

43
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,330
difficult because if you want to don't

44
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:33,519
to reverse a SmartWatch and you got I

45
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:35,350
don't know hours<font color="#CCCCCC"> of work on your</font>

46
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,200
SmartWatch and managed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do something</font>

47
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:40,810
well it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to work on connect</font>

48
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,549
to choose because it will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely</font>

49
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:45,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the connected shoes it's</font>

50
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:48,520
not going to work either on the now

51
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:49,989
connected doll or toothbrush as I've got

52
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:53,980
one I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a connected tooth we're</font>

53
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:56,470
here each time each time you investigate

54
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:58,750
a new product<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's you have to start</font>

55
00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:01,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">again from scratch because the hardware</font>

56
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:04,690
is different the operating systems are

57
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:07,180
different the file formats or difference

58
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:11,980
the communication protocols are

59
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:14,110
different everything is different also

60
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:18,340
sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> they they tend to be using</font>

61
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:22,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">some funky file formats or operating</font>

62
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:26,650
systems<font color="#CCCCCC"> like well there's Kentucky riots</font>

63
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:30,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">my crew see honestly who in the audience</font>

64
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:36,660
has already heard about either<font color="#CCCCCC"> contiki</font>

65
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:39,670
riots or micro see one two three four

66
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:42,040
four people and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this may be five over</font>

67
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:44,730
there now my<font color="#E5E5E5"> question to those five</font>

68
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:48,250
would be you consider yourselves as

69
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:53,320
experts in one of those just raise your

70
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:55,570
hands right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I didn't see any hands</font>

71
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:58,840
and the Sun blinds that's possible as

72
00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:01,840
well but though I have any way I approve

73
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,760
my point when you are starting to

74
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,880
reverse those objects well you're gonna

75
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,359
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> some kind of special skills those</font>

76
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:13,000
special skills are released specific and

77
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:16,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">well was it on personally I don't have</font>

78
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,298
those right and the communion cup

79
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:21,728
community for micro<font color="#E5E5E5"> c or for riot or</font>

80
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:22,799
Kentucky or whatever other operating

81
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:25,450
system there

82
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,970
well it's not so large so you're not

83
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:29,890
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get so much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information on the</font>

84
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:34,420
internet or from other people there to

85
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:36,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">help you out plenty of of stuff we'll</font>

86
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:40,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one later but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

87
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:43,780
the connected toothbrush but there's no

88
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:46,900
technical documentation at all so where

89
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:48,609
do I start right I don't have anything I

90
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:54,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a community a developer</font>

91
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:59,920
community to talk with it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult so</font>

92
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:02,620
when I say here is that well when we

93
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:05,160
don't know where<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start I think it's a</font>

94
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:08,110
good idea actually to start with

95
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:11,800
reversing the mobile applications of

96
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:14,320
those objects that usually happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

97
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,540
the connected toothbrush for instance

98
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,360
we've got a mobile<font color="#E5E5E5"> application to check</font>

99
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:21,940
how well you have brushed your teeth for

100
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">the smart glasses there you also have</font>

101
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:26,950
another mobile application to check

102
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:30,750
where are<font color="#E5E5E5"> your friends where they are</font>

103
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:34,030
running things like that when you have

104
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:35,710
webcam webcam you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile</font>

105
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:37,989
application which control the webcam

106
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:41,440
right so you often have those mobile

107
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:43,660
applications and it's easier to have to

108
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,560
inspect those because we have tools for

109
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:50,890
those we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's large community of</font>

110
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:52,690
either reversers malware analyst or

111
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:54,969
things like that people like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you</font>

112
00:05:52,690 --> 00:06:00,340
can can exchange with those people and

113
00:05:54,970 --> 00:06:02,470
get some ideas and in the worst parts if

114
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:04,000
ever when you reverse the mobile

115
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:06,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">application you don't find anything</font>

116
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,130
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really unlucky well you can still</font>

117
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:15,820
resorts to tearing down your your

118
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:19,870
hardware and looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> into it that way so</font>

119
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:22,030
we're at area 41 not gon talk too much

120
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:25,510
about the theory but rather about

121
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:29,429
practice I tried this technique on three

122
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:32,060
different connected objects so this is

123
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:37,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">the connected toothbrush</font>

124
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:40,639
I tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on smart glasses there and</font>

125
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:44,480
help safety alarm couldn't break that

126
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:50,000
one of course but we're going to try on

127
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:53,990
those so the connected toothbrush well

128
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,730
what's the goal of it well basically you

129
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:58,280
have a mobile<font color="#E5E5E5"> application which will</font>

130
00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:00,740
tell the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end user if he brushed</font>

131
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:04,880
correctly<font color="#E5E5E5"> his teeth if he brushed all</font>

132
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:09,560
his teeth<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh for parts upper down left</font>

133
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:14,540
down right upper upper teeth you also

134
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:17,630
have some challenges so it's kind of a

135
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:21,080
way to get some incentive for the people

136
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:22,960
if you brush your teeth more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than two</font>

137
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:27,050
minutes in a row you're gonna earn a

138
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:31,638
virtual star and well that will probably

139
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:35,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">make you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happy that's the goal of this</font>

140
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:37,640
toothbrush<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're right there so we'll</font>

141
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:42,049
get into reversing the mobile

142
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:45,140
applications that come with it first

143
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:48,650
thing which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is interesting to look into</font>

144
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:50,510
is the SQL tables or databases that you

145
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:53,570
might find there because this is where

146
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:55,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">all your data is located</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right so if you</font>

147
00:07:53,570 --> 00:08:00,229
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know what data is being stored</font>

148
00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:02,000
on your behalf if its private personal

149
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:05,270
sensitive in that in either way it's

150
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,370
really a good way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to check this so here</font>

151
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:10,310
it's an ID approach screenshot of the

152
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:12,680
iOS mobile application if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

153
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,750
quickly want to list all the tables that

154
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,780
you've got in the database just look<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

155
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:21,680
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> keyword primary key and you get them</font>

156
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:23,719
all I don't know if you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> read that</font>

157
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">the back end there but well you've got</font>

158
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:29,539
table for instance a brush Evans client

159
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:33,380
device discount policy insured things

160
00:08:29,539 --> 00:08:35,539
like that and if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get more</font>

161
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:39,830
details if you want for instance you get

162
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:41,809
each column of the table<font color="#E5E5E5"> well you go and</font>

163
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:43,740
inspect the code and there you look for

164
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:47,040
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> function which is called mappings</font>

165
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:48,750
and in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mappings function while you</font>

166
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> math pin we're between</font>

167
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:55,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">the column and its name so in that case</font>

168
00:08:52,140 --> 00:09:01,920
here we see first name is one of the

169
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:04,649
columns of the of the table and you can

170
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:07,560
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that on all the tables you have in</font>

171
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:10,620
the application and basically you get a

172
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:13,229
whole map of all the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have which</font>

173
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:15,779
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> stored on the on the phone so for</font>

174
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:18,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">instance we've got a table called</font>

175
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:22,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">insured's primary primary key is entered</font>

176
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:25,560

179
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:40,020
ID<font color="#E5E5E5"> sequence number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more what you can</font>

180
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:43,350
also see by looking into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the code or</font>

181
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:46,170
more exactly the disassembly is the

182
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:49,620
implementation design so then in that

183
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:53,550
case<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a look especially in the</font>

184
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:55,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">objective c segment at the end most of</font>

185
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:58,680
the time of the code and you can list

186
00:09:55,829 --> 00:10:01,319
for a given class all its methods so

187
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,839
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bt firmware updater class</font>

188
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,810
and we get all the list of methods which

189
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:11,160
are there we can also get all the

190
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:13,770
instance variables for this class and we

191
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:16,410
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the name of the variables but</font>

192
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:21,959
also their type so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really very</font>

193
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:24,569
helpful and<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that again it takes a</font>

194
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:27,180
little bit of time of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you you</font>

195
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:29,810
can reconstruct the implementation

196
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:32,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">design</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the application and and</font>

197
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:34,979
understand a little bit more how the

198
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:38,760
connected toothbrush working so what did

199
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:42,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">we learn in this case well you see here</font>

200
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:45,630
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> button left we've got a class</font>

201
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:48,209
called BTW firmware updater obviously

202
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:50,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">bluetooth firmware updater so what means</font>

203
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:53,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we can change the firmware on the</font>

204
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:56,888
toothbrush we see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this firmware is</font>

205
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:59,939
like just a sequence of bytes

206
00:10:56,889 --> 00:11:04,029
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> being sent and they just check if</font>

207
00:10:59,939 --> 00:11:07,299
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bites have been pushed to the to</font>

208
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:09,339
the connector toothbrush we see that

209
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:14,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's an over the air service for that</font>

210
00:11:09,339 --> 00:11:17,499
and over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> arikhan full point and and</font>

211
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:21,609
the other class BTW brush data which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

212
00:11:17,499 --> 00:11:23,230
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hand side there well what</font>

213
00:11:21,609 --> 00:11:27,730
you learn here is that there's an

214
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:30,459
accelerometer a gyroscope oh it's cool

215
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:32,919
we didn't even have to open it and no

216
00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:35,319
opening it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you uni always have a risk to</font>

217
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:37,149
ruin the the object we didn't even have

218
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:47,679
to do that we know a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more</font>

219
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:50,910
what's inside it so yeah well this is a

220
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:50,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit more time for a demo</font>

221
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:06,569
so this toothbrush here is answering

222
00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:09,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">well supports tube Bluetooth Low Energy</font>

223
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:14,160
so what we can do is we can scan it to

224
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:16,560
see what are all the primary services

225
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:21,770
which are open on the toothbrush and see

226
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,770
what we can possibly interact with right

227
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:31,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so there's plenty of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things there</font>

228
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:36,330
oh there's a nice smart words in the

229
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:37,680
audience that one if you want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand</font>

230
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:43,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">it over for me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hacking</font>

231
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:50,189
afterwards please do it's this one this

232
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:57,720
is my toothbrush<font color="#E5E5E5"> there right so we are</font>

233
00:12:50,190 --> 00:13:00,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to connect to the toothbrush now</font>

234
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:04,399
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> very sorry but I hate the trackpad</font>

235
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:04,399
of my laptop so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope this will work</font>

236
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:10,790
there

237
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:19,360
connect we're connected and then we can

238
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:22,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">list primary services so we've got like</font>

239
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:25,480
six different services and for those

240
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:28,060
services well it's not really don't have

241
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:30,490
much of an explanation there but you've

242
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:33,099
got the<font color="#E5E5E5"> you who I these the identifier</font>

243
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:35,200
for those services if you're a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

244
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:37,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit more accustomed to bluetooth you</font>

245
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:41,709
might know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the first three are</font>

246
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:46,209
like standard services while the other

247
00:13:41,709 --> 00:13:50,310
the bottom three are custom services

248
00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:54,399
there can also list what they call

249
00:13:50,310 --> 00:14:00,420
characteristics characteristics there we

250
00:13:54,399 --> 00:14:03,040
go and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a full list there right</font>

251
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:06,310
so you know there is plenty<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things</font>

252
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:10,029
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> interact with but honestly it's</font>

253
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:12,790
not that easy yet to know exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

254
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:15,540
service i'm gonna talk with and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

255
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:19,870
going to do that and that's where again

256
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:23,230
having a look in your favorite mobile

257
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:27,130
application is really interesting here

258
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:31,060
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of decompiler</font>

259
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:34,120
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> android application we see here</font>

260
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:37,709
sets motor speed it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is sending some</font>

261
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:41,410
information to this primary service and

262
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:44,140
this characteristic there so we know now

263
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:48,699
that this number<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is to set the</font>

264
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:51,910
motor speed of the toothbrush up here we

265
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:54,390
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this identifier here is to set</font>

266
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:57,579
the quadrant buzz the quadrant bus is

267
00:14:54,390 --> 00:15:00,250
well a buzzer that will best if you

268
00:14:57,579 --> 00:15:06,640
correctly brush all four parts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

269
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:11,500
mouth very interesting right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I built</font>

270
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:14,860
a small hacking tool that<font color="#CCCCCC"> will set on my</font>

271
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:19,300
own the motor speed for the toothbrush

272
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:27,580
right so let me

273
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:31,930
get to the right directory and there it

274
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:34,800
is it's suprising code and basically

275
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:39,219
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does is just talk to the right</font>

276
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:42,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">identifier and send it some values now</font>

277
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:45,880
i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not sending like random values</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

278
00:15:42,579 --> 00:15:48,729
checked the code and so oh this is what

279
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:51,100
I should send if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the lowest motor</font>

280
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:53,709
speed and this is the value for the

281
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:57,700
maximum<font color="#E5E5E5"> motor speed things like that and</font>

282
00:15:53,709 --> 00:16:00,550
in between I can set like intermediate

283
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:05,860
motor speeds there so where you gonna

284
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:07,959
set it to lower motor speed so to turn

285
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:10,920
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it's the big button there there's</font>

286
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:14,619
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> one button it's not very difficult</font>

287
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:21,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">and it was previously 20 on setting it</font>

288
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:21,480
to 0 now I'm sending it to full speed

289
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:30,579
its immediate swell and it works but

290
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:34,449
what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

291
00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:37,719
hand you over the juice bar and write a

292
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:41,560
short script there and have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> motor</font>

293
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:42,880
speed change a little bit every seconds

294
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,099
or something like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can see</font>

295
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:52,089
the difference for yourself while the

296
00:16:45,100 --> 00:17:00,270
program is running so oh I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think up to</font>

297
00:16:52,089 --> 00:17:00,270
200 will be oops will be far enough

298
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:11,680
first I set it to lowest speed

299
00:17:19,929 --> 00:17:24,329
then intermediate speed like

300
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:35,830
and full<font color="#E5E5E5"> speed ahead</font>

301
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:48,459
so yeah you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> have it please of course</font>

302
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,380
give it back at the end if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> press the</font>

303
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:52,390
button it will turn it off but that

304
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:55,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't matter you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can turn it off on</font>

305
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:58,120
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> again and see the difference and</font>

306
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:06,428
meanwhile it's running I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

307
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:09,520
continue the slides of course so there I

308
00:18:06,429 --> 00:18:14,880
said well you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out that way</font>

309
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:19,210
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the code what each identifier is</font>

310
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:21,640
motor spades motor speed battery level

311
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:24,070
you even have an indicator for the brush

312
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,799
color in case you have problems with

313
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:29,710
color while you can get it through

314
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:32,139
bluetooth you can get the the

315
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:35,940
accelerometer data that way as well well

316
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:39,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically lots of information from here</font>

317
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:41,620
so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end for digs this example</font>

318
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:44,559
but basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we learned pretty</font>

319
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:46,750
much through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> application we</font>

320
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:49,240
learned for instance that well we can

321
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:52,390
communicate with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the truth brush using</font>

322
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:54,700
bluetooth low energy and we know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

323
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:58,120
get the battery level how to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

324
00:18:54,700 --> 00:19:01,659
motor speed we know as well inspecting

325
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:04,330
the implementation design that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stars</font>

326
00:19:01,659 --> 00:19:07,390
the virtual stars there well they are

327
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:10,960
not stored on the toothbrush themselves

328
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:13,659
but on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> smartphone only so if you</font>

329
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,419
want to hack the virtual<font color="#E5E5E5"> rewards well</font>

330
00:19:13,659 --> 00:19:19,929
it's useless to open up the toothbrush

331
00:19:16,419 --> 00:19:23,080
that's not going to work there's also a

332
00:19:19,929 --> 00:19:27,429
list of dentists which are absolute

333
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:30,820
affiliated to the some connected program

334
00:19:27,429 --> 00:19:33,100
and well that's a list of dentists well

335
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:35,799
if you check it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up it's neither around</font>

336
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:38,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">the toothbrush nor on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the smartphone but</font>

337
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:41,020
on the remote servers of the

338
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:43,710
manufacturer so you learnt really quite

339
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,710
a couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

340
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:54,040
now this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really cool</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I have lots</font>

341
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:58,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">of fun right but especially for my</font>

342
00:19:54,040 --> 00:20:01,690
bosses or for many security people the

343
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:04,360
the immediate question is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but</font>

344
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:07,540
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> or well brings out the attackers</font>

345
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:11,500
don't care about your teeth and this is

346
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:14,320
absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> true but you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> missing the</font>

347
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:16,450
points because it's need it's not

348
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:20,049
necessary the teeth they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> after but</font>

349
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:23,380
some other things that's the toothbrush

350
00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:26,139
may carry so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me investigate a few</font>

351
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:28,540
scenarios that might be interesting for

352
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:32,500
an attacker even here<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the case of a</font>

353
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:35,490
toothbrush right first well targeted

354
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:40,660
information targeted business it

355
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:44,380
sometimes may be legal sometimes not not

356
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:48,309
legal it depends but the mere fact that

357
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:51,970
you own a toothbrush makes you like a

358
00:20:48,309 --> 00:20:54,428
wealthy high-tech end user and somebody

359
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:58,110
who cares<font color="#CCCCCC"> about his health for her</font>

360
00:20:54,429 --> 00:21:00,010
health so well we can send<font color="#E5E5E5"> you some</font>

361
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:02,799
advertisements on health plans<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

362
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:07,629
instance right there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always some</font>

363
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:11,530
information there it's also the source

364
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:17,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">for information for spyware right this</font>

365
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:21,668
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not legal another scenario well this</font>

366
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:24,280
one is for ransomware now just think if

367
00:21:21,669 --> 00:21:27,010
this toothbrush connected toothbrush is

368
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:29,260
owned by one of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> kids and so the</font>

369
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:31,540
attacker sends okay give me five bucks

370
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:34,510
or I tell your mom you're not pressure

371
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:36,668
your teeth well I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know but on my</font>

372
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:38,169
kid probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would work well he</font>

373
00:21:36,669 --> 00:21:42,190
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any pocket money so it</font>

374
00:21:38,169 --> 00:21:44,590
won't but it could so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

375
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:48,429
efficient low revenue of course in that

376
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:49,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">case because um well kids are not</font>

377
00:21:48,429 --> 00:21:52,179
probably not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have that much</font>

378
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:54,899
money but still it's something possible

379
00:21:52,179 --> 00:21:58,150
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really a very attractive</font>

380
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,610
scenario for other connected objects

381
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:05,120
other

382
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:08,899
you see the undeserved rewards I told

383
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:11,928
<font color="#E5E5E5">you they were virtual stars well it</font>

384
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:14,150
turns<font color="#CCCCCC"> out that in each cases i have</font>

385
00:22:11,929 --> 00:22:16,940
already investigated in the past

386
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:21,620
concerning<font color="#E5E5E5"> virtual rewards there are</font>

387
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:24,440
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> at some points some ways to turn</font>

388
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:27,199
the virtual rewards in something which

389
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:30,890
is cash right and when there is cash

390
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:33,590
then attackers are interested right so

391
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:35,410
this happens in the case in the

392
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:38,629
particular case of the toothbrush

393
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:41,450
there's another interest there is

394
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:44,780
insurance fraud because actually the

395
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:49,160
toothbrush is manufactured<font color="#CCCCCC"> by a dental</font>

396
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:51,410
insurance so you athletes to your dental

397
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:53,179
insurance and they hand you over this

398
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:57,710
connected to fresh along with<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

399
00:22:53,179 --> 00:22:59,450
toothpaste and they tell you well<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

400
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:03,530
you're brushing your teeth correctly or

401
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:06,350
not or whatever right and well they say

402
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:08,450
of course that if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> brush your</font>

403
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:12,139
teeth correctly it's not going to impact

404
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:13,340
how much you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay but what</font>

405
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,530
are they going to do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

406
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:18,559
information if they're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

407
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:23,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">it ask me so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> watch for this in the</font>

408
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:26,570
future and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally the toothbrush</font>

409
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:28,820
could indeed not be interesting at all

410
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:33,200
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacker but still we can be</font>

411
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:34,928
used to insect some other devices as

412
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,510
where it could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like a</font>

413
00:23:34,929 --> 00:23:42,140
transportation method for a virus<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

414
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:44,990
poor worm to go and infect some other

415
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:46,820
devices there this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something you</font>

416
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:50,120
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to watch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for in the future</font>

417
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:52,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">because especially you ask there are</font>

418
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:55,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">numerous canna connected devices out</font>

419
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:57,230
there if some of them start and begin to

420
00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:01,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">be connected and to be propagating a</font>

421
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:01,030
virus we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a real problem</font>

422
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:08,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so now let's talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about those cycling</font>

423
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,919
and running glasses

424
00:24:08,539 --> 00:24:14,090
well after<font color="#E5E5E5"> the toolkit would feel free</font>

425
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:19,100
of course to to come and see them more

426
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:21,600
yeah more closely those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> designed for</font>

427
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:25,289
cycling and running so they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font>

428
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:27,449
you at what pace you are running if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

429
00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:30,408
are heading in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right direction you</font>

430
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:33,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a small map that will display here</font>

431
00:24:30,409 --> 00:24:36,240
if you have friends nearby which are

432
00:24:33,149 --> 00:24:42,239
also running in the same direction so

433
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:45,779
yeah it's pretty cool the cool thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

434
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:49,649
a river<font color="#CCCCCC"> a reverse engineer here is that</font>

435
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:51,690
they are running Android so it's just

436
00:24:49,649 --> 00:24:55,469
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know hacking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into a smartphone</font>

437
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:58,649
I can just set here the Android and say

438
00:24:55,470 --> 00:25:02,309
okay I enable USB debugging and I can

439
00:24:58,649 --> 00:25:05,189
get Michelle on the smart glasses like

440
00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:09,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">oh I like that getting shell on smart</font>

441
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:11,519
glasses it's it's fun awesome and when

442
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:15,119
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have your shell on your glasses well</font>

443
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:17,399
you can get the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> properties so you</font>

444
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:24,029
can know for instance that it's running

445
00:25:17,399 --> 00:25:27,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">Android 4 12 you can have a look at all</font>

446
00:25:24,029 --> 00:25:29,580
the hardware which is on board you don't

447
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:31,590
you don't even have to open up glasses

448
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:33,869
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ruin</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your like well they're</font>

449
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:37,199
expensive<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you don't really want to</font>

450
00:25:33,869 --> 00:25:39,570
ruin them do you you just have to dig in

451
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">the information and look in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the files on</font>

452
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:43,499
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android file system you know there's</font>

453
00:25:41,639 --> 00:25:45,600
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> axle demeter there's a comp ass</font>

454
00:25:43,499 --> 00:25:48,990
there's a pressure sensor there's a

455
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:51,269
temperature sensor there's a special

456
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:54,210
recon instruments free full sensor it

457
00:25:51,269 --> 00:25:58,169
looks like its senses when you are like

458
00:25:54,210 --> 00:26:02,690
falling an avian line sensor things like

459
00:25:58,169 --> 00:26:06,119
that so that's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool and</font>

460
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:09,119
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> local so when some other</font>

461
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:11,459
directories so system app that's where

462
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:14,059
your system applications are stored and

463
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:17,639
while there you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see plenty of</font>

464
00:26:14,059 --> 00:26:20,720
applications that's really very

465
00:26:17,639 --> 00:26:24,840
interesting again so

466
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:27,330
let me head for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next demo oh it</font>

467
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:36,330
looks like as this one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still working</font>

468
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:42,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I'm gonna make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this bigger bigger</font>

469
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:50,189
again is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay ah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> complain if it's</font>

470
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:54,860
not right so well this is really simple

471
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:58,070
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to connect to the glasses okay</font>

472
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:58,070
they're off

473
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:21,910
there they are so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the serial</font>

474
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,909
number actually of the of the glasses

475
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:29,659
there we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm on the glasses right so</font>

476
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:31,970
I can inspect whatever directory I might

477
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:34,340
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in let's say system</font>

478
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:36,560
applications those are just the whole

479
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:41,620
list of all the system application we've

480
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:46,070
got on those glasses right so

481
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:48,169
interesting we've got applications well

482
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:50,659
of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll be reversing them of</font>

483
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:53,540
course that that's one fact but the

484
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:56,150
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that well if they have</font>

485
00:27:53,540 --> 00:28:00,440
applications on board maybe I could add

486
00:27:56,150 --> 00:28:06,620
my own applications on on the glasses

487
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:10,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">right and that's what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I did with this</font>

488
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:14,320
application there I wrote something that

489
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:17,450
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be like a very basic ransomware</font>

490
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:20,360
proof of concept it's just like toasting

491
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:22,700
a message on the on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> smart glass and</font>

492
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:24,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out whatever a message</font>

493
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:28,430
ransomware<font color="#E5E5E5"> a message it would be sending</font>

494
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:29,930
and that's all just to see if it<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

495
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:35,800
be possible to install an application

496
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:38,000
and have it interact with the glasses so

497
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:41,570
coding the application it's really

498
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:45,700
simple i'm just using the toasts classes

499
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:49,010
of androids I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> first to install</font>

500
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:51,680
the application and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I will toast</font>

501
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:56,060
this message ugly ransomware message

502
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:58,250
right and then as well I can't have you

503
00:28:56,060 --> 00:29:00,440
all of you see at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time the</font>

504
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:03,020
glasses what I'm doing is I'm capturing

505
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:06,100
the image<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you actually see here and</font>

506
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:12,860
I will display it on my<font color="#E5E5E5"> screen there and</font>

507
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:18,760
there afterwards of course so make

508
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:18,760
install it's installing it works

509
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:34,980
now toasting the message now let me make

510
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:38,130
this bigger yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so it displays</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

511
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:41,240
message that that way so what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

512
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:43,740
mean beyond this like a very simplistic

513
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:46,559
proof of concept means that you can

514
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:48,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">install and have anybody put any</font>

515
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:52,559
application he wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> on their smart</font>

516
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:55,230
glasses and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course those application</font>

517
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:59,779
may be malicious or not depending on

518
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:59,779
what which are your goals<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're right</font>

519
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:09,029
let's go back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slides so after</font>

520
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:11,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what I did of course is inspect</font>

521
00:30:09,029 --> 00:30:16,559
those system applications and that's how

522
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:19,799
I run into a dated<font color="#E5E5E5"> leach what happens is</font>

523
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:23,010
that from time to time well when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are</font>

524
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:25,190
synchronizing those smart glasses with

525
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:28,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">the remote servers they actually</font>

526
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:31,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">connects all the events which occurred</font>

527
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:33,000
like when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> started running when you</font>

528
00:30:31,019 --> 00:30:35,460
stopped when you charged started cycling

529
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,230
where you were heading<font color="#CCCCCC"> to what's the</font>

530
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:40,049
battery level where's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyst of the</font>

531
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:42,990
system logs all that stuff they<font color="#E5E5E5"> collect</font>

532
00:30:40,049 --> 00:30:45,299
that they zip it and they zip it and

533
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:47,700
protect the zip with a hard-coded

534
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:50,490
password and they send that over to

535
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:55,860
recon instruments service at the other

536
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:59,130
end now the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the information which is</font>

537
00:30:55,860 --> 00:31:02,129
being sense is parsley sensitive battery

538
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:05,070
level isn't that sensitive but perhaps

539
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:06,630
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do not want anybody to know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly</font>

540
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:09,090
when you started running when you

541
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:11,039
started cycling especially if you were

542
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:17,428
supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work right for</font>

543
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:20,789
instance so the problem here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

544
00:31:17,429 --> 00:31:23,450
information is encrypted with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

545
00:31:20,789 --> 00:31:28,169
hard-coded password which means that

546
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:31,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's totally counterproductive if you're</font>

547
00:31:28,169 --> 00:31:32,020
the standard end user and well what

548
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:34,000
happens is that

549
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:36,550
you won't be able to read your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own data</font>

550
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,980
because you don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to get that</font>

551
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:41,919
password because you're not skilled in

552
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:44,950
reverse engineering right so you won't

553
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:46,270
get it but the attacker supposedly a

554
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:48,610
little bit more skilled in reverse

555
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:51,010
engineering will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get that</font>

556
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:54,090
hard coded password without much

557
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:57,250
difficulty and<font color="#CCCCCC"> will get all your data so</font>

558
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:59,379
you're not secure you are secure against

559
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:01,750
yourself but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not against the attacker</font>

560
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:06,280
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly the opposite would like</font>

561
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:08,200
right so that's typically the kind of

562
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:11,710
information you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can sign in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end</font>

563
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:16,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">though zip so yeah it's more like here</font>

564
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:19,990
we say we saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> I stopped using the smart</font>

565
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:26,140
phone notification on the on the glasses

566
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:28,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">there of course we notified the the</font>

567
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:30,520
vulnerability to the vendor<font color="#CCCCCC"> who actually</font>

568
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:33,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a while ago when they fixed it so</font>

569
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:35,500
it's been fixed since off every although

570
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:37,900
to be honest the fixed airfix was a bit

571
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:40,720
quick because their solution was just

572
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:42,940
simply to remove the password in both

573
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:46,120
cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> but at least that way it's true</font>

574
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:49,840
it's not secure the same way<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

575
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:55,570
attacker and for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end-user a little</font>

576
00:32:49,840 --> 00:33:00,310
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> better so that's all for smart</font>

577
00:32:55,570 --> 00:33:05,740
glasses now let's head for home safety

578
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:08,350
alarm so in this home safety alarm the

579
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:10,930
the goal of course is well to protect

580
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:15,280
your house against burglars right and

581
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:18,760
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> plenty of home safety alarms now</font>

582
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:21,940
well they are controllable by SMS so

583
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:24,610
which means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you want to I don't</font>

584
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:26,740
know set the alarm for this or that zone

585
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:30,729
well you can you just have to type in

586
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:33,880
the SMS<font color="#E5E5E5"> and comply to restrict format</font>

587
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:38,410
there's and your password<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it will</font>

588
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:41,580
eventually in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end work and sets the</font>

589
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:44,620
alarm on or off depending what you want

590
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:45,399
because the<font color="#CCCCCC"> format's the format for the</font>

591
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:50,199
SMS is

592
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:52,720
really like very strict if you forget<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

593
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:55,690
semicolon<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not going to work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

594
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:57,310
instance because it's very strict the

595
00:33:55,690 --> 00:34:01,540
manufacturer thought it would be a good

596
00:33:57,310 --> 00:34:04,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea to to implement an Android</font>

597
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:06,940
application and make it more kind of

598
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:09,940
usable and in that case while you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

599
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:12,550
like press on the red button there if

600
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:15,040
you want your house secure and or on the

601
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:18,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">green</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> button if you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to enter and</font>

602
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:20,800
have no problems for instance so that's

603
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:25,690
what they<font color="#E5E5E5"> did and indeed it's for more</font>

604
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:31,120
easy to<font color="#CCCCCC"> control that way but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

605
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:33,610
it there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one problem at least well if</font>

606
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:36,580
you go and look in the outbox on the

607
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:40,960
smartphone what happens is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

608
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:46,360
actually see your SMS the SMS to the mat

609
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:50,168
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the home safety alarm and those</font>

610
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:53,190
SMS have your password and the phone

611
00:34:50,168 --> 00:34:56,889
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the alarm so if an attacker</font>

612
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:58,990
gets those SMS well thats attacker can

613
00:34:56,889 --> 00:35:01,569
basically control your home alarm

614
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:03,939
without any problem it's just remotely

615
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:05,650
they can set it on set it off do

616
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:11,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever they like with its they've got</font>

617
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:16,330
full control now let's suppose you are

618
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:19,900
wise and knowing this you erase the the

619
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:22,210
SMS from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> outbox right well still</font>

620
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:24,700
there is a slight risk but it's because

621
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:28,120
if you have a malware on your android

622
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:29,770
phone it's quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy for many Android</font>

623
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:32,770
malware we've already seen that that

624
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:34,270
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> grab the SMS actually before you</font>

625
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:36,940
actually see it so they could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

626
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:38,770
removing it themselves and reading it so

627
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:41,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's still</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> risk let's say you're</font>

628
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:45,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">not infected and you manually erase the</font>

629
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:49,540
SMS so that you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that risk at</font>

630
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:54,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">least well I inspected the application</font>

631
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:57,009
and for the application to to work of

632
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:58,840
course you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to provide at first</font>

633
00:35:57,010 --> 00:36:02,650
while the phone number of your

634
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:05,350
arm the password and some various

635
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:09,190
headings<font color="#E5E5E5"> rights and all those very</font>

636
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:12,870
sensitive settings are stored in a file

637
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:15,970
which is protected with poor

638
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:18,160
cryptography right<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand made</font>

639
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:20,049
cryptography I'm not even sure we could

640
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:23,710
call it crypto actually because really

641
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:26,440
it's so poor but well so it's extremely

642
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:29,080
simple just you're reading the source

643
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:32,830
code<font color="#E5E5E5"> there afterwards the disassembly to</font>

644
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:34,720
work out how to recover the<font color="#E5E5E5"> password and</font>

645
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:37,480
the phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> number and all the sensitive</font>

646
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:41,529
data from from that that's what I did

647
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:43,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">but it's really not I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not a genius</font>

648
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:57,630
there it's really kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of simple I'm</font>

649
00:36:43,750 --> 00:37:03,340
going to show you so yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's some</font>

650
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:04,840
that's the settings of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the alarm perhaps</font>

651
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:10,170
a little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a better to read</font>

652
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:10,170
like that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of encrypted and</font>

653
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:17,380
using this standalone program we're

654
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:23,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to decrypt and we get the phone</font>

655
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:25,570
number of the alarm the<font color="#E5E5E5"> password the</font>

656
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:27,970
delay before it gets sets<font color="#E5E5E5"> off the</font>

657
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:31,990
emergency phone to call if somebody

658
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:34,870
enters all the settings for them for

659
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:38,430
their home safety alarm right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's</font>

660
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:38,430
extremely quick to do

661
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:48,040
so grab somewhere

662
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:58,510
what happens here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that actually the</font>

663
00:37:55,180 --> 00:38:01,629
mobile application<font color="#CCCCCC"> is counterproductive</font>

664
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:03,940
in terms of securely if you are not

665
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:07,990
using the mobile application<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

666
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:11,500
one security issue the SMS in the outbox

667
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:16,180
if you are using the application you

668
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:19,330
have two security issues d SMS in the

669
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:22,330
outbox and the fact that the all the

670
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:25,509
credentials are<font color="#E5E5E5"> weakly protected in that</font>

671
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:27,520
parameters file right so while the

672
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:32,230
conclusion is really simple there don't

673
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:34,480
use this application right yeah by the

674
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:41,830
way we notified the vendor and we had no

675
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:44,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">answer at all so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you hopefully</font>

676
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:47,700
got the message if you want to do some

677
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:51,670
reversing on internet of things well

678
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:53,589
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's useful do try and get the</font>

679
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:57,430
mobile<font color="#CCCCCC"> application and do try and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

680
00:38:53,590 --> 00:39:00,340
some hints from there right and then

681
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:03,190
after that<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least you will probably</font>

682
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:05,170
have learned much from there and you

683
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:09,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">will be do some wiser hacking on the</font>

684
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:12,460
hardware or<font color="#E5E5E5"> sniff the communication</font>

685
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:17,680
protocols in a wiser way that should

686
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:19,870
really help you out in three cases I've

687
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,120
shown today it proved that to be really

688
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:25,810
useful we<font color="#CCCCCC"> identified from their</font>

689
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:29,950
abilities that way we understand how to

690
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:32,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">communicate with some of the devices we</font>

691
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:35,109
know what is in the hardware sometimes

692
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:37,690
we even know the the brown and does it

693
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:41,550
precise a chip modal for what is inside

694
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:47,290
without even having to open the device

695
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:51,160
so it's really useful and if you're an

696
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:55,779
IOT venner all you perhaps wonder well

697
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:58,089
what can I do about about that well

698
00:39:55,780 --> 00:40:01,690
let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> start with what you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

699
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:04,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing first is don't underestimate your</font>

700
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:06,400
device so don't

701
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:09,680
that there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing interesting</font>

702
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,720
interesting on your device because an

703
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,759
attacker has different goals than you

704
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:16,490
have right so it's not because it's not

705
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,710
interesting to you or not interesting to

706
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:22,009
normal people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not interesting</font>

707
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:24,770
to you an attacker the other thing also

708
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:28,940
is I<font color="#CCCCCC"> feared</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at some time that's</font>

709
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:31,850
presenting some talk like that about the

710
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:35,150
use of reversing mobile code would bring

711
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:36,589
vendors and saying okay well now that's

712
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:40,760
what I'm going to do I'm going to

713
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:43,130
obfuscate my coat well let me say it if

714
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:45,200
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it if you do only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that at least</font>

715
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:48,530
it's plainly stupid of course because

716
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:50,750
there has been much documentation about

717
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:54,260
that but security through obscurity has

718
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:56,960
never worked we all know that what you

719
00:40:54,260 --> 00:41:00,050
can do if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do it at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> least is rather</font>

720
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:02,540
do the other parts is really integrate

721
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:04,460
the security from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the beginning because</font>

722
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:07,070
it's easier if you do it from the

723
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:10,040
beginning<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you just have to catch up</font>

724
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:13,430
and put some security on something where

725
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:17,690
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> hasn't been intended to go and also</font>

726
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:20,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you have designs some connected</font>

727
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:22,160
object well do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think about the</font>

728
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:24,290
security of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile application I</font>

729
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:27,970
mean the case for that home safety alarm

730
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:30,950
this is a well this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really alarming</font>

731
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:33,020
they are breaking the security of this

732
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:36,189
home safety alarm just with one mobile

733
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:38,630
application that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really poor right and</font>

734
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:41,270
then of course while you can of course

735
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:44,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">get some help from security researchers</font>

736
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:46,040
or you consider your open sourcing the

737
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:48,860
code so that you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> some other help</font>

738
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:50,810
from other people in the community we

739
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:53,000
will inspect the code or tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh</font>

740
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:58,190
this is good this is bad you'll get some

741
00:41:53,000 --> 00:42:00,830
feedback at lake at least and yeah by

742
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:03,500
the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thanked well for this so the</font>

743
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:06,020
toothbrush is manufactured by beam

744
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:09,920
technologies and they provided me with a

745
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:11,509
free test account with the toothbrush to

746
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,880
be honest when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I bought the toothbrush I</font>

747
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:15,830
thought it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> work straight over but</font>

748
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:18,560
it did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not so I had to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that free</font>

749
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:21,230
account to at least be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

750
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:23,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with a toothbrush</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and recon</font>

751
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:25,100
instruments is manufacturing those

752
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:27,140
glasses and again yeah I thank them as

753
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:30,770
well for being really<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have very</font>

754
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:35,200
responses to vulnerabilities I send them

755
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:38,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">over so that that's good work here</font>

756
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:43,399
finally before I finish and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you perhaps</font>

757
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:46,879
have a few questions there is a quiz at

758
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:50,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">40</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nights booths which is like across</font>

759
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:52,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wall over there with some nice</font>

760
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:56,930
prizes to do in like looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a drone</font>

761
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:59,169
to me might not sure but that's

762
00:42:56,930 --> 00:43:01,609
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure you'll be able to</font>

763
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:04,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">flash the QR code from there but you've</font>

764
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:09,200
got at least the the tinyurl so maybe

765
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:11,900
that will work<font color="#CCCCCC"> out and well that's about</font>

766
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:15,339
all but if you do have questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

767
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:15,340
ready to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> man of course</font>

768
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:32,090
hi I have a question regarding the data

769
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:34,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">wicked scenario on the Recon glasses you</font>

770
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:35,960
said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was an HTTP s request</font>

771
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:38,540
made to the back end with the

772
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:43,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">information were they validating the</font>

773
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:45,380
certificates exactly I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure I got</font>

774
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:49,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">completely question i'll repeat and your</font>

775
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:53,390
your tummy so in this vulnerability here

776
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:57,440
yes all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the information where</font>

777
00:43:53,390 --> 00:44:00,470
she is sent is zipped and then it is

778
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:02,690
sent over to remote servers through

779
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:06,379
https yeah it's not a question right

780
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:08,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay yes the vector here is basically a</font>

781
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:12,890
man-in-the-middle attack but my question

782
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:15,200
is is the application on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the glasses</font>

783
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:18,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">sides validating correctly the</font>

784
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:20,450
certificates because if they are the man

785
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:22,310
in the middle attack is not going toward

786
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:24,200
that's my question all right okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

787
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:27,259
haven't tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> the for the certificate so</font>

788
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:29,089
I'd be answering nonsense but it's a

789
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:31,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">very good question and I will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> check it</font>

790
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:31,480
first

791
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:48,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so thank again our speaker and now</font>

792
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:52,960
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a break and we'll c 4 30 ready</font>

793
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:52,960
to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> again thank you</font>
