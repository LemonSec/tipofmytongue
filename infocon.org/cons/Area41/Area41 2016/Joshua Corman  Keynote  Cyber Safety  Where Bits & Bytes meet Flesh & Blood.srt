1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:16,290
all right what a great venue I need more

2
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:20,200
smoke<font color="#E5E5E5"> though can I have some more song</font>

3
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:22,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so I struggled about three or four</font>

4
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,880
times on which content to give you and

5
00:00:22,779 --> 00:00:26,650
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> really isn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a correct answer but</font>

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">I had some fascinating discussions last</font>

7
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:31,479
night at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> speaker's dinner which made</font>

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,769
me completely changed my mind one more

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,960
time so we're just going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to roll with</font>

10
00:00:32,769 --> 00:00:36,760
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> purpose of a keynote</font>

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,230
isn't necessarily to give you just yet

12
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">another talk I think it's supposed to</font>

13
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:43,180
expose you to something you may not

14
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:45,610
normally see I think it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> supposed to</font>

15
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:47,200
make you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something you</font>

16
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:49,989
normally wouldn't think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and maybe</font>

17
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,610
even challenge you a little bit so I'm

18
00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:53,769
going to show you some of the content

19
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:55,180
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've been showing outside of the</font>

20
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:56,739
security conference in fact I haven't

21
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">really been to very many hacker</font>

22
00:00:56,739 --> 00:01:01,328
conferences in the last year and a half

23
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:03,430
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of us have decided</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

24
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:05,199
really can't fix many of the things that

25
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:07,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've been working on if we just talked</font>

26
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,100
to each other so we've been trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

27
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:11,080
turn into ambassadors that can translate

28
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,339
and yes use the word cyber so anyone

29
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,350
that gives me a hard time about cyber

30
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,600
and makes me have to drink<font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plenty</font>

31
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:19,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">of drinking later but also this is one</font>

32
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:22,059
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the words that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the outside</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> world has</font>

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,770
to use and we have to hold our nose eat

34
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,540
our lima beans and try to do so I'm

35
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:27,640
really quickly so I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> gauge the</font>

36
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:29,650
audience and by the way I<font color="#E5E5E5"> love people to</font>

37
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:34,799
live tweet or to start a discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

38
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:36,909
me at either one of these handles so

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,259
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though we grown at the word white</font>

41
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:41,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">think there are any white hats one of</font>

42
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,549
the hardest things we have to do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

43
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:44,320
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking to different governments</font>

44
00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:46,540
and different regulatory agencies and

45
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,699
medical device companies or<font color="#CCCCCC"> automakers</font>

46
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,649
is they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are totally afraid of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

47
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,299
community they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have no idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> why anyone</font>

48
00:01:50,649 --> 00:01:54,369
would want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hack their stuff they</font>

49
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:57,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that you're primarily there to</font>

50
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:59,470
extort them or that you're a risk and

51
00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:03,070
I've been trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put some names and</font>

52
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:05,560
faces to why<font color="#CCCCCC"> people do what we do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

53
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:07,270
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an oversimplification but I</font>

54
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,789
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the last several years</font>

55
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:12,310
distilled it down and do why we do what

56
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:16,629
we do and I essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> boiled down to 5</font>

57
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:18,099
p's you're either a protector that wants

58
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:18,859
to make the world a safer place or you

59
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:21,619
like to defend

60
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:24,950
random objects you're either a puzzler

61
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:26,870
who does<font color="#CCCCCC"> this for curiosity or to figure</font>

62
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:28,070
things out or to take them apart and<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font>

63
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:30,950
them back together because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

64
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:33,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">really hard challenge you do it for</font>

65
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:35,600
prestige or pride because there's a

66
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:37,460
healthy amount of ego in this industry

67
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,590
but that's not a bad thing it might just

68
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:41,150
be that you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel really good</font>

69
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:43,910
about your accomplishments in your body

70
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:46,070
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> work then there's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Prophet</font>

71
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:47,240
motivation which is a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us make a</font>

72
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:49,370
living off this we<font color="#E5E5E5"> might not have</font>

73
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,890
started<font color="#CCCCCC"> that way but this is a lucrative</font>

74
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:54,020
way to sustain our lifestyles and our

75
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:55,970
families and then some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it for</font>

76
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:57,709
protests were either for something or

77
00:02:55,970 --> 00:03:01,100
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> something with more of an activist</font>

78
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:02,810
bent but still in a lawful way and what

79
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:05,750
I find is most of us are really<font color="#E5E5E5"> strong</font>

80
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:08,690
at one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these and we have a secondary</font>

81
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:13,070
as well so<font color="#CCCCCC"> just by show of hands who</font>

82
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:16,700
primarily identifies as a protector<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

83
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:19,010
who's a puzzler lots of puzzlers that's

84
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,929
not surprising who does this<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the to</font>

85
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:25,310
be a rock star the prestige in the pride

86
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:27,380
all right oh I of course and and then

87
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:32,360
protest or something some sort of cause

88
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:34,910
anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so I major in protector I</font>

89
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,920
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the world</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a safer place but</font>

90
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:39,590
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> also can't lie i really like a</font>

91
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,420
challenge<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'm really a protector /</font>

92
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,920
puzzler now I can tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's not that</font>

93
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,869
many hackers in here<font color="#E5E5E5"> because i only see</font>

94
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,720
about 30<font color="#E5E5E5"> days and all hackers wear</font>

95
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:49,519
hoodies right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know what</font>

96
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,170
motivates you on an individual level but

97
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,450
regardless of your motivation<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

98
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:55,488
there's some some substance in here if

99
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:57,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">you look at what we say to the outside</font>

100
00:03:55,489 --> 00:04:00,019
world so try to think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own</font>

101
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,310
motivation as we discuss this so even

102
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:03,860
though<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm talking about where bits and</font>

103
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:05,720
bytes meet flesh and blood which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is very</font>

104
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:08,030
much oriented towards a protector class

105
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,859
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are really really really hard</font>

106
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:11,840
problems so if you're bored<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're</font>

107
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:13,820
sick of popping shell or it's just easy

108
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,399
enough to find the 700th piece of

109
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,988
<font color="#CCCCCC">android malware some people are finding</font>

110
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,510
more satisfaction and trying some of

111
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:23,479
these much harder problems much much

112
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:25,310
harder problems so let's jump in<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

113
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:27,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to show some of this i have to use</font>

114
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:29,090
story in metaphor so if a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you i</font>

115
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,700
no have seen this you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have to</font>

116
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:32,369
tolerate

117
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:34,530
I'll do a shorter version of it I did a

118
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:36,990
TEDx talk to try to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> neighbors</font>

119
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:39,719
understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> cybersecurity and why this</font>

120
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:41,070
was a big deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I had it all sketched</font>

121
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,540
out I knew exactly what I was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

122
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then I went shark diving</font>

123
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:46,530
with Dave<font color="#E5E5E5"> Litchfield he loves to go</font>

124
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,180
shark diving I finally had a chance to

125
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:50,429
go with him before DEFCON<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 years ago</font>

126
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:53,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I realized I have to completely</font>

127
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:56,640
rewrite this thing around sharks so here

128
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:59,070
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> go I love them I you still go to</font>

129
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,780
school for marine biology I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

130
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:02,580
study sharks and dolphins and things

131
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:04,200
like that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimately got a degree in</font>

132
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,340
philosophy instead and I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

133
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:09,180
computer science and got into

134
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:10,679
programming but I think they're pretty

135
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">awesome in fact before I die I want to</font>

136
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">see a school of hammerhead that's the</font>

137
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,430
most beautiful thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's very rare</font>

138
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:19,050
to see because in general sharks don't

139
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,540
like people they stay away from people

140
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:23,460
they don't like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> noise that we make</font>

141
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:25,830
now you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go swimming every single day</font>

142
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,870
and never see a shark now as I scuba

143
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:29,340
dive over my hobbies and over vacations

144
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,840
sometimes you'll see a shark in the

145
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,119
distance maybe you'll see a little one

146
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,429
maybe it's curious but in<font color="#CCCCCC"> general they</font>

147
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,370
just don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bother with us that's</font>

148
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:40,410
all until there's blood in the water

149
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:43,350
because they are an apex predator they

150
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:46,050
are one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most perfect organisms in</font>

151
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:47,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">the history of the planet and as soon as</font>

152
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,570
there's blood the different part of

153
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:50,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">their brain goes into a different mode</font>

154
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:53,070
they get curious they get hungry they

155
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,229
get frenzied and they come around so

156
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:56,760
when we try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this shark dive we</font>

157
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,320
asked a bunch of our friends to go it's

158
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,300
a fairly expensive thing we wanted to

159
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,960
subsidize the cost by splitting it and

160
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:05,940
everybody made excuses oh I have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

161
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,609
to my wedding my friend's<font color="#E5E5E5"> wedding I have</font>

162
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:12,180
to I have to get my hair done or oh I'm

163
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:13,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">working on my Def Con presentation my</font>

164
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,360
boss at the time was Andy Ellis of

165
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,250
akamai and he said what kind of an idiot

166
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,050
would get in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the water with an apex</font>

167
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,550
predator right he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was just judging us</font>

168
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:24,300
because he thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was a completely</font>

169
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:26,040
stupid risk decision so he was maybe

170
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,770
right maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> not but I wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see them</font>

171
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:30,120
so we went out three out of three hours

172
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:32,340
off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the coast of Cape Cod in</font>

173
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,320
Massachusetts we put some dead fish in

174
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:36,390
the water and within less than five

175
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,130
minutes this little guy showed up it's a

176
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:41,310
blue shark gets about<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight or nine feet</font>

177
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:42,900
long if I recall it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> initially curious</font>

178
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:45,389
but it very quickly got

179
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,620
mean I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually like blue sharks</font>

180
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:49,020
that much of all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> different sharks</font>

181
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:52,590
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was pretty amazing colors when</font>

182
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:54,270
the Sun hit it you know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> usually</font>

183
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:55,919
when people see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I say and he's</font>

184
00:06:54,270 --> 00:07:01,580
stupid but I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to remind people that</font>

00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:04,650
David<font color="#E5E5E5"> the shield took the photo and and</font>

186
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:07,560
it was worth it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to see this so I</font>

wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wasn't bothered yet now in</font>

security though if you're wondering how

189
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:13,590
this is a security talk we have this

190
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:15,030
ridiculous belief that we hold which

191
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:17,369
hasn't been<font color="#E5E5E5"> true in a long long time</font>

193
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:21,030
than that shark we just have to swim

194
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:22,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">faster than our buddy right so I don't</font>

195
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:24,989
have to worry as<font color="#CCCCCC"> long as he's the one</font>

196
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:27,270
eating but we forget that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Sharks</font>

197
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:30,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">also have buddies this picture was taken</font>

198
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:32,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">30 seconds after the one of me right so</font>

199
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:35,909
he turned around and there were two more

200
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:37,560
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea that you know ah you know we</font>

201
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:39,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">just have to be slightly better than our</font>

202
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,789
competitors or slightly better than<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

203
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:43,650
other guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> that assumes we have very very</font>

204
00:07:41,789 --> 00:07:46,680
few predators and it also assumes that

205
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:48,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">we we have very similar motivations so</font>

206
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,190
he had to very quickly get back in the

207
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,770
boat<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the photograph after this</font>

208
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:54,210
one wasn't very legible but it was the

209
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:56,460
inside of one of their mouths as he was

210
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:58,320
hitting it back with his camera and if

211
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:01,440
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty bad this was</font>

212
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:03,389
his prior dive but at some point shortly

213
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">after he got back into the cage with me</font>

214
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:07,530
we had five we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> six and they were</font>

215
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:10,889
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> aggressively trying to liberate us</font>

216
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:12,388
from that cage but he got at some point

217
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:15,030
I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> worried so even though I was</font>

218
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:17,250
protected they were successfully

219
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:19,500
grabbing at my leg or my hand or whatnot

220
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:21,150
and I said what kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an idiot gets in</font>

221
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,800
the water<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lynn apex predator because</font>

222
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:24,900
they moved quickly to move deliberately

223
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're faster than you they're stronger</font>

224
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,280
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> you I had no business being there</font>

225
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:31,409
why the heck would we expose ourselves

226
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,708
to that level of risk you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

227
00:08:31,409 --> 00:08:36,718
stupid so at some point I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of</font>

228
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:39,348
the out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the water we got back in the</font>

230
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:44,850
fact I wasn't going to feel safe until I

231
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,880
got back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the safety of what say it</font>

232
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:49,260
safety<font color="#CCCCCC"> of dry land right now</font>

233
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,600
unfortunately we had three<font color="#E5E5E5"> hours left</font>

234
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:53,279
before we could get<font color="#CCCCCC"> back so instead of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">just panicking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole time we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> just talked about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the state of</font>

00:08:54,660 --> 00:09:00,540
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cybersecurity now a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago</font>

238
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,829
some of you know I did this but people

239
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,529
thought I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was an idiot for studying</font>

240
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:05,910
these guys and Jericho and I spent about

241
00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:07,709
a year and a half writing a series

242
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:09,689
called building a better anonymous and

243
00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:14,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">we had some artwork done by our friend</font>

244
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:16,560
Marv from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 303 hacking group and it</font>

245
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:18,300
was a stupid thing to do because they

246
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,160
had successfully punished anybody that

247
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,109
talked about them at all like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the idea</font>

248
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,640
of if you remember Aaron bar they

249
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:26,010
destroyed<font color="#CCCCCC"> his career and he did more</font>

250
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">than talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about them but it was a risk</font>

251
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:29,189
that we were willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take at the time</font>

252
00:09:27,329 --> 00:09:31,469
because we knew it was significant not

253
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:32,520
because they're hacking prowess many of

254
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:35,279
you in this room<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know turn your</font>

255
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,900
noses up to anonymous but it was it was

256
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,540
consequential for a bunch of different

257
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:42,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">reasons and we didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly know why</font>

258
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:44,130
until we got into it but what I really

259
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:45,450
think is appropriate for today of all

260
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:47,670
the lessons we could take out of it i

261
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:49,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we're two things number one in</font>

262
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:52,650
spite of having very little skill

263
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:54,390
relative<font color="#CCCCCC"> to others they were wildly</font>

264
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:55,980
successful taking down nearly every

00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,420
target they had if you remember the

266
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,730
50-day summer of<font color="#CCCCCC"> lulls they just</font>

267
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:02,069
punished company after company after

company successfully<font color="#CCCCCC"> i said that they</font>

269
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:05,660
held a mirror to our neglect because

00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:08,550
here we are talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about espionage and</font>

00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:10,680
apts and sophisticated malware and

272
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:12,420
they're just trashing us with really

<font color="#E5E5E5">simple sequel injection and cross-site</font>

274
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,589
scripting and ddos attacks so they

275

really<font color="#E5E5E5"> showed us how poorly we've</font>

operationalized basic hygiene and number

two they kind of showed the entire world

<font color="#E5E5E5">that this thing called hacking this new</font>

294
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:01,050
they very hard problems but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is</font>

295
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:03,120
you don't need a sophisticated attack if

296
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,680
a ten-year-old known vulnerability that

297
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,660
no one bothers the patch still works

298
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,920
right so while we do have to be

00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,150
concerned about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the nation-state</font>

they're at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> more rational and</font>

302
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:14,220
controlled in their behavior but

<font color="#E5E5E5">regardless of which of these two</font>

304
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:18,270

305
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,130
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of just true that attacking things</font>

is really really<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy I'm not trying to</font>

00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:31,650
anyone never had a pic anyone here had a

315
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,780
we did get back to dry land i did get on

316
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,820
my knees I did physically kiss the

317
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:46,680
ground you know symbolically but I

318
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,240
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really feel safe because there's</font>

319
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:51,329
a part of your reptilian brain your

320
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,790
fight-or-flight that can't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

321
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:56,490
higher function until you feel safe

322
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:58,770
again and as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> did it that's safety in</font>

323
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:01,620
that wellness that washed over my body

324
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:03,829
lasted about 30 seconds and the reason

325
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:06,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">for that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is I looked at my brand-new</font>

326
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:08,310
connected vehicle my new computer on

327
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:10,920
meals this thing was as high tech as I

328
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:12,989
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen a long time is three days old I</font>

329
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:15,479
said wait a second the Internet of

330
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:17,610
Things is tsunami we are swimming and

331
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,220
connected technology we're putting

332
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:23,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">Bluetooth and 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspots on</font>

333
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:25,980
to everything and we too have apex

334
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:28,079
predators so then for the third time

335
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:30,570
that day I heard any<font color="#CCCCCC"> losses</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comment what</font>

336
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:34,140
kind of an idiot gets in the water with

337
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:36,510
an apex predator we're deliberately

338
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:38,819
exposing ourselves just to someone who

339
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:41,069
has much more control over that domain

340
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:43,020
because offense is<font color="#CCCCCC"> eV and defense is</font>

341
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:44,850
hard so adding software to something

342
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:46,710
makes it weaker and adding a

343
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:48,120
connectivity to it makes it exposed so

344
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:51,750
the Internet of Things the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

345
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:53,370

346
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,110
not my car but think about a modern

347
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:58,050
vehicle you don't turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> a key you press a</font>

348
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:59,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">button and you watch an operating system</font>

349
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:03,150
load and you want to connect to your

350
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:05,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">devices and to the internet there's 69</font>

351
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:08,490
computers in a car from just six years

352
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:10,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">ago 69 separate computers so we say it's</font>

353
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:11,340
a computer<font color="#CCCCCC"> on wheels but it's really a</font>

354
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:12,510
network on wheels and if you know what

355
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:15,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">Kristen Charlie and others have done</font>

356
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:17,790
this is not new news but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very new</font>

357
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:19,860
for the audience's that we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

358
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:21,449
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to very few people</font>

359
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,010
understand just how connected a vehicle

360
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:25,170
is it controls your steering

361
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:27,170
breaks your power every<font color="#E5E5E5"> aspect of your</font>

362
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:29,430
car has some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of software exposure</font>

363
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:31,589
we're putting software into our bodies

364
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:33,449
if you knew Jay<font color="#CCCCCC"> Radcliffe tore the work</font>

365
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:35,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">that Barnaby Jack had done you have</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Bluetooth stack sitting on an insulin</font>

368
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:42,300
almost no authentication or no effective

369
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:44,070
authentication sitting between you and

someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> that may wish to harm you right</font>

371
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:47,520
and it doesn't need an adversary

372
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,900
sometimes it's just an accident the

373
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,880
original thing that got Jay Radcliffe

374
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:53,160
interested was a software glitch nearly

375
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:56,070
killed him in his sleep he said if a bug

376
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:58,350
can kill me could I kill me and the

377
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:59,340
answer was yes it wasn't very<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard and</font>

378
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:01,950
he went from manufacturer to

379
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:05,490
manufacturer and found very very poor

380
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:08,490
hygiene it's in our homes and I don't

381
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:10,950
care at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> about bridges that send spam</font>

382
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:13,320
but we are putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bluetooth door locks</font>

385
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:19,170
in our home and nearly<font color="#CCCCCC"> every single one</font>

386
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,270

390
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:29,730

more importantly we had to work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

these industries where bits and bytes

458
00:16:54,740 --> 00:17:00,770
given us a kick in the ass to say maybe

<font color="#E5E5E5">we need to do things differently so it</font>

failure and you'll know it's

00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,850
consequential because the<font color="#CCCCCC"> consequences</font>

468
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,560
of failure would not be measured in

number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of records and it won't be</font>

00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:25,280
measured in replaceable credit cards and

471
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:28,700
it won't be measured in stock price

472
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:31,070
it'll be measured in human lives right

473
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:33,470
it'll be measured in a crisis of

474
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:36,110
confidence where<font color="#E5E5E5"> people no longer trust</font>

connect and medical devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> or connected</font>

476
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:41,629
cars and it has a material hit to a

477
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:43,610
nation's economic gross domestic product

478
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:46,310
or GDP and you'll know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have a</font>

479
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:48,500
consequential failure when the reaction

480
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:50,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">to that fear is we compromise our</font>

481
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,460
freedoms or surveillant we add more

482
00:17:50,419 --> 00:17:55,070
surveillance we add bad laws we start to

483
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:57,169
criminalize research we start to put

484
00:17:55,070 --> 00:18:00,139
more people in to the Middle East and

485
00:17:57,169 --> 00:18:02,570
physical conflict so I am much more

486
00:18:00,139 --> 00:18:06,109
concerned<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a crisis of confidence</font>

487
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:10,129
that triggers these real damages because

488
00:18:06,109 --> 00:18:11,600
those fear-based responses are going to

489
00:18:10,129 --> 00:18:14,029
compromise everything we care about and

490
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:17,480
they won't probably make things better

491
00:18:14,029 --> 00:18:20,509
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of the mission of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the cavalry</font>

492
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,070
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that we think we can avoid these</font>

493
00:18:20,509 --> 00:18:24,049
high consequence failures but that we

494
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:26,269
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be more prepared when they come</font>

495
00:18:24,049 --> 00:18:30,529
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reaction is more intelligent more</font>

496
00:18:26,269 --> 00:18:33,019
thoughtful more measured so as an

497
00:18:30,529 --> 00:18:35,269
example in history at least in the u.s.

498
00:18:33,019 --> 00:18:37,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">we polluted like crazy we are just</font>

dumping all sorts of chemicals and

called the Cuyahoga River and you had to

00:18:47,389 --> 00:18:51,769
see a burning<font color="#CCCCCC"> river on fire for so long</font>

505
00:18:50,419 --> 00:18:54,049
they couldn't put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it out that was the</font>

billowing smoke those are the the fire

hoses how do you put out burning<font color="#E5E5E5"> water</font>

508
00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:01,789
right throw more water finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font>

509
00:19:00,379 --> 00:19:03,350
the high consequence moment where they

510
00:19:01,789 --> 00:19:05,059
said you know what we probably should

511
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:06,949
stop polluting so much and they added a

512
00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:09,529
bunch of laws some of them good<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of</font>

513
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:11,929
them terrible and some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those terrible</font>

514
00:19:09,529 --> 00:19:13,429
laws are still in the books but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you kind</font>

515
00:19:11,929 --> 00:19:15,350
of need that<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment so instead of</font>

00:19:13,429 --> 00:19:17,869
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cyber 911 our cyber</font>

Pearl Harbor I'm really lately talking

518
00:19:17,869 --> 00:19:21,619
about a cyber Cuyahoga moment something

519
00:19:19,999 --> 00:19:23,600
that triggers<font color="#CCCCCC"> the consciousness and says</font>

520
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:24,918
we need to do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> different now</font>

521
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,408
these are not them but these are

522
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:29,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">starting to get close as much as we make</font>

523
00:19:27,409 --> 00:19:30,710
fun of it in fact Jericho<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I made it</font>

524
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:32,539
did an entire talk making fun of how

525
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:34,820
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> been more outages in power</font>

also<font color="#CCCCCC"> have confirmation it's very quiet</font>

have deliberate sustains denial service

565
00:21:05,419 --> 00:21:10,789

for any<font color="#CCCCCC"> hospital any country hospital</font>

technology is so bad and we are so

00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:18,080
exposed you could pretty much shut down

573
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:27,620
connectivity anymore because our

574
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:30,200
dependence on connected technology grew

575
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:32,600
faster than our ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to secure it so</font>

576
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,710
back to anonymous when we were we I

00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,928
don't think anonymous is going to go

hurt hospitals by the way but when we

were<font color="#E5E5E5"> researching them we didn't care</font>

00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:41,840
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> they were doing per se we said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

581
00:21:39,289 --> 00:21:44,960
this is a blueprint that will be copied

<font color="#E5E5E5">fiction we actually made the blueprint</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of the blog series and it's undeniable</font>

587
00:21:56,059 --> 00:22:01,309
if you look at current<font color="#E5E5E5"> events that Isis</font>

588
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:02,929
and dash have perfected the blueprint

00:22:01,309 --> 00:22:05,330
that anonymous created their use of

social media<font color="#CCCCCC"> and asymmetric power and</font>

it was unprecedented in every attempt

they do to use social media against them

596
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:25,120
doesn't work but what's more troubling

597
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,649
is unless you studied an anonymous

598
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,750
really carefully like we did you might

599
00:22:26,649 --> 00:22:30,039
not even notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> this story but there</font>

600
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,690
were very few hacking groups in

00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:33,399
anonymous one of them was team poison

one of them was<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lowell sack one of them</font>

recruiting other hackers and while he

was not you know a world-class<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero-day</font>

enough skill and knowledge of<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to</font>

611
00:22:57,669 --> 00:23:02,590
hack that if he wanted to he would be

it's harder to attack power plants it's

00:23:07,899 --> 00:23:11,049
hard to attack it's not hard to attack

616
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:13,299
the cars but you have to get familiar

617
00:23:11,049 --> 00:23:15,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">with how cars work so we have exposure</font>

00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:17,168
and lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these places but the kind of</font>

619
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:19,529
attacks that take down these hospitals

620
00:23:17,169 --> 00:23:22,480
they're running windows XP unpatched

621
00:23:19,529 --> 00:23:25,059
they have no network segmentation you

622
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,909
know basic common malware accidentally

623
00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:30,549
did it so I'm much more worried about

624
00:23:27,909 --> 00:23:31,629
this type of an adversary<font color="#E5E5E5"> because when</font>

625
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:33,309
you connect everything to everything

626
00:23:31,629 --> 00:23:35,080
else it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> let it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> matter what most</font>

627
00:23:33,309 --> 00:23:37,899
people would do it matters what one

628
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:41,740
would do and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just not set up in</font>

629
00:23:37,899 --> 00:23:44,500
cyber security to handle everybody right

630
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:46,600
we focus on financially motivated ones

631
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,669
because if I'm faster than<font color="#CCCCCC"> my buddy</font>

632
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:51,519
they'll just move on to a softer target

633
00:23:48,669 --> 00:23:53,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">save time or we focus on espionage</font>

634
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:55,360
because if I have nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to steal or if</font>

635
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:57,580
I can sue them we have some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

636
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,699
response so back to that consequences of

the

648
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:32,960
so why haven't we screamed why<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't</font>

649
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:37,879
we revolted how can we claim that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

650
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:39,560
being successful there's answers one of

651
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,690
them is as long as the fraud rate

652
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:46,399
doesn't go above four percent it's

653
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:48,200
acceptable and as long as you don't see

654
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:51,280
a company go out of business the

655
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:53,570
intellectual property loss is acceptable

656
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:56,180
but I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask you is a four</font>

657
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:57,770
percent increase death toll in these

<font color="#CCCCCC">safety-critical industry is acceptable</font>

659
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:03,080
we're nowhere near<font color="#E5E5E5"> as good in the safety</font>

660
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:05,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">critical industries as we are in the</font>

661
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,980
private sector we<font color="#CCCCCC"> spent tons more money</font>

662
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,810
on credit cards than we do on human<font color="#E5E5E5"> life</font>

663
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:12,320
and that's because that's where<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

664
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:14,600
adversaries have been but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> truth is</font>

665
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,850
we're not if we add in all that good

666
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,290
brass best practice to your cars and

667
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:22,100
your medical devices we would still fail

668
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:23,480
about a hundred percent now somebody's

669
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,830
probably saying it can't be this bad

670
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,050
right there's got to be something he's

671
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:28,550
leaving out and I think one of the

672
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:30,590
differences and you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

673
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:31,760
imagination just a little bit it's not

674
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:33,770
the fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people are going to die</font>

675
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,390
right when you start talking to policy

676
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:37,490
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just changed jobs to a policy</font>

677
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:38,600
think tank and there's they think<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

678
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:41,030
differently they don't care as much

679
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,290
about what we talked about in fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

680
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:45,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to quote a statistic there were</font>

681
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:48,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">thirty-two thousand more than 32,000</font>

682
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:50,300
deaths in cars in 2014 alone and<font color="#CCCCCC"> just in</font>

683
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:53,060
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US twenty thirty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two thousand deaths</font>

684
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:55,070
so clearly we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get that worried</font>

685
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:59,270
when people die in cars it's just what

686
00:25:55,070 --> 00:26:02,090
happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> people die but what is</font>

687
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:04,610
concerning is when it's an exotic death

688
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:06,080
right we were talking last night the

689
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:07,909
speaker centered about how much outrage

690
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,860
there was in<font color="#CCCCCC"> germany over the New Year's</font>

691
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:11,660
Eve attacks and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sexual assaults and</font>

692
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:13,219
it was terrible but the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> they made</font>

693
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:17,780
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think was that there's more of those</font>

694
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:19,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">every year at oktoberfest than there are</font>

695
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:23,000
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the exotic and terrifying</font>

696
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:24,679
nature of it so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the fact</font>

697
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">that well what will trigger that crisis</font>

698
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:29,150
of confidence is if we no longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust</font>

699
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:31,639
our medical equipment if we no longer

700
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:32,750
trust our connected cars that's where

701
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,610
you're going to see the bad outcomes

702
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:37,509
happen it's less a matter of technology

703
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:40,008
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> more a matter of confidence</font>

704
00:26:37,509 --> 00:26:42,139
so the bigger fear is that worse on

705
00:26:40,009 --> 00:26:45,230
these attacks to happen were someone

706
00:26:42,139 --> 00:26:47,508
like an ideological attacker to exert

707
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:49,370
their will on to public safety the

708
00:26:47,509 --> 00:26:50,960
bigger<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue isn't the attack it's that</font>

709
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:53,268
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing we can do about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it if</font>

710
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,059
you recognize this picture anybody see

711
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:59,149
this know what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all right this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

713
00:26:59,149 --> 00:27:03,979
the news every single night because all

714
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:05,749
systems fail<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not the surprise the</font>

715
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:08,809
surprise was they couldn't close the

716
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:10,429
leak for four weeks and that's the

717
00:27:08,809 --> 00:27:13,490
concern I have in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hospitals there's</font>

718
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:15,529
really no good response plan so we were

719
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:17,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking at dinner last night about well</font>

720
00:27:15,529 --> 00:27:21,619
you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> prevent anything so you have</font>

721
00:27:17,389 --> 00:27:23,330
to detect and respond sure but when did

722
00:27:21,619 --> 00:27:24,830
the thing you're detecting and

723
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:27,379
responding to<font color="#E5E5E5"> is people just died</font>

724
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:31,309
there's really no ability to go on kill

725
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:34,998
them there's no good just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a defense live</font>

726
00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:37,908
but moreover we really can't stop the

727
00:27:34,999 --> 00:27:39,499
attack because you can't stop the

728
00:27:37,909 --> 00:27:41,299
connectivity and we can't make these

729
00:27:39,499 --> 00:27:43,730
unmatchable devices all of a sudden

730
00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:45,710
patchable and we can't make these

731
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:47,539
hospitals all of a sudden to have enough

732
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:49,100
money<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get rid of windows XP systems</font>

733
00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:51,169
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not making excuses for them but</font>

734
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,820
the bottom line is we're completely

735
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:54,980
exposed and we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a good</font>

736
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:57,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">strategic or tactical plan for anything</font>

737
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:59,570
to do about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it now these are gonna sound</font>

738
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,309
really boring but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is where the</font>

739
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:03,110
industries are at and we have to start

740
00:28:01,309 --> 00:28:05,658
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the kraal stage so that you can walk</font>

741
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:07,998
and run so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not giving them a bunch</font>

742
00:28:05,659 --> 00:28:09,379
of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know advanced best practices what</font>

743
00:28:07,999 --> 00:28:11,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've been doing is we publish these</font>

744
00:28:09,379 --> 00:28:13,789
things like this first one was on<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

745
00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:15,918
first birthday two years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> Def Con we</font>

746
00:28:13,789 --> 00:28:18,440
said look cars<font color="#E5E5E5"> or computers on wheels</font>

747
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:20,419
all systems fail you need to be prepared

748
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:23,330
for failure so they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

749
00:28:20,419 --> 00:28:26,360
hacked are you prepared for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all</font>

750
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:28,610
we basically said was your masters of

751
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:30,498
your domain we're masters of our domain

752
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:32,928
now the domains have collided we have to

753
00:28:30,499 --> 00:28:36,710
work together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can be safer sooner</font>

754
00:28:32,929 --> 00:28:38,419
if we do so safer sooner together so the

755
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:41,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea which I'll show you in a few</font>

756
00:28:38,419 --> 00:28:43,249
minutes is if all systems fail tell your

757
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:45,200
customers how you avoid failure tell the

758
00:28:43,249 --> 00:28:47,720
researches you will take help avoiding

759
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,730
failure without suing them how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

760
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,600
capture study and learn from<font color="#CCCCCC"> failure how</font>

761
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:52,370
do you have a prompt

762
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:55,159
response to failure and how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

763
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:56,600
contain an isolate failure and they're

764
00:28:55,160 --> 00:29:00,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying that they won't be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ready for</font>

765
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:01,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">these any earlier than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 20-25</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you</font>

766
00:29:00,049 --> 00:29:02,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys think this is really basic stuff</font>

767
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:05,600
and you'll still<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to have cars</font>

768
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:08,629
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if they do these you're right but</font>

769
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:11,090
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> so far away from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this that</font>

770
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:13,340
we have to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhere similarly</font>

771
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:15,709
this January we published a Hippocratic

772
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:18,379
oath for connecting medical devices and

773
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:20,240
again it's basically the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same controls</font>

774
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:22,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">but we had to map it into something that</font>

775
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,710
doctors physicians and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and medical</font>

776
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:27,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">professionals understood and valued and</font>

777
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:29,390
core to their profession is first to

778
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:31,370
know her so they really identify with

779
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:33,400
language so it's less about finding you

780
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:36,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">0 days and more about packaging our</font>

781
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:40,820
knowledge in a consumable way that

782
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:42,409
they're familiar with<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

783
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:46,250
skip<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead because I took a while on</font>

784
00:29:42,409 --> 00:29:47,780
that front end but the urgency should

785
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:49,940
really come from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact not that we</font>

786
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:51,950
have added the connectivity but now that

787
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:54,169
you're seeing these attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> even the</font>

788
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:55,309
accidental ones again you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can swim</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

789
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:56,480
the ocean every day and never<font color="#CCCCCC"> see a</font>

790
00:29:55,309 --> 00:29:59,330
shark but when blood is in the water

791
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:01,400
they come quick and my deep concern

792
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:04,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the Hollywood Presbyterian example</font>

793
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:06,169
is even if ideological adversaries

794
00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:07,820
weren't thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this they've now</font>

795
00:30:06,169 --> 00:30:10,580
seen it on the news they know it's

796
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:14,570
available blood is<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the water so i</font>

797
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:16,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">think the timer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is started so just a</font>

798
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:18,799
quick look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Hippocratic oath one</font>

799
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:20,240
of our deliverables I base these are

800
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:23,840
slides I showed them i said look all

801
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:25,940
systems fail all of them so you need to

802
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">be ready for failure this is a graphic</font>

803
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:28,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">from information is beautiful we know</font>

804
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:30,470
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> few things about computer science</font>

805
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">but one of the things we know is there</font>

806
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:35,240
is a defect rate per 10,000 lines of

807
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:37,100
code actually four thousand lines of

808
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,990
code some people measure it that way so

809
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:41,209
there's some flaws every thousand lines

810
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:43,370
of code the more code the more problems

811
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:46,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">I used to have a biggie smalls photo i</font>

812
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:48,139
took out but if an operating system had

813
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:50,030
about 10 million lines of code and we

814
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:53,240
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> often we patch those right we</font>

815
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:55,309
patched them monthly a car has over a

816
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:57,650
hundred million lines of code and

817
00:30:55,309 --> 00:31:00,710
climbing so there's bugs in there and

818
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:02,490
anyone that says there aren't is stupid

819
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:05,130
it's just science

820
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:07,080
so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the doctors I</font>

821
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:08,220
said using the shark commended for we're

822
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:11,460
going to need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bigger boat because</font>

823
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:13,110
essentially in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> healthcare arena a</font>

824
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:15,690
piece of legislation in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s.</font>

825
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:17,520
basically broke the industry it said

826
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:19,530
we're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay you for new</font>

827
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:21,179
medical equipment unless you can have

828
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:23,160
meaningful use which meant you<font color="#E5E5E5"> had to</font>

829
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:25,020
have connectivity to share electronic

830
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:26,550
health records so they took all these

831
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:28,410
devices that were never designed to be

832
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:29,399
connected<font color="#CCCCCC"> to anything else</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they said</font>

833
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:31,590
we're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you money unless</font>

834
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:34,080
you can connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to the stuff so no</font>

835
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:36,270
threat modeling no risk assessment they

836
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,399
just added connectivity to all sorts of

837
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:40,879
old models and I said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the</font>

838
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:43,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">original sin as to why we have such</font>

839
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:48,510
wildly indefensible medical

840
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:50,460
infrastructure if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about it in</font>

841
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:52,170
terms of a car it's not the number of

842
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:53,760
lines of code that<font color="#E5E5E5"> bothers me it's the</font>

843
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:55,350
number of remote attack surfaces have

844
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,540
grown so we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> had software and cars</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

845
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:59,969
a long long time we have near-field via

846
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:03,629
bluetooth we have app stores<font color="#CCCCCC"> third-party</font>

847
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:05,790
app stores that's safe the head end unit

848
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:07,380
is really the center of the car so if

849
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:09,960
you can compromise that it's on the same

850
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:11,309
canvas and once you're on a canvas you

851
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:13,740
have unfettered access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to everything</font>

852
00:32:11,309 --> 00:32:15,990
else so I care less that Chris and

853
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:18,150
Charlie could hack the<font color="#CCCCCC"> UConnect stereo</font>

854
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:20,160
and the Jeep I care more that that

855
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:22,770
access point allows them to shut off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

856
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:26,940
brakes or kill this or kill the steering

857
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:28,350
or kill the car right so then once you

858
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,940
start talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about cannot be hacked of</font>

859
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:32,370
course and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about can be</font>

860
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:33,960
hacked from anywhere yes there's 4g LTE

861
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:36,059
Wi-Fi hotspot standard in all these

862
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,679
vehicles then you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> say well yeah</font>

863
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:39,510
but no one<font color="#CCCCCC"> would hurt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us right there's</font>

864
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,240
no money in it is what Chris and Charlie

865
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:44,250
said they're wrong there is money in it

866
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:45,900
but aside from that the first adversary

867
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:48,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">in every threat model should be Murphy</font>

868
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:50,700
Murphy's Law<font color="#E5E5E5"> right bugs happen so it's</font>

869
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,470
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just adversaries</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's accidents and</font>

870
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:55,940
adversaries and second of all there's

871
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:58,350
plenty of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would hurt you I</font>

872
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:59,760
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that they couldn't you know</font>

873
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:01,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">we don't have to connect everything</font>

874
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,540
everything else there's no law requiring

875
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:05,700
it we do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> because we think it's</font>

876
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:07,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">awesome right so we put out this</font>

877
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,760
Hippocratic medical oh and I already

878
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,950
said some of this so I'll go faster

879
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:12,240
these are the fancy names but basically

880
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:15,840
how do you avoid failure take help

881
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,410
avoiding failure notice failure respond

882
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,270
to failure

883
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:19,410
isolate failure how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you separate</font>

884
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:21,780
critical systems for non-critical

885
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:24,570
systems and they're really far away from

886
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:26,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing this really far and it because you</font>

887
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:27,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys are all smart and logical that</font>

888
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:29,700
argument we were having with them is

889
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,679
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> Josh there is no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> evidence of</font>

hacking I said guess what unless you

00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:36,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three you'll never have</font>

892
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,980
evidence of hacking so the food and drug

893
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:40,110
administration was<font color="#E5E5E5"> waiting for proof of</font>

harm they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see confirmed deaths</font>

895
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:44,340
due to hacking before they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> take an</font>

896
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:46,500
action and there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely no</font>

897
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:48,179
requirement to have any proof so they

898
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,890
were never going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get it if you</font>

899
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:51,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">followed this last year the friday</font>

900
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:54,630
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> DEFCON they put out the first</font>

901
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:56,190
ever recall of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> medical device for a</font>

hoss pry or drug infusion pump that

903
00:33:56,190 --> 00:34:00,600
Billy Rios had found a flaw<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and we</font>

904
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:04,290
had convinced them slowly using models

905
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:06,270
like this that unmitigated pathway to

906
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:08,580
harm is sufficient to<font color="#CCCCCC"> trigger a</font>

907
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:10,350
corrective action so you don't have to

908
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:12,480
wait until there's dead bodies you can

909
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:13,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually find some unmitigated pathway</font>

910
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,469
to harm and they'll do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

911
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:18,900
it so really<font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly the first one is</font>

912
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:20,609
essentially do you publish<font color="#E5E5E5"> your sdl so</font>

913
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:22,980
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can decide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if I'm a hospital that</font>

914
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:25,500
you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sdl than someone else</font>

915
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:26,850
think Microsoft right probably one of

916
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,320
the best in the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> even though we</font>

917
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:30,089
used to beat on them they're very

918
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,300
transparent<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what they do to avoid</font>

919
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:34,470
harm the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is basically do</font>

920
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have a published coordinated</font>

vulnerability disclosure programs and

922
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:39,960
you won't prosecute researchers acting

923
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:41,699
in good faith and while you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:47,159
places safety critical industries look

00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:49,230
at you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys as terrorists almost right</font>

927
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:50,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're terrified of you so is it a</font>

928
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:54,270
beware<font color="#E5E5E5"> of dog sign saying we're going to</font>

sue you<font color="#CCCCCC"> or is it a welcome mat inviting</font>

930
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:57,780
research and several of us have put a

931
00:34:55,949 --> 00:35:00,540
significant amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of energy into this</font>

one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we've gotten GM the auto company</font>

00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,350
we want help and<font color="#E5E5E5"> more importantly we got</font>

936
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:09,930
the food and drug administration to

937
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:11,250
almost require it they basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> say now</font>

938
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:12,299
in their new guidance if you have a

939
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:15,380
coordinated vulnerability disclosure

940
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:17,760
program and you fix your bug in 30 days

941
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:19,830
then you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a recall which is</font>

942
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,050
incredibly painful so it's not required

943
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:23,670
but you'd be an idiot not to do it the

944
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:25,530
third one is evidence capture so think

945
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:27,480
about airplanes you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we put these</font>

946
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:29,820
black boxes they're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> to spy on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

947
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:31,170
you can do it away without spying but

948
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:33,440
because you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to study these because</font>

949
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:36,690
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> people lose faith in airline industry</font>

950
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:38,250
global commerce<font color="#E5E5E5"> would cease so we study</font>

951
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:39,450
the failure we learn from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the failure we</font>

952
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:42,860
make the industry better through the

953
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:45,210
failure fourth one is can you know

954
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:46,740
segmentation isolation a submarine is

955
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:48,510
structured<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that any one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> part can</font>

956
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:50,580
flood without<font color="#E5E5E5"> sinking the whole boat and</font>

957
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:52,830
right now unfortunately most these

958
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:56,700
things one compromise destroys the

959
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:57,990
functionality the whole and then lastly

960
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,310
updates even though this is

961
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:00,930
controversial in safety-critical

962
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:02,700
industries they think updates isn't a

963
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:03,930
point of exposure and you'd be stupid to

964
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:06,089
update they believe youre not allowed to

965
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:09,299
update all those things are false if

966
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:10,650
you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use openssl when</font>

967
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:13,050
something like a heartbeat happens you

968
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:15,060
better be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to update it so what we</font>

969
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:16,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">are is dependent on all these packable</font>

970
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:18,480
things we have no update mechanisms and

971
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,740
most of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> and some of you guys last</font>

972
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">night we're groaning at this like</font>

973
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:25,049
updates are so basic and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

974
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:26,850
focus on ioc well guess what if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

975
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:29,160
can't update we have to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the basics</font>

976
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:31,140
in place if it's an industrial control

977
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,790
system that costs<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 million dollars and</font>

978
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:35,759
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed to last for 30 years and</font>

979
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:40,610
it's popped tomorrow and you can't patch

980
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:43,380
it that's a pretty expensive paperweight

981
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:45,240
so one things like this is katie

1000
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:23,819
and moreover if you think of those five

00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:26,160
stars i would say Microsoft is in the

1002

have to fix about a dozen or more

1005

these cars<font color="#CCCCCC"> and medical devices</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can't</font>

1006
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:39,690
patch even once a year so we have

1007
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:42,200
material exposure all right I'm pretty

1008
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:45,140
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> running out of time so I'm gonna</font>

make the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 30 second version</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of this I</font>

1010
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:49,470
kept looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for metaphors and if you</font>

1012
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:53,879
but the haitian earthquake killed

1013
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:55,440
230,000 people was all over the

international news for weeks right

really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really horrible disaster it was a</font>

1020

1021
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:15,060
the total devastation of damage was very

1022
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:17,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">different that's why the coverage was</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different when they studied all the</font>

1024
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:20,940
different contributors as to why it

1025
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:22,320
wasn't the size of the earthquake it

1026
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:24,770
wasn't the presence of an earthquake it

1027
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:28,650
was one thing pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much building codes</font>

1028
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:31,280
qi lai had modern building codes<font color="#E5E5E5"> haiti</font>

1029
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:33,680

<font color="#E5E5E5">toppled the building and flattened it in</font>

1032
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:42,810
to it's not the presence of adversaries

1033
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:44,460
and it's not the skill of adversaries

1034
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:47,549
it's the presence<font color="#E5E5E5"> or lack of building</font>

1035
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:49,350
codes for building code and we can't

1036
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:52,200
write unhackable code but we have

1037
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:53,670
incredibly terrible hygiene<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

1038
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:56,509
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> can affect Public Safety</font>

so one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to stimulate</font>

1047
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:12,330

1048
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:13,830
than we're accustomed to fighting so a

1049
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:15,540
lot of your best practices won't work

1050
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:18,569
the kind of people that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this</font>

1051
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:20,160
are the kind of people like trick<font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font>

1052
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:21,870
two we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have much different consequences</font>

1053
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,700
of failure they'll be life<font color="#E5E5E5"> and limb</font>

1054
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:26,910
confidence in key markets etc which

1055
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:28,710
we've hinted next really different

1056
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:30,569
context and environment some of these

1057
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:32,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">devices are migratory there's no such</font>

1058
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:35,360
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> as defense in depth there's no</font>

1059
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:38,400
perimeter you're wearing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on your body</font>

1060
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:40,470
next is composition very different

1061
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">hardware firmware software stack so a</font>

1062
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:43,770
lot of our security countermeasures

1063
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:45,210
aren't designed to work on them and

1064
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:48,650
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't they may not have enough</font>

1065
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:48,650
computational power to do encryption

1066
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:51,660
massively different economics when

1067
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,600
you're talking about the consumer

1068
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:54,399
Internet of Things

1069
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,839
there's no profit in doing security

1070
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,590
they'll never have a security<font color="#E5E5E5"> person on</font>

1071
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:01,360
staff and lastly different time scales

1072
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:03,460
some of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices their time to live</font>

1073
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:06,790
is a year some of these devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1074
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:08,320
trying to live is 35 years so a lot of

1075
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:09,880
our best practices don't work when you

1076
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:12,100
start talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a device that has to</font>

1077
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:15,610
be resilience against 35 years of future

1078
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:17,410
attacks so when you factor those things

1079
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:20,950
together it becomes a useful way to talk

1080
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:23,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">about why we can't do detect and respond</font>

1081
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:24,399
why Prevention's been kind of going to

1082
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:25,270
become more<font color="#E5E5E5"> important and the bottom</font>

1083
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">line is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to need a bigger</font>

1084
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:29,050
boat and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have all the answers</font>

1085
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:31,540
the five-star framework is one of them

1086
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:33,580
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> pardon my cursing here it felt</font>

1087
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:36,759
relevant I thought of this last night

1088
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:39,160
you have seen the movie<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Martian all</font>

1089
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:40,450
right my basic assertion isn't to scare

1090
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:43,149
you to tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> that all your work is</font>

1091
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:45,040
crap it's to say we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need a better</font>

1092
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:47,380
solution we finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that the</font>

1093
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:49,210
compelling reason to be better to think

1094
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:51,970
harder to shift left in the kill chain

1095
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:53,320
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> those different things we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to science the shit out of it</font>

1097
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:58,360
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's very smart people in this</font>

1098
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,800
room<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you got really frustrated or</font>

1099
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:01,210
bored or you're tired of<font color="#E5E5E5"> popping</font>

1100
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,130
something so you just said you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what</font>

00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:05,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">I lost some of my passion or things are</font>

1103
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:09,880
know this new project take your talents

1104
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:11,379
take your curiosity take your puzzler

1105
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:15,220
gene if you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a protector be a</font>

1106
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:16,930
puzzler but think of it if we couldn't

1107
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:18,399
detect and respond if we had to do

1108
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:19,899
better prevention if we had a better

1109
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,990
segmentation if the cost of a single

1110
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:24,700
failure is unacceptable what would<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do</font>

1111
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:29,410
differently you know what kind of things

1112
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:31,029
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> I invent and that's mostly the</font>

1118
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:42,430
structure is if you're a protector if

you're a puzzler<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're doing it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

pride and prestige for profession or

00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:49,390
profit for some sort of protest I'd like

1122
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:52,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">you to think at least for a while we're</font>

you could up your game where bits and

you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be challenged you're</font>
