1
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:11,299
thank you very much so welcome everyone

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:13,669
here for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this last session and no it's</font>

3
00:00:11,299 --> 00:00:16,340
the last session between me and fun so

4
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:18,830
I'm glad<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're here we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> close the door</font>

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,800
so no one can leave and you stay but I

6
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:24,168
hope you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> something out of it</font>

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,450
it's not hacking systems now it's

8
00:00:24,169 --> 00:00:29,090
hacking the human operating system I

9
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:31,189
actually prepared a big entry like why

10
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:33,680
did I do social engineering and all that

11
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:36,410
stuff and these things but now in this

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">setting it kind of came to me you know I</font>

13
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:40,190
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> been in this setting for a long</font>

14
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:43,879
time in the evening but<font color="#CCCCCC"> no it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was back</font>

15
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:46,970
then maybe oh that's nice good object

16
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:49,190
girlfriend let me go back so social

17
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:53,089
engineering it's in every one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us it's</font>

18
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:55,940
our program how our mind works and it

19
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:59,150
sometimes astonishing how it works and

20
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:00,890
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> it doesn't work so I selected a</font>

21
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:03,199
couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to highlight</font>

22
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:05,689
to you for today's session and i hope

23
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,689
you can pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> up on some parts of it and</font>

24
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:10,899
maybe even use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so today's session is</font>

25
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:13,580
actually not about me it's about you

26
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:15,380
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to contribute to you what</font>

27
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:17,810
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> do but you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use in your daily</font>

28
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:20,690
life or in your job and give you away

29
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:23,780
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i have done I do</font>

30
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:26,030
information security stuff or security

31
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:28,700
stuff i can say<font color="#CCCCCC"> google knows me and</font>

32
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:32,870
there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> twitter I don't do much there</font>

33
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:35,299
I'm not so of an online<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy or as my</font>

34
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:38,540
mother-in-law one set right you work

35
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:40,820
with computers can you please carry the

36
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:43,400
printer inside and connected I said yes

37
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:49,000
of course i work with computers that's

38
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:51,920
my work stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> i do so what I do is I</font>

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,930
protect my clients you see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of</font>

40
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,790
them here as representatives from this

41
00:01:55,930 --> 00:02:01,280
wherever it is required that's the work

42
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:03,680
I do I spent of a couple of years in

43
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,920
Australia I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> done some work in Asia</font>

44
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,019
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the US and all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the place</font>

45
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,450
information security stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick in small</font>

46
00:02:09,019 --> 00:02:16,810
engagements and with all sorts of edge

47
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:18,579
to security I guess now

48
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,620
what's the definition of social

49
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:23,110
engineering<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually many</font>

50
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:27,099
definitions out there and none of them

51
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:28,810
really fit so we found for us it's

52
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:31,090
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create a common</font>

53
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:34,150
understanding for social engineering

54
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:37,060
it's also if you do work in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> field</font>

55
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:40,300
most important is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create a common</font>

56
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:42,610
language if you work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with clients with</font>

57
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,560
other colleagues whatever you do if you

58
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:47,650
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk the same language you get in</font>

59
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,080
trouble<font color="#E5E5E5"> so talk about segregation some</font>

60
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:52,030
talk about vlans some talk about zoning

61
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:56,319
there may be all mean the same but maybe

62
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:58,480
not so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> our definition of social</font>

63
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:02,768
engineering<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the elicitation of</font>

64
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,630
information from systems networks are

65
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:07,269
human beings from all these three areas

66
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:11,140
we want to collect information as social

67
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:13,420
engineers from people through methods

68
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:17,200
and tools we wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a controlled</font>

69
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:20,708
approach in obtaining information<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

70
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:23,500
information as I say usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do also</font>

71
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:26,230
some work with the heck high school for

72
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:29,109
kids<font color="#E5E5E5"> and stuff like that so it's always</font>

73
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:30,970
very hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to know people what</font>

74
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:33,790
information means and if it has a value

75
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:37,989
or not but the most important thing is

76
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:40,630
always data is an asset if you remember

77
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:44,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">this you will be fine that's basically</font>

78
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:47,200
it data is an s that means you for name

79
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,899
is an asset your phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> number is an</font>

80
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:53,649
asset your address<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an asset where you</font>

81
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:56,440
live your laptop your SSID your system

82
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:59,470
handle all this is an asset and has

83
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:01,510
value and it's like with hacking that's

84
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:04,269
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have these tools like arcsight</font>

85
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:07,420
for instance if you have an event<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

86
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:10,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">and an event</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here three months later a</font>

87
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:13,238
human being can not correlate what has

88
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:15,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">happened between those two it's the same</font>

89
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:17,560
things with your assets you give away

90
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,409
your name once then you give away<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

91
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:23,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">street there and the rest here you</font>

92
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:26,080
cannot correlate that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also what social</font>

93
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:28,419
engineering does they just pick pieces

94
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,700
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> piece there and the piece</font>

95
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:33,909
there and then at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end you have</font>

96
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:35,500
picture for whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to do with</font>

97
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:37,960
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just the definition</font>

98
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,540
which gives you an idea what this

99
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:43,539
actually means it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not bad or good it's</font>

100
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:46,090
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> evaluating right we don't say you</font>

101
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:47,590
still classify the information because

102
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,929
most of the information is not

103
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:52,599
classified you steal as a social

104
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:54,460
engineer but if you combine and

105
00:04:52,600 --> 00:05:00,370
correlate the information then it's

106
00:04:54,460 --> 00:05:03,039
becoming interesting why is social

107
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:04,810
engineering as an apt so underestimated

108
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:08,230
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's one of the biggest</font>

109
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:10,600
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also driver why we do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me my</font>

110
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:13,900
colleague in Germany<font color="#E5E5E5"> we actually started</font>

111
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:16,510
this framework it is as underestimated

112
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:20,169
because there is no software or<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardware</font>

113
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:22,599
you can buy there is not a box or an

114
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:24,430
appliance or something else you can buy

115
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:28,330
it protect you from social engineering

116
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:31,120
right there is no firewall gateway data

117
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:34,330
leakage prevention tool whatever it

118
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,940
cannot buy something really tangible to

119
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:38,289
protect you from social engineering and

120
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,120
actually I'm glad<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't because</font>

121
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:42,450
otherwise it's device which you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

122
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">really like to install on yourself right</font>

123
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:48,849
but also I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think social engineering as</font>

124
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:52,330
an apt doesn't have its own local right

125
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:54,550
so it's really kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of is it the real</font>

126
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:57,849
vulnerability if it doesn't has its own

127
00:05:54,550 --> 00:06:00,780
local I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe like the other</font>

128
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:05,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">serious ones right because only serious</font>

129
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:08,440
vulnerabilities have logos right so

130
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,810
that's this one and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't believe</font>

131
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:13,300
but the second<font color="#CCCCCC"> polar</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point is actually</font>

132
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:16,210
true I worked with those vulnerabilities

133
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:18,580
when they came out for my clients so

134
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:20,919
there was a big mess<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok do you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

135
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:23,620
asset register where are your machines

136
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:25,810
are they affected or not when can we

137
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:28,810
update them who's paying<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the update</font>

138
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:31,540
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the SLA still in place etc etc and</font>

139
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:33,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">then a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of weeks later there were</font>

140
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:36,810
new vulnerabilities coming out and I was

141
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:39,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing this kind of strategic advices on</font>

142
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:42,100
vulnerabilities etc and then I was a

143
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:44,950
vulnerability without the logo and I got

144
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:47,530
this ask hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> DOM is that</font>

145
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:49,960
to a dangerous<font color="#CCCCCC"> one it has no local I</font>

146
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:53,409
said hell yes it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> even more dangerous</font>

147
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:56,409
than the other one but it has no logo so

148
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:59,140
what do you do right I think also what's

149
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:02,350
in interesting here that's the human

150
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:03,849
mind playing around this is you get ten

151
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:07,360
percent more budget if your

152
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:10,270
vulnerability has a logo to fix it

153
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,800
really true you know if management is a

154
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:14,080
logo and their report oh my<font color="#E5E5E5"> god</font>

155
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:17,620
heartbleed look it looks like this so

156
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:20,590
dangerous blood coming out you get ten

157
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:23,920
percent more budget to fix it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also</font>

158
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:25,690
what's interesting if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you fix finally</font>

159
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:28,180
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these ones in the company you</font>

160
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:31,240
patched everything etc you run a new

161
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:34,270
scan it's a hot yes we done it<font color="#CCCCCC"> you the</font>

162
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:36,460
hero so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> not only get ten percent but</font>

163
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:39,630
also you get the hero bonus for fixing

164
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:44,280
it that's what happening with the logo

165
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:46,960
but as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said I'm thinking always ahead</font>

166
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,510
and I'm thinking ahead of problems and

167
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:53,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">how you can solve them it's like Harvey</font>

168
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:55,330
Specter in suits they are 146 things you

169
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:59,320
can do when someone points a gun to<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

170
00:07:55,330 --> 00:08:03,099
head right so i created this local you

171
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:05,560
can say logos who cares social

172
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:07,810
engineering<font color="#E5E5E5"> forget</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it it's not</font>

173
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,720
important it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not even real coding</font>

174
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:15,040
there so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i created social engineering</font>

175
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:17,380
logos but also created them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get the</font>

176
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:21,610
ten percent bonus and the hero status

177
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:23,350
right now you can use them<font color="#CCCCCC"> i am maybe</font>

178
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,910
you can hack them from me or social

179
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:27,760
engineer them from me or we will make

180
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:30,790
them available on the website for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

181
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:33,700
you can download them but i also use

182
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:35,500
them for planning social engineering is

183
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:38,110
also about planning playing attack

184
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:40,030
vectors looking for vulnerabilities and

185
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:43,210
when you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a logo you can actually</font>

186
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:47,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">make some nice maps so you pick out the</font>

187
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:50,710
person and then you say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now they're</font>

188
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:53,199
geographically we go fishing there

189
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:56,260
geographically we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> wailling we want to</font>

190
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,970
have this guy or spear fishing or

191
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,780
whatever so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's actually also for</font>

192
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,210
attack planning

193
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:03,280
quite useful but also to show management

194
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:11,410
hey you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need more budget to fix this</font>

195
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:14,380
right then some facts about social

196
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:18,189
engineering which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think are important</font>

197
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:19,890
too so I do as a hobby or<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of my</font>

198
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:24,250
work and get paid for it that's nice

199
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:26,980
also I do some reverse engineering not

200
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:30,760
technically I can't code that's why I

201
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:33,190
became social engineer right know every

202
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:35,530
large attack has some social engineering

203
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:38,380
components in it if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at carbon</font>

204
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:40,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">knock the banking attack it wasn't that</font>

205
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:43,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">famous in the news maybe but money-wise</font>

206
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:46,000
it was really interesting but from the

207
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:48,790
bank side who cares a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred</font>

208
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,950
million really minor but if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

209
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:52,839
the attack there is a social engineering

210
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:54,940
element in the middle where they

211
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:57,340
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at keyboard</font>

212
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:59,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">typing password typing and everything</font>

213
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:02,020
else without that little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

214
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:04,810
middle of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole attack chain you</font>

215
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:07,930
wouldn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been so successful I don't</font>

216
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:10,469
say it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't be successful what I am</font>

217
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:13,510
also saying is hacking is the business

218
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:15,430
we knew that<font color="#E5E5E5"> before right but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

219
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:17,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">for business principles apply and you</font>

220
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:19,810
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that like a</font>

221
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:22,630
professional<font color="#E5E5E5"> business you want to have</font>

222
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:25,000
something in return and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> from a</font>

223
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:28,890
socio economic point of view hacking a

224
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,420
person is much cheaper than<font color="#E5E5E5"> evading</font>

225
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:34,840
encryption or two factor authentication

226
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:37,420
for instance so<font color="#E5E5E5"> what what I do expect is</font>

227
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:39,640
for the future that there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be much</font>

228
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:43,900
more social engineering in the attack

229
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:46,210
chain and it's cheaper and if it doesn't

230
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:50,530
work who cares you create another attack

231
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:52,060
chain but so it means from my view

232
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:54,220
looking at social engineering and

233
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:56,589
protecting my clients you need to be

234
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:59,560
aware you need to be aware as a Cecil

235
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:04,470
need to be aware as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IQ responsible</font>

236
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:07,060
as CEO as an administrator as yourself

237
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:10,270
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because your reputations may be on</font>

238
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:12,130
the line so be aware of this it becomes

239
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:15,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">more important and</font>

240
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:18,520
so easy to make any faults in this area

241
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:21,640
without realizing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that's an</font>

242
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:23,439
important bit the link down here is

243
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:26,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually from a very interesting movie</font>

244
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,960
from the Switzerland federal

245
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:32,170
intelligence service about industrial

246
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:34,960
espionage they call it short movie and

247
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:36,250
it's 20<font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but it's really</font>

248
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,230
interesting there's some social

249
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:40,420
engineering techniques in there how

250
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:43,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually an industrial client gets</font>

251
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:45,849
hacked is a book author and then some

252
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:47,800
person is approaching him and saying

253
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:49,540
yeah we can offer<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a contract and</font>

254
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,420
give you a contract<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you know France</font>

255
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:54,790
and we can get you good reviews and all

256
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:57,280
that stuff so it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good</font>

257
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:59,530
made if you are in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the where nests or</font>

258
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:02,290
something for your company go to that

259
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:04,990
link and look at it it's a great great

260
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:10,420
video and also gives you<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit about the</font>

261
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:13,360
topic of social<font color="#CCCCCC"> engineering now but our</font>

262
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:15,610
social engineers<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just the</font>

263
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:19,900
unskilled little brother of real hackers

264
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:23,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay they have feelings too they love</font>

265
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:26,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">right what do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they love they love ducks</font>

266
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:30,280
they love turtles and they love

267
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:31,840
pineapples I see some<font color="#CCCCCC"> already make the</font>

268
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,970
link there right is it the riddle yeah

269
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:37,960
it's kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> riddle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what do I mean</font>

270
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:40,420
by that they do love land turtles they

271
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:43,720
do love USB rubber<font color="#E5E5E5"> ducky until do love</font>

272
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:46,660
pineapple nano it's not a product

273
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:49,630
endorsement<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay these are tools you can</font>

274
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:53,350
use and these are tools commercially

275
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:56,320
available easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use you know you can</font>

276
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:59,620
drop shells everywhere it's like an

277
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,540
injection tool and the nano it just

278
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:03,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">gives you what you want isn't that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

279
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:05,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">best thing that ever happens to you you</font>

280
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:08,950
know if someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> gives you what you want</font>

281
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:12,190
so the Nano is so friendly it gives you

282
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:14,370
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSAT you want it gives you the SSID</font>

283
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:17,920
you're promoting your access point

284
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:19,960
they're so friendly product so that's

285
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:24,250
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> what i mean by fruits and</font>

286
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:25,720
animals right so maybe you're connected

287
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:28,509
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> one right now</font>

288
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:31,269
sometimes at conferences or other<font color="#CCCCCC"> places</font>

289
00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:33,730
you really say leave<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything at home</font>

290
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:35,769
I say take everything with you to the

291
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:38,439
conference and look what's going on

292
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:41,350
there yourself then often you see people

293
00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:44,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">walking around backpacks and the Tanners</font>

294
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:47,079
like this going up right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what did</font>

295
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:50,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">they do are there just friendly to help</font>

296
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:52,359
you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> access so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't be always so</font>

297
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:55,600
very with these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things you can trust</font>

298
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:58,449
them but no that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also a problem which</font>

299
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:01,959
i think is careful from the perspective

300
00:13:58,449 --> 00:14:03,550
of how do you conduct yourself you know

301
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:06,609
do you really want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to show of your</font>

302
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:10,269
access<font color="#E5E5E5"> point what's the point of showing</font>

303
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:12,730
it yeah it's fun it's kind of is it ego

304
00:14:10,269 --> 00:14:15,610
feeding yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe do you want to</font>

305
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:18,519
provoke reactions of course do you want

306
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:20,980
to pre out reactions maybe it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

307
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:23,889
kind of the approach what you want to do

308
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:27,459
so my approach woo this is just for

309
00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:30,220
today I always try to combine work and

310
00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:33,250
pleasure<font color="#CCCCCC"> so--but a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> chocolate croissant</font>

311
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,689
today you know I have a train general

312
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,850
Bonham and can drive around everywhere

313
00:14:34,689 --> 00:14:39,569
right funny I can eat<font color="#CCCCCC"> my chocolate</font>

314
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:42,430
croissant and then put it on the table

315
00:14:39,569 --> 00:14:44,790
that's much better than<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing antennas</font>

316
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:49,779
because look it just needs a bit of

317
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:52,209
conceal it looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this you know you</font>

318
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:54,309
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to show antennas maybe you're</font>

319
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:57,189
connected<font color="#CCCCCC"> to one right now it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

320
00:14:54,309 --> 00:14:59,980
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> access just connected so these are</font>

321
00:14:57,189 --> 00:15:01,809
the nice things social engineers use to

322
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:04,959
to get their information or what they

323
00:15:01,809 --> 00:15:07,750
want so what do you do if your connect

324
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,670
to such a device or sing first don't

325
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:12,579
panic you're in good hands with the

326
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:15,490
social<font color="#E5E5E5"> engineer right so he will help</font>

327
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:18,128
you you can relax we have someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

328
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:21,879
competence on your side what you do next

329
00:15:18,129 --> 00:15:25,329
second don't remove this device if some

330
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:27,819
device is connected to your laptop to

331
00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:29,709
your desktop whatever right you don't

332
00:15:27,819 --> 00:15:32,378
want to break anything because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

333
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:36,670
to tell your IT department I have broken

334
00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:38,780
something so just leave it there yet the

335
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:41,750
next third

336
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:45,020
safely remove it and plop it to you CEOs

337
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:48,170
laptop or best<font color="#CCCCCC"> friends</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> laptop because</font>

338
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:50,650
you get rid of the problem and that the

339
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:53,660
principal what's called shared

340
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:57,199
responsibility everyone should get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

341
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:59,000
fair share<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this right and you can be</font>

342
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:02,900
proud of you you didn't have to involve

343
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:07,610
help desk and forth connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

344
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:11,240
following<font color="#E5E5E5"> website www don't get me enter</font>

345
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:13,850
your credentials all of them social

00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:24,199
tell you if you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> safe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if you</font>

349
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:27,260
miss a credential or a social security

00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:29,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">number or the credit card number the</font>

351
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:32,090
guys from<font color="#E5E5E5"> ww don't get me can tell you</font>

352
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:34,430
if you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> safe so put all of the</font>

353
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:36,700
information in then you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you're</font>

354
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:39,709
safe well if you're compromised or not

355
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:42,500
and thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for cooperation you will</font>

356
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:45,110
hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> from us that's what social engine</font>

357
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:52,610
you do they do the same thing as hacking

358
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:54,440
but they are nice with it ok so there's

359
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:57,860
another problem with social engineering

360
00:16:54,440 --> 00:17:02,060
and I think it's a general problem but

361
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:05,270
it becomes especially concentrated for

362
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:08,619
social engineering this is how we see or

363
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:11,329
I see social engineering landscape today

364
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:15,949
we do have heroes and what I call

365
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:18,079
naturals<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the heroes are the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one we</font>

366
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:19,840
just can do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's maybe the</font>

367
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,460
meat<font color="#E5E5E5"> nicks it's maybe the others right</font>

368
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:25,310
they're heroes their social engineering

369
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:27,800
heroes they do social engineering I

370
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:30,230
don't know not every social engineering

371
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:33,050
trail can do a consulting company after

372
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:36,200
epic that's the heroes but then also<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

373
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:38,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">have the naturals they kind of natural</font>

374
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:41,300
they can talk the rate out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of everything</font>

375
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:44,060
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> you maybe know some of your</font>

376
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:45,919
friends who are like that they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

377
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:47,810
their head off they can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this they can</font>

378
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:50,770
order free there and to hear whatever

379
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:52,559
these are the naturals and the heroes

380
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:56,639
usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you have</font>

381
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:59,749
new a<font color="#CCCCCC"> new topic or a new challenge in</font>

382
00:17:56,639 --> 00:18:04,229
whatever area you get those two first

383
00:17:59,749 --> 00:18:06,929
kind of they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> important for these</font>

384
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:09,419
topics to evolve or to get the topic

385
00:18:06,929 --> 00:18:13,559
recognized but there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem with</font>

386
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:17,639
them the slight problems they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are in out</font>

387
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:21,620
of those guys available<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok heroes and</font>

388
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:25,199
naturals they don't have clearance PSP

389
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:28,619
secret whatever they are sort of

390
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,149
manageable think about those<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys can</font>

391
00:18:28,619 --> 00:18:33,840
you manage<font color="#CCCCCC"> them in a professional</font>

392
00:18:30,149 --> 00:18:36,389
setting can you say this is your work

393
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,720
you have to do fly to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sydney fly to</font>

394
00:18:36,389 --> 00:18:42,959
Dubai execute this job and come back

395
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:45,480
they're not that easy manageable so we

396
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,379
cannot really use them they work for

397
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:50,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">themselves or can bring a topic further</font>

398
00:18:48,379 --> 00:18:53,428
they don't have structured and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

399
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:56,340
repeatable approach because it's natural

400
00:18:53,429 --> 00:18:58,590
to them or it's a hero they<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe not</font>

401
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:01,949
even be able to tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you what they do</font>

402
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:05,789
and why does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it work it just works for</font>

403
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:08,879
them from a professional view that's bad

404
00:19:05,789 --> 00:19:10,499
right it doesn't bring you<font color="#E5E5E5"> further you</font>

405
00:19:08,879 --> 00:19:12,418
cannot protect your company with this

406
00:19:10,499 --> 00:19:15,299
you cannot do engagement on social

407
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:17,879
engineering with this and the last point

408
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:19,580
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> afraid I have to tell you they</font>

409
00:19:17,879 --> 00:19:23,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">usually they don't want to work for you</font>

410
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:25,230
that's also<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bad point so that's also</font>

411
00:19:23,009 --> 00:19:27,990
we felt look there must be something we

412
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:30,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">could structure social engineering make</font>

413
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:33,389
it available for everyone show you how

414
00:19:30,389 --> 00:19:35,580
it works where<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pain points are you</font>

415
00:19:33,389 --> 00:19:37,709
can do then go different roads you can

416
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:40,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">go to the dark side to social</font>

417
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:42,990
engineering you can go this way execute

418
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:45,360
yourself or protect yourself from social

419
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:49,289
engineering that's where we come along

420
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:54,360
with the book just<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks like this not</font>

421
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:57,289
very spectacular then here you can take

like as<font color="#CCCCCC"> i said they wanted to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try how</font>

436
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:35,670
the brain works i will show you a QR

437
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,659
code<font color="#E5E5E5"> just in a second how the brain</font>

438
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:42,390
works and make things<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy so now</font>

439
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:45,059
imagining you are in a spa or in sauna

440
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:47,970
or wherever place in a whirlpool and you

441
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:50,820
need to remember something the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lottery</font>

442
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:54,660
figures are on the wall over there and

443
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:56,490
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 seconds what do you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do you</font>

444
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:59,190
don't have technology we have nothing

445
00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:01,200
with you the only thing protecting you

446
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:03,809
from getting the big lottery winners you

447
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,190
know brain so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on this social</font>

448
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:08,668
engine always think how the brain works

449
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:11,429
so try to remember this there are some

450
00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:13,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">people who just can do it you know we</font>

451
00:21:11,429 --> 00:21:16,169
cover it they will tell you but<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

452
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:20,040
others try to remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> I give you a hint</font>

453
00:21:16,169 --> 00:21:24,480
like mnemonic works so 40 n is like more

454
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:28,950
on you know more on but it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> four on ll</font>

455
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:32,610
is little lover and c 6<font color="#CCCCCC"> x is maybe like</font>

456
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:35,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">c sharp but see sex so for only lower</font>

457
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:38,459
see sex I think you can remember this

458
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:40,710
right and then you have it and the rest

459
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:43,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">is something like rapid telligence and</font>

460
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:45,900
cells and you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I will</font>

461
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:48,900
give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you the QR code I'm not sure if it</font>

462
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:51,600
works you can try make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> pic picture</font>

463
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:53,910
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it is the URL or make a photo and</font>

464
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:59,939
you can later make photo of the picture

465
00:21:53,910 --> 00:22:02,520
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to the link so let's go further</font>

466
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:05,610
this is how the book is structured what

467
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:08,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything is it in their social</font>

468
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:10,260
engineering the framework this is more

469
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:12,209
targeted if you want to do social

470
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:14,760
engineering engagements with your guys

471
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:17,790
or your company a bit about governance

472
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:18,870
risk<font color="#CCCCCC"> compliance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think very important</font>

473
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:21,050
from my<font color="#E5E5E5"> point of view</font>

474
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:23,429
intensity levels we will cover them

475
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:26,250
approach selection mode that is new

476
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:28,730
attack vector development I put the

477
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:31,800
quite an emphasis on this one today

478
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:33,960
interpersonal distance some information

479
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,340
about that one verbal masking the

480
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,620
experimental content that's just the

481
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:39,679
chapters of the book so we'll go through

482
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:42,750
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things here with you now</font>

483
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:44,600
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically the framework so from a</font>

484
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:48,150
knowledge point<font color="#E5E5E5"> its broad and specific</font>

485
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:50,459
the framework covers geo<font color="#CCCCCC"> C++ messes</font>

486
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:52,620
instructions and you have a skills area

487
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:54,420
skills is really where you develop

488
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:58,080
yourselves or the work can you bring

489
00:22:54,420 --> 00:23:00,360
into the table some of the methods the

490
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:03,330
method<font color="#E5E5E5"> is explaining you how you do</font>

491
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:06,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">certain things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an instruction is like a</font>

492
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:08,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">step by step some of the methods and</font>

493
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:12,300
instructions don't need additional

494
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:15,649
skills right and some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them need but</font>

495
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">you will see later what I mean by that</font>

496
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:24,950
this is the gr c plus plus grcs you may

497
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:27,929
know is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a government risk compliance</font>

498
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:30,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">Aaron talks about it on the carpet floor</font>

499
00:23:27,929 --> 00:23:33,630
what's important what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> governance what</font>

500
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:35,660
is risk etc so but GRC was from my view

501
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:38,340
not enough for social engineering<font color="#CCCCCC"> gates</font>

502
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:41,250
if you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> willner ability assessments</font>

503
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:43,860
you maybe know the pain of working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

504
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:45,660
terms and conditions right what do you

505
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:47,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">scare and where do you scale do you</font>

506
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:49,380
scale and exploit you explode not<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

507
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:51,809
or what the hell ever right it's really

508
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:53,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">a pain and it's very stressful for the</font>

509
00:23:51,809 --> 00:23:55,500
companies as well because they don't

510
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:58,678
<font color="#CCCCCC">know the problem is they really have to</font>

511
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:01,860
trust you with that so TRC is a topic

512
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:03,750
there but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I added certain elements which</font>

513
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:06,389
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> really important for social</font>

514
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:09,120
engineering because sometimes you hear

515
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:12,150
things like oh there's a get out of jail

516
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:14,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">leather you know you do a social</font>

517
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:16,620
engineer engagement you get the job you

518
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:18,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">get a confirmation from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the company</font>

519
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:21,120
saying you're allowed to social engineer

520
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:25,169
blah blah blah but then you're on your

521
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:28,070
own then you try to enter a company may

522
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:30,420
be physically through a reception desk

523
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:32,240
now in Switzerland the problem is

524
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:34,460
reception desks

525
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:37,640
are not the company's reception desk

526
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:39,830
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a separate field company right if</font>

527
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:43,010
you get caught trying entering there

528
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:45,919
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't be nice to you and you let</font>

529
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:47,990
her get<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of jail leather is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worth not</font>

530
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:50,390
the paper it's written on because they

531
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:52,370
don't care they have a contract<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

532
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:54,440
professional obligation to the company

533
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:56,659
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> do their services for these</font>

534
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:58,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">companies are known to be secure but</font>

535
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:01,690
they will also never let you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> away</font>

536
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:04,670
with it because that's their reputation

537
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:07,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">we are the company who's protecting the</font>

538
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:09,710
entrance of this company so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that things</font>

539
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:12,110
you need to understand that's why there

540
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:14,929
are more levels you need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> consider for</font>

541
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:19,010
social engineering I got some feedback

542
00:25:14,929 --> 00:25:20,900
about this here it says feedback was

543
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:24,050
don't pour hackers with this they will

544
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:28,120
die yeah they're still on their chairs

545
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:33,050
so won't talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this forget it right</font>

546
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:36,770
some of it culture don't overdo it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

547
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:39,409
listening<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that ethics not much use at</font>

548
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:41,110
the hackers conference skip that so

549
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:45,740
we'll probably talk about those two

550
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:48,530
right go to the intensity levels that's

551
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:50,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">a part we worked quite a bit and it</font>

552
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:52,428
comes out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of engagements i have</font>

553
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:55,850
done internationally there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always the</font>

554
00:25:52,429 --> 00:25:58,520
point of what do you exactly do what do

555
00:25:55,850 --> 00:26:00,559
you do if you go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> thailand and heck</font>

556
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,840
the site or if you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> pen testing over</font>

557
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:05,540
there and that's always<font color="#CCCCCC"> a communication</font>

558
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:07,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">between you and your client that's why</font>

559
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:10,159
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> brought up this intensity levels</font>

560
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:12,200
because you define those and discuss it

561
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:15,880
with your client one two three green

562
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:19,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">four to six orange red and black</font>

563
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:23,809
risk-based it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Green is</font>

564
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:26,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay orange is not so okay red is bloody</font>

565
00:26:23,809 --> 00:26:31,490
fun but not allowed and black<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> death</font>

566
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:33,770
so take your<font color="#CCCCCC"> pick then additionally to</font>

567
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:36,800
this comes the risk appetite and

568
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:40,639
possible consequences or techniques used

569
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:44,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">to give you to these intensity levels is</font>

570
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:47,779
actually a tool so here on this level

571
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:50,389
we have legal non-invasive<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source</font>

572
00:26:47,779 --> 00:26:52,039
intelligence that's level one that's

573
00:26:50,389 --> 00:26:55,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty cool you can do that mostly</font>

574
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:57,559
without a problem without the problem

575
00:26:55,309 --> 00:27:00,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">always looking over your shoulder and</font>

576
00:26:57,559 --> 00:27:02,299
see if you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> caught or not and writing</font>

577
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:05,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">your letter and say mama will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be away</font>

579
00:27:05,649 --> 00:27:10,639
it's simple local or national standard

580
00:27:08,779 --> 00:27:13,700
or corporations it depends also on the

581

company you work for we can do the same

also<font color="#E5E5E5"> depends on the company that's why</font>

592
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:46,759
you have the company in here there too

593
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:49,490
and the local or national as well level

594

that you can go up to level<font color="#E5E5E5"> three with</font>

597
00:27:55,879 --> 00:28:01,428

00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:04,490
or a company's integrity don't smear

them don't make bad press for them don't

600

companies we all know right so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

620
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:09,920
really here is our just about the the

621
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:12,620
felonies and the misdemeanors I think in

622
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:15,920
the Switzerland context it's really

623
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:18,379
important that you know the difference

624
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:20,870
so I just look it up here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and tell you</font>

625
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:24,170
some crap so misdemeanors is along the

626
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:27,520
lines of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> treating and forgiving</font>

627
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:32,060
and felonies is along the lines of

copied<font color="#CCCCCC"> alpha branch draft art you know</font>

629
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:36,679
if you can find a flat you may do just a

630
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:40,040
misdemeanor gets you a couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> months</font>

631
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:43,220
if you produce<font color="#E5E5E5"> a felony can get longer</font>

632
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:46,370
to think about it think about before you

633
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:48,760
hack this table<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not just for hacking</font>

634
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:50,959
guys it's for social engineering hacking

635
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:53,510
whatever else you do in life<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> it everywhere it's important to</font>

637
00:29:53,510 --> 00:30:00,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what you let yourself into and it's</font>

638
00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:02,360
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of the agreement with your</font>

639
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:05,870
client if you get social engineering

640
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:09,110
contract you put this table in you both

641
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:10,790
agree you do social engineering based on

642
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:13,939
physical entrance blah blah blah

643
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:16,280
locations headquarters very funny 25

644
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:19,910
grand but you stay within these levels

645
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:21,379
and both sign this that's important so

646
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:27,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have a common understanding what you</font>

647
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:29,930
do so that's how<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole table looks</font>

648
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:33,170
like here are just a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of comments</font>

649
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:36,640
sign of approval because the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

650
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:39,620
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this table is if you do red teaming</font>

651
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:42,050
sending people somewhere you won't<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

652
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:44,030
them for a while you send them to

653
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:46,100
Mogadishu oh no you won't see them at

654
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:49,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">all I guess no you sent them to Sydney</font>

655
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:51,110
maybe and you say guys you're going to

656
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:53,830
Sydney you have to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the corporate</font>

657
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:56,780
headquarters red teaming one month

658
00:30:53,830 --> 00:31:01,100
expected<font color="#E5E5E5"> result you stay within level</font>

659
00:30:56,780 --> 00:31:03,020
green off we go then when they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

660
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:05,990
and they do they're entering and

661
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:09,590
breaking and whatever they know they

662
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:10,860
don't should go above level green that's

663
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:14,070
the point because

664
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:18,419
they go in there they see a laptop with

665
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:21,419
the golden image from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CEO and it's</font>

666
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:23,040
like a check pot and at this moment if

667
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:25,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">you see something like this you think oh</font>

668
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:29,460
I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to check war you go like this and</font>

669
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:32,370
they take it with them and then they

670
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:35,549
fucked up the whole agreement<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if</font>

671
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:37,770
you agreed on this<font color="#CCCCCC"> before they just</font>

672
00:31:35,549 --> 00:31:40,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">leave it there do that job and come home</font>

673
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:43,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay these things is especially</font>

674
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:45,389
important as you can see here if you

675
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:48,120
engage third parties for the more risk

676
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:50,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">bits don't do them on your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> own it's</font>

677
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:53,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">especially important to talk to them</font>

678
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:56,690
about this it's that job it's that job

679
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:59,160
to stay here and do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and not more</font>

680
00:31:56,690 --> 00:32:00,809
that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do it in the professional</font>

681
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:03,390
world because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to have</font>

682
00:32:00,809 --> 00:32:06,178

683
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:07,919
wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's in table you agree</font>

684
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:10,169
beforehand with your team with your red

691
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:30,660

692
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:32,790
there may be something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be more boring</font>

693
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:34,559
from the engagement point that won't go

694
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:36,960
through all this here but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

695

here I don't have a job<font color="#CCCCCC"> here that's why</font>

this one is for and I was with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big</font>

four it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very important point</font>

726
00:34:01,059 --> 00:34:08,159
always keep track not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the job</font>

727
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:11,409
but also of your client I tell you

00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:14,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">otherwise you will become a tool never</font>

729

730
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:21,339
which I just showing you some elements

731
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:23,740
now we go to the more meteors things I

732
00:34:21,339 --> 00:34:28,659
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> which you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can maybe relate more to</font>

733
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:31,868
it that's the attack vector table that's

734
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:36,310
kind of the summary of it and we have a

735
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:39,869
range from standard attack vectors on

736
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:44,049
this side too highly sophisticated

737
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:46,899
targeted attack vectors so here you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

738
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:50,379
also see on this axis it's based on the

739
00:34:46,899 --> 00:34:53,290
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> of engagement or the</font>

740
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:55,598
importance of the task but also it's

741
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:59,230
based on effort and costs to develop a

744
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:06,970
the craziest attack vectors to get your

00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:11,079
results but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> won't get paid for it so</font>

746
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:13,509
it's always in this area that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

fishing spear fishing etc and on here

752
00:35:24,819 --> 00:35:29,829
you really have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> specialize the tech</font>

753
00:35:27,339 --> 00:35:34,420
vectors you for you won't find them

00:35:29,829 --> 00:35:36,609
anywhere else we define them<font color="#CCCCCC"> unsafe for</font>

755
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:38,030
instance you can do psych profile in you

00:35:36,609 --> 00:35:40,850
can use NLP tech

what it is and sir maps sir map is

759
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:50,529
actually something we invented<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

760
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:53,830
social and emotional relationship maps

761
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:58,460
it means if we look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at a target person</font>

762
00:35:53,830 --> 00:36:01,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">or a target object we look how this</font>

763
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:03,160
person<font color="#CCCCCC"> is related not just from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:06,920
networking perspective or from a social

is his out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> character behavior what</font>

can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do with him else he is a you know</font>

769
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:23,240
his head love relationships usually you

770
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:25,130
won't go there because of ethical does

771
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:27,140
he have kids family what else is he

772
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:31,460
healthy or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will show you that and</font>

773
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:33,350
that can be pretty intense and obviously

774
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:36,320
cost a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money so you only do that</font>

775
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:38,450
if it's very important but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will show</font>

776
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:43,550
you now after that that one how this

777
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:46,700
actually works so here on this one you

778
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:49,130
see how we can develop attack vectors

779
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:51,950
and not just talking about attack

780
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:54,260
vectors you're dreaming up after a night

781
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:58,490
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are drunk say oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a fucking</font>

782
00:36:54,260 --> 00:37:00,770
good idea it's engineering social it's

783
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:03,080
called social engineering not social

784
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:05,300
whatever so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the engineering</font>

785
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:07,670
approach in making attack vectors and

786
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:10,940
the point behind this they are

787
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:13,880
successful<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are predictable and they</font>

788
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:16,490
do deliver the results you know it's a

789
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:18,890
structured approach and you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

790
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:21,290
probably the most fun working on social

791
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:23,720
engineering working on these attack

792
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:25,850
vectors it's also very good if you have

793
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:27,770
people in your team who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not maybe</font>

794
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:30,080
want to go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there and expose</font>

795
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:33,590
themselves and always getting arrested

796
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:36,770
at reception desk those guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> can develop</font>

797
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:39,830
these you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> clever guys you need guys</font>

798
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:41,960
who know how things work how the world

799
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:44,810
works how company works how accounting

800
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:47,030
works they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can help you with this you</font>

801
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:49,730
can even get specialized people in like

802
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:50,840
psychologists for instance you know

803
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:54,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">hecker say</font>

804
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:58,100
handles syste system hands like frackers

805
00:37:54,620 --> 00:38:01,609
etc and psychology assistant handles

806
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:04,069
like Woodstock rainbow etc so get them

807
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:06,650
into that can give you some valuable

808
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:10,360
information so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you start with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> defining</font>

809
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:14,210
the type of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Av you want to develop first</font>

810
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:17,900
technology-based person based remote on

811
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:21,410
site or<font color="#CCCCCC"> location based then it's what I</font>

812
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:25,520
call the<font color="#E5E5E5"> principal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the attack vector</font>

813
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:28,609
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically use anything I don't</font>

814
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:31,520
say this approach is the best it's the

815
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:35,840
same like with these<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools the framework</font>

816
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:38,870
actually counts for we use what works

817
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:42,050
and commercially works and the rest we

818
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:44,390
get rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it it's the same here I don't</font>

819
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:46,760
want to focus on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple method</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:49,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">principle to develop tease and in two</font>

821
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:52,220
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's outdated so we take what's</font>

822
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:54,380
out there so we can use all these things

823
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:57,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">you may be never thought you can make</font>

824
00:38:54,380 --> 00:39:00,710
attack vectors out of it but we can lose

825
00:38:57,470 --> 00:39:04,459
mass loss hierarchy of needs maybe have

826
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:06,470
heard of it we use kaldeen<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 he has six</font>

827
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:08,570
principles defined in the book<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

828
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:11,060
good sometimes they talk in social

829
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:12,560
engineering what parts of this stuff but

830
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:15,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">not really sorted you know not</font>

831
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:17,720
engineered we have sir map you can use

832
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:20,990
NLP techniques as attack vectors you

833
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:23,270
know rapport building timing leading

834
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:24,709
pacing mirroring<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the same as the</font>

835
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:28,160
person the others are techniques for

836
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:31,510
between people we can use social media

837
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:35,120
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use mice money coercion etc</font>

838
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:36,770
curiosity or deception and in there you

839
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:39,380
put in what you like or what you know

840
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:42,500
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know some budu technique put</font>

841
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:44,420
it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> here I don't care it's you develop</font>

842
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:46,700
an attack vector but it should be

843
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:48,890
repeatable and it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be successful</font>

844
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:51,890
and then should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be bring the results you</font>

845
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:54,080
want there can be time-based<font color="#CCCCCC"> Authority</font>

846
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:56,540
scarcity helplessness these are

847
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:59,779
principles the human brain works and has

848
00:39:56,540 --> 00:40:01,340
flaws and depending on where you are the

849
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:04,110
floors are different that's the beauty

850
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:07,800
you cannot fix it right

851
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:09,720
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> here what you're looking for is</font>

852
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:12,390
actually sweet spots weaknesses

853
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:14,100
strengths out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> character etc here are</font>

854
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:16,819
the constraints you only get a certain

855
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:19,529
amount of money to develop them or time

856
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:22,940
and you need to stay within the

857
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:26,850
intensity levels or the gr c plus plus i

858
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:31,460
will show you now three standard attack

859
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:34,770
vectors right so here we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

860
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:37,140
impersonation impersonation is actually

861
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:40,290
the method of course of impersonating

862
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:42,299
someone or something to gain access to a

863
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:45,480
location or write<font color="#E5E5E5"> a letter in the name</font>

864
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:47,790
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CEO etc to get information</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

865
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:52,160
login information<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> etc that's</font>

866
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:54,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically what impersonation is then</font>

867
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:59,069
next you look at intensity levels

868
00:40:54,870 --> 00:41:01,290
remember the 12 12 what's with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

869
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:04,560
intensity<font color="#E5E5E5"> level with this standard</font>

870
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:07,440
attack it's a cool attack everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> loves</font>

871
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:09,570
it dressing up and changing things but

872
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:12,810
the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it becomes quickly</font>

873
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:16,080
uncontrolled and it's more trouble than

874
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:21,270
it's worth because depending what you do

875
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:26,220
here I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I got that for you on the</font>

876
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:28,320
next side here you got the answer most

877
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:31,290
social video media websites and other

878
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:33,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">websites have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in-person</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> policy or anti</font>

881
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:41,040
impersonation you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> already violating</font>

882
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:42,870
all that stuff then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

883
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:45,660
really careful if you create a

884
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:48,870
fictitious company and get in there

885
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:50,670
that's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay all these</font>

886
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:52,759
good ideas about you know get some

887
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:56,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">overall from the cleaning company</font>

888
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:59,010
whatever name they have you can buy

889
00:41:56,190 --> 00:42:01,560
t-shirts at secondhand fairs with names

890

892
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:11,430
develop a fictitious company and then

893
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:13,740
refer to it because at a certain point

894
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:17,160
and it always depends how far you take

895
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:17,939
it I know from<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases where people also</font>

896
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:22,109
started

897
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:25,020
doing fake IDs no like I'm now the blah

this in Switzerland it's all

902
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:39,930
condensation this it's a felony and how

903
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:43,880
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to risk felony for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> five</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> grand</font>

904
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:47,990

905
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:51,180
impersonation tricky thing good thing is

00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:55,319
dumpster dive these are the rats of

908
00:42:53,069 --> 00:42:58,069
society right so they go through

909
00:42:55,319 --> 00:43:00,930
everything everywhere buy stuff online

910
00:42:58,069 --> 00:43:03,869
go to the dumpsters have a look at them

911
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:07,078
dig in figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out stuff and information</font>

912
00:43:03,869 --> 00:43:08,540
it's a cool thing so you have to

913
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:11,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">consider a couple of things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

914
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:13,920
intensity level usually can be done

915
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:15,630
within acceptable intensity levels if

916
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,300
you have a clear understanding what you

917
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:21,240
do and where you can take the pins out

918

in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SB be in the train station but</font>

919
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:26,368
you have to be careful if you walk on

920
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:28,140
someone's property<font color="#E5E5E5"> with dumpster diving</font>

921
00:43:26,369 --> 00:43:32,220
it's expected if someone throws

922
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:34,859
something away he has no real expectancy

923
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:37,470
of privacy for these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things if these</font>

924
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:39,660
containers are on a company's property

925
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:43,140
it's different<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to be a bit more</font>

926
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:45,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">careful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but usually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a good thing</font>

927
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:48,210
and dumpster diving is you can go do it

928
00:43:45,569 --> 00:43:50,910
everywhere you find dumped on hottest

929
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:54,390
memory sticks etc as well as<font color="#CCCCCC"> dumped in</font>

931
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:59,609
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the best point I say also</font>

932
00:43:57,150 --> 00:44:01,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">usually as a joke to my friends and I</font>

will<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it I promise</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you I will do it</font>

934
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:08,460
one day I say if I travel first class in

935
00:44:05,369 --> 00:44:10,980
the train all around Switzerland go to

936

these<font color="#E5E5E5"> first-class lobbies in the airport</font>

in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the train station they're even more</font>

938
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:18,480
every day I can live from the

939
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:22,109
information i will obtain there just by

940
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:25,410
listening this guy's saying all cuadras

941
00:44:22,109 --> 00:44:27,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">alters like this or we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind get</font>

944
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:33,569
day i will try it

945
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:36,210
as a proof of concept and I think it

946
00:44:33,569 --> 00:44:38,310
will work I don't know how much money I

947
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:42,180
can make but I will be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

948
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:44,009
because people are stupid privacy

949
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:47,220
screens don't protect them from talking

950
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:51,240
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the biggest problem from</font>

951
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:53,160
talk no one applies the same principles

952
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:55,290
as for document you have secret

953
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:57,920
documents you have these documents for

954
00:44:55,290 --> 00:45:01,250
Towelie etc but they talk all crap

955
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:04,190
dumpster diving eavesdropping is great

956
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:06,660
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually within acceptable levels</font>

957
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:09,420
except you do wiretapping but that's not

958
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:11,879
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessary they say you anything if</font>

959
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:15,390
you just talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and buy them a</font>

960
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:17,339
coffee so and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> mostly legal that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

961
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:20,240

these are the principles in his book

00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:44,609
obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> he didn't wrote it for social</font>

971
00:45:42,329 --> 00:45:48,240
engineering he wrote it for marketing

972
00:45:44,609 --> 00:45:50,819
for making people<font color="#E5E5E5"> comfortable warm fuzzy</font>

973
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:54,240
stuff but of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can use</font>

974
00:45:50,819 --> 00:45:56,759
everything you will use purpose this is

975
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:59,609
our description if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will give you</font>

976
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:03,440
will receive in return if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do small</font>

977
00:45:59,609 --> 00:46:07,828
favors then you owe me a favor right

978
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:10,710
when others are doing it it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay group</font>

979
00:46:07,829 --> 00:46:12,599
pressure peer pressure if I agreed i

980
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:14,520
will stick to it if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get a commitment</font>

981
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:17,880
from someone you can take it may be

982
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:19,770
further if it's like me<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

983
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:22,710
if everyone walks around in t-shirt I

984
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:24,930
will walk running t-shirt too if an

985
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:26,819
expert that's an interesting point if an

986
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:30,509
expert or authority figure says it's

987
00:46:26,819 --> 00:46:33,089
true then it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> true people don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

988
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:36,930
think between the first information they

989
00:46:33,089 --> 00:46:40,020
see on a website<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have put out graphics</font>

990
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:43,078
and stuff online with links in there

991
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:45,180
which would send them to some hellhole<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

992
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:48,329
can tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you i got</font>

994
00:46:48,329 --> 00:46:52,319
they don't even look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> it what is it is</font>

everything it's better gives you also

1001

another ten percent of the budget so

00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:31,799
it's a bit more complex this is the

1009
00:47:28,829 --> 00:47:33,210
index person psychologists use that by

1010
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:36,059
the way you can say you're a side

1011
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:38,520
psychological advisor but you cannot say

1012
00:47:36,059 --> 00:47:41,069
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> a psychologist okay what the rest</font>

1013
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:43,980
is fine so you do this map he put a

1014
00:47:41,069 --> 00:47:45,990
person in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle index person now</font>

1015
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:49,050
description what does this person do

1016
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:51,479
that's a simplified example he had an

1017
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:54,780
affair 2014 with 20<font color="#E5E5E5"> year old Tiffany</font>

1018
00:47:51,480 --> 00:48:00,030
he's now focused on Claire his best pal

1019
00:47:54,780 --> 00:48:02,520
bob has PTSD is 45 he's married in 99 to

1020
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:07,500
Ellis which is 44 by the way round<font color="#E5E5E5"> his</font>

1021
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:09,720
female edgy is men he has a hostile his

1022
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:12,390
horse she is hostile towards Bob sorry

1023
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:13,799
so you collect this information you can

1024
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:16,200
also give<font color="#CCCCCC"> these to professionals to</font>

1025
00:48:13,799 --> 00:48:20,130
collect then you build an attack vector

1026
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:23,299
and this one will hit<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you look for</font>

1027
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:26,670
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things emotionally loaded in</font>

1030
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:35,579

1031
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:38,670
leverage with social engineering we have

1032
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:41,730
your crowbar we look where you can put

1033
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:45,809

1034
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:48,329
edges to put a crowbar and crack it open

1035
00:48:45,809 --> 00:48:51,059
right so you look for<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things and</font>

1036
00:48:48,329 --> 00:48:53,849
you can use them then I mean that's very

1037
00:48:51,059 --> 00:48:58,070
level six right you wouldn't do that

1038
00:48:53,849 --> 00:49:00,890
just as it is here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> list of symbols</font>

1039
00:48:58,070 --> 00:49:03,020
you use it can also give you those ones

1040
00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:08,150
but also<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for your</font>

1041
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:10,340

it's here now in a year there's enough

1064
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:21,950
information to correlate all this and

1065
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:26,120
find the one who did<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be careful</font>

1066
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:28,970
with these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> with ego you can give</font>

1067
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:31,730
you big struggle so bit about distance

1068
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:34,939
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we'll be finished soon this is</font>

1069
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:37,580
just to tell you how things work you

1070
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:40,070
have the intimate space family about

1071
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:42,740
normed length personal space about two

meters<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's friends social and public</font>

1073
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:49,370
space and then there's the bit we call

1074
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:52,100
reaction zone so that's about this if

1075
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:54,980
you enter this base towards a person

1076
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:58,790
it's the reaction zone you will provoke

1077
00:50:54,980 --> 00:51:01,760
reaction of some sort if its military

1078
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:04,940
you get shot if it's something else you

1079
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:06,920
get hit you provoke fight or flight you

1080
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:10,250
need to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's culturally</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">but be aware of these things what is</font>

1085
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:21,740
what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the soul what is the comfortable</font>

1087
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:28,328
or sideways keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in mind when you</font>

1088
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:31,910
work with people right that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

1089
00:51:28,329 --> 00:51:33,380
the space of New York everything cramped

1090
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:37,430
you can ask your neighbor can you change

1091
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:39,280
the song on my iPad or iPhone this is

1092
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:42,500
then the practical application of this

1093
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:45,710
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the desk by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the way that's your</font>

1094
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:48,859
target person no practical application

1095
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:52,579
how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> approach someone guys not</font>

1096
00:51:48,859 --> 00:51:55,520
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the back it's never comfortable the</font>

person will never talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you it's just</font>

1098
00:51:55,520 --> 00:52:02,270
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> good red zone orange somehow</font>

1099
00:51:58,819 --> 00:52:04,130
acceptable<font color="#E5E5E5"> Green is ideal talk to this</font>

1100
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:05,990
and the screen is there to a person

1101
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:09,170
because then you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make the person</font>

1102
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:11,689
comfortable if she's insecure or

1103
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:13,670
whatever you will not talk you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

1104
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:16,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to social engineer everyone it's</font>

1105
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:21,650
also if you have employees or a team

1106
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:24,470
consider this but if you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hear</font>

1107
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:28,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">really cool I go green you go to the</font>

1108
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:31,368
person's desk and sit on it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1109
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:33,710
work right that's enough that's an

1110
00:52:31,369 --> 00:52:35,839
aggression if you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so it's really</font>

1111
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:41,710
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> approaching the zones keep that in</font>

1112
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:44,930
mind so I'm think I'm I'm finished with

1113
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:47,299
the Parts I had I<font color="#CCCCCC"> could cover within</font>

1114
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:49,609
this time and if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are questions or</font>

1115
00:52:47,299 --> 00:52:53,500
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do something else</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like a</font>

1116
00:52:49,609 --> 00:52:53,500
microexpression training just<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell me</font>

1117
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:58,720
are there<font color="#E5E5E5"> any questions</font>

1118
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:08,180
you want to see the QR code again hiya

1119
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:11,960

1120
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:16,848
question have you ever felt like<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1121
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:20,119
danger doing something in your job yeah

1122
00:53:16,849 --> 00:53:22,190
I think definitely or not comfortable

1123
00:53:20,119 --> 00:53:24,680
and it also depends what you do where

1124
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:26,359
right there are just certain countries

1125
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:28,310
or things you won't do anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1126
00:53:26,359 --> 00:53:30,380
that's the point in staying

1127
00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:33,410
professionally or<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's maybe if you do</font>

1128
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:35,720
it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a team if you team up you do</font>

1129
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:37,660
distractions or other things I don't

1130
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:39,770
mean like<font color="#E5E5E5"> explosions but just you know</font>

1131
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:41,118
other distractions then you feel

1132
00:53:39,770 --> 00:53:42,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">uncomfortable because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't control</font>

1133
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:45,020
the other person's and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think oh</font>

1134
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:47,359
my god oh my god this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going so that's</font>

1135
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:49,099
why these tables are here you brief

1136
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:52,130
everyone beforehand and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

1137
00:53:49,099 --> 00:53:55,609
trust that where is this code now I

1138
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:58,579
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that takes risk out of it but not</font>

1139
00:53:55,609 --> 00:54:02,089
the fun that's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> why even kind of</font>

1140
00:53:58,579 --> 00:54:04,339
invented this framework so you can do it

1141
00:54:02,089 --> 00:54:06,470
safely you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> few rules you don't go</font>

1142
00:54:04,339 --> 00:54:08,960
to jail too long I guess you need good

1143
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:10,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">lawyers but you're fine and it gives</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1144
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:14,000
a good feeling right and the learning

1145
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:16,910
for companies individuals is anyway

1146
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,880
there way before you steal something or

1147

some assignments to do as well in there

1158
00:54:55,480 --> 00:55:01,150
in Vegas so some people just took it too

1159

1167
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:24,790
that's an approach to approach selection

1168
00:55:22,359 --> 00:55:27,009
was bad and she showed<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ID and there</font>

1169
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:29,470

1174
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:41,500
not really good if you pose yourself as

1175
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:43,329
police or an authority so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:45,460
got in trouble I mean it's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1177
00:55:43,329 --> 00:55:47,230
friends they got in trouble right it's

1178
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:49,060
never you you always have a friend who

1179
00:55:47,230 --> 00:55:51,849

1183
00:55:55,390 --> 00:56:02,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">risk-averse so and always I guess you</font>

1184
00:55:59,349 --> 00:56:04,569
have to be careful you can get closed up

1185
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:05,380
in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> no in the toilet and then you don't</font>

1187
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:10,060

1188
00:56:07,810 --> 00:56:13,170
hide yourselves but if you don't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

1189
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:15,400

1190
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:18,220

1191
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:19,960
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> was it a good approach and then</font>

1192
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:21,910

1193
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:25,180
of it usually what happens you talk

1194

yourself into it so need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

1195
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:30,549
