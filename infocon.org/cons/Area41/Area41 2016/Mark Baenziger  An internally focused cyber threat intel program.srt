1
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:10,969
good morning everyone thanks for thanks

2
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,950
for being here thanks Stefan and

3
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:16,189
everyone at area 41 for inviting me I'm

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:18,049
really excited to be here my name is my

5
00:00:16,189 --> 00:00:19,700
name<font color="#CCCCCC"> is Mark benziger</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk</font>

6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:21,619
a little bit about my bias going into

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:24,259
this because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it affects what I'm hoping</font>

8
00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:27,259
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get out of it from you and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bl so it</font>

9
00:00:24,259 --> 00:00:29,059
affects sort of the why I'm approaching

10
00:00:27,259 --> 00:00:30,380
it from this so I come from and I from

11
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:32,870
an incident handling it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a response</font>

12
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:34,190
background I was a pen tester and a more

13
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:36,680
traditional security operations guy

14
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:38,780
before that but for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last 10 years</font>

15
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:41,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really been focused on the belief</font>

16
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,520
that it's the in the detect and respond

17
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:45,410
cycle that we we can have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> greatest</font>

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,710
effect and it's where most of my

19
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:50,569
interest has been I've been doing a lot

20
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:52,010
of sock design or exposed to sock design

21
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:53,510
i use the word sock with a question mark

22
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,519
because it's a stupid word and it's been

23
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,050
around for<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years and we use it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

24
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of interchangeably to talk about</font>

25
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:01,578
organizations that worry about finding

26
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:03,380
and responding to evil on their network

27
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:04,879
and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really focused on the detection</font>

28
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:07,369
response i'm not thinking about

29
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,990
vulnerability management or security

30
00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:10,370
operations like firewall provisioning

31
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:12,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm thinking about the tech can respond</font>

32
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:14,990
and that's what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is focused on I</font>

33
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:18,679
like agile solutions I want thing I I

34
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:20,990
definitely the idea of process over

35
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,450
people is important and it informs why I

36
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:26,330
did this because I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> we we built</font>

37
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:28,880
some really really Byzantine complex

38
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:30,260
solutions to solve problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font>

39
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,920
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> always work because of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

40
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:35,510
complexity that's my Twitter handle I

41
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,479
sadly<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't use it that much but</font>

42
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:40,070
please feel free to ping me there or you

43
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,250
know I don't like said I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it</font>

44
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:46,279
tweet much but maybe I'll try more I

45
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:48,170
hope that's my email address i work for

46
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,390
fire<font color="#CCCCCC"> i obviously</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this talk is not</font>

47
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:52,610
condone or sanctioned by them this is

48
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:55,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">just about my experiences both there and</font>

49
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:57,820
it some previous companies so this this

50
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:01,040
talk isn't about products it's not about

51
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:03,080
tools that you use necessary like that

52
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,790
so as<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll get through you'll see that</font>

53
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,280
i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about tools several</font>

54
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:11,150
times but it's more about process and

55
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,980
ideas the and so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the last thing</font>

56
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,620
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been really intimidating to see the</font>

57
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:17,090
quality of the talks I've seen here and

58
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,980
talking to many of you because there's

59
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,310
some really insanely smart people in

60
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,799
here

61
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:23,810
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> their doings they have their part of</font>

62
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:27,349
some pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> advanced programs to find</font>

63
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:29,060
find evil and respond<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it and so my</font>

64
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:30,980
experience has been that the vast

65
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:33,020
majority of organizations do not have

66
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:34,579
multiple malware reverse engineers on

67
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,410
staff but some of you are part of

68
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:40,700
organizations that<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that do have that</font>

69
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:42,349
flexibility this is about this is for

70
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">the organization that doesn't have</font>

71
00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:46,429
multiple more reverse engineers on staff

72
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:48,140
they have one guy who's made is what

73
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:50,660
made it halfway through practical mall

74
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:51,859
learn analysis and keeps promising

75
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,000
himself he's going to go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

76
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,819
whole thing and figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out one of</font>

77
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,590
these days where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sock team is 10</font>

78
00:02:55,819 --> 00:02:59,179
people and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

79
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:04,310
depth or skill and they have very narrow

80
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:07,280
narrow abilities so what what led to

81
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:09,440
this talk I'm so tired of the phrase

82
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,290
threat intelligence and i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

83
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,420
the word cyber all over just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it</font>

84
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:16,670
is the language<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> least</font>

85
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,809
industry is speaking in they say cyber

86
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:20,839
threat intelligence or threat

87
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:23,329
intelligence interchangeably and I hate

88
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,920
the fray I hate the word it I don't know

89
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:26,090
it feels overloaded I'll talk a little

90
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,559
bit about my frustration with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the word</font>

91
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:30,290
intelligence for this but it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what it</font>

92
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:33,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">is we have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to live with it a</font>

93
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:34,790
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of too many organizations are</font>

94
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:38,600
spending a ton of money on these things

95
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:40,548
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're focusing on the the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CEO they'll</font>

96
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,890
pay a half million or a million dollars

97
00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:44,900
a year for a threat Intel feed they'll

98
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,850
pay you know quarter million dollars for

99
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,769
a strategic intelligence service to

100
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:51,100
assess their business and give them

101
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:54,709
periodic reporting they'll build or buy

102
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:56,209
crits or big data tools and spend a lot

103
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:58,220
of money<font color="#E5E5E5"> and maintaining and using them</font>

104
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:59,900
tons<font color="#E5E5E5"> of money is going into this and</font>

105
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:02,930
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> always having a lot of value</font>

106
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">out in the field and so I say this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

107
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:06,680
someone who works for a company with a

108
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:08,720
threat Intel offering it's a useful

109
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,010
thing I mean and I've seen it<font color="#E5E5E5"> help at</font>

110
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,290
companies i'm not saying threatened

111
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:14,179
tells bad I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying it's it's</font>

112
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:15,920
underutilized and this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

113
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:18,380
of talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe we don't need to</font>

114
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,909
focus on the big the big adversary quite

115
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:22,370
as much but look a little bit in words

116
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:23,930
as well and it's and it's for all<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

117
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:26,389
overwhelm sake analysts who don't know

118
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,770
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so some word some</font>

119
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:29,240
thoughts about the word threat

120
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,370
intelligence or just intelligence in

121
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,110
general it's a horribly overloaded word

122
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:35,180
when I when I'm using it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

123
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:37,670
presentation I'm not talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

124
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:40,160
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really smart people I'm not</font>

125
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:42,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about nation states or scary</font>

126
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:46,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">oligarchy is spying on us I'm not</font>

127
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,720
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about secret services trying or</font>

128
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:50,450
or people spying on their own companies

129
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,730
I trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come a better word and this</font>

130
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:56,750
is this problem comes up frequently in

131
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:58,520
Germany I so I come I'm obviously an

132
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:00,140
American by the accent but I have been

133
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:03,140
in Germany for<font color="#E5E5E5"> roughly the fast the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> past</font>

134
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:06,650
four years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I come from Europe</font>

135
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:08,390
European parents so I've I picked up

136
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:09,830
enough of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the language to start spotting</font>

137
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:11,180
like where the breakdowns happen and so

138
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:13,400
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think of a word that's</font>

139
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:16,550
better to describe in German

140
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:18,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">intelligence and it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> beautiful mouth</font>

141
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:21,050
full of a German word alpha sins

142
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:23,360
familjen maybe that's it i don't know so

143
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:26,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">i tried summarizing in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> English roughly</font>

144
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,900
what I mean how can I going to use data

145
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:31,910
efficiently to make the right decision

146
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,469
and the keywords are the right decision

147
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:37,190
and efficiently like how<font color="#CCCCCC"> can we do this</font>

148
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:40,190
quickly so<font color="#CCCCCC"> please be patient with me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

149
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:42,080
you know almost five minutes in and i'm

150
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:43,910
still I'm still on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> introduction so</font>

151
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,479
I'm getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> there I'm painting a picture</font>

152
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:49,880
for a reason the there's no demo I'm

153
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:52,730
sorry I know this is my first talk at a

154
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:54,159
con and and I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the demo gods</font>

155
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:58,730
would laugh at me if I even<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried</font>

156
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:01,610
spinning up a crits instance and a elk

157
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:04,150
instance and a ziam and tried linking

158
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:07,640
together on the stage it would be bad so

159
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:08,929
please maybe next time and so at the end

160
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,669
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to ask some questions because</font>

161
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,870
this is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is based on personal</font>

162
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:14,630
experience and a couple of different

163
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:16,370
attempts in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the field but I'm a data</font>

164
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,810
point with I've got maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

165
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:20,750
socks I've been exposed to in the last

166
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:22,970
five years<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if there's if others of</font>

167
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:24,320
you have experienced that that conflicts

168
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,940
with this or supports this I'd love to

169
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:30,260
hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> it afterwards or during the Q&A</font>

170
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:32,920
session so still still in the background

171
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:38,980
we have is the word framework here

172
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:41,150
loosely frameworks aren't necessarily

173
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:43,820
framework can be a document it can be a

174
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:45,080
regulatory thing it can be an idea so

175
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,430
some of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things are not like the</font>

176
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,789
others obviously some of them are

177
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,010
framework

178
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:52,040
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> measuring things sums are I think</font>

179
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:55,520
sums are organizational that enforce

180
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:58,310
things but they all end up creating or

181
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,590
all end up almost mandating some sort of

182
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:03,760
process for how<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do we take in</font>

183
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:06,409
something from detection to response and

184
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:08,570
and so I tried distilling like the

185
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:10,670
absolute minimalist beginning of that

186
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:13,099
detection response cycle where its most

187
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:15,100
most important you find<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

188
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,910
probably as<font color="#CCCCCC"> IAM rule</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most likely</font>

189
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:19,850
unfortunately sometimes a phone call

190
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:23,420
from the FBI or from<font color="#CCCCCC"> BSI or some other</font>

191
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:25,460
organization then you take a look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

192
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:27,080
and say how big<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you know do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

193
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:28,640
understand this is it really an incident

194
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,919
how big is it is it scary do I have

195
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:33,320
enough information and then if it's big

196
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:35,840
and bad you analyze it maybe you do

197
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">something about it and if it's if it's</font>

198
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,710
just if it's if it's a garden-variety

199
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:42,860
malware you say yeah reimage the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Box</font>

200
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:44,840
closed the ticket move on and if it's a

201
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:48,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">false positive you say hey our rules are</font>

202
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:50,270
broken do something about it so there's

203
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:51,979
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a group of intelligence</font>

204
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:54,169
frameworks and methodologies again and

205
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:55,430
I'm clumping them all together because

206
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:57,890
some of these some of these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> purely</font>

207
00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:00,590
technology solutions but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they drive</font>

208
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:04,250
towards ways of how we look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at data and</font>

209
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:05,719
so the ones i'm going to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> i apologize</font>

210
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:08,180
in advance for using the kill chain<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

211
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,860
know you're tired of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it everyone is but</font>

212
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:13,790
it's still a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> effective way to</font>

213
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:16,130
model to model threats and and make and

214
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:18,710
in particularly look at targeted threats

215
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:19,969
where you're worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the where you</font>

216
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:21,620
can afford<font color="#E5E5E5"> to worry about the</font>

217
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:23,480
infrastructure or the capabilities to

218
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:25,430
the adversary<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about</font>

219
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">the diamond model so most of you</font>

220
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:29,870
probably seen that as well it's a pretty

221
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:31,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">useful way to look at again attacker and</font>

222
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:33,229
victim and I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> lock talk a</font>

223
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,000
little about technology-based solutions

224
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:37,010
and so there's all of these it's been

225
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,559
great actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think five years ago</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

226
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:41,770
was I was I was dying for something that

227
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:44,209
allow me to keep track of all of the

228
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:46,550
thousands of indicators I was trying to

229
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:48,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">deal with and had no central way to say</font>

230
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:50,089
yes this showed up on this threat feed

231
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:53,420
this day and went away<font color="#CCCCCC"> on that day and</font>

232
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:54,890
this IP address belongs to this threat

233
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,660
group but not that threat group and oh

234
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:58,490
by the way it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the all of those little</font>

235
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">pieces of information there's tools now</font>

236
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:01,500
to manage that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm</font>

237
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:03,029
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're very good at drawing links</font>

238
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,269
between different pieces of discrete

239
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:08,160
pieces of data the ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm so lots of</font>

240
00:09:06,269 --> 00:09:09,120
link diagrams crits an avalanche are the

241
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,009
ones<font color="#CCCCCC"> that throw out there but there's</font>

242
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,509
like three other ones and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and those are</font>

243
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:15,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">the two ones i'm most familiar with so</font>

244
00:09:12,509 --> 00:09:16,319
that's the ones i'll refer to and then

245
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:18,720
there's a big data based approaches

246
00:09:16,319 --> 00:09:20,880
where people has<font color="#E5E5E5"> to or ridiculous truly</font>

247
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,120
ridiculous amounts of data to and try

248
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">and build analytics to find things and</font>

249
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,500
and I'm kind of amazed sometimes by the

250
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:30,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">the size of some of these efforts</font>

there's been a few one company<font color="#CCCCCC"> he was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">caning indefinitely and just keep</font>

261
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:53,370
building that because they treat it<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a</font>

262
00:09:50,579 --> 00:09:57,120
giant data analytics problem to find

white papers things to help you make

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,008
<font color="#CCCCCC">decisions where someone else takes all</font>

266

of these different<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and and</font>

267

distills it down to something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

actually people can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a decision on</font>

so kill chain really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really simple the</font>

idea that there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of steps in an</font>

intrusion and that it's it's not about

272
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,949
and this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most common common</font>

273
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,709
misconception it's not about<font color="#CCCCCC"> defense in</font>

00:10:19,949 --> 00:10:24,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">depth it's not about being able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to break</font>

it early on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kill chain it's a way</font>

276
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:28,860
for modeling how the adversary is

00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:32,910
dependent on infrastructure to attack

278
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:35,250
you every step here you can find things

279
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:37,560
about about their their method<font color="#E5E5E5"> of attack</font>

00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:39,990
whether it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> specific you know some</font>

something he had to you had to go ahead

287

<font color="#E5E5E5">and own someone's box and confirm it was</font>

had to do the research<font color="#E5E5E5"> for some sort of</font>

290
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,500
exploit and ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that no one else was</font>

291
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:04,138
using it and that it was that that was

292
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,579
likely to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get past whatever it was every</font>

293
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:08,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">little piece of this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> represents someone</font>

294
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:10,800
someone some piece of work so by by

295
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:12,230
treating it as<font color="#E5E5E5"> discrete columns of</font>

296
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,390
information you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

297
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:17,720
art drawing connections because

298
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:19,550
replacing any of these chunks takes work

299
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,640
for the attacker so they're they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

300
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:24,349
inclined to replace pieces so if you can

301
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,900
find ways to draw connections you can

302
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,670
draw conclusions about the attacker so

303
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,750
you have your<font color="#CCCCCC"> first alert and the reason</font>

304
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,860
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> through this is because I'm</font>

305
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,720
going to use this data and some of the

306
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:34,850
later presentations I know you most of

307
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,830
you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have something your</font>

308
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:39,410
email e-mail fires on a system says hey

309
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:42,710
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> stopped something that was bad that's</font>

310
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:44,569
it that's all you got some summer

311
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:45,740
memory-based exploit and so you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

312
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,180
research<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say oh it looks like an</font>

313
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:50,330
email came in and he clicked on this

314
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:51,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">Excel document and and there's something</font>

315
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:53,780
in it that maybe was bad and actually

316
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:55,750
this is a this is a poor example<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mixed</font>

317
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:58,640
in when I was drawing this i mixed two

318
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:59,840
two alerts obviously an<font color="#E5E5E5"> excel macro</font>

319
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,520
based exploits probably not going to

320
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,230
give you an email log but bear with

321
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:06,170
maybe ideas that there's some connection

322
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:08,360
between the two and you and you have no

323
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:09,800
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> how they how the recons tied to it</font>

324
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,660
you you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't guess about web</font>

325
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,339
blogs or something that that might have

326
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:16,459
been connected<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning</font>

327
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:19,370
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so then you do a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> research and</font>

328
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:21,260
you reverse engineer the actual mahler

329
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:22,940
and say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if this thing actually ran</font>

330
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:24,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">its you know or maybe put in a sandbox</font>

331
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:26,900
probably not reverse engineering at this

332
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:29,120
point figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know oh it's going</font>

333
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">to leave this registry entry and you</font>

334
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,210
have this service and it'll connect to

335
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:34,220
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build a signature</font>

336
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:37,670
on it so you build a a picture of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

337
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:39,560
this entire each chunk here represents

338
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:43,430
some part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the adversaries</font>

339
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:45,170
infrastructure so then you start doing

340
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:47,780
you start building<font color="#CCCCCC"> up a long picture of</font>

341
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:50,030
a different attacks and you start

342
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:51,890
getting you know you say hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> I triggered</font>

343
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:54,620
on this signature here i found<font color="#E5E5E5"> an IP in</font>

344
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:55,970
a URL<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then I walked back couldn't</font>

345
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,440
figure out the<font color="#E5E5E5"> exploit because I don't</font>

346
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:59,060
actually keep track of my I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

347
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,190
full packet capture so I have no idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

348
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:03,290
was actually in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found a</font>

349
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:05,420
little bit of information from this may

350
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:06,890
be a different flash attack here I found

351
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">something in the registry perhaps and</font>

352
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:10,280
based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on some other signature and so you</font>

353
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:12,500
start building<font color="#CCCCCC"> this picture of different</font>

354
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:15,530
chunks of adversary activity and then

355
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:17,480
the day comes when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you when you spot the</font>

356
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:19,490
link when you say hey this IP address

357
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,650
here that you know that looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

358
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:22,760
forwarding you know some IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

359
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:25,569
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> forwarded from happens to be the</font>

360
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:27,700
same that was an exfil IP use

361
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:29,020
a year later or six<font color="#E5E5E5"> months later and</font>

362
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,820
sometimes they're completely unrelated

363
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:33,819
but sometimes you start drawing the tie

364
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:35,560
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I said attackers are cheap if</font>

365
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:38,440
they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to read their cheap and</font>

366
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:40,660
lazy if they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to rebuild</font>

367
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:45,400
infrastructure or rebuild code they

368
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:46,990
won't so we get here and n we and we

369
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,400
dumped<font color="#E5E5E5"> it into crits or something else</font>

370
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:50,260
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we model it and say look these this</font>

371
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">two IPS it'll actually show up as one IP</font>

372
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:53,470
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've left him with both colors to</font>

373
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,960
represent hey there's two different

374
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:57,250
discrete events and they're tied to

375
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,900
these different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things there's some sort</font>

376
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:00,340
of linkage between all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

377
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,870
different things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that tells us hey</font>

378
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:04,720
there's there's a chance the next time I

379
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:06,070
look at you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I spot this thing that</font>

380
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe it's tied</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to these and we use</font>

381
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:09,280
these beautiful link diagrams and these

382
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:13,120
big repositories of historical

383
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:16,050
information to find where what the tie

384
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,100
is does something happened previously

385
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:19,870
another way of looking at this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

386
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:22,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">diamond model and so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is and I've</font>

387
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:24,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">saved if there's any one piece of</font>

388
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">information that informs talk most was</font>

389
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:29,620
thinking about the diamond model and how

390
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:32,620
how we r we don't seem<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus on that</font>

391
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:36,060
part of it very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much and so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

392
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:38,860
work of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sergio</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> caltagirone and</font>

393
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:40,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">Christopher bets and Andrew Pendergrast</font>

394
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:43,600
and it's it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> helped me a lot</font>

395
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:45,370
it's really some great<font color="#E5E5E5"> mechanism it</font>

396
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,760
basically says that every piece of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

397
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:52,000
every attacker every attack has these

398
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:53,439
four things associated with it that you

399
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
can't avoid<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that somehow</font>

400
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,180
there's there's a tie between all of

401
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,980
those things and so you can look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

402
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,689
sort of the technology access the idea

403
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:04,750
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> infrastructure hey they have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

404
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:06,490
own boxes in order to upload things they

405
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:08,530
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to have something that can</font>

406
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:10,660
write the craft their emails and send

407
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:13,510
their emails and they have some

408
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:16,839
capability they have some ability to to

409
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:18,760
write code right exploits embed exploits

410
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,200
package them in some way and send them

411
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">to you and send them to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you so all of</font>

412
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:26,470
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> pieces are associated with the</font>

413
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:29,170
capability piece and then we have this

414
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:30,610
access now in the in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> paint in the</font>

415
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:35,079
original paper it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was described as</font>

416
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:36,670
socio-political and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's I like and they</font>

417
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,050
also refer to as motivation i prefer

418
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,079
looking at that way like what is the

419
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:42,020
motivation why

420
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,580
is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> happening to me and and you can</font>

421
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:45,560
you can make some conclusions here about

422
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:48,020
the adversary you can say hey this this

423
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:51,410
guy seems to reconstitute ip's when we

424
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:52,819
block them really fast and his locale

425
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:56,180
you know there's little hints of locale

426
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:58,190
information linguistically or time zone

427
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:00,650
or something that's embedded in some of

428
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:02,120
the documents hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is really good</font>

429
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:03,829
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really good coat</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know I</font>

430
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,090

<font color="#E5E5E5">of the headers are obscured and was</font>

00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:09,410
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> tough and it seemed to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be sandbox</font>

433
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,880
aware and you can guess maybe there's

434
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:13,430
there's a pattern you know all of the

435
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:16,520
attacks come in UTC plus a tour<font color="#E5E5E5"> plus</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

436
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:17,510
or whatever it is that makes you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go okay</font>

437
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,740
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that thing that's tied to</font>

438
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:21,410
something so you draw some conclusions

439
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:22,370
about the attacker and hopefully that

440
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,930
lets you tell you something about

441
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:26,180
motivation but if you don't know about

442
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:30,219
the victim you don't necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

443
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:34,609
what the motivation is like what is that

444
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:36,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">so with all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these tools why do socks</font>

445
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:39,380
have trouble because they do they're

446
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:41,420
horribly overloaded part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

447
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:44,960
because we we all like the puzzle we

448
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:47,120
love the art of having to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out why</font>

449
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,860
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> small where came in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this time and</font>

450
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,270
how it exploited why we didn't see it

451
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:53,210
and all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> those doesn't puzzle pieces</font>

452
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:55,220
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Josh on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the in the keynote speech</font>

453
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:59,240
talked about motivation the motivations

454
00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:01,310
of hackers or white hats and the puzzler

455
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:04,310
and so a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of us I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think most of us</font>

456
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:06,109
have that to a certain extent it like

457
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:08,208
focusing on the internal stuff is boring

458
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:10,490
it really is you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus on the</font>

459
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:15,050
third post on the outside we're unsure

460
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:16,910
of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prioritize there is every</font>

462
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:20,930
the hardest<font color="#E5E5E5"> part is getting someone to</font>

463
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:22,820
commit to know what's really important

464

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you what do you want me to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> focus on</font>

465
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:27,349
and and we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have rules that help</font>

466
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,570
analysts do that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just doesn't make</font>

467
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:31,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">sense</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to many of the analysts it doesn't</font>

468
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:32,899
make sense and I a part of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is work</font>

469
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,580
we're our own worst enemies sock

470
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,880
managers are part of the problem

471
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:39,889
sometimes because they're so scared<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

472
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,260
getting of missing something that they

473
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:44,720
can't decide that there's a priority<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

when I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to force the</font>

information sometimes it's better just

to say I accept this I'm reimaging and

because you don't have time we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">got at you why you got hacked so you can</font>

chain analysis helps you with root cause

00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:16,449
a lot too but<font color="#CCCCCC"> sometimes you spent way</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">part of the ratio</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has been roughly on</font>

the order you know of anywhere between

00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:39,550
socks are always going to be maybe 125

thousand one to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten thousand internal</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">250 thousand users</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worldwide and in</font>

538
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,630
talk about what the limitations are

00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,860
all of the all of these actually go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

540

to store a second all of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

we we have too much<font color="#CCCCCC"> too there's there's</font>

a we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> overlooked we're overwhelmed</font>

544

with the amount of choices we have to

make and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to narrow these</font>

546
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:26,300
things down so some initial steps to

00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:28,830
start including targeting information

548
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:30,629
into your sock processes are pretty

549
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:33,870
straightforward and some of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd have</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to say probably most socks do a couple</font>

sometimes not sometimes it's accidental

sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's deliberate build into</font>

of keeping all of your DHCP logs forever

and all of your ad and every ad group

560

change forever and all of the all of

ever forever is it seems like an

563
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:10,260
expensive pain in the ass but<font color="#E5E5E5"> compared</font>

browsing logs it's actually not that bad

00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:17,010
it's actually it's often less data and

567

this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the data that starts giving</font>

00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:22,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">about internal context so you have to</font>

570
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,290
commit to<font color="#E5E5E5"> gathering data about your</font>

571
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,760
internal environment so there's some

572
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:28,770
really simple approaches that are just

573
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:32,580
that you can most most<font color="#CCCCCC"> socks do early on</font>

574
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:34,800
anyhow because it helps them use use

575
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:36,960
these existing repositories of data this

576
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:40,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">is just existing systems of record and</font>

577
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,090
and get them into your device integrate

578
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:43,889
it into alerting at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> simplest you</font>

579
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:46,080
know if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have a list of</font>

580
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:48,630
directors and above and didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bend</font>

581
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,370
domain admins and unix admins and make

00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:52,350
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get put a little flag next to</font>

the mountain<font color="#E5E5E5"> your ziam your step ahead</font>

584
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:57,870
of the rest that's at the very basic

585
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,370
this is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the one that's that's</font>

586
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:00,719
really troubling to a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

587
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:02,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">think which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the idea of knowing your</font>

588
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,930
knowing<font color="#E5E5E5"> who your internal targets aren't</font>

589
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:05,550
advanced I say targets there it sounds

590
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:08,880
external<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm saying about us about that</font>

591
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:10,740
you you the defender there's two really

592
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,100
radically different perspectives here

593
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:16,470
the what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the outsider sees of you and</font>

594
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,260
what you know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself and you</font>

595
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:21,010
have to treat

596
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:23,379
differently because the depending on who

597
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:25,420
the adversary is they may<font color="#E5E5E5"> really not</font>

598
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:26,860
have any<font color="#E5E5E5"> good idea of internal they</font>

00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:29,260
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have internal knowledge yet</font>

600
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:31,300
and so they are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a very</font>

00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:33,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">similar view of you to what a pen test</font>

look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the outside is part of</font>

the deliverable to the sock into the

610
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:52,480
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data that lets you say hey</font>

611
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:55,659
the outside world thinks I'm exposed

612
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:58,000
here so all of the the the pen testers

613
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:59,770
view of you needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be part of the sock</font>

614
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,720
data set it shouldn't be part of the

615
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:03,340
extent be part of the pen testing group

616
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,550
or the compliance group I mean it's both

617
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:07,990
but you need to use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then there's</font>

618
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:09,280
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internal knowledge perspective</font>

619
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:13,090
from the outside that looks like your

620
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:14,920
R&D group is in Detroit Michigan and in

621
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:15,820
the reality<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all the folks doing</font>

622
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,350
through the really<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font>

623
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:20,679
scientific work and doing all the

624
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:22,209
engineering is in Indonesia but from the

625
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:25,060
perspective of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the papers that are</font>

626
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:29,320
written and the the descriptions on your

627
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:32,950
website it's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> Detroit so it may make</font>

628
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:35,550
more sense to focus on the Detroit it

629
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:37,930
may make sense to focus on the Detroit

630
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:42,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">target as the place to maybe look a</font>

631
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:43,690
little closer the route is though as as

632
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,070
an adversary gets to know you better

633
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:47,050
they're going to know soon enough that

634
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:48,730
actually all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the cool IP that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

635
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:51,070
want to steal is actually living on some

636
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:53,380
engineers desktop in Indonesia it's not

637
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:59,770
living in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the research scientists desk</font>

638
00:23:53,380 --> 00:24:02,080
in Detroit<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the last is is obviously</font>

639
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:03,639
changes the instant healing process like

640
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,439
that's the fundamental part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

641
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:07,690
that you can't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this unless you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> change</font>

642
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:11,650
the decisions you make along the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

643
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:14,200
each incident so I had my my simplified

644
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:18,040
version of an incident response process

645
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:19,240
there and and so that this I talked a

646
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,070
little bit about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in that detect</font>

647
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,350
phase the simplest thing you can do is

648
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:25,570
making sure you're incorporating target

649
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:27,730
information into whatever your alerting

650
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:29,050
mechanism is it's a probably going to be

651
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:31,500
a rule in as<font color="#CCCCCC"> IAM but it might be</font>

652
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:34,240
something else

653
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:36,490
right here if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can change how you</font>

654
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,020
prioritize events based on target

655
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:40,240
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make your life so</font>

656
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:42,730
much easier when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred</font>

657
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,560
events that come in within an hour<font color="#E5E5E5"> every</font>

658
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:47,770
hour and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you only have enough analysts</font>

659
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:49,929
to do 50 if you if all<font color="#E5E5E5"> else is equal</font>

660
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:52,030
choose something to prioritize it and

661
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:54,510
and if you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to drop 50</font>

662
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:56,740
drop 50 that aren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the target list</font>

663
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:59,280
it's a lot easier that way it gives you

664
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:02,170
a tool to shed work and focus which as

665
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:04,180
an analyst at<font color="#CCCCCC"> krave</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I crave the ability</font>

666
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:08,140
to know hey I need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus on this I</font>

667
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:10,540
cannot worry about that during<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

668
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:12,670
analysis phase you need to be analyzing

the target as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> as all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of them all</font>

670
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:16,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">where an exploit stuff and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and more</font>

671
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:19,240
importantly that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data about that</font>

672
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:20,980
analysis it can't be lost it has to be

673
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,970
part of your big data solution that

674
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:24,760
you're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> to record all your</font>

beautiful<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS HTTP Netflix or whatever</font>

676
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,510
it is when you make a note saying oh

677
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,820
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy's actually a research scientist</font>

678
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:33,129
you know whatever his name is in

679
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:35,919
Indonesia or in Detroit that that data

680
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:38,140
needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go in into your permanent data</font>

681
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:40,960

682
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:42,040
comes up it's flagged somewhere that

00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,340
there's when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do that little</font>

00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:48,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">fred was targeted by this attack two</font>

686
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:50,620
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago and here's the notes we had on</font>

00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:52,750
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> or even better this organizational</font>

00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:55,149

other incidents in this organizational

unit and here's the notes about that you

691
00:25:56,830 --> 00:26:01,060
need you need to basically include that

692
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:02,530
in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> analytic storage and that's</font>

693

actually perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> more hear about the</font>

00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:42,130
penny you know if it's a shared if it's

711
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:43,180
a lab pc for example and being able to

712
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:44,530
say hey these are these are

713
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:46,180
people or working in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

714
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:48,850
organization that tells you something

715
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:50,140
and then there's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other pieces all of</font>

716
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:52,540
a sudden you get added you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:56,260
who's the actual user specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> beatsie</font>

718
00:26:52,540 --> 00:27:00,340
and other things so tying in those

719
00:26:56,260 --> 00:27:02,560
pieces of of target information in your

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,610
you're having to look at and allows you

723

to make decisions<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that that</font>

724
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:15,189

725
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:16,870
is here all of a sudden we have this

726
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:19,510
other information about the specific

727
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:20,949
business unit or PC or user that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:23,110
associated<font color="#CCCCCC"> with these pair of attacks</font>

729
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:25,510
and for the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> time we maybe have a</font>

730
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:27,610
chance at drawing a conclusion about

731
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:29,379
motivation and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> value</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

732
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:31,719
understanding the motivation is that it

733
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:33,700
finally gives it both<font color="#CCCCCC"> it sheds a little</font>

734
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:36,460
bit of light potentially on this you

735
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:38,920
know it's it's a bit of a risky it's a

736
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:40,480
risky thing because you're using<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

737
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,890
business unit to draw conclusions about

738

up<font color="#CCCCCC"> here but sometimes sometimes</font>

739
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:49,690
sometimes that's valid and and then that

740
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:51,670
then can inform more effectively the the

741
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:53,380
sorts of decisions you make going

742
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:55,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">forward hey I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to really bump up</font>

743
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:57,040
the alerting on these three business

744
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:58,690
units because that really seems to be

745
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:01,870
the primary motivation of this adversary

746
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:04,060
that's been targeting us every summer so

747
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:05,649
the advanced options are fairly are

748
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:07,409
probably not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be too surprising</font>

749
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:09,760
to all of you which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is basically</font>

actively analyzing your internal groups

treat your internal network as an

752
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:18,340
intelligence problem hey I'm noticing a

pattern of increasing 00 day activity

763

you have to draw those little bits<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

are what those are the link diagram

768

00:28:54,700 --> 00:29:00,550
bit about the

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:02,949
talk a little bit about<font color="#E5E5E5"> perhaps there</font>

there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are even internal groupings so</font>

774
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:07,240
like use group<font color="#E5E5E5"> information to to create</font>

775
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:09,070
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those links and so the risk here</font>

776
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:11,230
is that when you do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> it can get</font>

777
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:12,850
pretty you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get pretty fuzzy fast and</font>

778
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:15,250
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that's necessarily</font>

779
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:16,810
yields immediate results but in the long

780
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:18,250
term it helps you draw<font color="#CCCCCC"> that picture hey</font>

781
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:20,919
these are shared business units you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

782
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:22,270
to include the internal units some some

783
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,410
groups do a good job of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it</font>

784
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:24,820
seems a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little foreign to use the</font>

785
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:29,770
threatened tool tool to track your

786
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:32,139
internal data spaces this is kind of

787
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:36,300
controversial<font color="#E5E5E5"> this works more in the in</font>

788
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:41,020
a highly regulated non privacy conscious

789
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:44,290
country the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tracking a internal</font>

790
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:46,240
users connections as a way as part of

791
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:48,580
those connection diagrams because I

792
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,100
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of you have jive or</font>

793
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:52,720
some other similar social networking

794
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:54,280
tool that's internally built and you

795
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,260
build connections side of company I

796
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,730
think most companies of a like a

797
00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:00,129
thousand or more start having those

798
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:02,410
sorts of things mine your internal

799
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:05,380
network for those connections between

800
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:07,720
people because if they're not be able to

801
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:08,890
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> things or an active directory but</font>

802
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:13,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">you may find it in the social</font>

803
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:15,760
connections and this of course is the

804
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:17,620
fundamental thing all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that data don't</font>

805
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,810
don't don't necessarily treat the

806
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:22,209
attacker data separate from the target

807
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:23,050
data now you have to tag it you have to

808
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:25,000
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it closer you don't get yourself</font>

809
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:26,950
confused that<font color="#E5E5E5"> your think one's an attack</font>

810
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,390
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and target but the idea is</font>

811
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:30,220
that they should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be part of a common</font>

812
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:32,860
data set that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can query and pivot on</font>

813
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:34,990
together that you can make a query for

814
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:36,639
something that includes both of some

815
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:40,860
sort of selection based on target and

816
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:43,270
some sorts of selection based on victim

817
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:44,620
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the this is the feed but when</font>

818
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:46,210
you've tried doing this when you tried

819
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:48,610
pushing socks in this direction and

820
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:50,800
again these<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are basic like the</font>

821
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:52,840
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are these are socks that were just</font>

822
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:56,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of nascent and we're trying to give</font>

823
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:58,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">them the tools to do this it's amazing</font>

824
00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:00,730
how comfortable people were with

825
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:03,460
ambiguity on about about attacker

826
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:05,890
information well we know the CHC to IP

827
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:08,230
might be bad or might not be we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

828
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:09,280
accept that we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> treat it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 5050</font>

829
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:11,260
it's bad

830
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are incredibly confident</font>

about or comfortable<font color="#E5E5E5"> dealing with</font>

00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:17,610
ambiguity outside the organization but

833
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:21,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">they resist accepting it internally I</font>

834
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:24,070
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> like knock-down drag-out arguments</font>

with a with a sock architect about

839
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,790
well it's out of date I'm like yeah I

840
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,780
know it's out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of date you know is it is</font>

841
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:39,340
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> percent on a date is</font>

842
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:40,720
everything inaccurate yeah clearly don't

843
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:42,970
use it but is it fifty percent out of

844
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,610
date ten percent help me understand and

845
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:47,080
the reality<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it wasn't that out of</font>

846
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:48,459
date you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's there's like</font>

847
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,810
twenty percent of the internal network

848
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:51,910
that wasn't covered<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe twenty percent</font>

849
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:54,399
of it was wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> but he couldn't he could</font>

850
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:58,210
not stomach the idea of using known

851
00:31:54,400 --> 00:32:01,660
flawed data in his model in his modeling

852
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:04,060
of priority internally and I think maybe

853
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:06,700
a cultural thing too I definitely have

854
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:11,290

00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:14,920
to using known flawed sources using

856
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:17,080
allowing ambiguity in Germany they want

857
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,980
yes or no<font color="#E5E5E5"> they want a clear criteria to</font>

858
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,199
make a decision least that was my

859
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:21,880
perception with with the companies there

860
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:25,270
that wasn't always there in the Middle

861
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:26,500
East there's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more comfort</font>

862
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:28,690
with the idea of ambiguity saying yeah

863
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:30,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">we can get a little bit boost of our</font>

864
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:33,520
ability to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make decisions that's good</font>

865
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:35,830
enough even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not perfect this is</font>

866
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:37,690
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that sock that sock manager who</font>

867
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:39,399
demanded that we treat all malware

868
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:40,330
equally and<font color="#E5E5E5"> his fundamental there's two</font>

869
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:43,060
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> driving and one was</font>

870
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:44,649
egalitarianism we can't treat VIPs and

871
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:46,720
administrators different from internal

872
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:48,580
users and the second was they could

873
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,680
attack anywhere and we can't assume that

874
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:53,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">just because it's on a high value system</font>

875
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:55,690
it's you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know or a high value person or</font>

876
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:58,060
or not that one is more important than

877
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:59,920
the other and that's absolutely true you

878
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:02,110
know that the first point of entry may

879
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:04,540
just may be a random<font color="#E5E5E5"> person and then</font>

880
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:06,070
they move laterally which is good

881
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:07,810
argument for making sure you have

882
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:09,659
instrumentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> deeper in your network</font>

883
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:12,669
so you can pick up the lateral movement

884
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:15,130
because the target of lateral movement

885
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:16,900
is also a target and so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

886
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:18,790
the triggers on those<font color="#E5E5E5"> high-value targets</font>

887
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:22,270
when you see it see their name pop up in

888
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:22,780
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a you know a SMB share</font>

889
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:25,120
some

890
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:26,889
or an attempt to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move to new system or a</font>

891
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,899
specific use of a password when that

892
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:30,550
happens if you happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

893
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:33,790
instrumentation deep in your network

894
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:35,710
you'll pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> up that new connection that</font>

895
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:37,780
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey this is one of my high-value</font>

896
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:41,740
targets and something bad happened you

897
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:44,620
may not<font color="#CCCCCC"> care about weird weird SMB</font>

898
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:46,210
traffic for regular users but these

899
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:53,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">eight scientists you'll actually take a</font>

900
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:56,020
little look at whatever it is this is a

901
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:59,050
some people say well why would we want

902
00:33:56,020 --> 00:34:01,600
to include<font color="#E5E5E5"> our old</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cmdb data in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our old</font>

903
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:03,220
CMD data in the database I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

904
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,760
get it why<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just wipe it clean</font>

905
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:08,770
every time we get updates and so the

906
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:10,179
temptation<font color="#E5E5E5"> is again we crave the</font>

907
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:11,620
knowledge about our internal systems why

908
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:15,310
would I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to include old active</font>

909
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:16,989
directory information because a being

910
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:18,790
able to do retrospective analysis is

911
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:20,529
pretty fundamental to figuring out<font color="#E5E5E5"> why</font>

912
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:23,110
something happened I can't tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you how</font>

913
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:24,640
many alerts where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found something bad</font>

914
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:27,010
we found a found a new piece of malware

915
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,960
and a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> see to Hydra IP address and</font>

916
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:31,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">then we go back and say oh wow these</font>

917
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:34,750
four systems over here a beacon to their

918
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:36,158
six months ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you don't know</font>

919
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:38,080
what things looked like at that point

920
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,460
it's harder to draw a conclusion so

921
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:41,739
don't throw away your old data just<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

922
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:43,210
sure you tag it hey actor directly

923
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:46,449
looked like this on this date and look

924
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:47,590
like this on that date<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this so this</font>

925
00:34:46,449 --> 00:34:50,290
is the last one this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> one I struggle</font>

926
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:56,350
with the most is because no particularly

927
00:34:50,290 --> 00:35:00,330
in the works council centric you privacy

928
00:34:56,350 --> 00:35:03,480
rules regulations German datenschutz

929
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:08,049
pressures all of those things drive a

930
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:10,090
good desire to protect the internal

931
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:11,830
people within a company and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

932
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:14,230
looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> an awful lot like you're targeting</font>

933
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:16,270
your internal users and that you're

934
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:18,640
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do something to them not for</font>

935
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:20,530
them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if there's a way that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

936
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:23,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">can if there's a way that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can reduce</font>

937
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:25,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">that reduce you know reduce that you may</font>

938
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make compromises on it this this</font>

939
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:30,520
is honestly the one I struggle with the

940
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:33,250
most on a few a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> occasions we haven't</font>

941
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:35,600
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to do target centric tracking</font>

942
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:37,940
because of this and in some cases

943
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,500
we had a works council that was really

944
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:41,930
willing to have that discussion and

945
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:43,520
willing to allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to do a little bit</font>

946
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:44,779
more once they understood and<font color="#E5E5E5"> understood</font>

947
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,620
that it was fully auditable and

948
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:51,080
reviewable by them as well as us so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

949
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:53,210
probably finished too early with

950
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:57,259
apologies which is good because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would</font>

951
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:59,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">love feedback and so so my questions to</font>

952
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:01,730
you that I would really appreciate you

953
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:04,399
being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to me about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it did</font>

954
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:06,110
this help you at all do you do any of

955
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">you shared a perception of these gaps</font>

956
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:11,210
like do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have you seen similar</font>

957
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,830
problems in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your own organizations have</font>

958
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:14,270
you seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> people using some of these</font>

959
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:15,980
techniques in your environments because

960
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:17,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have a limited data set I've seen you</font>

961
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:19,070
know like said maybe 10 or 20 Sox where

962
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:21,770
I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen it haven't seen too many</font>

963
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:24,200
papers about using internal threat

964
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:25,580
intelligence tools I mean look external

965
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,350
threat intelligent tools internally but

966
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:30,860
I suspect that there's probably someone

967
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:32,240
who's doing similar things already what

968
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:34,370
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> problems do you see that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,540
missing<font color="#E5E5E5"> here because i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure the these</font>

970
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:38,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">are the problems i saw i didn't have a</font>

00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:39,800
long list is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the resistance usually</font>

972
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:42,920
wasn't too high because it's an it's an

973
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:44,900
easy step to take and what would if

974
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:47,170
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a follow-on work to this what</font>

you're doing a internally eternally

00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:34,440
so did it help yes do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I share you a</font>

989
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:36,779
perception right I mean I'm having a

990
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:39,600
hard time hearing you let's get a little

991
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:41,850
bit louder I share your perception what

992
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:44,910
are other problems you see I see the

993
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:46,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem use you mentioned we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

994
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:49,859
penetration tests and we have no

995
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:52,560
standard where you can automatically dig

996
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:54,540
into the results of the penetration test

997
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:57,620
for a third for example so we can export

998
00:37:54,540 --> 00:38:00,360
it to a third and they can somehow

999
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:05,180
consider it yeah so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a standard</font>

1000
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:08,220
missing which is above all technologies

1001
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:10,169
vendor-independent where any penetration

1002
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:13,200
tester can put its results into a

1003
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:14,640
database I think I think that's true<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1004
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,109
think i<font color="#CCCCCC"> would i would i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think i would</font>

1005
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:19,560
start maybe if I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to guess would be</font>

1006
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:20,790
would say that both recon ng and multi

1007
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,620
go do a pretty good job of giving

1008
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:25,230
formatted output if you want that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1009
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:26,940
that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a piece of the attacker</font>

1010
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:29,250
perspective admittedly it's just a small

1011
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:30,960
chunk but it but it's it's good at if

1012
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:33,570
you can figure out it can consume both

1013
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,520
of you both of those and literally recon

1014
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:38,520
ng can be just a list of email addresses

1015
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:40,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">and a list of domain names as much as</font>

1016
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:42,630
anything else and so you can it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

1017
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:45,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">necessarily</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be a lot of work to</font>

1018
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:46,650
import that but so but i but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i hear your</font>

1019
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:48,530
point there is no standard way of doing

1020
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:51,630
it you have to take a shortcut and do it

1021
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:54,060
because from my experience there is the

1022
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:56,940
results of any penetration tests are in

1023
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:59,520
a doc document and there's simply not

1024
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:02,250
possible so it needs something like an

1025
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:04,950
xml HTML output you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> import you can</font>

1026
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:06,150
parse<font color="#CCCCCC"> i agree that's why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i was one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1027
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:08,189
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mentioned is that you have</font>

1028
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:10,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">to push for like a lot of a lot of pen</font>

1029
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:12,750
testing groups will be willing to give

1030
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:15,240
you working papers and presumably they

1031
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:17,250
have as part of it those recon<font color="#E5E5E5"> ng</font>

1032
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,870
results or something else in some some

1033
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:20,430
form of output so hopefully that that

1034
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:22,529
can do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's that has a lot</font>

1035
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:24,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do with a company's relationship with</font>

1036
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:26,430
a pen testing team and that the signed

1037
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:30,200
agreement the willingness<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give up</font>

1038
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:30,200
data the raw data

1039
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:37,660
thanks for the great talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see that a</font>

1040
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:41,500
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this introspection would rely on</font>

1041
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:44,649
logging essentially but new attack

1042
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:47,710
methods move to towards in-memory

1043
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:50,590
attacks which are quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to log</font>

1044
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:52,870
and forensically analyzed and I wonder

1045
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:57,070
if you have some comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> on those</font>

1046
00:39:52,870 --> 00:40:02,200
developments like PowerShell so I think

1047
00:39:57,070 --> 00:40:06,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I agree it's getting tougher</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1048
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:08,350
pick up indicators on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> endpoints in</font>

1049
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:09,850
particular because the<font color="#CCCCCC"> NMM reissue the</font>

1050
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:12,040
fact that folks are willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give up</font>

1051
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:13,779
persistence because they know<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have</font>

1052
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:16,029
a good drive by download that they'll

1053
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:17,980
get they'll get a the pop a new shell

1054
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:20,080
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next week if they just wait or</font>

1055
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:26,430
VD<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are forcing people to just accept</font>

1056
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:26,430
the fact that persistence is useless<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I</font>

1057
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:32,200
come long ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the network</font>

1058
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:34,090
background so ultimately if you can't if

1059
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can't find it on the endpoint easily</font>

1060
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:37,060
you have to go back to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1061
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:39,970
lot of our indicators are network

1062
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:43,720
centric and and the network centricity

1063
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:45,310
of indicators works also for further the

1064
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,750
victims like the victims are often they

1065
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:48,640
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's characters network-based</font>

1066
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:50,470
characteristics of the victims IP

1067
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,150
addresses where they're located you know

1068
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:55,029
system is tied to a person for a given

1069
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:57,190
time period so you can if you if you're

1070
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:59,110
forced away from the endpoint log data

1071
00:40:57,190 --> 00:41:01,060
you have to rely on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ties of the</font>

1072
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:02,950
network indicators and then it's then

1073
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:06,060
you end up with a harder problem though

1074
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:09,100
you're absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about it</font>

1075
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:11,440
anything else there are several

1076
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:14,740
companies now shifting into the silk as

1077
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,930
a service business and recapping your

1078
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:20,229
talk you're basically telling<font color="#E5E5E5"> me they</font>

1079
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:21,609
are totally inefficient oh god no<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

1080
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:23,530
hopefully i'm not i'm not saying that

1081
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:26,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">because that's that's because i work for</font>

1082
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:29,050
a company that sells managed security

1083
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:31,180
service and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and i'm actually on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> team</font>

1084
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:33,700
that does that so one of the things

1085
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:35,589
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this isn't a sales pitch for</font>

1086
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:38,020
fire I because that we have flaws just

1087
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:39,640
like any other any other company one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1088
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:42,280
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I loved about fire I is the</font>

1089
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,970
fact that they've built such a good such

1090
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:46,000
good model

1091
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:48,490
of the attackers that they can afford<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1092
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:52,210
give up little knowledge on the target

1093
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:55,240
and so but but with that said the

1094
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:58,180
there's lots of ms<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's SPS that that</font>

1095
00:41:55,240 --> 00:42:00,520
aggressively seek and incorporate

1096
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:02,649
customer data that say hey give me<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1097
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:04,390
know you know hey it's January could you

1098
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:07,510
give me your active directory listing

1099
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:10,810
and your and your you know and your<font color="#CCCCCC"> cmdb</font>

1100
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:14,200
and XXX and they can also track like

1101
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:15,940
track the historical patterns of

1102
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:18,040
compromise well again this isn't just

1103
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:19,960
about knowing being able to know it's

1104
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:22,630
being about being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to analyze so for</font>

1105
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:26,260
example there was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> MSSP not fire I that</font>

1106
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:29,020
had a really great really great sock

1107
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:31,090
workflow engine<font color="#E5E5E5"> that anytime they you</font>

1108
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:32,620
know an internal IP came up in there and

1109
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:35,980
they're in there they're highly

1110
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:37,450
customized version of RT you could get a

1111
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:40,000
nice mouse over and it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> show you</font>

1112
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:41,830
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know context about that I key</font>

1113
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,030
or network based on previous incidents

1114
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:45,759
hey this looks like this is their

1115
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:47,800
internal their turn Adele<font color="#E5E5E5"> you this is</font>

1116
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,990
their data of their data VLAN or this is

1117
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,990
their their their web their web app VLAN

1118
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:55,569
or something so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the idea that</font>

1119
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:56,890
Eva's nemesis p I can also build context

1120
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:59,140
about the customer without the customer

1121
00:42:56,890 --> 00:43:01,839
telling me anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jase based on the</font>

1122
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:04,660
pattern of log events and historical

1123
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:06,190
analysis so I agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you that as a</font>

1124
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:08,049
nemesis p you have a challenge in that

1125
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:09,700
you are one step away from the customer

1126
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:11,560
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are not</font>

1127
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:13,419
dependent on actually having access to

1128
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:15,880
the customer it's about having access to

1129
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:23,340
the data feeds and as a nemesis p you

1130
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:23,340
probably have those anyway anybody is

1131
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,819
thank you very much really appreciate<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>
