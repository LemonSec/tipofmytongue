will

41
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,880

had to retract his talk on cross-site

45
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:37,330
scripting the force awakens it's one of

46
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">the best titles actually that we had but</font>

52
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:58,510

00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:01,240
this point so thanks fight for stepping

54
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:03,329
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so on such short</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> notice apart</font>

55
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,830
from that the schedule<font color="#E5E5E5"> is as it was</font>

56
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:08,440

going<font color="#CCCCCC"> down there it's sort of tricky</font>

66
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,680
especially since the guys outside some

67
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:45,940

candy is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell you a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit</font>

111
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,780
about the batch now but before<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do</font>

112
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:44,270
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> can we please get the round</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

113
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:54,229
applause for candid who spent the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last</font>

114
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:59,240
two nights<font color="#E5E5E5"> flashing those patches so yes</font>

115
00:05:54,229 --> 00:06:02,330
the batches maybe a few words as<font color="#E5E5E5"> Stefan</font>

116
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:05,810
already said some of them might get warm

117
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:08,448
as in very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very hot that's not the</font>

118
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:11,120
fingerprint sanitizer so don't put your

119
00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:13,310
finger on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Wi-Fi chip because well it</font>

120
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,520
will wipe your fingerprint but probably

121
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:19,220
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> your thumb and not from the device</font>

122
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,440
we're not too sure why they're getting

123
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:23,720
hot so please<font color="#E5E5E5"> just exchange it with</font>

124
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,509
another one we assume it's the lanyard

125
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:29,180
which might get a short circuit and some

126
00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:32,870
of the other issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> i might explain on</font>

127
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:36,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">the next slide as well because you know</font>

128
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:38,750
we had two years time to do the batches

129
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:41,360
so obviously we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> last year of</font>

130
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:44,900
course why would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you wait for a last</font>

131
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">minute right did a little longer than</font>

132
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,870
expected

133
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:52,400
that and here's just one of the things

134
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:55,259
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I sent some of the material to</font>

135
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:58,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">locro God who helped as well with the</font>

136
00:06:55,259 --> 00:07:01,620
batches and well I mean you're relying

137
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:03,719
on express landing in Switzerland so you

138
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:07,039
would think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that well it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> getting there</font>

139
00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:10,439
right it went eventually after 24 hours

140
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:13,740
but we saw got misdirected a few times

141
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:16,710
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just one of the examples some</font>

142
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:19,409
of the batteries well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> ordered them in</font>

143
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:22,198
four batches as in four packages three

144
00:07:19,409 --> 00:07:24,449
of them arrived the last one they say my

145
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:28,199
ex and my address doesn't exist anymore

146
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:32,520
I'm not so sure and it's still missing

147
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:35,039
somewhere no idea where and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

148
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,930
helps for the three weeks delay that we

149
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,110
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have plans that in the end the</font>

150
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:44,189
batches arrived a little bit later as in

151
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:46,499
this Wednesday so turns out we were

152
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:49,139
actually flashing and soul during the

153
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:51,990
last patches this morning at five

154
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:56,399
o'clock which might also explain why

155
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:59,430
some of them get a bit warm because<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes</font>

156
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:02,610
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was getting early in the morning so</font>

157
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:05,310
please if it gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> too hot as I exchange</font>

158
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:07,939
it but you don't really care<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that</font>

159
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:11,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">you want to see what's on it right so</font>

160
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:16,259
basically there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Wi-Fi chip an</font>

161
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:18,839
esp8266 12<font color="#E5E5E5"> e which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is basically just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

162
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:22,349
of those funky IOT chips which you can

163
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:24,360
reprogram with<font color="#CCCCCC"> your Arduino IDE or just</font>

164
00:08:22,349 --> 00:08:27,389
in Lua scripts now as well or see

165
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:30,270
whatever you prefer at the moment it's

166
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:33,889
checking in into the separate Wi-Fi

167
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:36,689
network here and checking for specific

168
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:39,360
color patterns so we can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> send</font>

169
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:44,250
you new color patterns down if you like

170
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:47,190
to and you also have two buttons<font color="#E5E5E5"> the two</font>

171
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:50,220
buttons<font color="#E5E5E5"> are for voting so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> haven't</font>

172
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:52,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">really told the speakers yet but well</font>

173
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:55,110
there's always a first<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to</font>

174
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">say that the left button is if you</font>

175
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,840
really like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk and say yes that's</font>

176
00:08:56,699 --> 00:09:00,900
cool

177
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:03,330
and the right button is well could be

178
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:07,640
improved or may be swapped for another

179
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:10,260
one next year so just keep that in mind

180
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:12,810
prestos and we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> gather those for</font>

181
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:14,730
the talks here in room one the on the

182
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:16,469
ground track room<font color="#E5E5E5"> two is still on their</font>

183
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:18,720
own so there you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

184
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:22,020
directly if you don't like it but well

185
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:26,550
please be nice as always you can also

186
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:29,670
find the<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> code online on how to do it</font>

187
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:32,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">so in the agenda there's link with more</font>

188
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:34,560
information but of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> it wouldn't be</font>

189
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,630
a hash days area 41 batch if there

190

191
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:40,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">can do is actually press both buttons at</font>

192
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:44,160
the same time it will flash a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

193
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:47,220
on the blue side and then you have to

194
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:50,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">find the right combination of left and</font>

195
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:53,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">rights they can be up to nine different</font>

196
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:56,189
settings if you find one it will blink

197
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:59,370
green a few times<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it changes your</font>

198
00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:01,320
color pattern so just play a little bit

199
