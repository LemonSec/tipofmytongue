<font color="#CCCCCC">is an application that wasn't in scope</font>

10
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:42,769
at the time but as a result of preparing

11
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:44,360
this talk we we took a look at and then

12
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,620

talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

32
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:37,610
happening in a country fairly far away

33
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:39,320
from here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just so we don't get any</font>

34
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:44,810
confusion we are talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> South</font>

35
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:47,059
Korea but not North Korea and South

36
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:50,810
Korea is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very special country in terms</font>

37
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:52,790
of you usage of new media and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

38
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:57,650
and smartphones I found here<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

39
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:59,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">survey's that show how close to ninety</font>

40
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:02,450
percent of the total population in North

41
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:05,180
Korea South Korea sori are using

42
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:08,060
smartphones and if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the young</font>

43
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:11,239
adults between 18 and 34 years old then

44
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,379
it's basically a hundred percent for

45
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:15,049
this talk it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting</font>

46
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:18,260
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get the smartphone usage of children</font>

47
00:02:15,049 --> 00:02:19,110
and minors teenagers but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I couldn't find</font>

48
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:23,010
the proper sore

49
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:25,260
resources but this will show you that

50
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:27,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is a country</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with a very high</font>

51
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:30,179
smartphone usage and that's why what we

52
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:34,500
will present<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you is so interesting</font>

53
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:36,300
and scary so in late 2014 the<font color="#CCCCCC"> South</font>

54
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,180
Korean government implemented a new

55
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:43,200
child protection law it's basically

56
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:45,720
about parent to protect protection and

57
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,369
monitoring so they implement this law in

58
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,580
the telecommunication and business act

59
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:53,190
where they are saying that mobile

60
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:56,910
network operators have to provide some

61
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:59,250
services or features to adult provide

62
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:03,359
adult content filtering if they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

63
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:05,550
do business with legal minors at that

64
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,680
time it was not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very clear how this is</font>

65
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:09,840
going to look like but a few months

66
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">later they added some implementation</font>

67
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,160
details where they are describing more

68
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:17,700
how the means of the blocking has to

69
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:19,560
look<font color="#CCCCCC"> like so for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example those details</font>

70
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,170
are still very vague but contain things

71
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,570
like that the child and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the parent have</font>

72
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:27,119
to be informed about the means of the

73
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:29,910
blocking and there have to be monthly

74
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:33,060
notifications in case the service is not

75
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:35,730
running or has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been deleted but whatever</font>

76
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,780
this law says in the it's more

77
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:39,959
interesting what happened then in

78
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:42,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">reality and it's now the case that South</font>

79
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:44,820
Korea has this mandatory installation of

80
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:48,090
a surveillance app when you buy a phone

81
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:50,790
for a teenager so if a parent goes into

82
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:54,720
the store<font color="#CCCCCC"> and wants</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to buy a phone the</font>

83
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:56,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">salesperson will install this parental</font>

84
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,830
monitoring application on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the phone even</font>

85
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:02,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">if the parent doesn't want to use it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

86
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:04,560
by law at<font color="#E5E5E5"> first that is required and</font>

87
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,510
there is no opt-out the parent can

88
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,450
choose<font color="#CCCCCC"> not to use it obviously maybe</font>

89
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:11,399
even uninstall it but the default is

90
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:14,070
kind of we put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the phone to be</font>

91
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:18,239
used by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the parent to check on the child</font>

92
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:20,969
and here's like a photo from in front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

93
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,919
a Korean mobile store where they inform

94
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:25,890
their customers about the details of

95
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:27,960
this new law what that they have to

96
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:31,219
install this application and some

97
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:35,419
details<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> law that we should</font>

98
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:37,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">for and this is where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my back comes into</font>

99
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:40,730
play mobile mobile internet business

100
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:43,420
association is a company in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Korea</font>

101
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:46,130
directly funded by the Korean government

102
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:47,870
developing such an application<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

103
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:49,940
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> the go to application that is</font>

104
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:52,640
like from a government directly funded

105
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:56,420
to a piece to this to this law and they

106
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:59,750
gave them a roughly 2.7 million u.s.

107
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:01,670
dollars and along with data obviously

108
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,980
like support hotlines for parents and

109
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:06,320
stuff because what you will see soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

110
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:10,130
like it's crazy how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much money you can</font>

111
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,540
spend on an<font color="#CCCCCC"> application like that but</font>

112
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:14,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">before we head into the technical things</font>

113
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:16,040
just quickly to<font color="#E5E5E5"> point out how this whole</font>

114
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:19,400
project started because this was that

115
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:23,110
started by us at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Q 53 it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

116
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:26,000
open at Korea which is Korean local

117
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:28,730
digital rights human rights organization

118
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,230
that brought this new law that this is

119
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:32,870
happening to the attention of Citizen

120
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:35,060
lab and Citizen lab then did last year

121
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:37,669
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the summer institute with the project</font>

122
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:41,300
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this application and we as an</font>

123
00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:42,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">external company were getting into this</font>

124
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,740
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well to provide an additional</font>

125
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:49,250
technical report on this so these

126
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:50,900
players helped starting this and the

127
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:54,320
open Technology Fund also partially

128
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:56,390
partially funded this whole research so

129
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,490
let's talk about these applications

130
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:00,560
developed by mobile my by developed

131
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:02,270
actually two applications one is smart

132
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,419
sheriff and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other one is smart dream</font>

133
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:07,729
so the yellow one and the green one at

134
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:09,200
the time we were only looking at smart

135
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:12,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">Sheriff because that is like this</font>

136
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:14,599
flagship application by<font color="#E5E5E5"> MOBA but they</font>

137
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:17,450
also developed another one which has a

138
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,220
slightly different purpose the

139
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:21,620
application smart sheriff that we had a

140
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:24,130
look at is about restricting the

141
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:26,240
smartphone usage blocking apps and

142
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:28,010
restricting the time a<font color="#E5E5E5"> child is allowed</font>

143
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">to use it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the other one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is about</font>

144
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:31,849
monitoring SMS and chat message dings we

145
00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:33,650
which sound a little bit more scary and

146
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:36,229
we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some additional info about</font>

147
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:38,150
that towards<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of the talk and you</font>

148
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:40,490
can guess already that the security of

149
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:42,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">smarter is probably very awful that we</font>

150
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:44,720
are standing<font color="#E5E5E5"> here today but I leave you</font>

151
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:47,900
a little bit surprised till the end what

152
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">sup for smart dream so smart sheriff</font>

153
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:52,400
comes in two modes when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> first open</font>

154
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:54,890
it it you can choose either if you are

155
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,140
the parent or the child and as a parent

156
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:59,690
you can look at the usage statistics of

157
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:01,430
your child you can see how much on

158
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:03,740
average they play games and stuff like

159
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:05,690
that in the child mode it will install

160
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:07,880
as a device administrator to obviously

161
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:11,719
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few more privileges regarding or</font>

162
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:14,690
serving the activities on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the phone and</font>

163
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,250
it offers three main features the use

164
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:18,530
time management you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can restrict the</font>

165
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:20,890
usage at certain times not allowing them

166
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:24,169
to be playing games at<font color="#CCCCCC"> night for example</font>

167
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:25,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">or the app management where you can see</font>

168
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:28,040
what kind of applications your child has

169
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:30,409
installed and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> deny access to</font>

170
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:32,510
them and blocking them there's a third

171
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:34,970
tab the website management that is

172
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:37,570
actually disabled in like the admin view

173
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:39,410
but the code is implemented in the

174
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:42,980
application and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the application is</font>

175
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:45,650
acting on when the child tries to serve

176
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:49,669
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> contact certain sites so the code is</font>

177
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:52,159
still there so we started preparing for

178
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:54,680
our first round of pen testing now the

179
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,410
first thing when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> test an application</font>

180
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:00,740
with a beautiful exotic language like

181
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:02,720
Korean is that of course you trying to

182
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:06,320
use they have a you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all these</font>

183
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,120
buttons without as<font color="#E5E5E5"> been you know not in</font>

184
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,860
Koreans it was like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit hard</font>

185
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,990
like what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> its thing do like how do</font>

186
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:15,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">you how do you analyze all these kind of</font>

187
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:20,360
stuff right so how many of you have done

188
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:24,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">any Android reversing okay no not many</font>

189
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:26,360
so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you when you can use</font>

190
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:28,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">this tool like everybody doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Android</font>

191
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:31,610
reversing uses this tool called apktool

192
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:34,070
so this file called strings dot XML and

193
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:36,169
we just took<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Korean file just google</font>

194
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:40,190
translated get the one in<font color="#CCCCCC"> English and</font>

195
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:42,348
then you can pack the APK again and then

196
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:45,890
you get the application working in

197
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:48,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">English right for the most part because</font>

198
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:50,569
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course like if the mobile</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> application</font>

199
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:52,579
makes a request to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> web server for</font>

200
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:55,520
some HTML that is like returning a

201
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,720
normal web page then we had like to like

202
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,279
get it with a

203
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,379
in the middle proxy<font color="#CCCCCC"> then translate that</font>

204
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:03,019
and substitute it so that we can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

205
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:05,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">English for that as well but that's one</font>

206
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:07,910
of the problems that we had to overcome

207
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,470
and another one<font color="#CCCCCC"> was just what some</font>

208
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:11,360
breaking points and some debugging

209
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:14,110
messages so that we knew like<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

210
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:18,319
certain code was going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> accessed so</font>

211
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:20,329
when you reverse a an APK with apktool

212
00:09:18,319 --> 00:09:22,878
you get this Molly code this is the

213
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:24,729
equivalent<font color="#CCCCCC"> Java code for that that's the</font>

214
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:27,379
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is the equivalent and</font>

215
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:29,839
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like added Sam like debugging</font>

216
00:09:27,379 --> 00:09:32,060
messages and things like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you</font>

217
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,069
are into this kind of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> this link at</font>

218
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:35,899
the bottom is quite useful for dalvik

219
00:09:34,069 --> 00:09:40,670
opcodes which is essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> like how</font>

220
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:43,990
with the less human intuitive smiley

221
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:47,329
code how to call like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Java things right</font>

222
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:49,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">so it's useful thing to have for that so</font>

223
00:09:47,329 --> 00:09:53,269
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> all these like we were ready</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

224
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:55,430
start and the first finding was somewhat

225
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:57,529
interesting because we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

226
00:09:55,430 --> 00:10:00,500
JavaScript interface right and a

227
00:09:57,529 --> 00:10:03,889
JavaScript interface in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android on all</font>

228
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:07,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">Android versions from Android 2.4 to</font>

229
00:10:03,889 --> 00:10:10,970
android 4.1 what lets you do is it lets

230
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:13,160
you call<font color="#CCCCCC"> a java classes from javascript</font>

231
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:16,670
right and that should like race a few

232
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:18,889
red flags among you so essentially this

233
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:21,620
was like called code execution on all

234
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:23,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">android versions and the funny</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is</font>

235
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:25,399
like they had this JavaScript interface

236
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:27,680
but they were really not using it for

237
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:30,230
anything it was probably copy pasted

238
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,989
from some beginner like android tutorial

239
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:35,149
something and essentially this was

240
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:38,059
called execution now this is code

241
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:41,059
execution because a mobile phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

242
00:10:38,059 --> 00:10:42,680
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> favored Wi-Fi over the mobile</font>

243
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:46,069
network just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of course these</font>

244
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:48,229
restrictions on mobile networks so you

245
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:51,050
can see like in the in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the code that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

246
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:53,300
showed before<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's like HTTP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and of</font>

247
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:55,128
course there was like no ssl anywhere so

248
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:57,258
it was all like clear text like in this

249
00:10:55,129 --> 00:10:59,180
like sensitive<font color="#E5E5E5"> applications supposed to</font>

250
00:10:57,259 --> 00:11:01,069
protect children like all traffic

251
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:02,599
between the mobile phone to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> servers</font>

252
00:11:01,069 --> 00:11:05,719
like in<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear text over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the network</font>

253
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,490
right so you could imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> like some bad</font>

254
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,839
guy like waiting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the coffee shop for</font>

255
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:09,230
all the children to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of school</font>

256
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:11,750
you

257
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:14,750
and then just get all the all the

258
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:17,230
traffic right and get remote code

259
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:19,970
execution on the phones because of this

260
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:22,580
now another interesting thing is they

261
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:25,070
were not using SSL so all the traffic

262
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:27,710
was and encrypted but some parts of the

263
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:31,130
request maybe they consider sensitive so

264
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:34,720
they encrypt it only<font color="#E5E5E5"> those parts and you</font>

265
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:37,370
can see here I at the left this is the

266
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,590
this is the encrypted phone number and

267
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:44,170
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the unencrypted one now any</font>

268
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:44,170
guess as to what algorithm is being used

269
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:50,449
that's it x or so<font color="#CCCCCC"> xor but of course</font>

270
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:53,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">lexus this is a mobile</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> application the</font>

271
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:56,420
key was on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone so you can get the</font>

272
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:57,770
key and you can explore and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can XR</font>

273
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,660
it's cool because like you can use it

274
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:01,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">for encrypting and decrypting so you</font>

275
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:04,610
only need one function you save some

276
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:07,370
time so maybe that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

277
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:08,780
but the other cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that will give</font>

278
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:11,810
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them is that they put some new</font>

279
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:14,180
characters in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the key maybe with the</font>

280
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:16,099
hope that if somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that runs</font>

281
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:18,400
like the string the strings command on

282
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:21,650
the APK maybe they wouldn't get the key

283
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:24,010
so I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know some speculation or our</font>

284
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:26,660
part maybe that's why they did it and

285
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:28,850
now let me tell you story now this is

286
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:30,319
really funny now let's pretend<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this</font>

287
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:34,310
is an ad is supposed to protect<font color="#CCCCCC"> children</font>

288
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,870
right so let's pretend that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this do you</font>

289
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:37,459
have like a classroom of kids and

290
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:39,590
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one key that is really mean that</font>

291
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:41,870
he he really<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants to screw up the life</font>

292
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:43,760
of every other child on the room and

293
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:45,260
he's like really mean like he wants to

294
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">make the life of all the children</font>

295
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:51,530
miserable right so smart sheriff made an

296
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:53,480
API for this guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the you know for</font>

297
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:56,959
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bully the bully guy you know like</font>

298
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:58,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">the mean guy now this API is really cool</font>

299
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:02,270
for this kind of children that want to

300
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:03,620
abuse others because I mean in life you

301
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:05,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">should always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask questions I mean</font>

302
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:08,090
what's the worst that can happen maybe

303
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:11,060
you don't get an answer but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

304
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:14,660
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the time when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you ask questions</font>

305
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:16,069
like amazing things happen right so and

306
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,230
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example of this right like</font>

307
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:19,139
you asked smart<font color="#E5E5E5"> this merger if API hey</font>

308
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:21,359
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

309
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:24,029
this is the child phone number of the

310
00:13:21,359 --> 00:13:26,309
child<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to mess with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then smart</font>

311
00:13:24,029 --> 00:13:29,069
saves tells you sure this is the parent

312
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:32,608
phone number for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> child member</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

313
00:13:29,069 --> 00:13:34,259
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Buddha guy is yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

314
00:13:32,609 --> 00:13:35,759
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to logging I need the</font>

315
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:37,949
parent number but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also need the</font>

316
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:40,079
password like come on girl give me the

317
00:13:37,949 --> 00:13:42,660
password and then there's mercy I

318
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:45,839
price's sure like why<font color="#CCCCCC"> not I mean you</font>

319
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:48,839
know and then of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> the password is</font>

320
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,639
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> X or encrypted but we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so like we</font>

321
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:53,759
got the key so you can like decrypt it

322
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:56,850
and and yeah I'm well I mean the

323
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:58,799
password<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just like 4k four digit so I</font>

324
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:01,319
mean it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not and there wasn't like any</font>

325
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:02,608
kind of brute force mitigation so it

326
00:14:01,319 --> 00:14:04,229
wouldn't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> like very challenging to</font>

327
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:07,769
brute force it after you got the parent

328
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:10,019
phone but anyway so yeah they invented

329
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:11,459
this API and of course because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what</font>

330
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:14,279
we explained at the beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this</font>

331
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:17,099
is a map for phone restrictions and all

332
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:19,649
these things like it now the this mean

333
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:21,779
guy in the class can like get access to

334
00:14:19,649 --> 00:14:24,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">all the all the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other children's phones</font>

335
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:26,819
like get parent access to control like

336
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,470
when all the kids on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the room can use</font>

337
00:14:26,819 --> 00:14:30,569
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone like which applications they</font>

338
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:34,529
can use and really like mess with them

339
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:36,628
right so technically this is more or

340
00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:39,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">less how the request look like simply</font>

341
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:42,149
like a cross request and then you can

342
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:45,989
see here like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> password</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is using</font>

343
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:49,379
the it's encrypted with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> XOR and then</font>

344
00:14:45,989 --> 00:14:52,139
the part in mobile and this is you know

345
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:53,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">what it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looks like so this is doing the</font>

346
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:55,529
XOR with this with the key that they

347
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:57,269
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> using it was one two three four and</font>

348
00:14:55,529 --> 00:15:00,899
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is like the phone number</font>

349
00:14:57,269 --> 00:15:02,699
unencrypted and encrypted now of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

350
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:04,709
because there are so many users you can

351
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:06,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">just keep trying like random phone</font>

352
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:09,209
numbers and start like guessing<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

353
00:15:06,689 --> 00:15:11,039
parents and parents<font color="#E5E5E5"> and children and get</font>

354
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:14,219
the password of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> child the password</font>

355
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:16,470
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the parent and and all these right</font>

356
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,449
like using the<font color="#E5E5E5"> using the API because</font>

357
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:21,660
it's good to ask questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you</font>

358
00:15:18,449 --> 00:15:24,839
might get an answer another potential

359
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:27,509
abuse case of these api of smart sheriff

360
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:30,269
is of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fig use to fake usage</font>

361
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:32,360
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> i pretend that a child is like</font>

362
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:34,040
searching for<font color="#E5E5E5"> porn so that you know</font>

363
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,440
then the parent who is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get an</font>

364
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:38,120
alert<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the child is going to get</font>

365
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,070
in trouble right but the child hasn't

366
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:44,600
even looked porn it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font>

367
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:47,029
bully is like faking the usage now some

368
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:50,149
API will most API endpoints used a

369
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:52,100
device ID but even<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our public report</font>

370
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:54,620
like we were like in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the demonstration</font>

371
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:56,779
with just using like words like whatever

372
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:59,240
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the device ID because it didn't</font>

373
00:15:56,779 --> 00:16:00,680
matter like what you used so just with

374
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:03,829
knowledge of the phone number<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could</font>

375
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:06,739
like almost API<font color="#E5E5E5"> endpoint sweet liking a</font>

376
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:08,899
couple of exceptions and now this is

377
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:11,899
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a section that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> call why not</font>

378
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:13,339
because I mean we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> like showing</font>

379
00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:15,740
shark like they could<font color="#E5E5E5"> get like three</font>

380
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:18,170
million dollars and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this</font>

381
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:20,029
like all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this mess of application that</font>

382
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:21,649
we like gave up trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand</font>

383
00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:23,029
another with just saying like well why

384
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:25,250
not you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could do it like that like why</font>

385
00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:28,790
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so this is just an example of</font>

386
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:32,540
sloppy coding like you would expect<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

387
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:34,849
when this an<font color="#CCCCCC"> AJAX login request like</font>

388
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:37,310
this I'm like<font color="#CCCCCC"> JSON back saying you know</font>

389
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:39,890
like you are logged in fine or you are

390
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:42,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">not logged in some JSON back so this is</font>

391
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:44,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">the response</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the Ajax</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> request which</font>

392
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,910
instead of returning semjason its return

393
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:49,699
like script tags you know with all the

394
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:51,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">JavaScript and then depending on the</font>

395
00:16:49,699 --> 00:16:54,140
number of tries like<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you were</font>

396
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:56,240
exceeding the number of bad trace then

397
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:59,329
there's this comparison here I will<font color="#CCCCCC"> show</font>

398
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">like a different alert you know so it's</font>

399
00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:04,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">just an example of sloppy code like why</font>

400
00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:08,918
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> now they are another example like</font>

401
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:13,880
tom cat version from 2009 like come<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

402
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:17,329
2009 so why not another example and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

403
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:20,600
this was also quite funny for the web

404
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:24,649
blocking they were using if it contains

405
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:27,079
the you know the host name of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile</font>

406
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:29,360
website then then allow it then the

407
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:31,280
filter won't work now of course you can

408
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,928
get something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this block and just</font>

409
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,850
add a fake parameter you know with

410
00:17:32,929 --> 00:17:38,120
containing that and because contains

411
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:41,418
yeah so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this bypass so it</font>

412
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:43,879
was like really really broken and they

413
00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:45,270
know just to us other examples like you

414
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,190
know development snippets

415
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:51,480
we're like revealing like<font color="#E5E5E5"> internal ip's</font>

416
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:55,170
internal<font color="#E5E5E5"> URLs so in summary like a big</font>

417
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:57,450
pile of shit we found exercise we found

418
00:17:55,170 --> 00:18:00,210
sequel injection on the mobile<font color="#CCCCCC"> lab and</font>

419
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:02,490
safe storage of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> blocking history on</font>

420
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:04,920
the SD card<font color="#E5E5E5"> licking personal data over</font>

421
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:07,170
the API and just don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> take our word for</font>

422
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:09,210
it I mean seriously<font color="#E5E5E5"> just or report is</font>

423
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:12,120
public just go here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you can like</font>

424
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:13,860
read all the gory details but you know

425
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:16,080
that's what happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now for me I</font>

426
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:18,689
will tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> us what happened with the</font>

427
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:21,840
responsible disclosure is the

428
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:24,150
responsible thing to do right so we gave

429
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,760
our technical report to Citizen lab who

430
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:29,760
was in contact with<font color="#CCCCCC"> mobile to do the</font>

431
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:32,190
irresponsible disclosure my way in the

432
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:35,190
beginning also provides on legal threats

433
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:36,630
that's every good company that's what

434
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:39,360
every good company is doing when they

435
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:43,500
receive a responsible disclosure report

436
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:46,199
read but in the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> they agreed and they</font>

437
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:48,030
gave them some days time to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix it i</font>

438
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:51,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it was like 45 days or something</font>

439
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:53,550
then and then my wife<font color="#CCCCCC"> started to react</font>

440
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:55,320
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they started fixing and pushing</font>

441
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:57,629
updates of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the application and releasing</font>

442
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:59,820
press press releases informing their

443
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:01,800
customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> about those updates so here is</font>

444
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:04,350
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first one where they say that they</font>

445
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:08,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">continue to improve the security now by</font>

446
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:10,830
moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ssl and no credits were given</font>

447
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:13,470
to Citizen lab or what the issues were

448
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:16,460
they like make it a bit sound like they

449
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:20,130
discover this and they improve on it a

450
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:22,260
few<font color="#CCCCCC"> days later</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> another update which was</font>

451
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:24,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually quite surprising because now</font>

452
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:26,700
they say that they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deprecate the</font>

453
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:29,550
old version because of security issues

454
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:31,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">and this is as I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said very surprising</font>

455
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:33,750
because the application was so broken

456
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,550
that that seemed to be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only way to</font>

457
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:37,520
go just you know deprecated the old

458
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:41,070
version make it completely new and

459
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,120
correct from the first time and they you

460
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:44,220
know say sorry for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this inconvenience</font>

461
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:46,379
and that you please update and that they

462
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:49,860
continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to strengthen their security</font>

463
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:51,660
and then after the deadline of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

464
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:54,030
responsible disclosure<font color="#E5E5E5"> citizen-led</font>

465
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:56,520
publishes their report and press release

466
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:59,410
in different languages with our

467
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:01,000
technical report attached and so on

468
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:05,430
and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> also got some media attention</font>

469
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:08,650
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Western media as well as Korean media</font>

470
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:11,830
but it was kind of underwhelming there

471
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:14,680
was not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that much controversy about it</font>

472
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:16,929
as we were hoping for if something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

473
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:19,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">this would happen in probably germany</font>

474
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:21,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">then I feel like a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more people would</font>

475
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:24,700
be outraged about it but this went kind

476
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:27,610
of just under it was very view people

477
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:30,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">reporting about it and no real outcry</font>

478
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:33,419
about it so we kind of felt like that we

479
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:37,060
provided mobile with a free pen test

480
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:41,070
instead of providing or taking down an

481
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:43,450
application that is monitoring and

482
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:46,090
invading the privacy of the children we

483
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:49,180
felt like we improved a surveillance

484
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:52,360
application and we felt bad for it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

485
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:56,680
it felt<font color="#CCCCCC"> like it all backfired so we were</font>

486
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:59,860
hurt but ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a second round now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

487
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:02,320
the second round I want you to just very

488
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:06,159
mind like in our first report they were

489
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:08,950
like 22 findings right 22 and this is

490
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:14,980
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> they fixed for okay what does that</font>

491
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:16,540
mean I teen left right so the what did

492
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:19,390
they fix they fix what matters to them

493
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:22,360
so they fix the web filtering contains

494
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:25,020
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I showed before they fix the usage</font>

495
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:27,610
of SSL that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> started using a cell</font>

496
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:29,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">the you know all the development leagues</font>

497
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:31,750
the internal URL so that kind of stuff

498
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:35,530
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> an exercise that we found on the on</font>

499
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:39,550
the website I and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it what's</font>

500
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:43,810
missing here the bully API<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay among</font>

501
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:47,590
the other 18 findings now I said that

502
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:49,030
they fixed as a cell but on Android like

503
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:51,070
this this cool thing that you can like

504
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:53,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">override like how you know things are</font>

505
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:56,290
supposed to work and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can I say well</font>

506
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:58,260
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you receive an ssl error like what</font>

507
00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:00,980
the hell like to proceed anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

508
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:04,200
because why not

509
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:07,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">if there's you know if you try to verify</font>

510
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:10,200
a host then just just return true like

511
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know just returned through like just</font>

512
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:16,020
don't make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it complicated just return</font>

513
00:22:12,029 --> 00:22:18,419
true<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so essentially yeah they were</font>

514
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:21,840
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cell okay we'll give them that</font>

515
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:23,279
but you can like using any like<font color="#E5E5E5"> self</font>

516
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">signed certificate you can mine in the</font>

517
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:26,340
middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the traffic of the</font>

518
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:28,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">application and the application will not</font>

519
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:31,230
complain and everything will go<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

520
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:34,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">through and of course no meaning at all</font>

521
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:40,080
as well so you know a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font>

522
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:42,059
but yeah now this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bully API to</font>

523
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,899
point out so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the original</font>

524
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:49,289
endpoint and is the new endpoint<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

525
00:22:44,899 --> 00:22:51,989
very original now the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that</font>

526
00:22:49,289 --> 00:22:55,500
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to emphasize here is that they</font>

527
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:58,470
never deprecated<font color="#E5E5E5"> this old API so these</font>

528
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:01,230
like to this day or report<font color="#CCCCCC"> Republic and</font>

529
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:02,580
you can like worry this API and do like

530
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:04,260
all the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we showed in the</font>

531
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:07,500
report because they still work and

532
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:11,340
wasn't fixed and the old API is still

533
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:12,960
there and then the new API is like

534
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:16,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">vulnerable to the same things but in a</font>

535
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:21,120
slightly different way so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

536
00:23:16,289 --> 00:23:23,100
new API so what's different here saying

537
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:26,129
well this like the keys on the phone

538
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:28,620
this is the encrypted message and then

539
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:33,360
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the old message with the actual</font>

540
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:35,580
stuff so they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> still using the old</font>

541
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:39,000
way of sending this<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jason request to the</font>

542
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:42,600
API with the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> X or algorithm and the</font>

543
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:47,190
same key but they were encrypting it

544
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:48,658
with AES and you know return these this

545
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:51,600
thing and then just sending the

546
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:54,929
encrypted part so but again<font color="#E5E5E5"> since this</font>

547
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,850
is on the phone you can you know encrypt

548
00:23:54,929 --> 00:23:58,350
and decrypt and do anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want and</font>

549
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:59,820
because it except self-signed

550
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:02,158
certificates you can my in the middle

551
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:04,889
traffic so we are like on square one

552
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:07,740
like it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't really properly fixed now</font>

553
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:10,440
on the bully<font color="#CCCCCC"> API that was there was a</font>

554
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:12,450
small difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> so like everything kept</font>

555
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,410
working so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you give the you know the</font>

556
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:16,660
target victim child you give the phone

557
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:18,340
number two the API it gives you the

558
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:20,380
parent<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you ask for the password</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

559
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:23,199
then this was different instead of

560
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:26,830
giving you<font color="#E5E5E5"> the four digit password which</font>

561
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:28,360
again is like a joke to brute force it

562
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:30,639
will give you these asterisks but of

563
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:33,280
course you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could change like the user</font>

564
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:36,340
agent and then it will give you like the

565
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:38,200
proper password so i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we speculate</font>

566
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:40,350
that this is because in our report like

567
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:44,170
the proof<font color="#E5E5E5"> of concept what was using curl</font>

568
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:46,090
so they they fixed it so that when the

569
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:49,360
user agent is curl then we'll give you

570
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:52,209
the asterisk but if<font color="#CCCCCC"> the user agent is</font>

571
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:54,490
like chrome or<font color="#E5E5E5"> IE or whatever then</font>

572
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:58,270
they'll give you the<font color="#E5E5E5"> password so that's</font>

573
00:24:54,490 --> 00:25:00,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">how they fixed it now of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course in the</font>

574
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:03,550

<font color="#E5E5E5">what we showed before so with knowledge</font>

still basically all there and this time

594
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:57,639
moba against the priceless with a

595
00:25:54,700 --> 00:26:00,250
totally new reaction by pulling the

596
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:02,860
application from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> android store and</font>

597
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:05,440
they are kind of whining here in their

598
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:08,590
press release about it that they offered

599
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,630
services for free for 12 years now and

600
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:12,730
that eighty<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the kids in</font>

601

school has no smartphones and there's no

602
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:17,530
this new law to protect them because

603
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:20,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very dangerous and but they decided</font>

00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:24,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">to stop smart</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Sheriff and please move on</font>

605

to another blocking services and new

news<font color="#E5E5E5"> article were written about the news</font>

that smart<font color="#CCCCCC"> surfed</font>

608

appeared from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Play Store and we were</font>

609
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:37,370
so stoked we were celebrating internally

610
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:39,260
we felt like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we fought a little war</font>

611
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:41,178
against surveillance and monitoring and

612
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:43,730
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we won against a huge</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> company</font>

613
00:26:41,179 --> 00:26:45,679
and maybe we even change the law at some

614
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:48,950
point and we joked about naming

615
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:52,100
ourselves lawmaker or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

616
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:55,190
this like we were super<font color="#E5E5E5"> excited a bit x</font>

617
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:57,949
arrogated of what we achieved but we

618
00:26:55,190 --> 00:27:00,620
felt really good about it but then

619
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:02,630
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> shady happened so here Citizen</font>

620
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:05,449
lab updates their press release and

621
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:07,880
saying that yes my removed small sheriff

622
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:10,910
application but this small sheriff API

623
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:12,590
remains still available<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well give</font>

624
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:15,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">them some time to deprecate everything</font>

625
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:17,178
and shut<font color="#CCCCCC"> it all down but we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know today</font>

626
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:20,389
that it's still up there and running and

627
00:27:17,179 --> 00:27:23,030
why is it up still<font color="#E5E5E5"> and running it seems</font>

628
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:25,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mobile has republished small</font>

629
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:28,100
sheriff under a different name which

630
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:31,100
translates to cyber safety zone and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

631
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:33,320
again on the Play<font color="#CCCCCC"> Store on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Korean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> store</font>

632
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:37,850
and it seems like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there are not</font>

633
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:39,770
much changes so now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I see question that</font>

634
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:42,530
we fail that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we really take it down or</font>

635
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:44,780
did nothing really happened so here's

636
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:46,730
the screenshot from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Korean app store</font>

637
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:49,460
where you can see like this new app

638
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:51,650
cyber relief or cyber safety zone with

639
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:53,750
this different logo but those

640
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:55,549
screenshots look very similar to the

641
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:57,830
screen shows how smart sheriff look like

642
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:59,690
and just to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the difference</font>

643
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:01,970
between smart sheriff and cyber safety

644
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:04,160
zone we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> now try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to find together the</font>

645
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:06,500
differences like they change the logo

646
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:09,620
it's not the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hat</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore so green and</font>

647
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:14,990
some text here changed so yeah

648
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:16,668
apparently not much really happened also

649
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:18,230
while preparing for this talk and

650
00:28:16,669 --> 00:28:20,540
preparing the slides and researching a

651
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:22,370
bit more i visited the mobile website a

652
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:24,950
lot and suddenly the old website

653
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:28,040
disappeared and this happened just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

654
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:29,570
a month or one and a half months ago and

655
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:32,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is the old website with a small</font>

656
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:34,700
share of head logo and because sheriff

657
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:36,530
is smart and so that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a flagship</font>

658
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:39,169
product so heavily advertising sponsor

659
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:41,450
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you now go to the website they</font>

660
00:28:39,169 --> 00:28:44,029
made a complete redesign it looks

661
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:45,830
now very sleek and I think this

662
00:28:44,029 --> 00:28:48,500
translate to the new name cyber safety

663
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:51,019
zone and I also want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> point out that</font>

664
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:53,360
those pictures seem look cute<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a</font>

665
00:28:51,019 --> 00:28:55,309
nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> family but it's also kind of creepy</font>

666
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:57,949
it looks like this mom<font color="#E5E5E5"> eavesdropping on</font>

667
00:28:55,309 --> 00:28:59,960
her<font color="#E5E5E5"> child or the other picture looks</font>

668
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:02,059
maybe like a happy family but could we

669
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:05,179
also seen as like this father taking

670
00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:07,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">control of all the hobbies and stuff his</font>

671
00:29:05,179 --> 00:29:08,299
children<font color="#E5E5E5"> are doing but I mean what do</font>

672
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:13,190
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from a surveillance</font>

673
00:29:08,299 --> 00:29:16,010
application also<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the latest press</font>

674
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:17,960
release here from March now they

675
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:21,590
increase the password limit from four

676
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:25,700
digits to nine digits so they still work

677
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:28,850
on their issues also<font color="#E5E5E5"> they offer now a</font>

678
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:31,309
new web login interface and on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> left</font>

679
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:33,080
it's basically login for smarter for

680
00:29:31,309 --> 00:29:35,960
this new application server safety zone

681
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:37,309
and on the right small dream which we

682
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:42,610
have briefly mentioned in the beginning

683
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:45,500
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> other application by my mova and</font>

684
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:47,209
this web interface if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> login into</font>

685
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,799
smart sure if you see again<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

686
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:50,630
different functionalities and if you

687
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:52,610
compare this to the original small

688
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:54,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">sheriff application you can see that</font>

689
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:56,120
it's basically about the same features

690
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:59,990
it's about managing use time managing

691
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:02,268
apps management managing websites so if

692
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:03,679
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before didn't convince you</font>

693
00:30:02,269 --> 00:30:07,039
that it's still the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> app and they</font>

694
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:10,570
just redid it then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think now it's</font>

695
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:14,269
clear that it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the same app</font>

696
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:17,120
so just to recap really quick smart

697
00:30:14,269 --> 00:30:19,909
sheriff was renamed to cyber safety zone

698
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:22,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">mobile never deprecated the API and</font>

699
00:30:19,909 --> 00:30:25,580
never really<font color="#E5E5E5"> got rid of smart Sheriff</font>

700
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:27,019
they just renamed the app and now it

701
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:29,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">seems like they are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to hide these</font>

702
00:30:27,019 --> 00:30:30,860
issues and evade the bad press and if

703
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:34,100
you google smart<font color="#E5E5E5"> sheriff all these</font>

704
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:36,830
negative news articles about them by

00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:39,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">just having this new app but what's up</font>

706
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:41,899
with smart dream because that looked a

707
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:44,179
little bit more<font color="#CCCCCC"> scary so here's the web</font>

708
00:30:41,899 --> 00:30:46,699
interface for small dream and you know

709
00:30:44,179 --> 00:30:48,320
it the translation is a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad but it</font>

will tell you in a second what what it

can do so<font color="#CCCCCC"> smart dream also comes in two</font>

712
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:55,160
modes the first one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the parent mode</font>

713
00:30:53,929 --> 00:30:58,040
where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can check</font>

714
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:00,920
locked messages from the child if they

715
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:02,990
contain<font color="#E5E5E5"> a harmful word and in the child</font>

716

00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:13,100
which is a Korean very popular Korean

720
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:16,700
instant messaging service and as well as

721
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:18,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">Google searches and I was curious how</font>

722
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:20,960
can they access like<font color="#E5E5E5"> third party</font>

723
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:22,520
messages in<font color="#CCCCCC"> kakaotalk and it's quite</font>

724
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:25,130
clever through this accessibility

725
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:27,460
service because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you will use this</font>

726
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:30,380
feature normally to provide some

727
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:32,870
text-to-speech functionality for people

728
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:34,760
that need some accessibility features so

729
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:36,800
they abuse this to get access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

730
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:38,810
texts<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this other application this</font>

731
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:41,530
instant messenger to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to look for</font>

732
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:45,050
harmful words and lock them just in<font color="#CCCCCC"> case</font>

733
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:47,030
and if you will then our parent and you

734
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:49,639
look on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your phone you can look at the</font>

735
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:51,680
messages locked by your child and this

736
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:54,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">is how the web interface looks like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

737
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:57,620
four messages log a few things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to point</font>

738
00:31:54,800 --> 00:32:01,340
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is that they do sense or the</font>

739
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:03,620
phone number<font color="#CCCCCC"> that from which message</font>

740
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:06,290
originated presumably to protect the

741
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:08,330
privacy of the sender to you know be not

742
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:11,000
that invasive but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

743
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:13,220
cosmetic the API itself knows about

744
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,700
these phone numbers and returns the full

745
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:18,440
phone numbers and also here in the

746
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:20,870
weapon of<font color="#CCCCCC"> view if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are web security</font>

747
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:23,600
guy you can guess why the h1 here is a

748
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:26,350
bit bigger<font color="#E5E5E5"> than all the other texts on</font>

749
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:30,709
here but about that's more in a second

750
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:32,510
so what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

751
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:34,730
a responsible disclosure just because

752
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:36,650
there are potentially children's

753
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:39,200
involved as being the victims of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

754
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:41,120
whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing and it's very trivial to</font>

755
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,040
just develop a bully application with a

756
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:46,429
person can enter a phone number and

757
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:49,070
really screw somebody over but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

758
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:51,710
also that mobile lied to us they never

759
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:54,379
fix the security issues and now even

760
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:57,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">went so far as being so awful as</font>

761
00:32:54,380 --> 00:33:00,500
renaming this application and rebranding

762
00:32:57,110 --> 00:33:02,090
it trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> evade this bad press but</font>

763
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">then again how can we still protect the</font>

764
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:05,540
privacy of the children if you just

765
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:06,520
would drop it for this close are out

766
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:10,120
there

767
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:12,160
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> also didn't feel right ethically no</font>

768
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:16,030
i don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really know i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all versions</font>

769
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:18,790
are a bit hectic can have the criticism

770
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:22,000
but in the end we go with the way that

771
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:24,430
we will show you<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is possible show</font>

772
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,130
you a few of the issues without showing

773
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:29,260
and without<font color="#E5E5E5"> making a technical report</font>

774
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:31,570
public and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> contact again with</font>

775
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:33,670
Citizen lab to provide responsible

776
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:39,129
disclosure to Moya just also<font color="#CCCCCC"> to protect</font>

777
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:40,690
us from some legal issues so as some

778
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:43,630
people have already guessed the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cap of</font>

779
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:46,030
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> big written h1 was obviously an XSS</font>

780
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:48,190
issue on the weapon<font color="#E5E5E5"> to face for smart</font>

781
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:50,410
dream and the interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing about</font>

782
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:52,810
this is that first of all you can just

783
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:56,050
like write an SMS message with an XSS

784
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:57,940
payload to your friend including a bad

785
00:33:56,050 --> 00:34:00,790
word so it gets locked by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> service</font>

786
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:03,550
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the parent then gets XSS but also</font>

787
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:08,590
again the whole application doesn't use

788
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:10,270
any SSL still<font color="#CCCCCC"> all clear</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> text and most</font>

789
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:12,820
endpoints don't have any form of

790
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:15,909
authentication authorization so just by

791
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:19,780
knowing a phone number you can push fake

792
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:25,570
messages to the service and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a big</font>

793
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:28,300
scale basically XSS all the parents but

794
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:31,210
the way worse issue where small dream is

795
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:34,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you can access more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than 700,000</font>

796
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:36,010
stored messages from more than 55,000

797
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:39,580
children that are registered<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

798
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:40,960
service I know those or I assume those

799
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:43,899
are the numbers because when I was

800
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,490
testing you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see an identifier just</font>

801
00:34:43,899 --> 00:34:48,069
simply incrementing every time when I

802
00:34:45,489 --> 00:34:50,229
stored a message or when I created a new

803
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:53,140
child so it's fair to assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this</font>

804
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:55,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">is how much is stored and this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

805
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:57,910
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a demo output of a script you can</font>

806
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:00,880
write to just enumerate all over all

807
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:02,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">those messages and all those children to</font>

808
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,660
provide protect the privacy those is

809
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:06,279
just scrambled it's all the Korean

810
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:08,500
characters are replaced with random

811
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:10,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">other Korean characters and I send her a</font>

812
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:13,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">few of the numbers but just to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> give you</font>

813
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:17,110
an idea how how this could look<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

814
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:19,920
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> smarter'n tries to take every</font>

815
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:21,869
message what the harmful word was

816
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:25,710
so it take these messages as

817
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:28,319
blackmailing or harassment and stuff but

818
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:30,119
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean it's clear that probably most of</font>

819
00:35:28,319 --> 00:35:34,170
these seven hundred thousand<font color="#E5E5E5"> messages</font>

820
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:36,299
are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> these kind of messages and this</font>

821
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:38,099
is probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most offensive slide in</font>

822
00:35:36,299 --> 00:35:42,059
our presentation because it contains

823
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:45,960
more than 1086 harmful words that smart

824
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:49,260
dream is monitoring in if they are

825
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:50,880
contained in a in a text<font color="#CCCCCC"> message or if</font>

826
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:52,770
they contain in a google search and then

827
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,980
they will log that requests or lock that

828
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:57,450
message and it's also very clear to

829
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:00,720
assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of these words are</font>

830
00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:02,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">very harmless I didn't translate all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

831
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:05,490
them but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I read like news headers that</font>

832
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:07,650
apparently the word beer is in<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so if</font>

833
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:10,770
you just write your friend about<font color="#E5E5E5"> beer</font>

834
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:14,160
then you get locked somewheres also the

835
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:16,829
up here is like being<font color="#E5E5E5"> assured fuck I</font>

836
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:19,558
also saw that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's like the Korean</font>

837
00:36:16,829 --> 00:36:21,569
word<font color="#CCCCCC"> of for 18 years old so if you would</font>

838
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:24,089
wish somebody happy birthday that would

839
00:36:21,569 --> 00:36:27,359
get locked presumably you know to catch

840
00:36:24,089 --> 00:36:29,640
some age of consent sexual stuff but but

841
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:34,078
a lot of harmful harmless stuff is

842
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:36,720
included in those<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1000 harmful words so</font>

843
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:41,220
again small dream shows us that it's a

844
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:43,439
big pile of poo we found XSS no ssl used

845
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:46,680
lock lack of authentication and

846
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:49,849
authorization and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> access all</font>

847
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:53,910
those stored messages and searches from

848
00:36:49,849 --> 00:36:55,559
from these children it's also funny to

849
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:57,509
point out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically all these</font>

850
00:36:55,559 --> 00:37:00,000
issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we are telling you hear</font>

851
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:03,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">about are very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> similar to small sheriff</font>

852
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,280
so even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't tell more about</font>

853
00:37:03,059 --> 00:37:08,579
these issues yet they could<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like</font>

854
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:10,230
find and replace<font color="#CCCCCC"> the initial report with</font>

855
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:13,079
smart sheriff<font color="#CCCCCC"> too smart dream and it</font>

856
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:14,730
would basically be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same thing so we</font>

857
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:17,190
informed them about these kind of issues

858
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:20,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the initial report but they never</font>

859
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:22,260
care to address this issue with smart

860
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:24,599
dream just showing again how much they

861
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:27,359
don't care and<font color="#CCCCCC"> how they are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only acting</font>

862
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:31,440
trying to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the marketing a bit</font>

863
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:32,500
straight and now Abraham<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a note for</font>

864
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,900
reflection

865
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:37,330
yeah so I know this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult okay</font>

866
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:39,430
but make an effort I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to ask you</font>

867
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:41,279
a question but I want you to stake a to

868
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:44,440
take a step back take a deep breathe and

869
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:47,440
pretend<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this was somehow perfectly</font>

870
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:50,590
secure like imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we didn't find</font>

871
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:53,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">any problems that these applications</font>

872
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:55,120
that log messages and control you know

873
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:57,130
where parents control children and all

874
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:59,799
this that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was somehow magically</font>

875
00:37:57,130 --> 00:38:01,900
secure like perfectly secure like all

876
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:04,810
traffic all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the protocols and everything</font>

877
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:07,870
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the API it was secure right just</font>

878
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:10,509
imagine<font color="#CCCCCC"> that for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a second and it's</font>

879
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:14,920
difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> but like an effort and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

880
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:18,430
would you trust like any government or

881
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:21,040
any company right to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of</font>

882
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:24,759
information like a database of an entire

883
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:27,790
country with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and who is</font>

884
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:30,640
like all the children you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know for that</font>

885
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:33,250
parent and all the messages that<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

886
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:35,470
been logged and all this like<font color="#CCCCCC"> would any</font>

887
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:39,840
of you trust<font color="#E5E5E5"> a government or a company</font>

888
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:43,209
to store all that<font color="#E5E5E5"> information anybody</font>

889
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:46,960
nobody right so like the whole concept

890
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:51,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">like is flawed like you know by design</font>

891
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:54,190
yeah so what's going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen next I</font>

892
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:56,680
already briefly mentioned that we are

893
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:58,810
now in process of responsibilities

894
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:01,990
closing the technical<font color="#CCCCCC"> details again of</font>

00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:10,590
weeks where we will sit together and do

898
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:13,410
some additional research looking at

899
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:17,890
maybe some of the other operators

00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:28,030
we can work<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit better together with</font>

you think it makes a great university

like motivation to look into these and

920
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:13,450
may might be a cool thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

Citizen lab and open that Korea or some

924
00:40:18,609 --> 00:40:23,890
other organization and then again of

925
00:40:20,859 --> 00:40:26,290
course support these organizations that

926
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:29,470
try to fight against these kind of

927
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:32,710
lausanne on a different level especially

928
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:35,319

think so to get there a discussion

933
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:50,290
started on a political level to maybe

934
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:55,390
tell Korea maybe it's not a good at here

935
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:57,910
to have such a law and we want to end

936
00:40:55,390 --> 00:41:01,660
this presentation with a quote<font color="#CCCCCC"> from a</font>

941
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:13,810
what he says gives me hope that in the

942
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:16,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">light of increasing surveillance</font>

943
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:19,390
monitoring and self-censorship some

944
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:23,368
bright kids might discover what it means

945
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:23,368
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a real hacker thank</font>

946
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:41,570
any questions or comments did you also

947
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:44,990
look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> iOS app if there was one so</font>

948
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:47,510
up the stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> about iOS is also funny so</font>

949
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:49,040
smart sheriff has an iOS version which

950
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:50,600
we haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> looked at yet which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

951
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:53,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">good candidate to be looked at in the</font>

952
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:57,140
summer then but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have also heard from</font>

953
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:59,840
Korean teenagers that they preferably by

954
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:01,580
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> iPhone because the monitoring</font>

955
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:04,610
capabilities that an application can

956
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:07,910
have are less intrusive on iOS than they

957
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:12,770
are on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android so a lot of them like to</font>

958
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:14,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">buy iphones because of that reason</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

959
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:21,050
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example smart dream does not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exist</font>

960
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:24,440
in an iOS version well<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess he enters</font>

961
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:28,520
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> no but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mr. anything politically</font>

962
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:31,610
yet in Korea like against the law or not

963
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:33,110
we have not heard much we had some

964
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:34,760
rumors in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the beginning especially after</font>

965
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:36,770
a first round where we were celebrating

966
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:39,050
a lot that this app got pulled because

967
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:40,730
we heard some rumors that now there was

968
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:43,100
actually some political change but in

969
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:45,950
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end that was just some political</font>

970
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:48,380
first people trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know protect</font>

971
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:50,990
themselves or you know appease the

972
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:54,530
public so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> far as I know there has</font>

973
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:57,529
been no change or no update yet but I we

974
00:42:54,530 --> 00:43:00,950
hope that with this new disclosure now

975
00:42:57,530 --> 00:43:02,750
that there's a bigger pressure on the

976
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:06,830
Korean government and I think they are

977
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:09,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">also getting into the election soon so</font>

978
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:11,120
this we try to you know get this moment

979
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:18,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">now right to put some additional</font>

980
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:20,480
pressure on the political<font color="#E5E5E5"> parties we</font>

981
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:23,980
have some demos as well that maybe we

982
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,980
can run while we<font color="#E5E5E5"> take questions</font>

983
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:30,740
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just like how the password</font>

984
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:34,819
click worked<font color="#CCCCCC"> or there is not on the</font>

986
00:43:34,819 --> 00:43:44,930
during any other questions or<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay maybe</font>

987
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:46,849
if I close it doesn't there<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank</font>
