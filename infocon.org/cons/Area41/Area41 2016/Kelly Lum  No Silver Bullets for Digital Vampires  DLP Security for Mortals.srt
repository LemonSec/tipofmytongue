00:00:49,629 --> 00:00:54,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">the talk just the requisite background</font>

professor<font color="#CCCCCC"> at NYU engineering where i</font>

23
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:08,920
teach application security before i

24
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:10,810
started a tumblr I've kind of been all

25
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,659
over the place of insecurity you know

26
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:16,380
officially for about 12 years so I have

27
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:19,659
worked in military of in government in

28
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">non-profit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and also in finance so I've</font>

29
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:25,090
worked<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of places where dlp has</font>

30
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:28,360
been either in use or something that has

31
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:29,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">been considered for use which is one of</font>

32
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,530
the reasons why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought it would be</font>

33
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:37,240
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look into some of those</font>

34
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:39,880
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are out there serve in terms</font>

35
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,589
of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> genda um I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just do all these I</font>

36
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:47,439
don't know why we do like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh nope</font>

37
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:50,140
nevermind so first we'll just do an

38
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:53,079
overview what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> LP is why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people use</font>

39
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:55,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">it how it is used and we'll kind of go</font>

40
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:57,758
<font color="#E5E5E5">into the breakdown of the different</font>

41
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:59,408
targets that we picked when I say we

42
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:03,009
this research was done in conjunction

43
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:05,710
with a friend of Mines a clan yer some

44
00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:07,060
of you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> know him as quine so he is</font>

45
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:08,380
also somebody who wrote the<font color="#CCCCCC"> android</font>

46
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:11,410
hacker's handbook so he's real smart

47
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:13,870
dude look them up but so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

48
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:15,760
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> over you know what the opie is what</font>

49
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,580
the targets are and what

50
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,859
their components were what the

51
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:23,319
components are of those targets and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

52
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:25,750
we'll go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into sort of the techniques the</font>

53
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:28,810
kind of methodology that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we went through</font>

54
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:30,849
in order to test and kind of put these

55
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:33,280
targets through the paces in terms of

56
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:34,780
mostly group when we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this we're</font>

57
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,120
evaluating the security of these

58
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:39,909
products you know how whenever you take

59
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,349
a piece<font color="#E5E5E5"> of software a piece of hardware</font>

60
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:45,399
whatever put it into your infrastructure

61
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:47,048
you're potentially adding more tax

62
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,750
surface you're to potentially putting

63
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:51,519
something that may be insecure into your

64
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,109
infrastructure so that's a question that

65
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,170
we should want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to answer right how</font>

66
00:02:53,109 --> 00:02:57,970
secure are these security products then

67
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,559
we'll do you know some conclusions some

68
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:04,959
like final thoughts and then I'll open

69
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:07,120
it up for questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> so why did you know</font>

70
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:10,329
why<font color="#CCCCCC"> DLP why not some other products and</font>

71
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,940
and kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reason is it's maybe</font>

72
00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:14,440
it's like this bullet shouldn't say used

73
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,889
to be a hot-button topic it kind of

74
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:22,419
still is in terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> not maybe DLP but</font>

75
00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:23,919
the fear<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the frequency of data</font>

76
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:25,480
breaches that have been happening you

77
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:27,790
see them in the news all the time

78
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:31,660
there's Home Depot there's target

79
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:35,709
there's people's password lists getting

80
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:37,599
a stolen or you know leaked somehow so

81
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:38,949
people were like how are we<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to do</font>

82
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:44,530
this how<font color="#CCCCCC"> are we going to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rid of this</font>

83
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:46,239
data loss privilege CLP<font color="#E5E5E5"> we throw it into</font>

84
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">our network or install it our machines</font>

85
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,739
then we'll be fine we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

86
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:53,709
worry about anything anymore<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the</font>

87
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:55,030
way that DLP is normally sold and as I'm

88
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:57,760
going through this<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just see some</font>

89
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:59,680
news articles from a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

90
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,940
about things that are people<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are</font>

91
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,769
freaking out about get they're getting

92
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,780
their information taken from them the

93
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:07,720
way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> LP is usually described or</font>

94
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:09,909
what its utility usually is is keeping

95
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:13,120
honest people from doing dumb things so

96
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:15,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have the person who you know goes</font>

97
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,820
through the HR paperwork you want to

98
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:20,560
discourage that person from putting that

99
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:23,169
sensitive information tax form social

100
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,669
security numbers addresses or whatnot

101
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:26,320
you want to discourage that person from

102
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:28,469
putting it on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thumb drive and taking</font>

103
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,060
it home<font color="#CCCCCC"> with them or sending it</font>

104
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,560
their personal email address so they can

105
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:35,820
work on it you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know while they're on</font>

106
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:37,590
vacation or whatnot but and that is

107
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">really kind of the way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

108
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:42,119
think about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lpa some people do worry</font>

109
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:44,460
about let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the Bradley Manning</font>

110
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:47,610
sort of thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> which we'll get to that</font>

111
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:49,260
later but in terms of the utility of dlp

112
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,970
we really kind of want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep the</font>

113
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:53,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">honest people honest the advance insider</font>

114
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:57,300
threat is a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more difficult and again</font>

115
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:58,830
we'll talk about that later and again

116
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:03,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">the reason why people are freaking out</font>

117
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:05,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">and looking at the LP to maybe let them</font>

118
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,570
sleep a little better at night is all of

119
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,239
these data breaches that are happening

120
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:11,790
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want your company to be the</font>

121
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,160
next company that's on the front of you

122

Street Journal of New York Times<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

124
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,729
you had a massive data breach you have

00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:24,600
to inform you know thousands to millions

128
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:34,770
of bad people so that's why people

129
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">choose DLP and the reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at it was again where</font>

131
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,969
you're curious about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the attack surface</font>

132
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,260
you buy something<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a company the</font>

products<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're looking at will</font>

range anywhere from you know five digit

license licenses in terms of cost to

136
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,030
free but you you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're putting</font>

your trust you're giving either money or

138
00:05:54,030 --> 00:06:00,150
time or both to getting one of these

140
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:03,539
the product is vulnerable then you've

141
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:05,820
made yourself a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more</font>

142
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:08,010
vulnerable just because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the added</font>

143
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:10,560
attack surface we're also interested in

144
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:14,969
reliability as we'll talk about some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">these with the LP I mean it's the way it</font>

146
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:18,120
works is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> has to look at the data that</font>

147
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,160
people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> dealing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with it has to look</font>

148
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,900
at file transfers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at</font>

149
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,350
things that are copying and pasting it

150
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,310
has to maybe monitor network

151
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:30,870
communications who are things that look

152
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:32,520
shady if those<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't reliable if</font>

153
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,410
they're constantly crashing if they're

154
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,729
making things super super slow that's

155
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:38,780
not going to be good<font color="#E5E5E5"> for anybody who's</font>

156
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,780
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get serious work done</font>

157
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,809
and in addition to other security

158
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:46,609
products that you probably all have

159
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:49,430
worked with or are familiar with things

160
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:51,290
like firewalls like IDs the position

161
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:54,530
that dlp needs to be in your

162
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:56,600
organization is usually somewhere that

163
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:58,849
is very very<font color="#CCCCCC"> attractive to maybe an</font>

164
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,910
attacker who wants to get and get as

165
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:03,320
much information out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your company or</font>

166
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:05,990
out of your network<font color="#E5E5E5"> or out of your</font>

167
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,670
system as possible right<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you have to</font>

168
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,460
monitor all the traffic then that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

169
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:12,560
perfect<font color="#CCCCCC"> place for me to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of go after</font>

170
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:15,200
to try to pop that you know box or

171
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,460
whatever to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in here now I</font>

172
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,900
can see all the data that's flowing

173
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:20,090
through that they were worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

174
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:23,479
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> stealing and now I can steal it</font>

175
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:27,049
and also so the joke i always make is

176
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:29,180
I'm from Brooklyn most people in

177
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:31,190
Brooklyn or<font color="#CCCCCC"> know like the stereotype</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

178
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:33,260
we're all hipsters and so we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

179
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:34,820
irony right and so testing the security

180
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,349
of security products it's kind of just a

181
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:39,080
fun<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to do it's kind of funny in a</font>

182
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:45,770
way also sometimes it's sad we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

183
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:47,300
into that a one less thing so one of the

184
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:48,830
turns we'll see when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at some of</font>

185
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,720
the bigger name products is there is

186
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:52,729
also this kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of trend and you don't</font>

187
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,380
see this just in dlp you see this in

188
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:56,870
other pieces you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in pieces of</font>

189
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:59,000
software other pieces of<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

190
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:00,919
hardware or whatever where the big

191
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,360
bender they see you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> like we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

192
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:03,979
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> more money we need to be more</font>

193
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,200
competitive<font color="#E5E5E5"> with what other people are</font>

194
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:07,790
offering look at that small company they

195
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:11,060
do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool let's buy them and</font>

196
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:13,160
then they may be by three or four small

197
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:16,070
companies bundle them all into<font color="#CCCCCC"> one big</font>

198
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,750
security suite and then forget you know

199
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:19,130
they lose all of the institutional

200
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,560
knowledge of the company that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they just</font>

201
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:23,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">bought out right they don't know what</font>

202
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,480
exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're rolling into their</font>

203
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:27,890
product maybe they're not evaluating the

204
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,240
thing they bought to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure it's</font>

205
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:30,860
secure they're like oh well these people

206
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:35,690
said it's okay so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know they have a</font>

207
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:37,130
penetration test report it's fine so in

208
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:38,719
order to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that people</font>

209
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:41,809
have done<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the past before we get into</font>

210
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,640
what we've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> so secure roses has done</font>

211
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:45,439
you probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> google it they've done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

212
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:48,650
bunch of blog posts and white papers on

213
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,320
dlp security back in two thousand seven

214
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:51,769
Madison<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe is now part</font>

215
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,249
of an

216
00:08:51,769 --> 00:08:57,829
CC they did a talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about defeating dlp</font>

217
00:08:55,249 --> 00:09:01,429
there was also a talk at Def Con 19

218
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:03,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">about basically using opengl p to steal</font>

219
00:09:01,429 --> 00:09:06,589
sensitive data so that was given<font color="#CCCCCC"> by and</font>

220
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:09,459
regret Gavin and there were a bunch of

221
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:12,559
others this talk has been done in

222
00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:15,170
various iterations at other conferences

223
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:16,790
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically you know we broke</font>

224
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:18,860
our research up into a bunch of

225
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:21,559
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendors so this is all of like</font>

226
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:26,600
the complete gamut of all the stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

227
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:28,610
we looked at so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hopefully</font>

228
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,799
people can see this all right but this

229
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:33,949
is just an example of how dlp would sit

230
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:36,079
in in terms of did the EOP architecture

231
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:39,920
and where it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be situated inside an</font>

232
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:41,599
organization you may have<font color="#E5E5E5"> depending on</font>

233
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> product</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're using depending</font>

234
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:48,110
on the feet features of the product<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

235
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:50,059
you're using you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> have all of this</font>

236
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:52,249
you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have some of this so usually</font>

237
00:09:50,059 --> 00:09:54,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">what you'll have in the center is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DLP</font>

238
00:09:52,249 --> 00:09:56,839
management server this is just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

239
00:09:54,379 --> 00:09:58,490
thingy well I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay a DLP</font>

240
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:00,049
management server which talks to a

241
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:01,939
database where you're going to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

242
00:10:00,049 --> 00:10:03,949
of your policy and reporting information

243
00:10:01,939 --> 00:10:06,349
and we'll talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you define</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

244
00:10:03,949 --> 00:10:08,029
in the next slide ok the DLP management

245
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:09,920
server is responsible for taking those

246
00:10:08,029 --> 00:10:12,139
policies for those signatures whatever

247
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,610
you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for and pushing those out</font>

248
00:10:12,139 --> 00:10:14,899
to let's say let's say you have a

249
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:16,819
network monitor because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to</font>

250
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:18,860
monitor<font color="#CCCCCC"> traffic to see if people or</font>

251
00:10:16,819 --> 00:10:19,610
maybe you know taking large files taking

252
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,379
files that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> shouldn't be</font>

253
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:23,600
transferring and moving them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> places</font>

254
00:10:21,379 --> 00:10:24,829
they shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be going maybe you want</font>

255
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,769
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> monitor things on the workstation</font>

256
00:10:24,829 --> 00:10:29,239
such as somebody trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> copy and</font>

257
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:31,549
paste something out of a classified

258
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,559
document or a document that has certain

259
00:10:31,549 --> 00:10:35,470
types of metadata you you want to catch

260
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:37,669
them trying to paste that<font color="#E5E5E5"> into an email</font>

261
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:39,829
you may want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your mail server</font>

262
00:10:37,669 --> 00:10:42,110
again maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody is trying to send</font>

263
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:43,969
something outside of the organization or

264
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:46,189
maybe receive something inside the

265
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:47,720
organization that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has something</font>

266
00:10:46,189 --> 00:10:49,639
sensitive and you want to go investigate

267
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,439
that you might want to look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

268
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:52,549
databases you know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of times</font>

269
00:10:51,439 --> 00:10:54,199
especially when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're talking about</font>

270
00:10:52,549 --> 00:10:56,959
credit cards getting stolen passwords

271
00:10:54,199 --> 00:10:58,849
getting stolen somebody's going to be

272
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,649
pulling<font color="#E5E5E5"> out lots and lots of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> records or</font>

273
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:03,559
your database if you can catch those

274
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:04,860
records being taken out then you know

275
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:07,079
you may either be able to

276
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,820
stop it or you may be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> react a</font>

277
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:12,180
little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> faster than finding out</font>

278
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:14,520
because you saw it on pastebin another

279
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:18,719
thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> dlp uses and so this kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

280
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:20,670
is not this<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually isn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dlp sometimes</font>

281
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,620
it is sometimes people will monitor

282
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:24,240
what's going on web so they want to make

283
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,940
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people aren't copying and</font>

284
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,130
pasting let's say insider information or

285
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:31,470
sensitive corporate information into

286
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:35,189
like a web forum but they'll also kind

00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:37,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">of as a selling point use these CLP</font>

288
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:39,330
policies to say these are the sites you

you're limited to these sites or these

291
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:45,690
sites are blacklisted just as an

00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:47,790
additional<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well not only do we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

293
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:50,130
to protect your company from having its

294
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:53,930
data stolen but we can also prevent your

295
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:53,930
you know employees from looking at porn

296
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:05,420
so just to go more into the architecture

297
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:07,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">of that go from network to to sort of</font>

298
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:09,920
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> it works in terms of you have these</font>

299
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,449
policies that are living<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your you</font>

00:12:11,449 --> 00:12:16,248
wherever the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dlp end point is whether</font>

00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:18,649
it's a network monitor a mail server

303
00:12:16,249 --> 00:12:20,360

going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be those policies are going to</font>

305
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,649
be talking to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bunch of different</font>

306
00:12:22,579 --> 00:12:27,258
things so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically closer to</font>

307
00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:29,360
where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user sits and this is more in</font>

308
00:12:27,259 --> 00:12:31,970
the back end so what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of the</font>

309
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the lp can look at well they</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">information or social security numbers</font>

313
00:12:37,809 --> 00:12:44,059
somewhere they maybe you want to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

314
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:45,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">your removable devices again the person</font>

who takes sensitive documents and puts

316
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:51,079
them on a USB Drive or burns them to a

DVD or whatever you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> monitor to</font>

318
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:56,290
see what people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are doing in that</font>

319
00:12:52,369 --> 00:12:58,850
respect sometimes you actually wanted my

320
00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:01,040
monitor documents right so somebody

321
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:02,839
opens up at classified file maybe you

322
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,969
want to log every sec test time somebody

323
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:06,589
does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to see if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people are</font>

00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:09,470
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to access things that they</font>

shouldn't be accessing see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are</font>

326
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:13,939
putting information into documents that

327
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:15,740
they shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be putting in so you</font>

328
00:13:13,939 --> 00:13:17,029
might want to indicate which files you

329
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:18,829
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at maybe you only want to</font>

330
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:21,410
look at you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know microsoft office files</font>

331
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:23,378
maybe you want to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at database files</font>

332
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:25,639
maybe you know you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> xml</font>

333
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:28,639
text maybe there's some binaries that

334
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:33,379
you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at these document and</font>

335
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:35,749
file parsers are can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> implemented in</font>

336
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:38,029
one of two ways sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a</font>

337
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:39,499
crawler sort of similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> to like an</font>

338
00:13:38,029 --> 00:13:40,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">antivirus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scan that's going to look</font>

339
00:13:39,499 --> 00:13:43,220
through all your files and<font color="#E5E5E5"> see if</font>

340
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:45,110
there's a pattern match sometimes it's a

341
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:46,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">real-time monitor so somebody opens the</font>

342
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:49,399
file manipulates it it's actively

343
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:51,709
looking at what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the user is doing okay</font>

344
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:53,689
we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have protocol analyzers so you</font>

345
00:13:51,709 --> 00:13:56,768
would say<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at ftp I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

346
00:13:53,689 --> 00:14:00,110
to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know connections too</font>

347
00:13:56,769 --> 00:14:02,959
weird IM services whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is so</font>

348
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:04,399
you're going to have a interface with

349
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,258
your network driver and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

350
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:10,720
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's monitoring the</font>

351
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:12,780
communications that are going on to your

352
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,090
over your network

353
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:16,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay the inspection engine is where they</font>

354
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:18,630
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the information from these</font>

355
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,940
parsers and basically says is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

356
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:22,830
is this not okay and then you have an

357
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,210
enforcement engine sometimes you'll

358
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:26,250
actually want to actively block

359
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:28,950
something there's some dlp solutions

360
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:30,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've seen where you you know try to copy</font>

361
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:31,800
and paste something you should and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll</font>

362
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,329
actually pop up and say you're not

363
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">supposed to do that it's been reported</font>

364
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:38,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the content police or whatever</font>

365
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">and a reporting engine sometimes you</font>

366
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:44,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">just want to see what's you know been</font>

367
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:46,860
going on maybe get hourly weekly daily

368
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:50,040
whatever reports to see like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

369
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:52,920
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have been trying to do now</font>

370
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:55,170
try not to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go on to this kind of soft</font>

371
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,670
stuff this is the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> one but this is</font>

372
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:58,620
sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of just an example of a workflow of</font>

00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:00,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody who's working with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lp so</font>

374
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,440
first you're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> identify what you</font>

375
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:03,720
want to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at maybe you have some</font>

376
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,190
keywords maybe you have like

377
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,520
fingerprints in terms of you know

378
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:09,870
certain binary data maybe you have

379
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,460
regular expressions right you want to

380
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:14,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">match for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> social security numbers for</font>

381
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:17,280
credit cards for things that look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

382
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,980
don't know email addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you</font>

383
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,089
have file attributes so the files

384
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,830
certain patterns for certain files you

385
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:24,660
might want to look at then you're going

386
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:26,100
to define what the rules are okay you're

387
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:28,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to say these things are allowed</font>

388
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:31,620
here these things aren't allowed here so

389
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:33,449
on and so forth once you oh that okay

390
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:35,760
once you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that you're going to create</font>

391
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:37,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">a policy saying here are my targets</font>

392
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,240
maybe you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> different policies for</font>

393
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,950
different people such as the people in

394
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,980
the HR department are allowed to work

395
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:45,570
with personally identifiable information

396
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:47,790
the people who are the graphic designers

397
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:49,110
they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> different policies on their</font>

398
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:51,209
machine they should not be looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

399
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:54,540
credit card or personally identifiable

400
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:56,490
information right you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to select</font>

401
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:58,319
which network channels you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

402
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:59,760
at and then what is it the action<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

403
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,460
want to do you want to block it you want

404
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:04,290
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> log it do you want to log it silently</font>

405
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:07,050
or do you want to log it and say hey

406
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:09,150
don't do that you deployed the policy to

407
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,380
wherever your agents are and then you go

408
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,670
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> your monitoring where you're</font>

409
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at logs you're looking at</font>

410
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:16,050
reports the other thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do</font>

411
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:17,550
is when I said more like an<font color="#E5E5E5"> antivirus</font>

412
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:20,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">scan where you go and do data discovery</font>

413
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:21,689
where your kraut crawling your systems

00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:24,240
for certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that may</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be of</font>

416
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,600
of drive to point home

417
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:30,760
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ability to do all of this means that</font>

418
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">DLP has to be very very powerful it has</font>

419
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:35,080
to have access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a lot of information</font>

420
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,490
the fact that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> EOP needs to look at</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">your data to determine whether or not</font>

423
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:45,640
sensitive data means that DLP if

somebody can compromise it they're going

before<font color="#E5E5E5"> i go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into we're going to talk</font>

00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,860
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> our targets and then we're going</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to get to the good stuff all the</font>

00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:58,779

00:16:55,589 --> 00:17:00,370
all the vendors have been notified<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

432
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:04,809
aren't any outstanding patches that need

433
00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:08,920
to be done some vendor names have been

434
00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:12,250
changed to protect the innocent just

435
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:15,250
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we didn't like people saying</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were going to send us nasty</font>

438
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:23,050
targets that we looked at again we did

439
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:26,079
this in two rounds the first round we

440
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:27,609
looked at more kind of big-name vendors

441
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,350
and then the second round we looked at a

442
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:34,780
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit more boutique startup</font>

443
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:36,730
offerings<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so round one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we'll go</font>

444
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:38,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">into you know the stuff first but we</font>

445
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:40,540
have Trend Micro suppose<font color="#CCCCCC"> Websense and</font>

446
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:43,360
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> for good measure we threw in an</font>

00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:50,710
windows for Trend Micro endpoint is also

450
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:53,140

linux the enterprise console for<font color="#CCCCCC"> sophos</font>

460
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:19,690
scanner is Linux so just kind of all

461
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:22,270
over the place in terms of you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

462
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:24,309
operating systems that we see we do see

463
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:27,429
that the endpoints tend to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> window</font>

464
00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:32,200
centric with the exception of web

<font color="#CCCCCC">Websense which supports the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> big three so</font>

466
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:38,020
we'll go too much into all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

467
00:18:34,419 --> 00:18:39,040
sort of what the interesting stuff is so

468
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,870
they have the windows and

469
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,580
an agent which the Samana Turing and the

470
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,919
enforcement the weird<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing about the</font>

471
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:46,510
windows agent actually acted like a

472
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:48,520
rootkit basically you install it you're

473
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:50,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">like where the hell did it go it's not</font>

474
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,780
here basically you install it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and hide</font>

475
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:55,150
it hides itself I can kind of understand

476
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:56,649
the rationale<font color="#CCCCCC"> behind that where you know</font>

477
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:58,540
if you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of worried about</font>

478
00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:00,070
somebody a little savvy or somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

479
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:01,750
actually is deliberately trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

480
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:04,600
bad things<font color="#E5E5E5"> hiding the fact that they</font>

481
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:06,100
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something monitoring them may put</font>

482
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,689
them into a fault lure them<font color="#CCCCCC"> into a false</font>

483
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:10,149
sense of comfort maybe you can catch

484
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:11,860
patched people easier it's just it was

485
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:14,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little shady looking when when a</font>

487
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:20,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">very very difficult</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of get rid</font>

488
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,030
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that piece of software if you for</font>

489
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:25,090
whatever reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want it on there</font>

490
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:26,560
anymore the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network agent is a virtual</font>

491
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:28,030
appliance it basically sits on the

492
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,530
network does what it says monitors

493
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:31,420
network traffic for the stuff you want

494
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:34,090
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> monitor there's something called a</font>

495
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:36,100
remote crawler which will basically go

496
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:37,810
out and look for machines that are not

497
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:40,149
part of your corporate network and try

498
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:42,520
to save why is this here<font color="#E5E5E5"> this isn't one</font>

499
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:44,980
of ours this is a machine<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is on our</font>

500
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,510
network that doesn't have an agent what

501
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:48,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">is it doing why is it there may be a</font>

502
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:49,450
consultant brought in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> laptop just</font>

503
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,260
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out what's on your</font>

504
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:56,380
network or what's there that shouldn't

505
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:57,760
be and the management server you know is

506
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:00,310
linux based again it's a virtual

507
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:04,570
appliance you you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a vm you install</font>

508
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:07,120
it wherever you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want ok so the</font>

509
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:09,610
management server is this management

510
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:12,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">console it's Apache coyote on Windows</font>

511
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:14,679
and using ms SQL database so a lot

512
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:17,020
different than a trend micro right it's

513
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:19,300
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> window centric management the</font>

514
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:23,110
endpoints again big three so a lot more

515
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:25,149
support here what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> they do they look</font>

516
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:27,969
at filed and network drivers they also

517
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:29,470
monitor clipboard operations and then

518
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:31,840
there's this protector appliance<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

519
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:33,160
has this weird restricted admin shell we

520
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,860
really didn't look too much about that

521
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:38,530
but we also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> crawlers that can</font>

522
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:40,209
basically go around on systems on

523
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:44,379
network shares and what not to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look for</font>

524
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:47,800
sensitive documents<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay for sophos our</font>

525
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:49,570
management console is<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows a whole</font>

526
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,370
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> dotnet we'll get into when is</font>

527
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:52,689
that shown up<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay hold on that which</font>

528
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:56,590
we'll talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a little bit</font>

529
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:59,140
later why that was interesting it's one

530
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:00,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">of those kind of bundled solutions where</font>

531
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:02,350
you get your endpoint security so you're

532
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:06,189
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just getting dlp you're getting</font>

533
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:10,540
antivirus dlp and you know whatever for

534
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:12,820
your different operating systems<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I</font>

535
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:16,629
hate<font color="#E5E5E5"> these slides why you do it like</font>

536
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:19,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">that ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> open dlp is just the Linux</font>

537
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:23,650
virtual appliance it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apache and a</font>

538
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:28,030
whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of pearl I personally don't</font>

539
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:29,410
dislike pearl but Zack was the one who

540
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:32,410
looked at this and he<font color="#E5E5E5"> got very very</font>

541
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:35,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">upset at all the pearl it also has a</font>

542
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:37,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">windows agent and it also has something</font>

543
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:41,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> file system crawler and a</font>

544
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:44,170
document crawler also you know this

545
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,930
sshfs fence crawler and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit</font>

546
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:49,060
out modules which<font color="#CCCCCC"> i thought was weird i</font>

547
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:50,860
guess if you wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make opengl p</font>

548
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:54,310
like a payload or something it was just

549
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:55,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">that was an interesting feature so one</font>

550
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:57,310
thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we also wanted to mention it</font>

551
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:59,139
was as we looked at these products not

552
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:01,120
open to you p of course but we noticed

553
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:03,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">that there's this thing on a lot of them</font>

554
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:07,510
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> key view or que</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vous which is</font>

555
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:09,370
give you a hopi binary this showed up a

556
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:12,040
lot don't ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> me what 00 p stands for i</font>

557
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:14,260
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember yeah you know me part of</font>

558
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:16,149
the key view fields their sdk it's used

559
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:18,460
for parsing normalizing documents

560
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:20,230
basically it makes sense that this would

561
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">be on a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of things that need to parse</font>

562
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:24,070
documents because it's a library for

563
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:26,860
parsing documents it's used in a lot of

564
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:28,360
dlp products it's also used in messaging

565
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:30,250
servers and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of big data platform</font>

566
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:33,669
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not just something that's</font>

567
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:36,910
unique to dlp this library is in a lot

568
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:39,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">of places so you know why am i bringing</font>

569
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:41,380
this up well if you're somebody who

570
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:44,200
likes to find a bug that affects a lot

571
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:47,520
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things then this is maybe something</font>

572
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">you might be interested in looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

573
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:54,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so for example in websense we have</font>

574
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,929
this thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> called EP classifier and it</font>

575
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:58,330
basically spawns all these KBOO

576
00:22:55,930 --> 00:23:03,430
processes processes and what it's doing

577
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:03,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">is creating a policy engine filter and</font>

578
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:07,210
then

579
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:09,220
the looking at documents that are either

580
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:11,380
living on the file system are being

581
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:14,310
looked at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right we're almost done</font>

582
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:16,960
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the overview stuff okay I promise</font>

583
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:20,139
so who did we look at again we change

584
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:23,860
these names just because one it just

585
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:26,260
kind of felt like a good idea and two

586
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:27,760
they are smaller vendors you know we

587
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:29,080
probably should have done<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for the big</font>

588
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,340
names but I think they can kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

589
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,590
handle the criticism because they have a

590
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:35,350
lot of money<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know so we named up</font>

591
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:37,659
alpha Bravo Charlie and dingus dingus

592
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:41,439
because thingis may or may not exist in

593
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:44,110
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> real world again the virtual</font>

594
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:48,400
appliances here they are all linux<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

595
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:52,199
endpoint agents are with all with all of

596
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:54,850
them support<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows the Charlie and</font>

597
00:23:52,200 --> 00:24:00,520
Bravo support OS X and Charlie supports

598
00:23:54,850 --> 00:24:02,889
linux and let's see do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have anything</font>

599
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:05,710
else the Bravo dlp management server hat

600
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:07,090
is in Windows but the yeah that's the

601
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:10,480
only one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a management server in</font>

602
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:13,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">Windows all right okay so this is a</font>

603
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:19,060
slide where I'm going to get angry alpha

604
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:20,919
dlp was how am I gonna okay so there I

605
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:23,260
know I've noticed<font color="#E5E5E5"> in security you're</font>

606
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,670
talking to security people looking on

607
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,930
Twitter reading message towards there

608
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:27,910
are certain vendors and certain

609
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:29,500
technologies that we kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like and</font>

610
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:34,750
there's ones that we really really don't

611
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:36,970
like so alpha dlp was just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

612
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:40,870
weird Frankenstein's monster everything

613
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:43,360
I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes me of fun first of all it</font>

614
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:45,669
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a it was previously an open source</font>

615
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,379
product the the people grab the code

616
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:49,690
base and basically closed office the

617
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:52,720
code that's not cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> the admin panel is</font>

618
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:57,460
entirely in flash because apparently

619
00:24:52,720 --> 00:25:01,060
it's 1998 and the windows agent you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

620
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:02,050
like I understand you know like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

621
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:04,330
how like when you when you're a little

622
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:05,889
kid and your mom or your dad takes you

623
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:07,830
out to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get ice cream and they're like</font>

624
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:09,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you want on your ice cream</font>

625
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:12,330
and you're like I want gummy bears no I

626
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:15,090
want hot fudge no I want marshmallows no

627
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:17,490
I want sprinkles no I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> what cherries no</font>

628
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:19,039
I want all and you're like you get it

629
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:22,380
and you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I'm going to die because</font>

630
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:23,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is too</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much so basically I kind of</font>

631
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,529
feel like that's their attitude in terms

632
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:28,890
of how they built this out because it's

633
00:25:25,529 --> 00:25:30,149
made of dotnet java and Erlang and I

634
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:34,850
thought the thought that in Java we're

635
00:25:30,149 --> 00:25:38,820
supposed to be like enemies so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah</font>

636
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:40,320
and and and just you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this</font>

637
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,879
is bad enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> but just just to make</font>

638
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:46,950
thing make you you know if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

639
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:49,380
already kind of just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it uses action</font>

640
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:52,080
message format or the beautiful

641
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:54,330
beautiful<font color="#E5E5E5"> adobe or macromedia whatever</font>

642
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,370
who invented that<font color="#E5E5E5"> assets message format</font>

643
00:25:54,330 --> 00:26:00,860
for communications because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the admin</font>

644
00:25:56,370 --> 00:26:00,860
panel again it's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> flash so why not</font>

645
00:26:02,539 --> 00:26:07,230
another thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to note is that they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> used</font>

646
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:09,149
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an OSX and Linux endpoint agent</font>

647
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:11,010
but they became<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows only because you</font>

648
00:26:09,149 --> 00:26:12,479
know maintaining software is hard when a

649
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:14,010
big company buys you and they lay off

650
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,659
all your people I don't know if they did

651
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:20,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">that but that's my theory our bread oh</font>

652
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:22,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay also the back ends this isn't so</font>

653
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:24,480
bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's Apache jetty in mysql mysql</font>

654
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:25,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of seemed like an odd choice for</font>

655
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:32,580
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's supposed to be</font>

656
00:26:25,529 --> 00:26:36,090
enterprising software but Yolo<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

657
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:38,158
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are not animating okay anyway so</font>

658
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:41,610
Bravo dlp the management console is an

659
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:44,370
MMC snap in its windows-based the back

660
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:47,100
end is ms SQL the content monitoring

661
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:51,029
server is also a<font color="#CCCCCC"> windows</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> base and it's</font>

662
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:53,699
separate from the management<font color="#E5E5E5"> console the</font>

663
00:26:51,029 --> 00:26:56,370
endpoint agent again windows has a lot

664
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:58,529
of drivers and hooks of as you might

665
00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:00,570
imagine and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> endpoint agent is</font>

666
00:26:58,529 --> 00:27:02,789
similar to windows but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it has less</font>

667
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:06,990
support for so the OSX agent isn't as

668
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:09,510
robust as the windows one they also use

669
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:12,899
a lot of open source free libs hopefully

670
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:14,970
they are using the proper licensing<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

671
00:27:12,899 --> 00:27:18,330
don't know i didn't know lawyer such as

672
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:19,070
boost free<font color="#E5E5E5"> dlc etc oh now you now it</font>

673
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:23,379
animates right

674
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:23,379
I'm about<font color="#E5E5E5"> to okay whatever</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Pearlie dlp</font>

675
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:29,360
go I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

676
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:37,850
because I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know why it's not all</font>

677
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:42,019
right are you gonna do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> No</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh fine</font>

678
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:45,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay there we go so a virtual appliance</font>

679
00:27:42,019 --> 00:27:47,360
kind of the same theme of linux and

680
00:27:45,139 --> 00:27:49,070
point agent windows this file monitoring

681
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,799
and scanning monitors clipboards

682
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:55,100
monitors network traffic and URLs coming

683
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:58,759
out of the operating system the endpoint

684
00:27:55,100 --> 00:28:00,678
agent is ubuntu and debian it has file

685
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:02,960
monitoring and scanning has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

686
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:05,539
notification tray ring thing in the

687
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,820
gnome KDE that pops up and says mean

688
00:28:05,539 --> 00:28:09,649
things to you i guess the<font color="#E5E5E5"> OSX and point</font>

689
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:14,090
agent we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't look at that much</font>

690
00:28:09,649 --> 00:28:16,100
but it exists all right dingus it may it

691
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:17,750
totally<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not a real thing we didn't</font>

692
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:23,000
change the name because these people

693
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:25,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">were mean to us or anything oh no shit</font>

694
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not good as slides I don't know how</font>

695
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:30,289
to computer I just got this computer for

696
00:28:26,899 --> 00:28:33,979
my mom<font color="#CCCCCC"> she put some video games on it</font>

697
00:28:30,289 --> 00:28:37,580
and stuff there we go I think that's it

698
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:39,799
oh no that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so again linux</font>

699
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:42,199
management system network appliance is

700
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:44,600
Linux virtual that can be used in a

701
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:46,879
variety of ways one in line you can do

702
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's half hour span port basically you</font>

703
00:28:46,879 --> 00:28:51,199
can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it either to monitor traffic</font>

704
00:28:48,289 --> 00:28:52,879
proxy traffic to something else the

705
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,879
windows endpoint agent monitors the

706
00:28:52,879 --> 00:28:57,678
clipboard it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the file system</font>

707
00:28:55,879 --> 00:29:01,490
and again it can act the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

708
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:03,730
network monitor all right now we talked

709
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:06,259
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we did this what our sort of</font>

710
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:08,600
methodology our assessment criteria was

711
00:29:06,259 --> 00:29:10,399
again this was less to figure out how

712
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,199
effective these products were although

713
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,850
you know we did throw some stuff at it

714
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,009
and make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it was alerting</font>

715
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:17,299
properly and working as intended but

716
00:29:16,009 --> 00:29:19,100
mostly we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were interested in the</font>

717
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:21,139
security of these products why should we

718
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:22,549
spend money on these products spend all

719
00:29:21,139 --> 00:29:24,949
of our time putting them into our

720
00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:30,220
infrastructure if they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

721
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:30,220
like a giant mess of security problems

722
00:29:31,219 --> 00:29:35,849
okay so in terms of network appliance

723
00:29:34,169 --> 00:29:38,429
we're going to run<font color="#E5E5E5"> the paces for on the</font>

724
00:29:35,849 --> 00:29:40,289
parsers right what happens if we throw

725
00:29:38,429 --> 00:29:42,209
invalid or<font color="#CCCCCC"> mangles files at it maybe we</font>

726
00:29:40,289 --> 00:29:43,949
can do some fuzzing see if it if the

727
00:29:42,209 --> 00:29:46,049
parser throws up on stuff it didn't

728
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:49,619
expect in terms of the up late

729
00:29:46,049 --> 00:29:51,449
deployment okay is it encrypted is are

730
00:29:49,619 --> 00:29:55,349
the updates you know properly signed

731
00:29:51,449 --> 00:29:57,799
properly<font color="#CCCCCC"> a you know encoded not encoded</font>

732
00:29:55,349 --> 00:30:00,749
encrypted or whatever are they using SSL

733
00:29:57,799 --> 00:30:03,479
certificate<font color="#CCCCCC"> good is their certificate</font>

734
00:30:00,749 --> 00:30:05,039
pinning that sort of thing the operating

735
00:30:03,479 --> 00:30:07,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">system that they're using for their</font>

736
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:08,999
virtual appliances or whatnot are those

737
00:30:07,109 --> 00:30:10,619
operating systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard ends are they out</font>

738
00:30:08,999 --> 00:30:12,989
of date are they using a really really

739
00:30:10,619 --> 00:30:16,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">old version that if I update it it's</font>

740
00:30:12,989 --> 00:30:18,269
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to break everything it's the</font>

741
00:30:16,529 --> 00:30:21,389
operating system hardened or<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

742
00:30:18,269 --> 00:30:23,459
everything running as root are we you

743
00:30:21,389 --> 00:30:25,529
know properly jailing things if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

744
00:30:23,459 --> 00:30:27,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">to jail them are we basically running it</font>

745
00:30:25,529 --> 00:30:29,669
as a less privileged user and then

746
00:30:27,649 --> 00:30:31,978
escalating privilege<font color="#CCCCCC"> only what we need</font>

747
00:30:29,669 --> 00:30:33,299
it dropping it when we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need it for</font>

748
00:30:31,979 --> 00:30:35,579
the endpoint agents again we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

749
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:38,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at the parsers throw weird stuff at</font>

750
00:30:35,579 --> 00:30:41,369
it same thing with you updated

751
00:30:38,639 --> 00:30:43,468
deployment mechanism also look at the

752
00:30:41,369 --> 00:30:45,389
drivers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> services</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they do ok the</font>

753
00:30:43,469 --> 00:30:46,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">vm point agent can be tying into a lot</font>

754
00:30:45,389 --> 00:30:49,468
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things it can be looking at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the file</font>

755
00:30:46,619 --> 00:30:51,029
system it<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be looking at your you</font>

756
00:30:49,469 --> 00:30:52,199
know interaction with printers it can be

757
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:54,599
looking at your interaction with a

758
00:30:52,199 --> 00:30:56,159
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> stack so those are a lot of</font>

759
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:58,499
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the endpoint agent can get</font>

760
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:01,769
its hooks into we want to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> if they</font>

761
00:30:58,499 --> 00:31:04,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">are properly handling what happens if i</font>

762
00:31:01,769 --> 00:31:06,419
send a whole bunch of weird packets to

763
00:31:04,589 --> 00:31:08,219
this endpoint or what if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i tried to open</font>

764
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:10,199
up a really really funky file or<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

765
00:31:08,219 --> 00:31:11,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">not what's going to happen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe I send</font>

766
00:31:10,199 --> 00:31:13,349
maybe it's monitoring print jobs and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

767
00:31:11,849 --> 00:31:15,299
will send a really really weird print

768
00:31:13,349 --> 00:31:17,329
request with malformed data is it going

769
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:20,158
to crash it's going to throw up and then

770
00:31:17,329 --> 00:31:22,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the management server most of these</font>

771
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,869
are web app interfaces so our typical

772
00:31:22,109 --> 00:31:27,149
you know a loss top<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 type stuff comes</font>

773
00:31:24,869 --> 00:31:28,769
in the database that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we use the sewer</font>

774
00:31:27,149 --> 00:31:30,809
policies and other sorts of information

775
00:31:28,769 --> 00:31:32,909
we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at make sure if that</font>

776
00:31:30,809 --> 00:31:35,119
the data is stored in a good way so

777
00:31:32,909 --> 00:31:37,889
anything sensitive should be encrypted

778
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:41,129
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> configuration should not be no</font>

779
00:31:37,889 --> 00:31:42,539
password or running as root and same

780
00:31:41,129 --> 00:31:44,280
thing with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the operating system make</font>

781
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:45,900
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have</font>

782
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:49,800
the operating system is up to date is

783
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:54,120
hardens and is not configured in a way

784
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:56,190
that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not considered best practice all</font>

785
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,959
right another 20 minutes to go or less

786
00:31:56,190 --> 00:32:01,740
than that<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just go through all of</font>

787
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:03,300
the stuff we found so before<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

788
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:04,800
specifics we're going to go vendor by

789
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:06,419
vendor I just want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about general</font>

790
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:09,480
observations just the trends that we saw

791
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:11,430
overall in terms of you know things that

792
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:14,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">it seems like everybody is kind of not</font>

793
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:17,520
getting right so the Linux appliances we

794
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:19,649
did see a like a very big lack of

795
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,820
hardening you know there were some

796
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:23,160
things that could have been locked out a

797
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:25,110
lot more we did see things running as

798
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:27,060
root where they shouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been so</font>

799
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:29,610
that's maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the things that they</font>

800
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:31,620
expect you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself but you know</font>

801
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:33,449
as somebody who's selling you a solution

802
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:35,399
we kind of expected that<font color="#E5E5E5"> those were a</font>

803
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:36,900
little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> better than they were so</font>

804
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:39,090
again the last service is run as root

805
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:41,310
they weren't using any sort of exploit

806
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:44,280
mitigation you know in terms of memory

807
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:49,440
corruption or code execution

808
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:51,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">Prevention's the endpoint agent software</font>

809
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,890
again we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how this stuff has</font>

810
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:55,140
access to a lot of stuff we<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to lock</font>

811
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:58,740
it down the endpoint agents out of the

812
00:32:55,140 --> 00:33:00,270
box usually ran as very very high level

813
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:04,470
of privilege<font color="#CCCCCC"> root local system</font>

814
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:06,750
administrator and then just general

815
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:09,090
absence of best practices like it's just

816
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:11,880
we really<font color="#CCCCCC"> didn't expect it to be as easy</font>

817
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:13,770
to find problems as we did you know

818
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:17,340
things where they didn't encrypt their

819
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:19,530
communications where they didn't I don't

820
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:21,209
know if they mean the<font color="#CCCCCC"> OAuth top 10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

821
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:22,740
pretty easy to find I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

822
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:24,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">what I don't know what's going we'll get</font>

823
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:26,250
into that and then occasional bug

824
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,929
inheritance they're using libraries that

825
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:29,160
have bugs that either haven't been

826
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:31,650
patched or do they using an outdated

827
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:34,800
version will go into specifics way we

828
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:36,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into the you know different targets</font>

829
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:39,870
but we did see you know people using

830
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:43,470
things like outdated JRE s3d<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cee and</font>

831
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:45,149
whatnot alright so the part where act

832
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:49,590
people actually that people actually

833
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:52,320
came to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this talk for all right so again</font>

834
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:53,669
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said you know and again you know this</font>

835
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">is going to come off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as a rant and maybe</font>

836
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:57,660
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole talk really isn't a rant but</font>

837
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:59,879
one of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I kind of</font>

838
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:02,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">we's expect from a vendor especially a</font>

839
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:04,290
vendor<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know is asking you for a</font>

840
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:06,690
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of money and is you know basically</font>

841
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:08,400
making the bulk of their profit from

842
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:10,380
selling people security solutions is

843
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:12,990
what not is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you should not have</font>

844
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:20,250
vulnerabilities that are so obvious that

845
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:21,750
an intern can find them and these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are so</font>

846
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:23,418
these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> just different pages some of</font>

847
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:25,710
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are reflected some of these are</font>

848
00:34:23,418 --> 00:34:28,759
stored but there's was cross-site

849
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:31,050
scripting all over turn my co which was

850
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:33,510
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't even find this</font>

851
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:35,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">my most of these myself I had like no</font>

852
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:36,840
because I was running burp suite and

853
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:41,760
burp is like this might be it I'm like

854
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:43,380
no no oh why they patch this<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

855
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,260
pretty sure they<font color="#CCCCCC"> patch this another one</font>

856
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:49,970
again come on cross-site request forgery

857
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:52,290
we learned this what like I yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

858
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:55,139
what can we do you know you can make

859
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:56,940
policies or whatnot<font color="#E5E5E5"> so why don't I see</font>

860
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:58,650
if I can trick an administrator into

861
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:00,180
making a policy maybe I make a<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy</font>

862
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:02,520
that allows me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do whatever I want</font>

863
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:04,560
maybe I make a<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy that blocks people</font>

864
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:07,160
from doing stuff they have to do let's

865
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:10,080
see if we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually what am i doing</font>

866
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:11,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay this needs to go faster but you</font>

867
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:13,560
guys all know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what and gals all know</font>

868
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:17,190
across site request forgery is so I'm

869
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:19,710
just what am I change in here oh so I

870
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:21,510
just changed the policy number was at

871
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:23,190
the peloton yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just changed the</font>

872
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:25,620
policy number 20 day just as a regular

873
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:29,280
proof of concept so if we go in and then

874
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:31,560
go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the panel we should yeah</font>

875
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">let's go look at what our keywords are</font>

876
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,770
all right now I have a keyword list

877
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,600
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> o days and I can fill that with</font>

878
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:39,930
whatever I want I could create a policy

879
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:42,870
using that keyword list another one

880
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:44,190
again turn right go hopefully has fixed

881
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:48,390
most of the stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm pretty sure they</font>

882
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:51,270
have we were kind of looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

883
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:55,290
this is there the remote crawler so

884
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:57,750
basically you say hey I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this is</font>

885
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:59,160
my you know agent on my<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows desktop</font>

886
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:00,780
I want you to crawl this and see if

887
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,490
there's anything weird going on like

888
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:05,280
does she have files on her system she

889
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:07,319
shouldn't have you know does<font color="#CCCCCC"> she have a</font>

890
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,300
list of everybody's salary or something

891
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:11,070
in an Excel spreadsheet and all that was

892
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:16,210
in plain text

893
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:17,950
which is you know nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm hopefully</font>

894
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:20,440
you just work at a company where nobody

895
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:22,868
knows how to run<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pack of smokes it's</font>

896
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:24,730
never so that was trend micro just

897
00:36:22,869 --> 00:36:27,780
really disappointing especially for the

898
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:30,400
first thing we looked at<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sophos</font>

899
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:33,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">sophos was actually surprisingly not</font>

900
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,500
that bad they most of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> code was</font>

901
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:39,250
in.net so and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were using the MS</font>

902
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:41,080
core libraries which modern modern we

903
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:43,390
tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be pretty good database best</font>

904
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:45,520
practices so you know using<font color="#E5E5E5"> stored</font>

905
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:47,259
procedures<font color="#CCCCCC"> parameterised queries there</font>

906
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,550
were you know encoding their input<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

907
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:49,960
output pretty well and they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

908
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:53,500
encryption libraries which were not

909
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:58,210
broken so good job<font color="#CCCCCC"> sophos that was on</font>

910
00:36:53,500 --> 00:37:00,369
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> endpoint same thing came for the the</font>

911
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:02,560
other manager so they were cheaper they

912
00:37:00,369 --> 00:37:04,500
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> chiru they dropped privileges we</font>

913
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:06,730
didn't see a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of web vulnerabilities</font>

914
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:10,270
just some low impact stuff like

915
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:12,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">information leakage the network and</font>

916
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:17,830
login access control restrictions we're

917
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:20,109
pretty locked down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to okay open dlp just</font>

918
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:21,160
a note<font color="#E5E5E5"> on open dlp we just didn't find a</font>

919
00:37:20,109 --> 00:37:22,839
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> just because there really isn't a</font>

920
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:27,009
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of functionality we did frying</font>

921
00:37:22,839 --> 00:37:30,099
cross-site request forgery which<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

922
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:32,890
you know you can create<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pretty into</font>

923
00:37:30,099 --> 00:37:36,339
creating a profile that they you know

924
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:39,299
didn't intend<font color="#CCCCCC"> to create okay so let's</font>

925
00:37:36,339 --> 00:37:42,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about websense for a little bit as</font>

926
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:44,349
you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> expect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for most policies they</font>

927
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,940
contain you know keywords regular

928
00:37:44,349 --> 00:37:47,550
discretions or whatnot but the

929
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:49,690
interesting thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> about these with these</font>

930
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:51,010
specific policies for web scents or

931
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:54,820
they're actually they actually made them

932
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:56,560
as Python pickled objects so what

933
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:58,930
happens is the management server they

934
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,580
take they take the the policies they

935
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:01,868
bundle them they encrypt them and then

936
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:03,400
they push them to the agency's

937
00:38:01,869 --> 00:38:08,320
appliances saying here's the new policy

938
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:10,839
go do policy stuff use it policies so if

939
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:13,480
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's say I'm a local</font>

940
00:38:10,839 --> 00:38:15,310
admin and I really really<font color="#CCCCCC"> hate my job or</font>

941
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,690
I really really hate deal p or maybe

942
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:20,200
somebody slipped me some money<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

943
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:22,000
this if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I replace the policy file which</font>

944
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,680
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a dot pic where's pickled object with</font>

945
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,960
my custom pickled objects

946
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:28,868
and you probably can't see that very

947
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:30,940
well but we're basically replacing a

948
00:38:28,869 --> 00:38:34,059
legitimate policy file with some bad

949
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:36,010
stuff and we were able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get a reverse</font>

950
00:38:34,059 --> 00:38:38,619
shell from the protector after the

951
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:40,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">policy update and we're route so that</font>

952
00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:43,660
was not good so yeah if you want to pop

953
00:38:40,809 --> 00:38:44,980
a machine as like an admin<font color="#CCCCCC"> on this I</font>

954
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:50,078
mean you shouldn't be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it</font>

955
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:52,540
anymore but again dlp is in a very

956
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:54,640
advantageous position being able to do

957
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:57,339
stuff like this is no bueno not very

958
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:59,828
it's not good<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let's go into</font>

959
00:38:57,339 --> 00:39:01,150
these smaller ones and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm kind of going</font>

960
00:38:59,829 --> 00:39:03,250
fast just cuz are a lot of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

961
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:04,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">alpha dlp got some things right which is</font>

962
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:06,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">good they didn't have any cross-site</font>

963
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:08,410
request forgery they didn't have any

964
00:39:06,309 --> 00:39:13,180
remember alpha dlp is the one that uses

965
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:15,098
flash and a whole bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> other stuff</font>

966
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:17,169
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we didn't like we didn't see any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

967
00:39:15,099 --> 00:39:20,349
cross-site flashing in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

968
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:22,809
management application<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay great they</font>

969
00:39:20,349 --> 00:39:24,430
used hibernate so there to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to their</font>

970
00:39:22,809 --> 00:39:30,099
databases so we couldn't find any sequel

971
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:31,328
injection what which is good but they

972
00:39:30,099 --> 00:39:36,549
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> put any authentication on the</font>

973
00:39:31,329 --> 00:39:39,900
mysql database want well also<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

974
00:39:36,549 --> 00:39:42,220
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talked about reliability and</font>

975
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:43,540
having something on your system

976
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:45,700
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's sitting on a lot of</font>

977
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:47,140
machines something that those machines

978
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,848
have end points that need to talk to

979
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:52,480
your management server having that's

980
00:39:48,849 --> 00:39:55,119
something that crashes a lot is you know

981
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,500
basically not very good it's just going

982
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:59,140
to make everybody's lives miserable

983
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:01,869
people hate security people enough as it

984
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:03,940
is forcing you know subpar products on

985
00:40:01,869 --> 00:40:07,540
them is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone hate</font>

986
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:11,410
us even more this thing crashed harder

987
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:13,599
than I'm trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think of who's the</font>

988
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:18,220
celebrity who's known for<font color="#CCCCCC"> like getting</font>

989
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:20,670
into a lot of car wrecks I can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

990
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:23,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">of one that I mean Lindsay Lohan I guess</font>

991
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:25,630
it crashed a lot I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> say like at</font>

992
00:40:23,799 --> 00:40:28,150
least once an hour and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

993
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:32,260
being generous this thing went down like

994
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:33,819
harder than what's her name that boxer

995
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:37,250
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> got punched in the face by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Holly</font>

996
00:40:33,819 --> 00:40:40,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">Holm yeah it was really bad it</font>

997
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:42,290
not good so that was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the server for</font>

998
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:43,970
the admin we saw a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> marshaling</font>

999
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:48,110
between java and Erlang as you would

1000
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:49,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to do we did see that maybe there</font>

1001
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:50,720
would be some potential heap corruption

1002
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:53,510
there we didn't really get enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

1003
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:55,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">to investigate but you know maybe</font>

1004
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:56,960
something for future but the bad thing

1005
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:58,609
the thing that made me really really

1006
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">upset and I start crying I didn't really</font>

1007
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:02,930
start crying they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> using a really</font>

1008
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:05,300
really old JRE and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know that you know</font>

1009
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:07,580
it's perfectly fine to never update your

1010
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:09,590
Java nothing ever bad ever happens if

1011
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:12,650
you don't update your<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java but this is</font>

1012
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:15,850
really old<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I tried to update it and</font>

1013
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:18,290
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> broke everything so yeah not good</font>

1014
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:20,150
there was also some<font color="#CCCCCC"> path no violation</font>

1015
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:21,590
with the Erlang rules so maybe you could

1016
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:24,560
get it's a point somewhere it shouldn't

1017
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:28,040
be looking and they also didn't sign on

1018
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:30,110
remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> air lang java and.net on</font>

1019
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:32,570
the.net assemblies they didn't do any

1020
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:34,130
signing so you know if you're unfamiliar

1021
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:36,890
with assembly signing and dotnet

1022
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:39,620
basically you can put some protective

1023
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:41,779
you know hashing and whatnot so that the

1024
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:44,810
runtime will verify the signature if the

1025
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:46,730
signature doesn't match the the assembly

1026
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:48,410
then it says this has been tampered<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

1027
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:50,060
I don't want to run it they didn't put

1028
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:52,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">that on there so I was able to do this</font>

1029
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:54,980
and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> its vast improvement so</font>

1030
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:56,780
instead of having our whatever this can

1031
00:41:54,980 --> 00:42:01,100
we have the threat but intelligent

1032
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:02,390
agents global apt configurator and this

1033
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:04,279
is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it looked like I just took out</font>

1034
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:06,950
the vendor stuff and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what I did</font>

1035
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:10,010
to it I basically just injected

1036
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:12,980
different new um I mean here I just

1037
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:16,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">modified strings and changed the binary</font>

1038
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:19,940
for the logo which is which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine but</font>

1039
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:21,710
again you could make this agent do bad

1040
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:24,410
things you could basically rootkit it

1041
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:29,480
make and hide inside that agent if you

1042
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:31,370
were savvy with<font color="#E5E5E5"> dotnet okay Downton okay</font>

1043
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,450
Bravo was probably one of the more

1044
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:35,660
complex ones I'm just going to go

1045
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:37,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">through them one that this won't real</font>

1046
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:39,470
fast it was really heavily reversed we

1047
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:43,130
didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> find anything so we got</font>

1048
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:46,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">really lazy they used DC erp for agent</font>

1049
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:49,130
server comes maybe that's why they did a

1050
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:50,990
lot of encryption packet privacy except

1051
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:51,470
for the OSS agent which is all plain

1052
00:42:50,990 --> 00:43:00,169
text

1053
00:42:51,470 --> 00:43:03,560
occasions oh dude again this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is so</font>

1054
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:05,510
pretty good<font color="#E5E5E5"> except come on in crip stuff</font>

1055
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:09,650
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry it just keep going for</font>

1056
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:11,660
Charlie dlp no anti CRS tokens all

1057
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:14,780
operations are done restfully so you can

1058
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:16,640
see our CSR why is this not working you

1059
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:18,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">can see us RF an admin and delete the</font>

1060
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:21,140
policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right these slides are</font>

1061
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:22,609
fucking fucked up I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe I</font>

1062
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:25,730
clicked it too much<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's just going</font>

1063
00:43:22,609 --> 00:43:27,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">around just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go supplement the</font>

1064
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:29,450
registration of endpoint agents is done

1065
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:32,290
by Sophie API that does not perform

1066
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:37,910
authentication and you can also inject

1067
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:40,490
stuff into the admin console these are

1068
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:44,598
super amazing j/s alert skills so

1069
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:47,419
basically we gave it<font color="#E5E5E5"> some see data in an</font>

1070
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:49,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">xml file and it was like whoa there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1071
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:52,520
go all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right let's look at dingus again</font>

1072
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:54,890
dinkus may or may not exist dinkus may

1073
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:57,950
be a figment of imagination or something

1074
00:43:54,890 --> 00:44:00,980
that came to us<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a fever dream it's</font>

1075
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:03,529
real we just don't want to so first

1076
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:05,450
thing they have a support account that

1077
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:07,210
is totally not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a backdoor I mean it</font>

1078
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:10,759
reverse SS ages to an Eastern European

1079
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:13,010
coming proxy somewhere but that's no big

1080
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:14,750
deal nothing ever bad has happened if

1081
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:16,580
you find an Eastern European<font color="#E5E5E5"> proxy I</font>

1082
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:18,680
mean I love Eastern Europe I just

1083
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:20,480
wouldn't ever want to find my machine

1084
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:23,750
proxying<font color="#E5E5E5"> there okay five minutes cool a</font>

1085
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:26,270
same protect same non<font color="#E5E5E5"> password protected</font>

1086
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:31,060
key on every appliance support can login

1087
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:31,060
at root on every appliance like that and

1088
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:36,080
the support candidates evokes for the

1089
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:37,339
web UI so you basically have a reverse

1090
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:40,700
tunnel everywhere if you combine<font color="#CCCCCC"> it with</font>

1091
00:44:37,339 --> 00:44:42,650
cross-site request forgery you can also

1092
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:46,480
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cross-site request forgery to do</font>

1093
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:48,740
command injection so what we did was if

1094
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,570
you want to change<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time zone you</font>

1095
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:54,319
just pass it the string of the time zone

1096
00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:56,890
okay well why don't I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> do touch TMP</font>

1097
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,890
little injection

1098
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:03,879
and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a file on the system and</font>

1099
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:05,109
it's reza patchy so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're whatever</font>

1100
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:07,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're uploading their will run as</font>

1101
00:45:05,109 --> 00:45:11,140
Apache so<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe some sort of script that</font>

1102
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:13,569
would be nice okay um let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> skip</font>

1103
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:15,368
lots of pseudo errs that are Apache one

1104
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:19,630
of them is<font color="#E5E5E5"> our p.m. okay let's install</font>

1105
00:45:15,369 --> 00:45:25,839
stuff central console is on<font color="#E5E5E5"> them that</font>

1106
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:29,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">they can d be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the synchronization</font>

1107
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:34,089
channel is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just plain text postgres and</font>

1108
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:36,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so all right real fast what about</font>

1109
00:45:34,089 --> 00:45:39,190
bypasses well again if you're dealing

1110
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:40,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">with somebody who does not who really</font>

1111
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:42,160
really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get around it it's very</font>

1112
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:43,899
likely they're going to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to or</font>

1113
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:46,029
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get somebody hired into</font>

1114
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:47,829
your company who is able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it okay</font>

1115
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:51,160
so what can we do we can use obscure

1116
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:53,290
file formats obscure obscure protocols

1117
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:54,759
do weird things on the network side

1118
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:57,430
channels any of you were working at

1119
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:59,079
finance we use Bloomberg terminal they

1120
00:45:57,430 --> 00:46:01,270
have their own chat and their own email

1121
00:45:59,079 --> 00:46:04,960
client are you monitoring that hopefully

1122
00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:06,700
okay using upskirt<font color="#CCCCCC"> obfuscate encrypted</font>

1123
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,500
files maybe doing some state

1124
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:11,259
steganography within those files and

1125
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:13,839
then again who do you trust how many of

1126
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:15,720
your users have elevated privileges how

1127
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:19,720
many of the of them can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just go around</font>

1128
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:20,919
disabling agents okay just<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> final</font>

1129
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:22,810
note because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know that they're</font>

1130
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:24,520
probably always get people in the

1131
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:27,310
audience they're like oh man so dlp just

1132
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:29,920
sucks and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it this sucks like</font>

1133
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:32,859
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> am I going to so it still has value</font>

1134
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:35,079
um oh I didn't know it's all looks like

1135
00:46:32,859 --> 00:46:37,049
great it still has value if you know

1136
00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:39,790
just make sure that what you're getting

1137
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:41,349
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> kick the tires in terms of</font>

1138
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:43,029
security before you actually give them

like in defense in depth right you

1141
00:46:44,589 --> 00:46:48,040
should have your button your firewalls

1142
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,170
blocking stuff you don't need you should

1143
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:52,029
have IBS monitoring for stuff that is

1151
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:06,859
at the end of the day you need to

1152
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:08,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically talk to the person who said</font>

catch them<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing something wrong which</font>

be nice to them just say I saw you were

00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:23,240
doing this here's a way you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it or</font>

1160
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:25,130
here's something you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do instead that</font>

1161

is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to violate policy get us all in</font>

00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:39,620
your stuff regularly do these<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

1168
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:42,350
still need these permissions so on and

00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:49,490
you put in your network can and we'll

1172
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:50,839
add additional attack surface so you buy

1173

something<font color="#E5E5E5"> or you're looking at buying</font>

1175
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:57,200
yourself see what security they've had

1176
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:58,879
done have they had their code skinned

1177
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,439
have they had a code audit have they had

1178

any sort of penetration<font color="#CCCCCC"> test</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done by</font>

them if you can hire somebody to

1181
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:09,050
actually do some security analysis on

1182
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:10,310
them if they say no then maybe try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1183
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:11,840
scratch your head and figure out what it

00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:13,220
what I don't like the excuse what do you

1185

rant that I come on you're selling me

1191
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:30,950
something you're a<font color="#E5E5E5"> security company</font>

1192
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:33,620
you're making you are a security company

1193
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:35,629
right why are they not<font color="#E5E5E5"> finding these</font>

1194
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:37,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">things a scanner can find it an intern</font>

1195
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:38,660
can find it i could probably my mother

1196

doesn't know how to turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a computer</font>

but<font color="#CCCCCC"> once</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i turn it on for her i could</font>

1198
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:46,580
probably teach her how to find some of

1199
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:48,740
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">considering a solution like this you</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">have to know who you're defending again</font>

1202

if you're really worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bradley</font>

1203
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">manning or somebody who's already</font>

1204
00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:58,359
trusted who's inside your organization

1205
00:48:55,210 --> 00:49:00,860
you're going to have a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

1206
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:03,620
method of trying to catch those people

1207
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:06,260
than<font color="#CCCCCC"> just you know the administrator who</font>

1208
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:08,089
copies everyone's salaries out of a

1209
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:11,590
spreadsheet and accidentally emails them

1210
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:14,240
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone in the company right and</font>

1211
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:16,360
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean at the end of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the day</font>

1212
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:18,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">everyone has a cell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> phone</font>

1213
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:21,950
you might want to worry about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that too</font>

1214
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:23,540
so we only have two minutes but I could

1215
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:28,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably take one or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two questions if</font>

1216
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:30,380
there are any that's me the dog also

1217
00:49:28,310 --> 00:49:32,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's my email address George Sims the</font>

1218
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:34,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">troop micronics and I'm also Viloria on</font>

1219
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:36,620
twitter if anyone wants to<font color="#CCCCCC"> press</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1220
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:39,770
apologize for<font color="#CCCCCC"> going over so my question</font>

1221
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:41,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">is are the agents smart enough or have</font>

1222
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:42,950
you seen instances where the files are

1223
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:47,240
being transferred to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the management</font>

1224
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:49,730
server for analysis so you're asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

1225
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:51,259
the agent is smart enough to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the to</font>

1226
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:57,410
see if it's transferring what to the

1227
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:59,360
management server I mean so they do I

1228
00:49:57,410 --> 00:50:01,040
mean they they generally do what they're

1229
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:02,690
supposed to do like if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're trying to</font>

1230
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:05,300
email<font color="#E5E5E5"> something or copy something you're</font>

1231
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:06,800
not supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to as long as you're not as</font>

1232
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:09,050
long as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not being like super</font>

1233
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,580
sneaky about it it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will usually catch it</font>

1234
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:13,430
right it's good for what it's supposed

1235
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:16,970
to do but if you have somebody who's

1236
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:19,220
maybe going to some time it also depends

1237
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:20,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">on your policy if somebody is going to</font>

1238
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:22,549
encrypt the file and email it somewhere

1239
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,649
you got to configure it to say no you're

1240
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:26,990
not allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to send that right so it</font>

1241
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:29,330
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes down to people may be able to</font>

1242
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:31,910
trick the scanner or the endpoint agent

1243
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:33,500
because you haven't properly told it you

1244
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:38,240
know all of the different loopholes that

1245
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:40,520
people might try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to jump through would</font>

1246
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:44,839
you see drm solutions as a replacement

1247
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:49,160
or as an addition<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the lp yes so drm</font>

1248
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:50,750
like if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are looking to you know if</font>

1249
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,890
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are thinking about the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lp just to</font>

1250
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:54,590
kind of keep people from stealing

1251
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:56,180
intellectual date or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

1252
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:59,390
it's you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I'm not really a lawyer or</font>

1253
00:50:56,180 --> 00:51:01,279
anything the<font color="#E5E5E5"> argument against CRM as you</font>

1254
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:03,650
know it does it is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

1255
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:05,000
being able to bypass but again depending

1256
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:06,860
on who you're defending against it can

1257
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:10,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">be an additional layer of protection you</font>

1258
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:12,740
know in with respect to we put this DM

1259
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:16,010
drm on there you took it off you've

1260
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:18,970
clearly produced evidence or you

1261
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:20,900
basically you basically you know like

1262
00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:24,709
changed yourself like you're basically

1263
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:26,600
like you by breaking this breaking the

1264
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:27,980
drm you basically proven that you had

1265
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:29,359
bad in center

1266
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:31,820
like you did something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1267
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:33,529
explicitly told you not to do so again

1268
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:35,240
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> dlp can catch people trying to do</font>

1269
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:37,940
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> DRM I guess</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just a different</font>

1270
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:43,180
method of trying to you know keep people

1271
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:43,180
from keeping honest people honest rather

1272
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:55,640
as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> scorer CIL's euro 0 did you find</font>

1273
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:58,100
anything related to these scanners<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

1274
00:51:55,640 --> 00:52:00,650
faster to give up like let's say<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1275
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:02,600
encrypt<font color="#CCCCCC"> a file of some weird hashing</font>

1276

algorithm<font color="#E5E5E5"> by maybe in the end of myself</font>

1277
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:08,450
are there any scanners to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll fuck</font>

1278
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:11,510
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just let it go through or uh yeah so</font>

1279
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:13,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">usually um so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> usually what would happen</font>

1280
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:17,330
it wouldn't be more of the scanner being

1281
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:19,129
like I didn't I didn't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this or like</font>

1282
00:52:17,330 --> 00:52:20,750
this is taking too long<font color="#E5E5E5"> send it through</font>

1283
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:22,940
it was more like the scanner was like I

1284
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:24,859
don't know what this is I don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1285
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:28,250
rule saying what to do with this<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

1286
00:52:24,859 --> 00:52:29,779
whatever bye there have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> instances</font>

1287
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:31,190
where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did send like really really</font>

1288
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:33,410
funky stuff to it and it thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1289
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:35,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">could scan it and but it wouldn't it</font>

1290
00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:37,819
didn't fail open it basically usually

1291
00:52:35,270 --> 00:52:45,200
they just throw up and crash so that's

1292
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:48,320
yeah unfortunately yeah there's one

1293
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:52,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">person here and over right in front of</font>

1294
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:54,920
you so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> has been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the winter response</font>

1295
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:57,200
and have they patched all the

1296
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:59,180
vulnerabilities you have reported so

1297
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:00,919
there were some of them that we we

1298
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:03,230
didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> get the updated version but so</font>

1299
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:05,390
that's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a funny story is that we</font>

1300
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:07,190
you know when we found these were like

1301
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:09,470
we're gonna report them why you know

1302
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:11,240
work for nice people we don't need to

1303
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:12,560
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of Eau de blowing around it</font>

1304
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:13,700
was actually kind of difficult for some

1305
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:16,369
of the vendors like they didn't have

1306
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:18,319
none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them had bug bounties a lot of</font>

1307
00:53:16,369 --> 00:53:20,270
them didn't have easy ways to contact

1308
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:22,609
people and in some instances we actually

1309
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:26,750
had to go through support and say I'm

1310
00:53:22,609 --> 00:53:29,180
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not somebody who is current I'm</font>

1311
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:30,859
not like an enterprise clients of yours

1312
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:33,200
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found something can you like give</font>

1313
00:53:30,859 --> 00:53:34,430
us an email address so just reporting

1314
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,720
them was difficult in a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways</font>

1315
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:37,009
because a lot of these bigger companies

1316
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:39,589
aren't really set up for that sort of

1317
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:41,300
thing which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> weird but yet</font>

1318
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:43,970
once they found out they did

1319
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:46,000
to actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix the stuff the ones that</font>

1320
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:48,379
we could verify at least they did fix it

1321
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:51,290
so hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other ones were but</font>

1322
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:53,630
yeah it's we did tell everybody that we

1323
00:53:51,290 --> 00:53:56,390
found bad stuff so we're trying trying

1324
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:57,830
to be good citizens you know despite

1325
00:53:56,390 --> 00:54:03,080
mocking them on a public stage in front

1326
00:53:57,830 --> 00:54:05,390
of all you people<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right cool all</font>

1327
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:08,120
right thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very much sorry for the</font>

1328
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:10,460
going a little fast at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end but hope</font>

1329
