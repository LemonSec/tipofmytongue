00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:15,990
hello good evening so my name<font color="#CCCCCC"> is Danny</font>

2
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:18,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">mana I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ntt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> home security</font>

3
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:22,350
and we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about internet of</font>

4
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:27,480
things like all the day<font color="#CCCCCC"> let see if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i can</font>

5
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:32,969
tell you something new first of all my

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:39,989
presenter isn't working improvise thanks

7
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:43,460
for your<font color="#CCCCCC"> attention yep that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not going</font>

8
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:43,459
to work we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to start this again</font>

9
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:59,349
let me give you an overview again first

10
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:01,899
of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will explain a little bit what</font>

11
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:04,089
Internet of Things is regarding some

12
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:05,740
definitions I don't want to go too deep

13
00:01:04,089 --> 00:01:08,259
into it because you all know what it is

14
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:11,979
we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about security</font>

15
00:01:08,259 --> 00:01:14,229
expects which are as we have seen not

16
00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:17,890
quite implemented as we expected them to

17
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:20,500
be then I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a small look into</font>

18
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:23,700
some power plugs which are controlled

19
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:27,310
like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet of Things they are</font>

20
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:29,800
interesting protocols not that custom

21
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:32,640
like in other presentations we have seen

22
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:35,850
there but they somehow give you a unique

23
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,530
access point which might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be quite</font>

24
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:41,440
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I will sum</font>

25
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:44,500
it up in a conclusion so let's get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

26
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:47,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">the internet'll things I grabbed it from</font>

27
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:49,530
the wikipedia and it's not much of a

28
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:53,830
deal in the little things or devices

29
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:55,330
vehicles buildings and other items so

30
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:58,030
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to realize we are talking about</font>

31
00:01:55,330 --> 00:02:00,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">other items what are these items what</font>

32
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:05,110
where where are they implementing things

33
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:08,080
where they are hidden the problem with

34
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:09,669
these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that's not quite obvious</font>

35
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes you have to discover them</font>

36
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:17,410
first to realize there's a flaw<font color="#CCCCCC"> in them</font>

37
00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:19,900
and since we're not hacking cars or

38
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:21,430
vehicles or buildings at this point we

39
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,860
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to focus on home automation</font>

40
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:28,300
so I try to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> down to home automation</font>

41
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:30,250
and I realized well what's home<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

42
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,720
accommodation<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's residual extension of</font>

43
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,430
building automation and involves the

44
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:37,330
control and automation lighting heating

45
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:38,980
and so on and so on and security so

46
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:41,500
we're hooking up security in the

47
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:47,018
Internet of Things<font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm that's food for</font>

48
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:50,080
thought so let's break this up a little

49
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:54,360
bit just to give you a small<font color="#E5E5E5"> aspect what</font>

50
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:56,530
global<font color="#E5E5E5"> threat we might face first of all</font>

51
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,450
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about smart cities</font>

52
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:00,640
surveillance security traffic control

53
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:03,339
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> song all's getting hooked up to the</font>

54
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,989
internet all let's building up some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

55
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:11,230
of attack

56
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:16,850
wall where our adversary can fast break

57
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:19,310
into it try to<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah get into it smart</font>

58
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:21,680
grid we have seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> several talks now</font>

59
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:24,290
about smart grid consumer control energy

60
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,210
control that's kind of a nightmare there

61
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:28,579
are stories in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet where they</font>

62
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:30,590
are where they are describing what would

63
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:33,460
happen if we lose<font color="#E5E5E5"> power from one day to</font>

64
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:35,870
another or lose power for a whole week

65
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:38,300
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that and the idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

66
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:43,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">connecting it to the internet might be</font>

67
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:46,130
another thing to keep in mind then we

68
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:47,960
have smart retail so stocktaking smart

69
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:51,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">shelves advertising and so on and so on</font>

70
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:53,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I just did a penetration test in a</font>

71
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:55,280
smart retail job and it was quite

72
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:57,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting once you get inside the</font>

73
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,260
network somehow somewhere you realize

74
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:03,470
there are so many devices which might

75
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:05,929
not be supposed to be there which might

76
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:08,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">be related to internet of things which</font>

77
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:12,940
might have access points for you that

78
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:15,649
pose opportunities to get inside and

79
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:18,620
especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the attacker and finally</font>

80
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:22,520
we're talking about smart home so

81
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:24,320
consumer control security logs cameras

82
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:27,349
and so on all hooked up to the internet

83
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,150
I mean if you crawl children HQ and you

84
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:31,610
will see there are a lot of cameras web

85
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:33,590
cameras you can just put<font color="#E5E5E5"> into your</font>

86
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:36,820
browser and you money for someone else's

87
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:39,349
home that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet of Things and</font>

88
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:42,200
we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about heating control and</font>

89
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:46,419
especially energy management so let's

90
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:49,190
get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a bit security aspects</font>

91
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:51,710
asking the customer or the manufacturer

92
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:54,040
at this point and he states the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole</font>

93
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:58,849
network secure ever hurt us before

94
00:04:54,040 --> 00:05:00,740
someone from your<font color="#E5E5E5"> customers I did just</font>

95
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:03,680
yesterday when I talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to someone and</font>

96
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:05,930
they also agreed their network<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sakura</font>

97
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:10,100
can be viewed a secure we don't need any

98
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:12,289
security aspects so what about all these

99
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">things we are working on in everyday</font>

100
00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:14,669
life

101
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:18,719
authentication authorization

102
00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:21,250
multi-client capability privacy etc etc

103
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">so everything that's securing our</font>

104
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:26,139
day-to-day life business most of the

105
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:30,280
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's completely forgotten with</font>

106
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:33,400
Internet of Things devices ever thought

107
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:37,599
about autonomous cars controlled by

108
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:40,000
cryptolocker I mean autonomous cars can

109
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:43,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">be viewed as internal things what what</font>

110
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,990
would happen in<font color="#E5E5E5"> worst case scenario you</font>

111
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:49,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">can imagine it I mean if you are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

112
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:52,419
into it just draw<font color="#E5E5E5"> an internet of things</font>

113
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:55,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">and leave the rows of the highway you</font>

114
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:57,969
can try it on several occasions but I

115
00:05:55,659 --> 00:06:01,020
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggest it or have you thought</font>

116
00:05:57,969 --> 00:06:04,469
about smart homes and cryptolocker

117
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:07,990
everybody's anyone is seen this film

118
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:09,969
it's some kind of dystopia where you've

119
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:13,240
locked into a room which is somehow

120
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:16,120
firmly controlled you don't get<font color="#CCCCCC"> out and</font>

121
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:20,110
maybe some devices which initially

122
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:23,639
discovered might prove to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> threat so</font>

123
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:26,319
these are things which are not

124
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:28,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">considered yet I mean let's just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go a</font>

125
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,389
little bit back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this car concept</font>

126
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:34,719
imagine you are driving yourself on the

127
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:38,349
highway 100 miles per hour and someone

128
00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:40,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> telling you over the radio we</font>

129
00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:42,279
just hijacked your car please<font color="#E5E5E5"> insert</font>

130
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:45,909
your credit card<font color="#CCCCCC"> number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> otherwise you</font>

131
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:48,129
will leave the road I mean that's some

132
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:54,639
kind of opportunity for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to stay</font>

133
00:06:48,129 --> 00:06:59,099
alive so now let's go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the first</font>

134
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:02,139
example question is why did we choose to

135
00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:06,219
yeah review some kind of power plug I've

136
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:08,169
one lying here one somewhere else why

137
00:07:06,219 --> 00:07:11,110
power plug because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the crucial</font>

138
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:13,779
thing in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our network that's the basic</font>

139
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:17,139
thing we can use we can abuse we can

140
00:07:13,779 --> 00:07:20,259
improvise it's an on and off switch we

141
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:22,479
can switch<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and off a server we can</font>

142
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:24,310
switch on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and off the lights we can</font>

143
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,080
switch on and off some<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font>

144
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:28,689
create<font color="#E5E5E5"> heat</font>

145
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,539
and it's some basic thing that's used

146
00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:34,659
somewhere it's everywhere it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not quite</font>

147
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:39,310
sure where<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is but it proves to be a</font>

148
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:43,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">security threat so let's take this</font>

149
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:46,110
Belkin Wemo switch a front of mine just

150
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,270
bought<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on the internet on Amazon it's</font>

151
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:52,000
where a wireless LAN compatible its uses

152
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:55,810
upnp protocol<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we all you know that</font>

153
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:59,680
upnp is flawed regarding security<font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font>

154
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:01,900
cloud compatible why is the power plug

155
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,330
cloud compatible what well let's take a

156
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:07,299
look a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit later it doesn't</font>

157
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:10,000
support identification<font color="#E5E5E5"> why should it</font>

158
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:12,460
direct communication is possible yeah

159
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,590
you can use your smartphone to switch on

160
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:18,068
and off this power plug and the

161
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:20,619
decryption is not really necessary so

162
00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:24,400
let's take dig into it first of all

163
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:27,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">discovering it I was thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about how</font>

164
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> discover a power plug on my network</font>

165
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:32,829
and I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> this nice little script from</font>

166
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:35,559
CA p someone has provided it we do a

167
00:08:32,828 --> 00:08:39,120
broadcast em Sarge you fire it on the

168
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:42,069
network and<font color="#E5E5E5"> something returns like this</font>

169
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:45,220
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's in the power plug it's my</font>

170
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:48,100
fruits box it's my dsl router that

171
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:51,579
wasn't it intended to happen and that's

172
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:53,920
where realized yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> i also have internet</font>

173
00:08:51,579 --> 00:08:56,560
of thing devices which are not that

174
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,719
configured like<font color="#E5E5E5"> i wanted them to be that</font>

175
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:02,500
secure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i wanted them to be so I</font>

176
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:05,800
join locked into my router try to enter

177
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:08,019
to disable the upnp protocol and first

178
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:10,449
of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought I'm just incompetent I</font>

179
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:12,640
can't find<font color="#E5E5E5"> the configuration but later</font>

180
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:15,399
on after digging a little bit in the

181
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:19,990
menu I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just realized it's simply not</font>

182
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:22,839
possible to disable upnp<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so what's</font>

183
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:24,970
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem with your PMP well you can</font>

184
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:28,449
see it was here it's disclosing a

185
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:31,360
location<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the location is HTTP so you</font>

186
00:09:28,449 --> 00:09:32,150
can connect you can send a request<font color="#CCCCCC"> eiu</font>

187
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,050
you

188
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:37,689
p to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the router on a high</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> port and it's</font>

189
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:40,699
disclosing some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of configuration</font>

190
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:42,530
doing this on a vemos switch and it

191
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:46,010
would disclose you a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things you</font>

192
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:48,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't have to read it all but then it's</font>

193
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:54,530
just presenting you a lot of information

194
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:59,120
and how to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it so anyone is in</font>

195
00:09:54,530 --> 00:10:02,079
this binary state 0<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we're talking</font>

196
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:05,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">about an on and off switch this could be</font>

197
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:10,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">the point where we put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it on and off</font>

198
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:12,680
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> iconic just took the soap request</font>

199
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:16,220
constructed to solve envelope and just

200
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:19,939
put the requests in it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one</font>

201
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:24,380
parameter binary state 0 or 1 he send it

202
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:29,690
to the power plug and guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

203
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:34,310
happened let's try if I can present<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

204
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:40,940
a little bit how great it works so first

205
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:44,410
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all verb isn't responding verb is</font>

206
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,410
responding it's not connecting

207
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">where the stone is not that great today</font>

208
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:06,670
well it's messing with my ad today

209
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:09,000
figured for you to connect why<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't</font>

210
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:09,000
ping it

211
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:17,720
let's take this one okay that was it so

212
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:19,640
like I said a lot of data a lot of

213
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,430
information and of course the binary

214
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:25,400
state power block is responding at this

215
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:30,560
point take your favorite intercepting

216
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:33,980
proxy proxy or<font color="#CCCCCC"> zapotec proxy you go back</font>

217
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:37,640
the center<font color="#E5E5E5"> request you intercept it and</font>

218
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:40,490
well we just need<font color="#CCCCCC"> some kind of binary</font>

219
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:46,510
state envelope I heard so we take this

220
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:46,510
post request we

221
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:58,779
got a bitch

222
00:11:54,050 --> 00:12:02,240
put it into our request and whoa that

223
00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:05,000
one is working<font color="#CCCCCC"> so far so switching light</font>

224
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:09,070
on and off<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not a problem we can also</font>

225
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:12,170
see that the power plug is responding

226
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:17,000
everything works fine so far I don't eat

227
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:23,599
that one but let's get back to the

228
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:28,760
presentation I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get back to the</font>

229
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:31,130
presentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give it a second</font>

230
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:33,740
well I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just switched on a power plug</font>

231
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:35,480
what's the basic thing a power plug is

232
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:42,200
capable of switching it on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> off and</font>

233
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:47,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">on and off and on and off well we</font>

234
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:50,000
successfully did this so what went wrong

235
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:52,189
here well they obviously forgot

236
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,500
authentification manufacturer needs a

237
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:56,630
solution it here at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mist</font>

238
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,550
encryption so anyone seeing us on the

239
00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:01,189
traffic can replay it and switch<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on</font>

240
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:05,390
and off everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a network can view</font>

241
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:08,750
this again and<font color="#E5E5E5"> again and again so it</font>

242
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:10,610
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> look funny but how often does it</font>

243
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:13,370
happen that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the device doesn't respond</font>

244
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:16,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">to you as you expect to it to happen so</font>

245
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:18,950
it went off but the power is on when you

246
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:20,810
go there it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because someone</font>

247
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:25,130
switched it off while you were not

248
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:28,099
looking or you have to imagine where is

249
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:31,700
it placed like it's used for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a switch to</font>

250
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:35,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">create some kind of physical barrier so</font>

251
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:38,300
someone remotely can disable a threaded

252
00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:42,370
network if the attacker<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this on the</font>

253
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:46,880
wrong time just might be slow intended I

254
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:49,279
try to set<font color="#E5E5E5"> up this power plug for</font>

255
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:53,899
dummies but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have my difficulties and</font>

256
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:56,540
guess why wireless LAN security is not

257
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:58,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">always recommended</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> took a look into</font>

258
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:00,620
the manual because it doesn't work

259
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,600
didn't connect loose connection and so

260
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:05,020
on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so on and that's what's in the</font>

263
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:15,230
know may have difficulties connecting

maintaining a connection use it supports

00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:27,930
missing special characters we are

00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:30,300
telling them every year you special

they are doing is well you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> down rate</font>

271
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:39,420
your security by clicking here downgrade

272
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:44,880
your whole network security to use this

273
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:46,920
power plug that's not what we want to so

274
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:50,189
let's get<font color="#E5E5E5"> away a little bit from this</font>

275
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:52,529
power plug I mean it's controlled it can

276
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:55,260
be controlled we are cloud when a cloud

277
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:57,839
infrastructure for my smart home where

278
00:14:55,260 --> 00:15:00,390
all my devices are hidden and secure and

279
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:03,959
the programmer would probably say yeah

280
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:06,959
right let's have a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the end roid</font>

281
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:08,880

00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:19,250
it's quite readable and I mean you see

285
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:23,209
the comments there which might not be

286
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:26,779
supposed to be there but honestly

291
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:48,410
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> close one is take another look</font>

292
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:48,410
it's not going to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> better</font>

293
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:56,930
but we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an API a right and that's</font>

294
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:59,420
hidden<font color="#CCCCCC"> in secure the programmer might be</font>

295
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:02,839
a little bit disturbed by our first

296
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:05,719
discovery and well it might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> secure I</font>

297
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:10,370
think then you take<font color="#CCCCCC"> another look at the</font>

298
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:12,530
API of the mobile<font color="#CCCCCC"> application and you</font>

299
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:17,240
just discover a lot of plugins to

300
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:20,959
control the cloud I mean I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font>

301
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:24,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">how secure every of these possibilities</font>

302
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:28,600
is but there's just something like

303
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:31,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">location search for my power plug is</font>

304
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:35,630
someone else supposed to search my power

305
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:38,959
plug or what if I try to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> any of</font>

306
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:43,250
these possibilities put it into my burb

307
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:45,670
attack browser and start fuzzing you

308
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:49,850
think every one of these is secure well

309
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:51,439
not sure honestly at this point leaguer

310
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:54,530
told me just<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep away from it</font>

311
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:58,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">production you can't hack a live system</font>

312
00:16:54,530 --> 00:17:01,339
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Berkeley okay let's stop</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it we have</font>

313
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:04,609
another power black right we have the

314
00:17:01,339 --> 00:17:07,329
d-link at my colleague lost a link and I

315
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:10,729
started to love it too why you will see

316
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:14,389
it's a wireless LAN power plug it

317
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:18,310
supports h-net protocol so they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

318
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:24,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">have learned no upnp edge nap security</font>

319
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:28,099
they require<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cloud authentication is</font>

320
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:32,570
required of course direct communication

321
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:34,639
is not supposed to happen between my

322
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:37,310
laptop and a power plug just maybe

323
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:41,240
through my app through a cloud to the

324
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:45,610
power plug an decryption local yes cloud

325
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:47,990
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> other way around anyway jens accepted</font>

326
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:50,060
dealing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> produce devices with</font>

327
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:53,420
vulnerabilities the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wemo power switch</font>

328
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:55,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">already owned in past multiple times yep</font>

329
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:59,480
so what might be the d-link strategy to

330
00:17:55,910 --> 00:18:01,940
protect it of course the usual thing

331
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">trainer developers put a life cycle in</font>

332
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:05,550
it

333
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:09,479
pen testers<font color="#E5E5E5"> certificate at and what they</font>

334
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:11,970
are doing hide the firmware so we cannot

335
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:14,610
reverse engineer it hide it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's hidden</font>

336
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:20,360
somewhere login<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the web app interface</font>

337
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:25,889
is prevented by a log<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay really and</font>

338
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:28,620
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> only control via cloud yes no cloud</font>

339
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:32,070
no power switch except you go to there

340
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:34,770
and hit it I mean how often do you

341
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:37,080
realize the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet is gone honestly it</font>

342
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:39,660
happens all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to me and if I want</font>

343
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:42,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">to switch off something crucial and the</font>

344
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:46,250
internet is gone my power plug is gone

345
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:49,530
so let's think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it how do we start</font>

346
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:51,210
to reverse engineer firmware we don't

347
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:53,730
have access to it we we start with a

348
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:59,179
power plug right and the power plug is

349
00:18:53,730 --> 00:19:05,600
telling us something<font color="#CCCCCC"> somewhere query</font>

350
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:11,160
follow it another firmware query binary

351
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:13,590
follow it Oh download it<font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm maybe a</font>

352
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:16,170
binary maybe ask washer<font color="#CCCCCC"> fast file system</font>

353
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:18,870
great that's documented in the internet

354
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:21,390
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't have to do a thing except</font>

355
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:23,059
you use on squash FSU compile it with

356
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:26,429
the right d compression algorithm

357
00:19:23,059 --> 00:19:30,000
extract<font color="#CCCCCC"> the binary and finally we have a</font>

358
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:33,450
linux box we can attack so what do we do

359
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,780
at this<font color="#CCCCCC"> point i mean with file system</font>

360
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:39,660
for not initialized power plug of course

361
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:41,428
we go to the shadow he is drawn we brute

362
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:45,360
force the shadow and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we find in two</font>

363
00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:47,280
accounts<font color="#CCCCCC"> rooted Edmund and after 30</font>

364
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,219
seconds it says the admin account uses

365
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,559
the password<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 up I don't want to brute</font>

366
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:55,590
force anything because three digits of

367
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:57,420
could take quite a long<font color="#CCCCCC"> time but anyway</font>

368
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,830
the root password was quite secure I

369
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:01,230
mean I gave it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the cluster of a</font>

370
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:05,850
friend<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mine and they weren't able to</font>

371
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:09,780
brute force it so that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> start</font>

372
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:11,340
let's we dove into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> file system a</font>

373
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:14,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a library</font>

374
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:17,740
regarding h-net protocol and<font color="#CCCCCC"> textin see</font>

375
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:21,470
they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> using right and we use either</font>

376
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:24,980
start decompiling and we find a<font color="#E5E5E5"> function</font>

377
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:26,810
called said socket settings<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean its</font>

378
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:30,500
power plug right so we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to set</font>

379
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:33,590
settings and digging a little bit into

380
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:37,250
it you find parameters like nickname for

381
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:41,419
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> power plug description maybe where it</font>

382
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:43,190
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I lost it and up status create we</font>

383
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:45,590
have a knob status a binary state

384
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:51,140
upstairs yeah everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> txts own</font>

385
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:53,000
description again we construct a soap

386
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:55,340
request we put all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> parameters</font>

387
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:00,950
around like nick name description up

388
00:20:55,340 --> 00:21:06,409
status and so on and well should do it

389
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:08,390
right but there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> this mmm login so</font>

390
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:12,050
what do we do about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it looking well how</font>

391
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:15,830
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> we ignore it I tried to pass word</font>

392
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:18,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">five up and set failed that's strange</font>

393
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:21,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay let's ignore the log in and just</font>

394
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:30,440
send the request and it set unauthorized

395
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:38,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay well let's try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it again hope this</font>

396
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:39,740
works we had this<font color="#CCCCCC"> login or create it's</font>

397
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:46,780
responding

398
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:50,809
and username admin password admin login

399
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:53,059
it takes longer no doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> work any</font>

400
00:21:50,809 --> 00:22:00,040
suggestions we have a root account right

401
00:21:53,059 --> 00:22:15,170
how about rude rude any suggestions

402
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:21,440
throw it<font color="#E5E5E5"> at me nothing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well yeah</font>

403
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:23,900
that's how I got my firmware great so we

404
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:27,260
have to log in<font color="#E5E5E5"> right what do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we do with</font>

405
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:31,010
the login so i try to send a request to

406
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:34,300
the power plug again with the soap

407
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:38,720
request and i got an error message let's

408
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:43,210
try<font color="#CCCCCC"> it again I'm just trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh no</font>

409
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,210
I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to intercept the group quest</font>

410
00:22:43,809 --> 00:22:53,629
maybe just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the main request it's</font>

411
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:56,178
intercepted we take<font color="#CCCCCC"> knob we take a</font>

412
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:58,400
request that's our soap request with

413
00:22:56,179 --> 00:23:00,770
nickname and so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> opps that</font>

414
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:04,910
is true we want to send<font color="#CCCCCC"> they start</font>

415
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:06,860
something right oh let's take the whole

416
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:10,540
request that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> better posters better</font>

417
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:13,719
than I get everyone forgets about a post

418
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:13,720
for what

419
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:24,970
no that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not what I wanted hey don't</font>

420
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:28,340
ignore me that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wrong system</font>

421
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:33,680
somehow this other power plug keeps my

422
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:36,889
attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay again I want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go there</font>

423
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:43,190
yep that's correct I want to set my

424
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:45,920
request not authorized it's missing so

425
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:48,530
authorization with root and no password

426
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:51,800
already worked but we get an error well

427
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:54,560
it's not very descriptive<font color="#E5E5E5"> but why should</font>

428
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:58,700
it no one should ever see it for what's

429
00:23:54,560 --> 00:24:01,990
wrong here well it's the H nib it's

430
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:05,780
creating some kind of string which is

431
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:07,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">created in the browser and created with</font>

432
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:11,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">the handshake to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> server in this case</font>

433
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:14,360
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> power plug so we try to the sem</font>

434
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:16,310
decision disassemble the library we try

435
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:18,530
to reverse and dream<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other algorithm</font>

436
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:20,870
creating it but it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that easy and</font>

437
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:25,879
we are lazy so we wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find a fast</font>

438
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:28,879
track and yeah what can you do if the

439
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:32,330
script is<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the browser and it's a</font>

440
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:34,460
handshake with the power plug and you

441
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:36,770
want to create some you want to use

442
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:38,900
another function well first of all you

443
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:41,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">need another function so we go back to</font>

444
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:43,970
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> firmware and we find functions</font>

445
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:46,460
functions light said socket options and

446
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:49,070
so on but<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do we trigger these</font>

447
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:55,070
functions well we could do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

448
00:24:49,070 --> 00:25:01,629
response right ok so again we intercept

449
00:24:55,070 --> 00:25:05,330
the request so good so far we forward it

450
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:11,510
we get a response and we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to modify</font>

451
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:13,189
a response and after doing a little

452
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:16,999
research and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so on you just</font>

453
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:20,659
have to put these<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside the web</font>

454
00:25:16,999 --> 00:25:24,469
the web response which is sent from the

455
00:25:20,659 --> 00:25:32,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">socket to your browser so edit select</font>

456
00:25:24,469 --> 00:25:34,639
all forwarded to our browser ignore the

457
00:25:32,449 --> 00:25:38,089
rest that's where everything fails no

458
00:25:34,639 --> 00:25:39,738
it's working and that would be like well

459
00:25:38,089 --> 00:25:42,408
you just created your own interface

460
00:25:39,739 --> 00:25:45,379
through your power plug and what happens

461
00:25:42,409 --> 00:25:52,459
now if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I select the set socket settings</font>

462
00:25:45,379 --> 00:25:55,879
i intercepted haha same problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

463
00:25:52,459 --> 00:25:57,709
yesterday<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly the same problem like</font>

464
00:25:55,879 --> 00:26:04,539
yesterday somehow the browser messed it

465
00:25:57,709 --> 00:26:04,539
up but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not a big</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font>

466
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:17,830
yeah keeps popping up forward again I

467
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:21,309
want select yeah it might be in<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

468
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:21,309
cash but

469
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:30,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">forward to my browser intercepts the</font>

470
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:30,510
requests

471
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:41,540
doesn't like me well in the end it sends

472
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,990
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> request to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the power plug and it</font>

473
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:46,790
creates<font color="#E5E5E5"> this H snap string for me so at</font>

474
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:48,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">this point I don't have to create a H</font>

475
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:51,050
nap string I don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to circumvent</font>

476
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:54,409
their security the browser generated the

477
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:56,600
string for me and I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to insert</font>

478
00:26:54,410 --> 00:27:04,840
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I just created from the soap</font>

479
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:08,659
request so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working I</font>

480
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:17,409
intercept the request and in the end it

481
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:17,410
looks like are<font color="#E5E5E5"> there Regis</font>

482
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:23,600
so when like I said it will mainly

483
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:26,330
generate you the first part of it and

484
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:32,270
then you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to attach the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> XML</font>

485
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:33,740
which is related and you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

486
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:37,760
unauthorized so why do I get<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

487
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:41,540
unauthorized here of course because i

488
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:50,780
forgot to end the<font color="#CCCCCC"> root right ok one more</font>

489
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:55,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">time enter rude again very cryptic</font>

490
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:58,270
password the air that<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked intercept</font>

491
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:58,270
my request

492
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:12,389
forward it and i<font color="#E5E5E5"> get an error okay just</font>

493
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:15,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">give me one more time after that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I will</font>

494
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:17,520
just explain what happens again I'm

495
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:23,850
locked in because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't get an</font>

496
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:26,850
unauthorized I want to get that's that's

497
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:30,750
a writer I want to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> requests normally</font>

498
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:37,709
I would just modify the response edit

499
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:40,890
select all edit copy paste forwarded to

500
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:43,380
my browser I browser gives me a button I

501
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:48,060
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> intercept the button make sure</font>

502
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:55,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's rude anyone knows what at this</font>

503
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:59,030
point my button is not working no well

504
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:59,030
too bad anyway

505
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:11,549
oh yeah you are so right my request is

506
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:17,460
missing the HTML someone didn't copy the

507
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:23,040
whole yeah but I want this so i think

508
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:27,059
i've recorded it hair i'm cheating<font color="#CCCCCC"> arrow</font>

509
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:31,280
it's also giving me an arrow it's also

510
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:31,280
giving me an error but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i recorded it</font>

511
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:47,850
ah you has all right it's always<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

512
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">same</font>

513
00:29:51,810 --> 00:30:00,600
for connection I don't see you cookie

514
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:00,600
yeah okay because I don't have locked

515
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:15,470
it's not pull it through for hacking I

516
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:15,470
think okay at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point of lockdown</font>

517
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:23,480
let's try<font color="#CCCCCC"> something if it doesn't work</font>

518
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:31,419
well we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to skip it at this</font>

519
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:37,850
point it doesn't like me well too<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad</font>

520
00:30:31,419 --> 00:30:40,039
anyway nothing is perfect so at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

521
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:46,250
point normally something switches on or

522
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:56,200
off and it worked even if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

523
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:56,200
seen it sadly come on stop doing this

524
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:04,350
back

525
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:10,449
so

526
00:31:07,059 --> 00:31:12,279
sum it up the<font color="#E5E5E5"> conclusion was we took a</font>

527
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:14,110
look at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> belkin and the encryption</font>

528
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:18,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">was not an accessible authorization</font>

529
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:21,418
failed and so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so on we sent the</font>

530
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:24,220
upnp request we got an<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML back how to</font>

531
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:26,529
communicate<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the power plug we</font>

532
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:29,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">created our soap</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> requests and the light</font>

533
00:31:26,529 --> 00:31:33,039
went on the same should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have done and</font>

534
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:34,899
dealing if if you try a little bit you

535
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:36,940
will see it works you're looking with

536
00:31:34,899 --> 00:31:39,639
the other passwords which is a problem

537
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:42,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">in itself you get an XML back with a</font>

538
00:31:39,639 --> 00:31:44,498
link<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the film where you go to the web</font>

539
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:46,480
server of dealing you get your firmware

540
00:31:44,499 --> 00:31:51,100
you disassemble it either magic and so

541
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:53,080
on you get your soap request and then

542
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:54,908
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to extract the functions</font>

543
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:58,330
because you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> generate the H net</font>

544
00:31:54,909 --> 00:32:00,249
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> browser so you can send a valid</font>

545
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:03,879
request with a valid cookie and the

546
00:32:00,249 --> 00:32:07,450
valid<font color="#CCCCCC"> H nub and our soap and that's the</font>

547
00:32:03,879 --> 00:32:12,340
tricky part to the d-link and well it

548
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:14,769
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> also work so conclusion yeah you</font>

549
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:16,809
might say power plugs are boring right

550
00:32:14,769 --> 00:32:20,320
but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> rich really depends</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

551
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:24,970
what's connected to it right away<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

552
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:28,899
hidden or maybe what's really sucking

553
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:31,690
the power out of it and these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

554
00:32:28,899 --> 00:32:33,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">two tiny examples of 50 billion devices</font>

555
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:36,580
around the world just just a rough

556
00:32:33,909 --> 00:32:38,740
estimation so if you go there you just

557
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:41,049
start scanning<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you can p you find a</font>

558
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:45,639
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of devices which have multiple</font>

559
00:32:41,049 --> 00:32:47,080
problems and that's 44 because if you

560
00:32:45,639 --> 00:32:49,090
find these with shoulder and they are

561
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:50,619
reachable on the internet and someone

562
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:52,689
finds the vulnerability in them and

563
00:32:50,619 --> 00:32:55,418
starts to switching them on and off<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

564
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:59,440
on and off and<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and off millions of</font>

565
00:32:55,419 --> 00:33:01,720
devices sucking power maybe with a

566
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,700
location<font color="#E5E5E5"> search so he can control where</font>

567
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:06,279
he puts the power on and off<font color="#CCCCCC"> and on and</font>

568
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:08,499
off this might prove to be a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

569
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:10,869
the power network or for the people

570
00:33:08,499 --> 00:33:16,280
working living there which already have

571
00:33:10,869 --> 00:33:20,189
winter so to power plugs

572
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:22,110
security didn't work but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we took a</font>

573
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:24,809
look a bit little bit look around I mean

574
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:27,179
they they know it's it might not be dead

575
00:33:24,809 --> 00:33:29,129
