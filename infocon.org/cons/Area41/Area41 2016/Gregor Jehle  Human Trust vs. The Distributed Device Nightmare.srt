1
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:14,209
thank you it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> great honor to be here</font>

2
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:20,900
though I guess you were all expecting FX

3
00:00:14,209 --> 00:00:23,780
to be here talking to you right yeah the

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:27,259
thing is he got seriously sick at short

5
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:29,660
notice caught himself quite a sinus

6
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:32,780
infection and it's so bad that<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's not</font>

7
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:35,719
fit to fly so at short notice you have

8
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:38,899
to deal with<font color="#CCCCCC"> me to stop to go but well</font>

9
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:41,120
long story short I'm actually one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

10
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:44,179
guys who's building what FX was planning

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,269
to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you about so i guess i can</font>

12
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:49,729
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quick intro here as well</font>

13
00:00:46,269 --> 00:00:52,309
but before<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get started and delve into</font>

14
00:00:49,729 --> 00:00:56,629
the presentation proper let's take a

15
00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:58,120
step back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> think a bit about the</font>

16
00:00:56,629 --> 00:01:01,428
trust infrastructure and applications

17
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:06,649
that every one of us is using on a daily

18
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:10,310
basis a few weeks ago we<font color="#CCCCCC"> were visiting</font>

19
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:14,510
company it was quite big multinational

20
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:17,750
and when we were in the office<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the IT</font>

21
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:21,470
sector<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking to him i glanced over his</font>

22
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:24,470
shelf and there was this one item it was

23
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:26,330
a grappling hook<font color="#E5E5E5"> i kid you not complete</font>

24
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:29,539
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think five meters of rope</font>

25
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:32,000
attached<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it and he he caught my</font>

26
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:36,350
glance and I were like smiling at me in

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,720
bed well that's our trust anchor and the

28
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:43,339
nuts<font color="#CCCCCC"> a funny thing is that I I think he</font>

29
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:45,200
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> only half joking so what what kind</font>

30
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:49,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">of trust systems are we using today are</font>

31
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:54,380
they hierarchical are they mesh based

32
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:59,120
how fine granularly can you decide who

33
00:01:54,380 --> 00:02:02,240
to trust with what how how fast can you

34
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:05,930
react<font color="#CCCCCC"> to changes in that trust do you</font>

35
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:11,030
have to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> explicit revocation or does</font>

36
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:13,579
it just happen automatically and how

37
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:16,909
good do these systems hold up against

38
00:02:13,579 --> 00:02:18,530
attack think if you're having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

39
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:18,900
hierarchical system and you cut the head

40
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,730
off

41
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,159
do you have chickens running around with

42
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:26,640
our head doing whatever chickens without

43
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:29,720
a head to or can you still operate so I

44
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:34,518
think we do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a solution for that</font>

45
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,519
which I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tell you about now</font>

46
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:41,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">pecky is FX</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> second company and what</font>

47
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,549
we're doing is the culmination of over

48
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:49,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">ten years of research which originally</font>

49
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:52,379
started as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISO 2828 automotive</font>

50
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:57,450
standard the automotive<font color="#CCCCCC"> Fox sat down in</font>

51
00:02:52,379 --> 00:03:02,578
2006 and decided well we have pretty

52
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:04,290
massive distributed system cars and we

53
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:07,230
have kind of a key distribution issue

54
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:10,319
and the trust issue so how do we fix

55
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:13,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and they set down wrote a standard</font>

56
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:18,480
and what they call for was basically a

57
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:20,549
peer-to-peer<font color="#E5E5E5"> pki if you look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> closely</font>

58
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,280
that kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the company name</font>

59
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:25,019
comes from<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we built something that</font>

60
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,379
does way more than just being a

61
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:31,680
peer-to-peer<font color="#E5E5E5"> pki so we're now building</font>

62
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:35,448
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> also solves the iso</font>

63
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,449
standard but does way more

64
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:49,440
so what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it we're building we're</font>

65
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:51,839
building a system that lets you each

66
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,970
individual person be their own trust

67
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,610
anchor you're no<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer relying on a</font>

68
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:59,130
third party will offer you a

69
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:02,480
straightforward interface there will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

70
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:06,420
in the simplest case one single function

71
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:09,060
can I trust entity X with a very

72
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:14,450
specific formulation of trust why and

73
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:17,190
you get one answer it's yes or no also

74
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:20,099
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the system either entirely</font>

75
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:22,019
an offline scenarios or the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

76
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:26,430
recommend using a crypto enforce

77
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:29,550
peer-to-peer network well what<font color="#CCCCCC"> can you</font>

78
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:31,740
do with it imagine<font color="#CCCCCC"> that your devices</font>

79
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:34,890
will actually trust you and you no

80
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:36,900
longer need to enter a password you

81
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:41,570
could build an actual self defending

82
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:44,340
network instead of what we have now and

83
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:50,210
as I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said before you no longer have to</font>

84
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:56,130
rely<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a third party for trust so trust</font>

85
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:58,200
what is that in in the current IT we're

86
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:59,909
out if you're if you're thinking trust

87
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:03,719
you're thinking well trusted web shop

88
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:09,270
trusted certificate trusted whatever but

89
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:13,380
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not really it trust is not</font>

90
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:16,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">knowing what what is currently sold is</font>

91
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:19,080
trust is confidence and confidence is a

92
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:25,740
very fickle thing confidence very easily

93
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:29,190
breaks so confidence<font color="#E5E5E5"> is basically</font>

94
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:31,919
predicting how someone will react in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

95
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:34,530
future by<font color="#CCCCCC"> ensuring that it will happen</font>

96
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,479
by having absolute control over it or

97
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:39,299
relying on a third party that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

98
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,730
absolute control over it and if

99
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:45,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">something goes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong it might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take a</font>

101
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:51,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">DigiNotar for example while with trust</font>

102
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:54,710
you're relying on future actions of

103
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:56,070
someone but only for a very very

104
00:05:54,710 --> 00:06:00,419
specific

105
00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:04,580
amount of bail<font color="#E5E5E5"> define control that</font>

106
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:08,760
you're handing over to said entity and

107
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:11,370
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way we implemented that if you want</font>

108
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:13,650
to everyone can see your trust and if

109
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:17,520
something changes in that trust everyone

110
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:20,340
can see that so you have oversight in

111
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:23,549
your peer group and with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can</font>

112
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:29,159
react a lot quicker than well if someone

113
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:32,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">carries out keys from digital hug well</font>

114
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:37,680
so to sum up Trust is the middle state

115
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:39,719
between knowing and not knowing if we

116
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">can take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a step back and look at the</font>

117
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:45,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">classic CIA triangle if you have</font>

118
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:48,060
confidentiality and integrity you well

119
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,800
you could use a certificate authority to

120
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:54,570
give you that but availability yeah if

121
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:58,230
the certificate authority breaks you're

122
00:06:54,570 --> 00:07:00,900
screwed equally if you have encryption

123
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:03,180
and signatures you're fine as long as

124
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:07,590
you have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> key if you lost your key</font>

125
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:13,110
well you're screwed and let me tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

126
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:16,289
there's a big company that set up their

127
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:18,750
certificate authority the way you do it

128
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:23,520
by the book they took their root

129
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:25,790
certificate key put it on a stick put it

130
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:31,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">in a safe in one of their offices and</font>

131
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:35,730
forgot where it was in the end it all

132
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:39,090
comes down to<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost and cost can be many</font>

133
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:42,950
things but not all problems you're

134
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:46,830
having have to actually be

135
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:51,120
authentication problems so where can you

136
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:54,440
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like authorization it's</font>

137
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:59,370
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough to be authorized for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> safe</font>

00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:04,260
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> text counselor your author</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">cares who exactly is as long as he does</font>

142
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:12,340
is work good

143
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:14,500
but then there's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff that needs a</font>

00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:18,159
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit closer inspection like</font>

by that like<font color="#E5E5E5"> cities turning them off</font>

150
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:33,909
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> needs some closer inspection</font>

151

over here you're very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very fine with</font>

trust usually over here you better

153
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:46,450
verify so computers and trust what we're

154
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:50,980
doing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're teaching computers human</font>

00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:56,320
trust the way humans work with all its

156
00:08:50,980 --> 00:09:00,310
transitive glory so underneath our

00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:09,069
that there's no really little well we

don't make huge demands it has to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

170

00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:41,380
trusting that entity with a slightly

different policy everyone publishes that

173
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:49,480
signed and you can retrieve that

174
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:51,160
information and then rebuild the latest

in parallel to that you can of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

177
00:09:54,250 --> 00:10:01,240
instead of just storing trust policies

178
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:04,620
store data in that Network and again we

179
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:08,770
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care which back and you use</font>

180
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:10,720
together you get trusted<font color="#CCCCCC"> data you no</font>

181
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:14,170
longer have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fetch the point of data</font>

182
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:17,290
and verify it you tell the trust network

183
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:20,439
give me something and you either get

184
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:23,140
nothing or you get trusted<font color="#CCCCCC"> data</font>

185
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:26,440
what you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> for free is situational</font>

186
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:28,890
awareness but if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to learn more</font>

187
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:32,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that hit me up at the bar later up</font>

188
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:37,930
on top<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that it's you and your own</font>

189
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:39,340
trust<font color="#CCCCCC"> anchor so one specific problem of</font>

190
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:42,339
the many<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can address</font>

191
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:48,430
with this system<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what we dubbed the</font>

192
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:52,570
device nightmare think device

193
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:56,170
provisioning you're a vendor<font color="#CCCCCC"> of devices</font>

194
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:58,540
and you have to get them to your

195
00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:02,170
customers of which ideally you have more

196
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:05,880
than one and you want to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> maintenance</font>

197
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:09,449
and as we were in the talk before

198
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:11,530
passwords are hard logistics equally so

199
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:15,220
you don't want to use the same password

200
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:17,530
everywhere but well that's work so what

201
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:22,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">is so hard you have basically two</font>

202
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:26,280
choices either you go ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> and keep a</font>

203
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:29,110
stock of customized devices per customer

204
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:32,260
with all their keys on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> which might</font>

205
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:34,240
pose some other legal consequences

206
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:36,760
because maybe you are not allowed to

207
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:40,780
handle<font color="#E5E5E5"> your customers key information or</font>

208
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:43,540
you keep a big big stack of unconsidered

209
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:45,850
devices which you'll have to touch every

210
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:47,800
time a new customer comes around and one

211
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:56,280
store or something which doesn't work

212
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:59,469
and yeah so what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we doing different</font>

213
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:01,780
with the human trust model you

214
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:05,320
manufacture a device and this device

215
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:07,060
initially trusts you as a vendor and in

216
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,480
the specific example that i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

217
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:12,099
show you briefly so the demo God's will

218
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,830
the initial trust will be for device

219
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:18,520
handover so the company can hand over

220
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:20,230
the device<font color="#CCCCCC"> to some customer once the</font>

221
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,870
product has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> paid that hand over is</font>

222
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:25,089
done and a transaction of ownership

223
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:27,550
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy enough for everyone to</font>

224
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:31,610
understand you do that once once you're

225
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:36,810
paid everything is done good

226
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:44,540
so let's head over to the demo bear with

227
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:44,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">me is it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

228
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:07,560
let's see how that<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes while it's</font>

229
00:13:02,819 --> 00:13:09,360
booting up i will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be using the debug you</font>

230
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:12,149
I that we built specifically for this

231
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem because we didn't find anything</font>

232
00:13:12,149 --> 00:13:17,550
that was good<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough to debug</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

233
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:19,470
distributed trust network so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> built</font>

234
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:24,120
our own and ended up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a second</font>

235
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:29,699
product which is worthy<font color="#CCCCCC"> of its own talk</font>

236
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:37,399
at some point but let's see how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

237
00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:37,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">works there we go</font>

238
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:47,460
so a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a scenario I</font>

239
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,410
already mentioned that there is a vendor

240
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:51,720
who manufactures devices so we have two

241
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:54,870
players a vendor and the device there's

242
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:58,200
also a customer participant<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 the</font>

243
00:13:54,870 --> 00:14:00,180
customer wants to buy a device now the

244
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:02,040
vendor is not a trivial company so it

245
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:05,010
got a billing department and a support

246
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:08,130
department the vendor is trusting its

247
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:10,710
billing department to track whether a

248
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:13,620
customer has paid already or not and if

249
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:16,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">the customer paid initiate a handover of</font>

250
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:18,060
the device to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the customer the billing</font>

251
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:21,870
department is not allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

252
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:23,939
maintenance likewise the<font color="#E5E5E5"> support</font>

253
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:30,810
department is only allowed to do

254
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:32,760
maintenance<font color="#E5E5E5"> and not hand over let's</font>

255
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:37,099
start them let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> start the vendor and</font>

256
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:40,520
its departments start the customer and

257
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:40,520
start the device

258
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:52,370
over here and while we wait for them to

259
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:56,420
boot<font color="#E5E5E5"> up I'm just acting like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a fool</font>

260
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:59,930
there we go what you're seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> now is</font>

261
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:04,130
the peer-to-peer network slowly building

262
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:07,729
itself on this layer here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have basic</font>

263
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:11,680
basically Ethernet communication what

264
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:13,820
you'll see in this UI is a ring

265
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:17,089
surrounded by notes the notes are

266
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:20,420
usually either trust<font color="#CCCCCC"> notes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or IP</font>

267
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:23,960
addresses and you can display either

268
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:35,800
values for that node or relationships

269
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:39,100
between them now not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one either</font>

270
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,099
that one here

271
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:51,779
here I'm the billing department and I'm

272
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,519
connecting to the device that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was just</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">manufactures the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> device recognizes that</font>

274
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:01,500
well I'm being connected to from the

275
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:05,670

276
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:07,740
enter any passwords it also notices that

277
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:19,949
I have a permission to do a device hand

278
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:21,779
over if I take a look<font color="#CCCCCC"> over here this is</font>

00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:25,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">the view the support department</font>

280
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:29,370
currently has of the device no access at

281
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:36,240
all and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we take a look at the</font>

access at all

284
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:44,930
let's say I'm the<font color="#E5E5E5"> customer i just paid</font>

285
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,390
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> calling the billing department tell</font>

286
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:51,140
them well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just send you X amount of</font>

287
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:53,900
money give me the device so the billing

288
00:16:51,140 --> 00:17:00,949
department says well hand that thing

289
00:16:53,900 --> 00:17:05,060
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> to customer one the handover was</font>

290
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:07,190
complete and immediately the billing

291
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:11,569
department has no rights whatsoever over

292
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:15,740
that device anymore if we now take a

293
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:17,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">look over to the customer the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> customer</font>

294
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:19,700
can now write to his configuration on

00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:23,530
the device which is basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you</font>

296
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:27,740
want but you also want to do maintenance

297
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:30,050
firmware update out roles whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> so as</font>

298
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:32,590
a support department I can now do device

299
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,590
maintenance

300
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:50,730
and if we take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the UI now let</font>

301
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:55,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">it refresh you seeing the device down</font>

302
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:59,910
here only<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever trust up there the vendor</font>

303
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:02,870
or now the customer there is no direct

304
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:05,940
trust to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> billing department or the</font>

305
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:09,120
support department this is transitive

306
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:11,610
trust so the device initially trusts the

307
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,860
vendor with do a hand over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vendor</font>

308
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:17,250
trusts the billing department with do a

309
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:19,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">handover</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then someone that looks like a</font>

310
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:23,700
billing department which device does<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

311
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:27,000
comes along so as well do a<font color="#CCCCCC"> handover so</font>

312
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:29,790
you ask the trust system using that one

313
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,960
metric function can I trust billing

314
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:37,050
department for device hand over and you

315
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:41,190
the device being its own trust anchor

316
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:43,169
start searching on your side which what

317
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:46,140
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of trust do I have in my local</font>

318
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:47,850
store well I've got one trust that is

319
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:51,390
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> for handover but that goes to</font>

320
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:54,149
vendor so you ask vendor what kind of

321
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:55,770
trust do you have and vendor tells you

322
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:57,510
well I'm trusting support department

323
00:18:55,770 --> 00:19:00,540
with maintenance that doesn't help you

324
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:03,379
in that case but I'm also trusting the

325
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:05,970
billing department with doing handovers

326
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:08,490
well that's good now you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a path</font>

327
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:12,300
from you via vendor to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> billing</font>

328
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:20,720
department and that is all<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to</font>

329
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:20,720
do let's go back to presentation

330
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:27,678
one very neat thing that we notice how

331
00:19:25,849 --> 00:19:31,009
do we actually solve the problem above

332
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:35,749
with identities it turns out that

333
00:19:31,009 --> 00:19:38,690
identity is a subset of trust well sadly

334
00:19:35,749 --> 00:19:42,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">I wasn't introduced so but usually I go</font>

335
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:45,589
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hadas</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and if someone would have</font>

336
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:49,879
introduced me that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way you'd probably</font>

337
00:19:45,589 --> 00:19:52,999
believe them so having an ad from

338
00:19:49,879 --> 00:19:55,369
someone telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> me how I'm hardest and</font>

339
00:19:52,999 --> 00:19:57,769
you believing that person<font color="#CCCCCC"> to introduce</font>

340
00:19:55,369 --> 00:20:06,289
people you established my identity as

341
00:19:57,769 --> 00:20:08,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">being hottest so everything we do all</font>

342
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:13,519
the software<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be released under</font>

343
00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:16,190
apache2 / no license but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're doing</font>

344
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:18,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">something a very little bit different so</font>

345
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:23,059
you won't be finding a direct download

346
00:20:18,229 --> 00:20:25,759
link what we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to do is not</font>

347
00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:28,219
gather your information we just want to

348
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:31,219
hear from you what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are planning to</font>

349
00:20:28,219 --> 00:20:33,829
build and that has one very simple

350
00:20:31,219 --> 00:20:36,079
reason you send<font color="#E5E5E5"> us an email tell us well</font>

351
00:20:33,829 --> 00:20:38,029
I have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific problem I want to</font>

352
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:43,309
address this using your Trinity trust

353
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:45,499
system sent me the code and then we'll

354
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:47,239
send you the code and tell you well go

355
00:20:45,499 --> 00:20:50,929
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that direction maybe not do it that</font>

356
00:20:47,239 --> 00:20:54,019
way if you're unsure call us will become

357
00:20:50,929 --> 00:20:57,259
help because the worst thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that could</font>

358
00:20:54,019 --> 00:21:02,739
happen is if you haven't understood<font color="#CCCCCC"> x509</font>

359
00:20:57,259 --> 00:21:08,179
you're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> reinvent it poorly and</font>

360
00:21:02,739 --> 00:21:11,179
yes we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a consulting team so if you</font>

361
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:16,809
have any questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> give us a call if you</font>

362
00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:19,879
have a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask us and we'll come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

363
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:23,589
now I will be open for questions for the

364
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:23,589
remainder of my talk thank

365
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:39,060
so what we've learned is that we build a

366
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:42,419
very general system and it's it's hard

367
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:44,879
to get across what the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do and</font>

368
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:49,020
people immediately fall into a very

369
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,850
specific set<font color="#CCCCCC"> of mind and then think</font>

370
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:52,379
that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do but the system does</font>

371
00:21:50,850 --> 00:22:00,570
more so if we have a specific questions

372
00:21:52,380 --> 00:22:03,090
come ask now hi thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

373
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:04,950
representation checking<font color="#E5E5E5"> the website I</font>

374
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:06,990
noticed that you offer different

375
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:09,870
implementations of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the system can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

376
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:13,290
tell us a bit more about<font color="#CCCCCC"> each of them as</font>

377
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:16,709
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am yes you're talking about fat</font>

378
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:18,030
boy and olive<font color="#E5E5E5"> oil yes fat boy is what</font>

379
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:23,310
we're currently developing we're

380
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:26,790
targeting the Travis AVM which will be

381
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:28,770
okay for a lot of applications little

382
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:30,240
boy on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> contrary will be an</font>

383
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:32,340
implementation targeting embedded

384
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:39,900
devices and will be probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> written in</font>

385
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:42,449
miss Rossi it just gave trusts to<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of</font>

386
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:45,570
the components yes how do you revoke it

387
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:47,190
and who is allowed to revoke it you

388
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:52,080
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> do not have to explicitly</font>

389
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:54,180
revoke anything you're publishing who

390
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:57,470
you're trusting right now this can be

391
00:22:54,180 --> 00:23:01,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">time limited if you want it to be so and</font>

392
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:04,410
if you fetch trust<font color="#E5E5E5"> information from the</font>

393
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:07,470
network you can store it locally and

394
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:10,140
evaluated as needed if you get a request

395
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:13,500
now and you think well this request is a

396
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:15,600
little bit fishy maybe I<font color="#E5E5E5"> should recheck</font>

397
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:19,110
if the trust is still the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just</font>

398
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:21,480
query the note in question again tell it

399
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:24,090
well tell me all your trust that you

400
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">have right now you're not asking that</font>

401
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:29,159
note directly<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're asking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

402
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:32,600
peer-to-peer network and then if that

403
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:36,270
note that trust edge<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no longer there</font>

404
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:38,760
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't a trust so you do not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

405
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:41,940
revoke you just no longer extent that

406
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:44,670
trust edge<font color="#E5E5E5"> to anyone you can also think</font>

407
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:46,830
of things like distrust which we can

408
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:49,560
also model so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can explicitly say</font>

409
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:51,600
well I'm fine with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> node in</font>

410
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:53,790
principle but I'm not trusting it for

411
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,820
alcohol recommendations which might

412
00:23:53,790 --> 00:24:04,080
happen so yeah that can be modeled as

413
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:06,230
well answer your<font color="#E5E5E5"> question any more</font>

414
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,230
questions

415
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:16,600
what if you have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> question to the</font>

416
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:18,550
network and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you happen to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ask me if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

417
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">trust someone that I know or whatever</font>

418
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:24,460
and then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> always say yes because I want</font>

419
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:26,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">to access your like currently operation</font>

420
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:31,740
or on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other hand can always say no</font>

421
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:31,740
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> therefore cause dinner or service</font>

422
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:43,600
well what we do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> we implement human</font>

423
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:45,840
trust that is human trust period so

424
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:49,389
everything that works in real life like

425
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:51,159
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> cheated will work the thing is</font>

426
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:54,910
as in real life you can very easily

427
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:57,670
react to that so if someone screws you

428
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:59,740
over that happens once and then your

429
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:01,840
peers know about it and then it<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't</font>

430
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:04,930
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore and you don't get a foot on</font>

431
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:07,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">the ground so yes you can behave like an</font>

432
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:11,320
asshole but then people will know you as

433
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:15,270
the asshole you are does that answer

434
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:15,270
your question or<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

435
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:30,590
so if you bring human trust to device I

436
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:33,770
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reinstall reset my phone or</font>

437
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:41,840
computer so in human terms q it go trust

438
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:47,629
me afterwards<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is a pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> abstract</font>

439
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:49,550
question so for this I guess your device

440
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:53,240
would have would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to be sentient</font>

441
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:55,850
which it is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> so i guess i can safely</font>

442
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:57,470
answer that question<font color="#CCCCCC"> for now with it</font>

443
00:25:55,850 --> 00:26:01,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">will trust you with with with whatever</font>

444
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:07,550
you set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think there was a question</font>

445
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:11,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">up here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too actually hello question on</font>

446
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:14,659
this scenario of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> peer sabotaging was</font>

447
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,699
subverting by<font color="#E5E5E5"> always saying no and you</font>

448
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:18,410
said okay well if a pyramids behaves in

449
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:22,220
this fashion can you speak up a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

450
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:26,240
don't get it ok so I'm relating to this

451
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:28,550
example scenario where a peer miss

452
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:32,120
behaves you know in all these answers no

453
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:35,300
yes and so attempts to subvert the

454
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:37,429
system in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this session so like if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

455
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,659
is established<font color="#E5E5E5"> like is there some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font>

456
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:42,350
of writing system that would write that

457
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:45,020
pier as untrustworthy or how do you

458
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:48,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">prevent this one well there's there's a</font>

459
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:50,540
subtle difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> between a note in the</font>

460
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:53,660
trust overlay Network and a note inside

461
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:55,730
a peer-to-peer network notes and trust

462
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:58,550
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> published their trust</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into the</font>

463
00:26:55,730 --> 00:27:00,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">kadeem lea peer-to-peer network and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

464
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:03,889
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're aware of how academia</font>

465
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:07,070
works but it's in the end it's evenly

466
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:10,670
distributing its key values over the

467
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:12,639
network and spreading each key value out

468
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:16,430
over a neighborhood of values or

469
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:19,460
neighborhood of notes so you're never

470
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:21,710
actually querying the note that

471
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:24,440
originated the data you're just worrying

472
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:27,430
signed data that you can verify of other

473
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:30,910
nodes in the peer-to-peer network so

474
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:34,240
you'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to be a very very powerful</font>

475
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:34,240
attacker as

476
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:42,690
to control which values are retrievable

477
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:46,170
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and ask Adam Leah</font>

478
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:49,500
specifically counters that attack which

479
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:52,320
would be if i'm not mistaken an eclipse

480
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:55,530
attack where you try to shade a certain

481
00:27:52,320 --> 00:28:00,830
key space and control which values can

482
00:27:55,530 --> 00:28:00,830
be retrieved there so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can't be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

483
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:06,750
so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> sounds like you're creating the</font>

484
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:09,630
one of one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the implications of this</font>

485
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:14,150
is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can create almost a trust score</font>

486
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:17,730
or an integrity score of individuals

487
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:19,860
have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> looked at like how that looks</font>

488
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:21,720
if it's gamified like if people if

489
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:23,760
people start trading off on trust and

490
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:29,190
how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be either manipulated or</font>

491
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:31,350
useful yes you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can actually use the data</font>

492
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:34,860
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is published to well extract</font>

493
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:37,949
metrics in that case reputation and any

494
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:41,070
system you<font color="#E5E5E5"> built will be gained there's</font>

495
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:44,160
no arguing with that the thing is how

496
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:47,540
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you react</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to it and how would you</font>

497
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:51,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">react to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that with your human peers if</font>

498
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:54,889
if you get wind of someone deliberately

499
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:58,560
cheating and doing insider trading

500
00:28:54,890 --> 00:29:00,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">effectively at the cost of some of your</font>

501
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:02,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">other peers or yourself you'll get</font>

502
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,860
pissed off and that's where the distrust

503
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:08,810
comes in so you point fingers and tell

504
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:08,810
them well no you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

505
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:17,120
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one over there</font>

506
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:22,899
still linked<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the British question so</font>

507
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:25,030
this means that you can point finger

508
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:27,760
without actually like because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want</font>

509
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:30,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">to take someone out of their of the ring</font>

510
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:33,190
let's say<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the trust trusted ring so I</font>

511
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:36,780
say that you cheated well while you

512
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:39,700
didn't so how the other then verify me

513
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:42,520
yes I I can like like it up and yeah

514
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:44,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">like I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can go back and yeah I can point</font>

515
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:48,070
fingers at everyone here and tell them

516
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:50,640
yeah you cheated that won't work because

517
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:54,879
actually you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to trust a note to</font>

518
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:56,890
accept its distrust so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

519
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:00,760
trusting that note for at least distrust

520
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:06,190
information you're not no no no<font color="#CCCCCC"> ah at no</font>

521
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:08,170
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> evaluating that and even if some of</font>

522
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:10,720
your peers say well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't trust that</font>

523
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:13,330
one what you do with information you

524
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:17,380
gather in the end is always a local

525
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:20,050
decision so you can say well it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a case</font>

526
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:22,300
of emergency and before drowning I'll

527
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:25,270
reach out my hand to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that node which I</font>

528
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:28,030
might not trust normally you can do that

529
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:30,100
it's a local decision but other than

530
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:37,120
that you'd have to trust you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

531
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:39,840
for distrust before that to work any

532
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,840
more questions

533
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:46,350
I have one more some of us agree that

534
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:48,240
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest problems in ite or</font>

535
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:50,100
even in general is naming and it is

536
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,620
tightly coupled to identity management

537
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:55,050
are you enforcing any kind of naming

538
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:59,219
convention on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> users or is it just up</font>

539
00:30:55,050 --> 00:31:01,559
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual initiator of the query</font>

540
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:04,140
yeah that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would actually be very</font>

541
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:05,809
scenario specific the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

542
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:08,670
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> itself does not make any</font>

543
00:31:05,809 --> 00:31:11,820
requirements towards names that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go</font>

544
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:13,800
by but depending on the system you're

545
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:16,678
implementing you might want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

546
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:18,659
restrictions in say if you're replacing

547
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:20,280
a domain controller in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> company you</font>

548
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:22,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to control the names that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are in</font>

549
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:25,379
the truss system equally if you're

550
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:28,649
implementing something like PGP or<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

551
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:31,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">mine you obviously need something like</font>

552
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:34,020
email addresses but yeah that that is

553
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">not affecting the system per se but that</font>

554
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:44,540
would be a scenario specific

555
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:44,540
implementation any more questions

556
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:54,190
well if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to ask them</font>

557
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:58,030
there's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> over there if you don't want</font>

558
00:31:54,190 --> 00:32:00,580
to ask here<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll be here awhile</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so you</font>

559
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:03,580
can catch me later on as well brief

560
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:05,620
quest book brief question<font color="#CCCCCC"> can and an</font>

561
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:12,669
identity be cloned<font color="#CCCCCC"> and what happens in</font>

562
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:16,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">the system if that happens since</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

563
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:18,730
identity in and off itself is basically

564
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:20,680
a key pair that you usually don't get in

565
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:24,010
touch with you'd have to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> access to</font>

566
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:25,510
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> private key so yes you can clone</font>

567
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:29,500
that as long as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a private key</font>

568
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:31,690
and if that was a legitimate clone well

569
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:34,990
you can do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your identity whatever</font>

570
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:39,070
you want to do they would basically look

571
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:43,510
exactly the same so they are exactly the

572
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:45,429
same because they're a clone if you mean

573
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:48,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">by that that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there was a compromise</font>

574
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:51,610
someone stole your key information then

575
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:55,180
get in touch with one of your peers that

576
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:59,010
you trust and it will well the message

577
00:32:55,180 --> 00:33:01,570
get out that that identity is burned and

578
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:04,810
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to explicitly revoke</font>

579
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:07,540
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the nice thing people can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

580
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:09,850
drop their trust edge<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you and then</font>

581
