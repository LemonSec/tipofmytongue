00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:35,469
just putting it out there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

10
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:38,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk about social media and how it</font>

11
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:41,230
relates to risk practice and security

12
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:44,349
and organizations which is an often

13
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:47,620
overlooked aspect of managing security

14
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:49,659
an organization and but let's start with

15
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:52,030
really understanding where the problem

16
00:00:49,659 --> 00:00:54,690
came from and kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my journey into</font>

17
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:58,179
this or our journey into this this is a

18
00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:01,059
research that I've done with<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of my</font>

19
00:00:58,179 --> 00:01:03,159
research partners Alex Hutton which

20
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:07,530
knows a thing or two about risk metrics

21
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:11,740
and so let's take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a quick journey down</font>

22
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:13,509
what's the problem anyone can spot the

23
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:16,360
problem with one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those social media</font>

24
00:01:13,509 --> 00:01:21,689
accounts is this richard branson's

25
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:25,299
twitter is that the real oreo cookies a

<font color="#CCCCCC">Facebook page and who the hell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is Brian</font>

28
00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:36,009
last name these are all obviously well

29
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:38,469
obviously to us maybe fake accounts if

30
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:41,530
you notice Branson's got an extra s in

31
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:46,449
the Twitter handle and these are very

32
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:49,420
often<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very popular accounts on social</font>

33
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:51,820
media they claim to<font color="#E5E5E5"> represent someone</font>

34
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:54,909
that's not actually that someone and

35
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:57,398
could potentially and often actually do

36
00:01:54,909 --> 00:02:01,149
cause harm in terms of public

37
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:04,390
relationships or fishing or any any kind

00:02:01,149 --> 00:02:07,509
of social related attack or attack

00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:30,279
there another one which one of those is

49
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:36,880
that's a question that we often<font color="#CCCCCC"> run into</font>

50
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:39,190
when looking at or looking for someone

00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,950
on social media<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the way these are all</font>

52
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:45,720
my accounts that i use for different

purposes I have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> different you know a</font>

55
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:57,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">my activities online so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's kind of</font>

56
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:59,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">the basic motivations around why did we</font>

57
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:03,280
even start looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it and when we do</font>

58
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:05,350
deeper into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem we realize</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

59
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,260
a lot of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack vectors are actually</font>

60
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:10,720
shifting from email<font color="#E5E5E5"> towards social media</font>

61
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,700
it's much more interactive email is very

62
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,700
asynchronous you send and you hope that

63
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:19,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone's going to read it and social</font>

64
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:22,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">media presents an inherent trust in that</font>

65
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,489
social<font color="#CCCCCC"> media network if I see a friend</font>

66
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,859
of mine or a friend or<font color="#E5E5E5"> friend of mine</font>

67
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:30,730
there's an employee trust that that

68
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:32,410
person is somehow related to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me and if I</font>

69
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:36,579
have some kind of interactions with them

70
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:40,090
I carry that inherent trust and and

71
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:42,190
apply it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that person and it's it's</font>

72
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,560
very it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty apparent even when</font>

73
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:47,320
we're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at debe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ir statistics from</font>

74
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,240
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> year ago</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i haven't incorporated the</font>

75
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:51,609
latest one here but the numbers actually

76
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:54,280
grow in terms of the impact that we're

77
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:57,580
seeing social media having as far as

78
00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:02,380
attack vectors and injection vector

79
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:07,060
insertions vectors into fraud and data

80
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:10,540
loss in general so why do I<font color="#CCCCCC"> really want</font>

81
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:12,910
to deal with social media<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how how</font>

82
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:15,220
real is that impact here's a quick

83
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:20,769
couple of examples anyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> recognize this</font>

84
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:22,300
nice young lady no one I know it's a

85
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:25,840
tough crowd because you're not Americans

86
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:29,890
but just this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> justine sacco rings a</font>

87
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,960
bell oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I see some nods yeah there</font>

88
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:33,630
we go

89
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,940
used to be very internet famous for all

90
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:38,340
the wrong reasons it's used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work for</font>

91
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:41,610
an ad agency in in New York I believe

92
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:44,609
and she was about to board a plane to

93
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:47,009
South Africa<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this is the tweet that</font>

94
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:49,289
that she sent out just<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes before</font>

95
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:52,830
boarding that plane she tweeted that

96
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:55,050
boarded the plane shutter phone down and

97
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:57,719
didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna happen</font>

98
00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:01,229
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> she had a couple of hundred</font>

99
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:04,910
followers very small<font color="#CCCCCC"> network and when</font>

100
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:09,060
when she took off but<font color="#CCCCCC"> during her flight</font>

101
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:11,039
that thing took off as well and became

102
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:16,259
an internet sensation people were

103
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:18,810
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about her were you know saying</font>

104
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:21,599
bad things about her again I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

105
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:24,150
judging you can judge I usually judge

106
00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:26,780
but I'm not judging this it might be

107
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:30,599
misplaced tweet you know some some

108
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:34,198
improper sarcasm but whatever it is her

109
00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:36,960
workplace was mentioned as well as part

110
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:41,520
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> online frenzy that started</font>

111
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:44,130
around her and there's a trending

112
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:47,900
hashtag has Justine landed yet on

113
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:50,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">Twitter that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> became you know number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

114
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:52,758
trending hashtag and someone actually

115
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:55,610
took a picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> of her when she landed as</font>

116
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:58,580
she was checking<font color="#E5E5E5"> her phone which</font>

117
00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:03,090
literally blew up with notifications

118
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:05,070
about that misplaced tweet shortly after

119
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:09,810
that she was fired she was actually

120
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:11,789
fired before she landed so one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

121
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:14,580
notifications on her phone was oh by the

122
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:17,729
way you're fired and as she was just

123
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:20,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to get to realization with what</font>

124
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:23,699
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on and this is her account of</font>

125
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:25,940
her experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> after this she got</font>

126
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:28,440
personal threats death threats and

127
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:31,680
threats to her family to her physical

128
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:35,280
well-being and all based on one little

129
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:38,729
tweet so yes social media has some

130
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,460
impact<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of risk and security and</font>

131
00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:44,130
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> the company that you work for</font>

132
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:45,030
had to deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that PR nightmare of</font>

133
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:47,580
someone's

134
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:50,549
someone that represented them either

135
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:53,219
implicitly or explicitly doing something

136
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:56,340
like that online so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reason</font>

137
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:59,220
why we we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with that vector</font>

138
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:00,719
the social<font color="#CCCCCC"> media one here's another</font>

139
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:04,260
example and again it's fairly

140
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:07,520
Americanized but again<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might</font>

141
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:12,539
recognize this this smug little person

142
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:14,669
anyone yes all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> we see you're up to</font>

143
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:18,630
speed with with what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:42,630
was to multiply the price of that drug

a lot of personal physical threats he

168
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:33,659
had to beef up the security he started

being associated with someone from a

controversial country like myself and so

201
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:19,170
what's what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that risk and we had to</font>

202
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:21,630
come up with a solution and instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:24,089
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build a product and pitch it</font>

204
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:26,339
and sell it and pimp it all over the

205
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:28,350
place<font color="#E5E5E5"> we decided</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to create</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a framework a</font>

206

framework that's going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> flexible</font>

207
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:36,630
enough open free so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you guys can</font>

208
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:39,810
take it criticize it adopt it modify it

209
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:43,050
to your needs and see how you can how

210
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:45,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">can you apply the social media aspect</font>

211
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:48,420
into your daily risk management<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

212
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:50,279
security posture for your companies and

213
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:52,380
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> decided to that solution</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

214
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:55,199
framework should cravat should provide

215
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:59,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">some basic capabilities first and</font>

216
00:10:55,199 --> 00:11:01,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">foremost the ability to rate people one</font>

217
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,959
against each other so if I'm looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

218
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:06,029
my IT department not everyone is created

219
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:08,640
equal not everyone has the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> online</font>

220
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:10,470
presence and activities I need to be

221
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,189
able to say this person<font color="#E5E5E5"> is riskier than</font>

222
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:14,050
that person by how much

223
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:16,480
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to create some kind of rating</font>

224
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:18,339
mechanism that's not just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

225
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:22,060
bucket everyone that's on social media

226
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:24,820
is risky but provide some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of way in</font>

227
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:28,349
rating<font color="#E5E5E5"> between them we also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font>

228
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:32,650
provide a root cause analysis what is

229
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:35,560
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it that makes you riskier than</font>

230
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:39,970
you are you trolling online are you

231
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:44,319
attracting some kind of a bad press or

232
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:46,810
or unwanted attention from from

233
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:51,090
individuals or groups that my company<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

234
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:54,670
concerned about we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to</font>

235
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:57,100
consistently track this activity and

236
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:59,979
that rating over time in order to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

237
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:02,980
able to reduce the risk so after raiding

238
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:04,990
and identifying the root cause we want

239
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,940
to be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply controls or</font>

240
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:10,420
activities to reduce that risk and

241
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:12,040
measure that level of reduction so we

242
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:14,050
can see whether we're effective or not

243
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:17,439
and last but not least we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

244
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:19,030
able to augment our ocean capabilities

245
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,700
in terms of collecting information

246
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:23,890
that's fairly available online and how

247
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:28,570
it reflects on us as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> company's</font>

248
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:30,840
organization as individuals and so the

249
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:33,160
next so we have this grand idea of

250
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:35,950
dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> social media and creating a</font>

251
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:38,560
framework and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next question that we</font>

252
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:39,850
faced is how feasible is this we're

253
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something that's very</font>

254
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:44,770
intangible that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very hard to measure</font>

255
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,930
we're talking about people's online

256
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:49,689
activities and what they say and in what

257
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:51,280
context they say it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we started</font>

258
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:53,020
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at has anyone done any work</font>

259
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:56,319
because the last thing we want to do is

260
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:58,630
is reinvent the wheel and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

261
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,180
found that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is possible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we found</font>

262
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:03,520
indicators that this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that's</font>

263
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:06,729
been done before<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of semantic</font>

264
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:09,130
analysis and predicting risk and

265
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:12,100
activities based on people's online

266
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:14,410
behavior in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> study that we found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

267
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:17,020
sentiment analysis on the general<font color="#CCCCCC"> German</font>

268
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:18,990
elections a few years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago that basically</font>

269
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:22,390
took everything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the candidates</font>

270
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:25,420
expressed online and measured it in

271
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:27,880
terms of how the public reacted

272
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:31,030
or predicted how the<font color="#CCCCCC"> public would react</font>

273
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:34,240
based on basic characteristics in terms

274
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:37,030
of a past orientation positive emotions

275
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:41,200
negative emotions and really providing

276
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:43,360
that kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a dive in into the context</font>

277
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the meaning of what they were</font>

278
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,890
expressing online so this study is

279
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:50,170
available on this link<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can you</font>

280
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:52,930
can freely download it and kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

281
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:58,990
how that fares up and how it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> used</font>

282
00:13:52,930 --> 00:14:01,209
in analyzing content online so in order

283
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:02,530
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create a framework you ginger you</font>

284
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:03,880
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> just start with an excel sheet</font>

285
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:06,850
it's like all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right let's plug some</font>

286
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:09,630
numbers you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to have a cohesive</font>

287
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:12,760
methodology and one of the people that

288
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:17,080
Alex pointed me to is Victor passively

289
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:19,990
which has this idea about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a GQ m goal</font>

290
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:22,060
question metrics which is a framework

291
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:25,360
for creating frameworks I know it's kind

292
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:27,369
of a cyclical but it actually works it

293
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:32,850
makes you think in a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific way</font>

294
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:32,850
and forces you some structure and

295
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:38,079
enforces you to apply knowledge to the

296
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:40,360
right directions the idea is very simple

297
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:43,300
you define goals what what are you

298
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:46,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to accomplish for each goal you</font>

299
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:48,819
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> asking questions what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is it that's</font>

300
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,730
going to make me<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand how to meet</font>

301
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:54,220
that goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I address the</font>

302
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:56,050
context of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific goal and for</font>

303
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:58,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">every question identify what kind of</font>

304
00:14:56,050 --> 00:15:01,689
metrics do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to collect in order to</font>

305
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:04,270
answer those questions so it's a very

306
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:07,660
systematic way<font color="#CCCCCC"> of looking at a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem a</font>

307
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:09,280
quick example for applying GQ m to patch

308
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:11,620
management would look something like

309
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:15,010
this I need to create a patching

310
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:18,780
scoreboard and the three my three goals

311
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:21,640
are comprehensiveness timeliness and

312
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:23,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">cost-effectiveness</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to quickly</font>

313
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:26,439
dive through this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is not you know</font>

314
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:28,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just an example if I'm looking at</font>

315
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:31,060
comprehensive what are the questions

316
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:33,189
that I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> answer well I want to see</font>

317
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:35,199
what's the coverage<font color="#E5E5E5"> my risk I want to</font>

318
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:37,040
see what is that coverage by asset

319
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,980
category

320
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,920
look at the different metrics that would

321
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:45,230
help me measure the answer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> doubt to</font>

322
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:47,300
those questions same goes for timeliness

323
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:49,459
what's the policy what are other

324
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:51,979
consideration for timeliness what are

325
00:15:49,459 --> 00:15:54,410
the priorities for timeliness and again

326
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:56,180
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the metrics that provide</font>

327
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:58,490
question provide the answer for the

328
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:02,000
questions in same goes for cost

329
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:05,000
efficiency so when we started applying

330
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,209
gqn for<font color="#CCCCCC"> merm which is the current name</font>

331
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,259
for social media risk metrics and

332
00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:11,239
someone came<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with a better name on</font>

333
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:14,509
twitter i haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> updated it here yet</font>

334
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:17,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">but feel free to suggest better better</font>

335
00:16:14,509 --> 00:16:19,160
terminology the main goal is really to

336
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:22,190
provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> a social</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> media risk score card</font>

337
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:24,860
for a person as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> as on organization</font>

338
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:28,509
and we made that specific distinction

339
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:32,180
because organizations specifically<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

340
00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:34,190
corporate accounts and an aggregation of

341
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:36,859
multiple individual accounts behave

342
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:38,600
differently than individuals and need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

343
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:41,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">be addressed differently from a control</font>

344
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:44,360
perspective the questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're</font>

345
00:16:41,449 --> 00:16:47,209
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> answer in order to to hone in</font>

346
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:49,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">on that goal is how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> does one's online</font>

347
00:16:47,209 --> 00:16:53,060
activity affect the likelihood of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

348
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:55,880
threat the<font color="#E5E5E5"> impact of it the areas of</font>

349
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:59,300
impact and how does unsanctioned

350
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:04,099
presence stuff that I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> responsible</font>

351
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:07,459
for affect my risk or my implied risk to

352
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:13,149
my organization we had a few more goals

353
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:16,659
oh and the metrics of colors were

354
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:18,949
qualitative with a pinch of quantitative

355
00:17:16,659 --> 00:17:21,290
we kind of botched things up a little

356
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:23,750
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> but i'll talk about that in a few</font>

357
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:27,500
minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of how we balanced the</font>

358
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:29,059
quality and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> quantity of applying</font>

359
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:32,059
metrics to those<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions to answer</font>

360
00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:35,960
those questions a<font color="#CCCCCC"> few more goals just to</font>

361
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:37,428
kind of round up the the idea behind the

362
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:41,000
framework<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we came</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up with is</font>

363
00:17:37,429 --> 00:17:44,780
creating a scorer for executives looking

364
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,910
at other quantitative a quantitative

365
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:49,799
measures of working with third parties

366
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:54,210
so when I'm engaging with a third party

367
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:57,629
and I have a selection of a few this

368
00:17:54,210 --> 00:18:00,150
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be another another way to choose</font>

369
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:02,549
between them is one third party riskier

370
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:04,920
because of their online behavior versus

371
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:07,830
a different third party that might shift

372
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:11,570
my view in terms of choosing who to work

373
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:16,439
with and again look for quality quantity

374
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:17,939
quantitative ways to rate employees and

375
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,700
to apply different controls and

376
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:22,620
activities around them and so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so</font>

377
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:25,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">forth again you can read I don't need</font>

378
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:27,600
you to help you with that and this is

379
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:32,040
what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> came up with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we came up with a</font>

380
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:35,370
big a mind map that put all those ideas

381
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:40,250
together put the structure behind GQ m

382
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:43,530
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> this into this framework and</font>

383
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:46,020
expressed it in a fairly simplified way

384
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:48,000
and from that mind map we ended up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

385
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:50,309
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> full framework okay so let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me walk</font>

386
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,140
you through some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the key elements</font>

387
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:54,120
here and again I'm not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font>

388
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:56,429
through each and every one of the

389
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:58,590
metrics just to give you an idea and

390
00:18:56,429 --> 00:19:01,890
because this is all free<font color="#CCCCCC"> and available</font>

391
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:03,418
online you can do a deep dive for

392
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:05,640
yourself later on and we'll see some

393
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:08,970
examples so let's dive through some of

394
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:11,730
those in kind of key elements what makes

395
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:14,460
an individual risky and there are a few

396
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:19,610
elements that we we looked at in terms

397
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:22,730
of how does<font color="#E5E5E5"> one's online activity</font>

398
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:26,159
increase the the motivation or

399
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:30,110
likelihood of someone attacking me or

400
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:33,320
targeting me so we're looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few</font>

401
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:36,090
characteristic you'll behaviors like a

402
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:39,210
mi enticing hacktivism am I talking

403
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:42,659
about controversial topics related to

404
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:45,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">two hacktivism politics is a very</font>

405
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:49,200
popular way to attract unwanted

406
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:50,760
attention fortunately for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> for those</font>

407

<font color="#CCCCCC">who live in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the US and probably even</font>

408
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,750
more fortunately for you guys who don't

live in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the US the the current political</font>

situation in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. provides a lot of</font>

411
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:03,210
opportunities for for attracting

412
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:06,210
attention you just need to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

413
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:07,980
like one candidate and automatically

414

half of the population is against you

415
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:15,060
and that can end up in again in physical

416

harm or or actual threats as we can all

417

hear from the media religion another

those into different in different

<font color="#E5E5E5">financial okay if I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font>

fraud usually the impact is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be</font>

486
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:36,830
financial in some sort if I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

487
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:38,269
about my root access to servers the

488
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:40,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">impact might be a little more technical</font>

489
00:23:38,269 --> 00:23:45,649
and these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the two main buckets that</font>

490
00:23:40,639 --> 00:23:49,129
we that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we used for categorizing the</font>

491
00:23:45,649 --> 00:23:51,529
type of impact of a potential threat

492
00:23:49,129 --> 00:23:54,939
based on your online activities and you

493
00:23:51,529 --> 00:23:54,940
will see<font color="#CCCCCC"> how it all ties up together</font>

494
00:23:55,389 --> 00:24:01,369
last but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last two branches is</font>

495
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:04,999
looking at unsanctioned activities stuff

496
00:24:01,369 --> 00:24:08,928
that i didn't put out online but exists

497
00:24:04,999 --> 00:24:13,070
online and is related<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me the first</font>

498
00:24:08,929 --> 00:24:14,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">example is impersonators is someone</font>

499
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:15,918
trying to impersonate me online I know

500
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,350
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that there are a few</font>

501
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,929
impersonators for me on LinkedIn on

502
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:22,699
Twitter on Facebook and so I have to

503
00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:24,580
take that into account and know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

504
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:31,659
deal with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

505
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:35,110
em another example is a parody accounts

506
00:24:31,659 --> 00:24:37,610
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not any personation per se</font>

507
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:39,740
because they say<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the real</font>

508
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:42,080
Donald Trump but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> parody</font>

509
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:44,120
account what kind of what kind of

510
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:48,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">attraction does that have what kind of</font>

511
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:51,080
impact that does have on my risk posture

512
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:53,659
maybe a lot maybe not so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

513
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:56,449
30,000 followers and by now it's it's a

514
00:24:53,659 --> 00:25:00,140
it's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more than that this was taken</font>

515
00:24:56,450 --> 00:25:01,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">in when Trump was kind of a joke running</font>

516
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:04,279
for president and<font color="#E5E5E5"> now it's oh my god</font>

517
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is real and so that account has got</font>

518
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:09,490
way more followers now with those

519
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:13,340
followers they have the impact of

520
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:17,630
changing public perception and having

521
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:19,720
having a say that actually it carries to

522
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:23,120
something and laughs I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not least is</font>

523
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:24,890
just information leaks someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> daxing</font>

524
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,860
you someone putting out information on

525
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:31,789
you whether it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> true or not if it's</font>

526
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:34,309
online it must be true right and how

527
00:25:31,789 --> 00:25:35,899
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that impact that organization in</font>

528
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:38,360
terms of data<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's out there and</font>

529
00:25:35,899 --> 00:25:40,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually is relevant or data that's not</font>

530
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:43,580
relevant it might and might entice

531
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:45,020
someone to dig in deeper because<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh my</font>

532
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:46,668
god they were breached and all those

533
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:49,370
look at all those passwords and dns

534
00:25:46,669 --> 00:25:52,130
entries and IP addresses<font color="#CCCCCC"> and whatever it</font>

535
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:55,070
is let's try to bang on and see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

536
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:57,350
can get in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't I</font>

537
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:59,510
someone and can<font color="#E5E5E5"> increase the likelihood</font>

538
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:02,689
of someone attacking you or at least

539
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:04,179
probing a little bit and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is what</font>

540
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:07,850
we ended up with this is kind of the the

541
00:26:04,179 --> 00:26:11,179
unfolded the complete spread out three

542
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:14,899
of the social<font color="#CCCCCC"> media risk metrics don't</font>

543
00:26:11,179 --> 00:26:21,350
try to read it I'm just bragging it's

544
00:26:14,899 --> 00:26:23,299
big it's it's comprehensive and and we

545
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:26,510
included a lot of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> metrics in</font>

546
00:26:23,299 --> 00:26:28,940
their folder them<font color="#CCCCCC"> into ways to answer</font>

547
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:31,900
those four main questions that we had

548
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:34,270
and ended up with a score

549
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:37,150
because we needed to come up with

550
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:40,690
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was that had a number</font>

551
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:43,870
associated with it and it was it was

552
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:47,200
kind of tricky how do you measure the

553
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:51,159
level in terms of if I see something bad

554
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:53,860
about you how bad is it is there a way

555
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:56,200
to measure the level of badness in terms

556
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:58,540
of you know hate speech political speech

557
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:00,370
activism and so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> so forth</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> older</font>

558
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:02,920
examples that we talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about and this</font>

559
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:06,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">is where we came up to to some of the</font>

560
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:09,360
challenges between quantitative and

561
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:13,270
qualitative what we ended up doing is

562
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:16,719
taking a fairly qualitative approach and

563
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:19,320
all those branches all those<font color="#E5E5E5"> leaves that</font>

564
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:22,750
you see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you saw on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the the mind map</font>

565
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:26,470
ended up being scored with a binary

566
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:30,690
value exists or<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't exist basically</font>

567
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:34,540
flip toggles do we see that activity yes

568
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:37,090
no yes no no no yes yes yes kind of flip

569
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:40,330
through those switches don't care about

<font color="#CCCCCC">the level only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> care about if I see that</font>

573
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:52,240
with a lot of ones and<font color="#E5E5E5"> zeros and now we</font>

574

had to wait them to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> how they</font>

actually affect or how they compose a

00:27:54,340 --> 00:28:01,959
risk score that would be a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> more a</font>

577
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:04,930
quantifiable and and we solve that

578
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:08,140
challenge by first of all looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

579
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:10,900
weighing because if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I look at a small</font>

580
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:12,510
company versus a big company or two

581
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:15,070
companies that deal with different

582
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:17,980
industries they would have different

583
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:20,080
biases one would be much more sensitive

584
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:22,090
to political speech<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe because</font>

585
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,580
they're associated<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a certain</font>

586
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:26,520
political party another one might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

587
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:30,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">essa might be much more concerned about</font>

588
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:33,340
hacktivism because they're green peas so

589
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:35,919
politics and hacktivism would have

590
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:37,870
completely different weights for those

591
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:41,230
two organizations<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for us</font>

592
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:43,270
to come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this you know with with</font>

593
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:45,020
a finite<font color="#E5E5E5"> number that says this is your</font>

594
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:47,770
risk that would be in

595
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:50,090
so we cheated our way a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

596
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:53,330
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> step when you use the</font>

597
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:54,770
framework is to put in your biases and

598
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:57,050
we have the simple mechanism of

599
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:59,180
providing you with you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know a number of</font>

600
00:28:57,050 --> 00:29:00,950
points to distribute between the

00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:03,800
different categories and you're

602
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:06,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically entering your specific</font>

into the system using that way which you

605
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:16,220
can see here on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right we ended up</font>

606
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,710

that's how we ended<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with with the</font>

the number of ones and<font color="#CCCCCC"> zeros we had</font>

618
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:51,020
some funky number that we call the

00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:53,780
aggregate number of online<font color="#E5E5E5"> threats or</font>

620
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:57,590
kind of factored number of online

threats that's reflected your specific

622

624
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:11,570
to multiply that and apply to both

personal and corporate aspects and

626
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:18,740
furthermore factor in additional metrics

627
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:21,080
and additional questions like what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

exposure to malicious content based on

what based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> my network of friends</font>

631
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:30,530
network is posting and what is

632
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:33,410
specifically the negative sentiment that

633
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:36,560
I'm attracting or that's being applied

634
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:39,440
to me as a person is someone saying oh

635
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:41,570
ins an idiot who gave him you know the

636
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,780
spot on area 41 I'm still trying to

637
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:47,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that out and and what kind of</font>

information leaks<font color="#CCCCCC"> exists in quantifying</font>

639
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:55,070
measure them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> see how those apply</font>

640
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:56,659
more accurately to my risk posture so

641
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:58,159
you're probably asking what<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of data</font>

642
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:01,970
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to</font>

643
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:04,940
provide that that risk scoring so some

644
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:07,550
basic elements about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> organization to</font>

645
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:10,360
put me in context first of all the size

646
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:13,100
of the organization if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm measuring me</font>

647
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:16,459
in my previous<font color="#E5E5E5"> workplace which had about</font>

648
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:19,219
100<font color="#CCCCCC"> people I have you know a fairly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> big</font>

649
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:20,870
impact on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the realization if you measure</font>

650
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:22,760
me against my<font color="#CCCCCC"> card</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> organization which</font>

651
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:27,310
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few hundreds</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of thousands of</font>

652
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:31,580
people my impact is slightly smaller and

653
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:33,889
geography goes a long way what where<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

654
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:36,530
my organization operating what offices

655
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:40,220
do we have how many assets am I

656
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:42,230
monitoring am I monitoring just me and

657
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:44,990
we're monitoring 20 people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

658
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:48,620
organization again 20 out of 100 that's

659
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:52,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">a pretty decent measurement base 20 out</font>

660
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:55,189
of 200,000 not so much so I need to

661
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:59,179
factor that in I'm measuring the chatter

662
00:31:55,190 --> 00:32:02,390
how many instances of chatter do I see

663
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:04,250
online that reflect on me how many

664
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:07,400
impersonations that I've discussed

665
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:09,560
before and what kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sentiment is</font>

666
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:11,600
being expressed about me and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

667
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:14,600
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> measure sentiment in a few</font>

668
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:17,899
minutes so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the basic information</font>

669
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:20,689
and the way that you can start<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

670
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:23,810
this framework to apply it to your risk

671
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:25,970
posture is a I believe it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind step</font>

672
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:30,200
process but we'll we'll see I can

673
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:34,010
remember step<font color="#CCCCCC"> one is understanding what</font>

674
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:36,860
is your organization's a willingness to

675
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:40,490
even start looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at people's personal</font>

676
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:44,240
online activities and you will see<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

677
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:45,800
the range<font color="#CCCCCC"> from nothing we cannot look at</font>

678
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,290
people at what people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are doing online</font>

679
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:53,540
and actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> measure it and and use that</font>

680
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:55,820
as something to to tune or or to act

681
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:58,610
upon from a<font color="#CCCCCC"> security posture</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from an</font>

682
00:32:55,820 --> 00:33:01,550
organizational posture all the way up

683
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:04,610
the scale to enforced we will not only

684
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:06,950
look from an<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source perspective</font>

685
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:09,260
open source intelligence perspective but

686
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:11,730
we will force people to provide as

687
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:13,830
access to their accounts because

688
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:18,270
they might be tweeting from protected

689
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:20,429
accounts they might be limiting the the

690
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:22,500
publicity of their<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook posts to</font>

691
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:24,330
friends only and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly</font>

692
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:28,290
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're doing so you'll see that</font>

693
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:30,870
entire range the keys to identify where

694
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:35,580
is my organization on that scale so i

695
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:38,370
can start adapting and and work towards

696
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:40,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">a the right way to do this obviously</font>

697
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:42,479
when you're doing nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all you</font>

698
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:43,860
kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> at an impasse so you need to</font>

699
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">figure out a way to convince the</font>

700
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:48,300
organization to say look this is out

701
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,730
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the way that we're going to</font>

702
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:52,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">use this is from a outsider perspective</font>

703
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:54,420
we're not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hack into anyone's</font>

704
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:56,700
account we're not monitoring people's

705
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:59,670
private communications let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just factor</font>

706
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:01,610
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> assent and that usually is it's</font>

707
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:05,040
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's fairly acceptable from</font>

708
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:08,870
even very sensitive organizations step

709
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:11,699
two is identify who do I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to track</font>

710
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:13,529
especially with large organizations you

711
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:16,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">can't track everyone I mean you can if</font>

712
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:19,920
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can that's great but usually want</font>

713
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:23,310
to focus on key individuals and that

714
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:26,639
focus would usually range between four

715
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:28,310
different categories first is IT all

716
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:32,699
right they have access to sensitive

717
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:37,830
systems and and if I own an IT guy let's

718
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:40,790
say someone will who's an admin at some

either owned them or or force some kind

they're designed to go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and be</font>

733
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:24,720
vocal and engage with with a large

have a lot of friction with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> outside</font>

world and last but not least sales

00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:37,440
people there the classic target they're

740
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:40,020
out there they're trying to pitch

741
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,300
everything don't sell their sister for a

742
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:44,009
big sale right and so they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

743
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:46,410
be very engaged on social media and

they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be very interactive if</font>

745
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:50,310
you approach them especially on linkedin

746
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:53,820
when you're like hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to buy</font>

747
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:57,660
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh no problem let's go</font>

out for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a beer awesome M so step two is</font>

again targeting or identifying<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are</font>

our focal points inside the organization

751
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:11,130
to start tracking step 3 start

752
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:15,000
collecting information and where the

753
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:16,740
internet everywhere I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> kidding and</font>

754
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,020
if you need some help<font color="#E5E5E5"> there books out</font>

755
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:22,140
there to help you figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how to</font>

756
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:24,750
collect information and by google

757
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:27,029
hacking by scraping by looking at data

758
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:30,420
that's freely available that is not

759
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:32,940
closed in terms of accounts or

760
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:35,160
protections or even then and try to

761
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:38,610
collect as much data as you can about

762
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:40,740
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> organization step</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 is taking all</font>

763
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:42,870
of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> massive data</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you've</font>

764
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:45,259
collected taking that internet and

765
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:47,910
folding it into something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

766
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:50,930
comprehend and use and analyze that's

767
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:54,270
called ETL extract transform and load

768
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:56,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">and in our specific example it's more of</font>

769
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:59,370
a scrape transforming load it's taking a

770
00:36:56,580 --> 00:37:02,370
tweet breaking it down to entities that

771
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:06,180
we can work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with by using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some form of</font>

772
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:08,279
scraping and ending up with the raw data

773
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:11,609
that we can feed back into a machine

774
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:13,680
into storage so we can reference in the

775
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:17,160
different elements like clinks like a

776
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:20,220
entities and so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> so forth so we can</font>

777
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:23,190
relate<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them and understand and kind</font>

778
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:25,879
of create a social graph of the threats

779
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:28,500
or the activities<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to track</font>

780
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:32,600
talking about storage we need to start

781
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:35,120
stuff a storage nowadays is easy as

782
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:37,520
as Marcus says big data big data big

783
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:41,120
data and I'm not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about it</font>

784
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:43,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">because go to RS and figure it out step</font>

785
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:46,040
6 analyze so we have all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

786
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:49,580
information start in big data we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font>

787
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:54,410
analyze it now two major approaches for

788
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:57,460
data analysis one automation automate as

789
00:37:54,410 --> 00:38:00,440
much as you can you'll hit a wall in

790
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:02,060
automation you'll hit a wall where you

791
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:04,130
would need some<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of subject matter</font>

792
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:06,380
expert to say this is right this is

793
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:10,310
wrong or let's do some more folding and

794
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:13,940
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of manipulation that's when we get</font>

795
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:16,130
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the kind of image handcrafted model</font>

796
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:18,950
of looking at data and starting to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font>

797
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:21,230
those correlations by hand so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

798
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:23,390
feed back into automation there is no

799
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:27,440
right or wrong here you have to apply

800
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:32,240
both and your goal would be to use a

801
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:33,950
mushy and crafted analysis in a way that

802
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,569
would feed back into automation so you

803
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:38,750
can move on to the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> target and the</font>

804
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:41,990
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> target</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of get from that 80</font>

805
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:43,010
20 to 90 10 all the way down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

806
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:45,109
percent that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to deal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

807
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:47,210
manually versus ninety-eight percent

808
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:50,710
that's that's being automated in terms

809
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:53,600
of analyzing this a quick example about

810
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:57,140
using semantic analysis especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

811
00:38:53,600 --> 00:39:04,250
we talk about automating the way to to

812
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:05,930
extract context from text and is a in an

813
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:08,480
automated fashion and again this is

814
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:11,120
better going to be very subjective but

815
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:14,170
the key here and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tricky part</font>

816
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:17,270
it doesn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> completely right</font>

817
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:18,650
because it's subjective so it doesn't

818
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:21,050
have to be right it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just has to be</font>

819
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:23,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">consistent so if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I feed the same text</font>

820
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:28,270
twice it has to give me the same results

821
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:28,270
if I feed the same text with some a

822
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:33,860
verbal differences but the same meaning

823
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:35,690
i still have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the same results so</font>

824
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:37,550
that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean that's what I mean</font>

825
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:39,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">when I say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be right it</font>

826
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:41,930
has to be consistent<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one of those</font>

827
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:45,200
systems is it was actually built by

828
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:45,808
IBM's Watson laboratory and they can

829
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,029
actually

830
00:39:45,809 --> 00:39:51,959
provide you<font color="#CCCCCC"> with an automated way to</font>

831
00:39:48,029 --> 00:39:55,619
analyze somatically<font color="#E5E5E5"> analyzed text and so</font>

832
00:39:51,959 --> 00:39:58,979
I fed a big blob of text in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this example</font>

833
00:39:55,619 --> 00:40:00,239
Donald Donald Trump's speech when he

834
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:02,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">announced that he's running</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

835
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:04,769
president it's a long piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> text and</font>

836
00:40:02,209 --> 00:40:07,288
it's got a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of semantics and content</font>

837
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:09,058
as you'll see in a second and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

838
00:40:07,289 --> 00:40:12,689
the breakdown that I got from the

839
00:40:09,059 --> 00:40:15,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">machine again don't judge not right or</font>

840
00:40:12,689 --> 00:40:19,319
wrong this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very subjective it were</font>

841
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:22,109
sensing 98% anger in eighty-eight

842
00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:24,900
percent negativity out of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> forty two</font>

843
00:40:22,109 --> 00:40:27,209
percent emotional tone of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that speech</font>

844
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:31,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I can even get a further breakdown</font>

845
00:40:27,209 --> 00:40:34,410
of very particular elements of openness

846
00:40:31,289 --> 00:40:37,559
consciousness all the way down to two

847
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:41,249
very my new details<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how that person</font>

848
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:45,630
is expressing itself themselves online

849
00:40:41,249 --> 00:40:47,129
in a kind of a verbal analysis of the

850
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:49,739
aggregation of all those different

851
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:52,199
elements your social boisterous and can

852
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:54,719
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> perceived as short-sighted again</font>

853
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:58,229
don't judge me<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is what the machine</font>

854
00:40:54,719 --> 00:41:00,119
came up with and Donald<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trump is just a</font>

855
00:40:58,229 --> 00:41:02,819
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> example because he's got he's very</font>

856
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:06,089
vocal and he's very emotional which

857
00:41:02,819 --> 00:41:08,999
carries pretty well in his in his in his

858
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:11,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">text and there's a lot of data to work</font>

859
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:15,598
with so again it's a great a research

860
00:41:11,729 --> 00:41:18,959
target to use and then you just apply

861
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:21,390
you know step<font color="#CCCCCC"> six point B is apply some</font>

862
00:41:18,959 --> 00:41:23,399
big data magic to transform all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

863
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:26,819
to aggregate it and to come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

864
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:29,429
score and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that score is basically what</font>

865
00:41:26,819 --> 00:41:31,170
we have in the framework and where we

866
00:41:29,429 --> 00:41:33,390
talked about the weighing of the

867
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:36,059
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> elements and that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the result</font>

868
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:37,859
of flipping those toggles that are based

869
00:41:36,059 --> 00:41:40,400
on everything that we talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> so far</font>

870
00:41:37,859 --> 00:41:43,288
semantic analysis and so on so<font color="#CCCCCC"> forth so</font>

871
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:47,290
here's a quick example of how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that looks</font>

872
00:41:43,289 --> 00:41:54,880
like demo demo

873
00:41:47,290 --> 00:42:02,310
work with me oh you can go away you can

874
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:06,250
go yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so this is our infamous</font>

875
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:09,549
social media risk metrics framework it's

876
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:13,180
basically a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 tab excel sheet available</font>

877
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:15,460
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google Docs and do I need to make it</font>

878
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:19,270
bigger bigger is this good can you see

879
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:24,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">it in the back bigger that's what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> she</font>

880
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:26,920
said and first app is just the breakdown

881
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:30,220
of the the goals that we talked about

882
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:32,290
before second tab you already<font color="#E5E5E5"> saw this</font>

883
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:36,430
is the first step when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> enter into</font>

884
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:39,550
the matrix is to enter your biases so we

885
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:41,859
can weigh that and again this is for

886
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:44,260
Donald Trump's organization and the

887
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:46,780
different biases we care a lot about

888
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:49,390
financial in stock not so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

889
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:51,730
technology IP and so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so forth so</font>

890
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:53,410
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is again this is a sample it</font>

891
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:55,270
doesn't have to be right or wrong it's

892
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:57,640
consistent and you can you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine-tune</font>

893
00:42:55,270 --> 00:43:00,100
it these are some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tract</font>

894
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:02,440
parameters that I talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> initially</font>

895
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:05,290
in terms of step to what what do I

896
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:07,780
collect so some numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we plugged</font>

897
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:10,660
in for organization size management

898
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:15,060
location chatter a number of tracked

899
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:18,160
entities and finally we get the formula

900
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:20,200
this is where we flick the toggles so

901
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:22,629
I'm just looking at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> yellow</font>

902
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:26,710
highlighted elements and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

903
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:29,110
flip you know if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> see a any kind of</font>

904
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:32,320
online activity related to economics I

905
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:33,910
flip the toggle if I do social that

906
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:35,920
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs to be flipped as well and</font>

907
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:39,220
so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so forth so as you just flip</font>

908
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:41,250
the toggles in terms of it excuse me

909
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:44,379
what kind of threat to my motivating and

910
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:47,590
I basically go down that tree the big

911
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:49,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">mindmap tree that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've shown before and</font>

912
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:52,180
I flip all those toggles and you can see

913
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:54,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">the numbers starting to form up in the</font>

914
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:59,440
green boxes in terms of the calculation

915
00:43:54,750 --> 00:44:00,880
and once i'm done with this once i'm

916
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,670
done with the collection and then now

917
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:07,300
and flipping<font color="#CCCCCC"> otago's I can look at my</font>

918
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:09,730
final score card which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> now an</font>

919
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:11,110
expression of those four main elements

920
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:13,480
that I talked about likelihood

921
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:15,940
manifestation impact in the factor

922
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:19,060
number of online threats and this is

923
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:21,370
what i get for analyzing a specific

924
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:23,110
person and then i go on<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the next one</font>

925
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:25,180
there the next one to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next one and</font>

926
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:28,330
they have those four numbers that

927
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:30,759
represent that person's online social

928
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:33,970
media risk score in terms of what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

929
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:37,270
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do now and if someone is riskier</font>

930
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:40,509
than someone else and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I define a certain</font>

931
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:42,520
level<font color="#E5E5E5"> a threshold of I can live with</font>

932
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:44,950
this kind of risk but nothing above that

933
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:47,890
I can look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that person and say well</font>

934
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:49,720
the manifestation here is too high and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

935
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:52,950
can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to the previous sheet and</font>

936
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:55,470
understand and drill down what caused

937
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:58,180
manifestation to be such so high that

938
00:44:55,470 --> 00:45:02,350
5.2 I want to lower that to like I don't

939
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:04,870
know a 4.8 to a 50 and I can look at the

940
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:09,100
elements<font color="#CCCCCC"> that triggered manifestation</font>

941
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:11,049
and see what what is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> that caused it</font>

942
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:14,319
to be so high so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can see all those</font>

943
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:17,380
ones here and I can now address them I

944
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:19,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">can figure out do I need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> apply you</font>

945
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:21,580
know technology controls do I need to

946
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:24,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">sit down with a person and like dude you</font>

947
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:27,670
can't say that online which are all

948
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:29,830
valid responses and activities in order

949
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:32,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">to reduce that risk in a month after</font>

950
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:34,029
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can measure again or day or a</font>

951
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:36,730
week whatever it is and<font color="#CCCCCC"> see how that</font>

952
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:39,460
score changed and if I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> being effective</font>

953
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:45,040
in terms of fixing the problem or

954
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:47,850
reducing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk let's get back to our</font>

955
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">presentation</font>

956
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:52,430
that's what I love about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Excel demos</font>

957
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:53,839
they can't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> screw up unless it's</font>

958
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:56,328
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google Docs and then I have to</font>

959
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:59,750
connect and you're all attacking me yeah

960
00:45:56,329 --> 00:46:02,480
so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> working to get it well two</font>

961
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:05,329
places in first place is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Society of</font>

962
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:07,069
information risk analyst there is a

secret<font color="#CCCCCC"> society of information risk</font>

964
00:46:07,069 --> 00:46:13,640
analyst like a special handshake and you

965
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:16,700
have to like bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> the blood of someone</font>

966
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:18,920
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you sacrifice but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it sits there and</font>

967
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:20,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">they actually published it as part of</font>

968
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:24,200
their<font color="#E5E5E5"> activities mostly because of Alex</font>

969
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:26,480
and he's on that secret society and the

970
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:29,569
second side is surprisingly risk metrics

971
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:33,079
calm was not registered it is now and

972
00:46:29,569 --> 00:46:36,890
that's where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the data in</font>

973
00:46:33,079 --> 00:46:39,109
the excel sheet the mind map and a full

00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:41,930
documentation of what each and every

975
00:46:39,109 --> 00:46:45,290
metric that we're talking about means

976
00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:47,569
and how how how do we collect it how do

977
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:49,790
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply it and in what cases should we</font>

978
00:46:47,569 --> 00:46:53,000
flip<font color="#CCCCCC"> it up or down so that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where it's</font>

00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:55,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">all at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you feel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> free to comment to</font>

980
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,349
take it use<font color="#E5E5E5"> it abuse it you don't have</font>

981
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:58,880
to tell me do whatever you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want with it</font>

00:46:57,349 --> 00:47:01,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you if you contribute back that's</font>

983
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,599
great if you used it and it's shit don't

984
00:47:01,309 --> 00:47:04,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me if you use it and it's</font>

phenomenal and<font color="#E5E5E5"> post it online so I can</font>

986
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:13,669
brag so quick takeaways and now and will

987
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:15,410
sum this up first of all before you even

988
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:18,319
start engaging in all this fancy big

989
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:21,558
data analysis stuff is try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out</font>

990
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:24,349
if you do have a social media policy do

991
00:47:21,559 --> 00:47:27,140
you even to your organization does<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

992
00:47:24,349 --> 00:47:29,000
organization even<font color="#E5E5E5"> care and what kind of</font>

993
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:31,759
framework do you have what kind of

994
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,109
boundaries did the organization paint in

995
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,569
terms of what you're allowed or not

996
00:47:33,109 --> 00:47:38,569
allowed to do so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can have at least a</font>

997
00:47:35,569 --> 00:47:41,808
baseline of this is good this is bad or

998
00:47:38,569 --> 00:47:43,279
this is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can do if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

999
00:47:41,809 --> 00:47:45,799
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> you probably want to create</font>

1000
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:48,160
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you dive in and start</font>

1001
00:47:45,799 --> 00:47:51,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">telling people stop saying shit online</font>

1002
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:56,509
um try understand if you have a risk

1003
00:47:51,799 --> 00:47:58,160
model beyond let's run<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nessus and see</font>

1004
00:47:56,510 --> 00:48:00,740
what vulnerabilities do we have that's

1005
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:02,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">not a risk model and try to see if you</font>

1006
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:03,729
have a risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> model for your secure</font>

1007
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:06,049
early posture that takes into account

1008
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:09,020
something more than just vulnerability

1009
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:11,869
scanning and see how that fits into the

1010
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:15,200
risk model again you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make this</font>

1011
00:48:11,869 --> 00:48:16,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">work inside your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> existing model there is</font>

1012
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,470
no way you can change that if you're

1013
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:21,590
using one framework or not a framework

1014
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:25,009
there's no way you can shift just

1015
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:28,280
because oh I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to factor in risk on</font>

1016
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:31,010
social media find a way to transform the

1017
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:34,450
scoring from here into your risk model

1018
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:37,520
and apply it the right way and<font color="#CCCCCC"> pressure</font>

1019
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:40,939
and so you can fit so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can use that</font>

1020
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:43,700
model measure<font color="#CCCCCC"> your current once you have</font>

1021
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:47,450
that done do a test run do it baseline

1022
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:49,879
run this exercise on a few key accounts

1023
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:51,980
and just based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source</font>

1024
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:56,030
intelligence and get a baseline of

1025
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:57,740
measurement and then do another baseline

1026
00:48:56,030 --> 00:49:00,650
after a month<font color="#E5E5E5"> after a couple of months</font>

1027
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:03,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">to see what changed and to see if that</font>

1028
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:05,390
model<font color="#E5E5E5"> really reflects the changes in the</font>

1029
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:06,650
sentiment the changes in the expressions

1030
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:09,980
the changes of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the activities that</font>

1031
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:12,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">people have and then you can see where</font>

1032
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:15,140
you can actually apply controls and

1033
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:17,210
activities and education to lower that

1034
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:19,900
risk and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to become your</font>

1035
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:22,700
ongoing practice in terms of measure

1036
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:25,130
measure the gap measure again see if

1037
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:28,160
there's a gap and every<font color="#E5E5E5"> time there's a</font>

1038
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:30,260
gap identify the right components that

1039
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:32,330
contributed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that gap so you can</font>

1040
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:34,820
address them at the right level whether

1041
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:38,000
it's HR whether its technical whether

1042
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:45,080
it's legal marketing and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

1043
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:47,270
forth make sense perfect this is all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1044
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:50,359
have for you we're good on time a

1045
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:52,759
perfect of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> and any questions we</font>

1046
00:49:50,359 --> 00:49:59,150
have a minute yes we have about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a minute</font>

1047
00:49:52,760 --> 00:50:01,730
for questions Wow<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right all right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1048
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:03,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's all clear that's phenomenal well</font>

1049
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:06,000
I'll be around here

1050
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:09,629
them buy me a drink<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll answer I'll</font>

1051
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:13,010
spill out everything so for the next two

1052
