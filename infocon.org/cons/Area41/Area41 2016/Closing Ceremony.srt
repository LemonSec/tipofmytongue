1
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:12,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay let's go do you guys like the</font>

2
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:12,209
conference yes no

3
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:24,619
cool cool cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> I assumed so because I</font>

4
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:28,779
figured none of you actually really use

5
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:32,119
the Wi-Fi thing with like a total of a

6
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:37,010
couple of gigabytes of traffic that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

7
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:38,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">yesterday it was this is ridiculous but</font>

8
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:42,110
yeah thnkx for focusing on the content

9
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:45,230
we appreciate that we also realized that

10
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:47,600
one of our event guys has the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most</font>

11
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:49,339
active clients<font color="#E5E5E5"> over figured we didn't</font>

12
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,760
have any<font color="#E5E5E5"> technical differences</font>

13
00:00:49,339 --> 00:00:55,729
difficulties downstairs so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool</font>

14
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:59,120
if you made any pictures during those

15
00:00:55,729 --> 00:01:01,220
two days we would really appreciate if

16
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,699
you could send<font color="#E5E5E5"> those those we won't</font>

17
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:06,229
publish them without consent especially

18
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:08,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">when they're people recognizable we</font>

19
00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:10,429
obviously respect that it's just very

20
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,070
useful for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to have some impressions</font>

21
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:18,170
of the event itself so if you took

22
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:20,360
pictures especially if they're good give

23
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:22,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">it not compromising then please</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> send</font>

24
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:26,150
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us yeah yeah drop us a line that</font>

25
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:31,280
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be really cool of you let's start</font>

26
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:33,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">with a batch shall we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so I see</font>

27
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,120
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them are still blinking which is</font>

28
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:37,040
nice that means either you got some new

29
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:40,070
batteries or you actually switch them

30
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:44,390
off beforehand and none of them seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

31
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:49,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">have been exploding so that's good for</font>

32
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:50,930
me so we obviously did a few things with

33
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:53,420
the badge and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did a small lightning</font>

34
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:56,060
tour<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of explaining how we did it</font>

35
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:58,970
the whole design<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the questions</font>

36
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:01,760
that came up is what's the freaky binary

37
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:04,780
number on the side well it is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> binary</font>

38
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:08,269
number so just type it in it's actually

39
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:11,330
2016 if you ignore all the spaces

40
00:02:08,269 --> 00:02:16,760
between so not too difficult to figure

41
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:18,110
out in the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the batch I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

42
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,970
pleased<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a lot of two people</font>

43
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:22,340
actually tried and<font color="#CCCCCC"> dumped the firmware</font>

44
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:24,709
of it we didn't do any shenanigans by

45
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:27,439
encrypting it or<font color="#E5E5E5"> X whoring it there's a</font>

46
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:28,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">very funny strings in there for those</font>

47
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,760
who dumped it

48
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:33,299
we've seen a<font color="#CCCCCC"> few people definitely</font>

49
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,769
managed to get it off<font color="#E5E5E5"> the batch and then</font>

50
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:39,220
getting the password<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the batch only</font>

51
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:41,830
Wi-Fi shouts out there to the besides

52
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:43,980
lisboa team who did<font color="#CCCCCC"> very well on that</font>

53
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,980
one

54
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:51,649
because of course they also found the

55
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">backend server the hard x server which</font>

56
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:56,000
we used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of see how many batches</font>

57
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:59,060
were locked in and sending you new

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,700
messages new blinking stuff we didn't

59
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:03,470
put any authentication on it because we

60
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,530
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> share the phone and they</font>

61
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:10,190
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> did behave so only sending that</font>

62
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:12,440
the blue and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> red triggers for the</font>

63
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:15,109
batches we try to overwrite them again

64
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:17,209
with the pink ones so little battle

65
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:23,750
there and we'll go into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

66
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:26,019
stats on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next slide so on the left</font>

67
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:31,340
side<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see that we had yesterday</font>

68
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:33,410
roughly 220 batches active at one or the

69
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:35,840
other time there were more batches given

70
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:38,030
out but of course some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

71
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,310
ripped off the battery instantaneously

72
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:42,549
because well<font color="#CCCCCC"> we probably go into the</font>

73
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:45,230
details why afterwards on the next slide

74
00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:49,910
today we started with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit less</font>

75
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:52,700
so roughly 140 active batches currently

76
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:55,220
slowly degrading probably because the

77
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:57,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">batteries started to run off and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

78
00:03:55,220 --> 00:04:00,320
people start to run off as well but

79
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:03,350
we're pretty pleased<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that on the</font>

80
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:06,410
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> side you see the voting so blue is</font>

81
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:09,890
the people who haven't pushed any of the

82
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:12,590
buttons the orange<font color="#CCCCCC"> e1</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the left button</font>

83
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:17,810
and green one is on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right we're</font>

84
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:20,389
still having the question there what's

85
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:23,419
the question the button one so if you

86
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:27,830
hold it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> front of you on the lower</font>

87
00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:31,580
left side yes BTN one and it's labeled

88
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:32,990
here exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> because of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that yes we</font>

89
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:35,090
probably should explain it better next

90
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:37,700
time we're still analyzing also getting

91
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:39,530
a few of the outliners there because we

92
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:42,110
saw a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few people trying to get the</font>

93
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:44,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">easter-egg codes and probably voting the</font>

94
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:48,110
whole time which might screw off a few

95
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:51,619
of the voting's but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> still hope you</font>

96
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:53,990
have fun and with that going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to the</font>

97
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:56,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">Easter Egg codes so there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ten Easter</font>

98
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:59,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">Egg codes which are in there and no we</font>

99
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,329
didn't publish them on<font color="#CCCCCC"> g top but thanks</font>

100
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:03,459
for trying

101
00:05:00,329 --> 00:05:05,499
they're pretty basic because they're all

102
00:05:03,459 --> 00:05:06,879
mirrored so for the people who can't

103
00:05:05,499 --> 00:05:11,649
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> distinguish between left and</font>

104
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:14,439
right any of them should work no offense

105
00:05:11,649 --> 00:05:17,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">there sorry and well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you started with</font>

106
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:19,749
the all right or left we had some people

107
00:05:17,409 --> 00:05:22,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming into it man that was really</font>

108
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:24,669
really difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> 132 characters and kind</font>

109
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">of really mixed up that's probably</font>

110
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:29,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">because the interrupts are some time a</font>

111
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:31,809
bit messy but seems to have worked in

112
00:05:29,589 --> 00:05:36,579
the end so probably a win-win situation

113
00:05:31,809 --> 00:05:38,649
and we publish them on the area 41 dash

114
00:05:36,579 --> 00:05:41,259
batch website with some more information

115
00:05:38,649 --> 00:05:44,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">there as well so just go and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> visit that</font>

116
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:47,799
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> after the conference and then yes</font>

117
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:50,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">the question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was why would people remove</font>

118
00:05:47,799 --> 00:05:52,209
the battery especially interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

119
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:53,769
thought was the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of removing it</font>

120
00:05:52,209 --> 00:05:55,899
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to the toilet and then I</font>

121
00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:57,879
actually put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it back in afterwards and I</font>

122
00:05:55,899 --> 00:06:01,719
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even think about that that's a</font>

123
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:03,039
whole new<font color="#E5E5E5"> level so yes I mean some</font>

124
00:06:01,719 --> 00:06:05,558
people said well microphone because

125
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:08,709
there is a coil on it well I use it for

126
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:10,299
d well the obvious part which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

127
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:14,229
level up of the power because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need</font>

128
00:06:10,299 --> 00:06:15,758
3.3 volt of course on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right side yes</font>

129
00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:18,549
you can remove touche out there and see

130
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,619
that there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a ESP below there</font>

131
00:06:18,549 --> 00:06:24,638
and the rum at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least for those who</font>

132
00:06:20,619 --> 00:06:27,159
recognize those question would be why

133
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,729
would I want to listening you on the

134
00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:32,438
toilet probably not so interesting Wi-Fi

135
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:34,719
will probably make more sense right

136
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:36,879
because at the easy Wi-Fi chip and you

137
00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:40,329
probably carried home so that's a nice

138
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:43,779
were driving or war walking and probably

139
00:06:40,329 --> 00:06:48,039
gives me time to crack your Wi-Fi at

140
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:50,889
home vp8 to write probably get a few

141
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:52,329
initialization vectors and maybe get the

142
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:54,659
spike on the bandwidth in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the morning</font>

143
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:58,809
for all the people uploading it again

144
00:06:54,659 --> 00:07:00,759
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be right or as we said well we</font>

145
00:06:58,809 --> 00:07:02,169
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have done something where if you</font>

146
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:05,079
remove the battery there is still<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

147
00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:07,389
little power in the coil which actually

148
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:09,219
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be good to do some stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

149
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:11,860
actually trigger the moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

150
00:07:09,219 --> 00:07:13,719
remove the battery so if you do that

151
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:16,090
maybe you should wait five minutes and

152
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,580
and do whatever you want to do just as a

153
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:21,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">reminder last but not least of course</font>

154
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:24,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">location tracking Wi-Fi is very good for</font>

155
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:29,409
that could also scan for let's say any

156
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:31,990
other device in the venue close by maybe

157
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:34,540
do some<font color="#E5E5E5"> IOT vulnerability scanning with</font>

158
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:37,030
it or just check if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a phone</font>

159
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:40,360
enable or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this so a lot</font>

160
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:43,239
of this sparked our interest and maybe

161
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:47,740
we come back with a few ideas<font color="#E5E5E5"> but of</font>

162
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:49,660
course yes we didn't have time to now we

163
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:52,060
didn't do it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

164
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:54,940
unethical and well<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should enjoy it</font>

165
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:57,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">without the fear so now we didn't do any</font>

166
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:59,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the tracking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or any of the other</font>

167
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:06,640
spying that we could have but thanks for

168
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:09,060
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas well let's see so apart from</font>

169
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:12,370
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> batches who generated some traffic</font>

170
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:14,890
as we said we had some traffic on the

171
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:17,680
other networks as well and here's from

172
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:19,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">49th d they did the scanning and</font>

173
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,210
monitoring<font color="#E5E5E5"> if anyone's downloading</font>

174
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:25,060
malware or uploading in that sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

175
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:28,090
as effing already said not too much

176
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:32,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually happened we saw a third of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

177
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:35,319
is just browsing web clients streaming

178
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:38,380
so twelve thirteen percent streaming

179
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:40,210
that started this<font color="#CCCCCC"> afternoon to pick up a</font>

180
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:42,159
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit yeah that was around three</font>

181
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:44,530
o'clock yeah I think might have been

182
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,860
three o'clock so that might be an

183
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:50,819
explanation so after all<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of the</font>

184
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:54,010
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> behave not sure if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's because</font>

185
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:55,540
no one played offense because there

186
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:58,750
weren't too many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

187
00:08:55,540 --> 00:09:01,689
targeted because no one<font color="#CCCCCC"> really dared to</font>

188
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:03,940
use it well we'd never know<font color="#E5E5E5"> but on the</font>

189
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:06,400
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide we have a few of the things</font>

190
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:09,339
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they saw in the network so</font>

191
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:12,670
basically just view<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS messages which</font>

192
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:16,330
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> Beach is corrupted and a few TCP</font>

193
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:19,120
mismatches there so not too much Frankie

194
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:21,580
a few very very old buffer overflows

195
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,010
forge a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pack which of course you all</font>

196
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:26,460
have patched so

197
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:30,300
yeah nothing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> worry about but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still if</font>

198
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:34,380
anything happens well you probably

199
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:37,229
should just<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah patch it beforehand and</font>

200
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:40,080
maybe reinstall the system right but we

201
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:41,820
