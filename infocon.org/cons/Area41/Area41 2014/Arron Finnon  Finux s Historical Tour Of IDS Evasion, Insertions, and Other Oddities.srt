00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,860
mixes historical tourism

6
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,960
ideas invasions and surgeons and other
such

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,850
oddities home gotta do talking about
ideas what we need doubtful

8
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:38,260
well will explain a second so

9
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,910
you might well amarah summary my
non-hispanics

10
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,700
few you might know me from wanting quite
a lot true story

11
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,559
I am if you want to follow me on twitter
and UT

12
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:54,480
totally calm I I'm Scottish

13
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,170
which means nice where a lot okay

14
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,559
I everyone treasure hunt second mom

15
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:05,080
a name and shame people %um but your
hands up to my

16
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,090
come on i mean you know stall

17
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,940
keep your hands up if you know Scott you
always impressed how much they swear

18
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:20,340
because I fucking a so I'm gonna talk
about

19
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,030
network intrusion prevention systems
detection systems UT and whatever

20
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,719
three-letter abbreviation you want to
call it today okay

21
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:30,750
you know this that technology there will
be people who haven't come come to this

22
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,270
talk because hey it's my DS

23
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,090
in that sucks right we'll do that nasa

24
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,170
for criticism I'm a talk to you about
that

25
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,549
well I'm not going to talk to you about
because

26
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:46,899
that's not really where I'm at as I'm
not gonna talk to you about music fails

27
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:48,450
and so on and so forth

28
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,789
I'm gonna be this site

29
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:56,250
as I have you guys seen this picture
before once I decide yes AV

30
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,850
blah blah blah blah blah and on the
other side is day

31
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:04,909
assure security appliance rightly see
that side such a budget

32
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:08,210
so

33
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:10,870
let's do the pro coast of protein low

34
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:15,470
they've been kinda taking the piss off
idea since 96

35
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:19,410
we're gonna talk a little bit about P
technician kind of an interesting paper

36
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,040
that I don't a lot of research

37
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,550
which really shows how sucky

38
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:29,230
IDS is Ben and why we're always going to
be on about for

39
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:33,300
okay I know some %uh view sickness
thinking right now

40
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,300
than a special kinda videa because Hayes
come to happen conference to talk about

41
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,610
it. yes we know it sucks

42
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,620
fair enough so

43
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,610
when we talk about IDSs

44
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:49,210
it's really important understand the
limitations

45
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:53,210
like a I'm I'm gonna let you into secret
fuck the vendors

46
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:56,820
okay let's just talk about amongst
ourselves we can work this out

47
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,880
so you know the state technology

48
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:05,680
you know in 2010 gonna seems to think
that the stand-alone

49
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,940
IPS industry is $989 million dollars

50
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:16,070
just shy the billion dollars why am i
picking on 2010

51
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,400
beginning the years on crisis bailout to

52
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,489
European countries in that time I know

53
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:25,630
use with when you know you're a butt
when a perso you

54
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:31,550
you forgive me for this one okay that
technology remember

55
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:35,690
Cisco this year last year sorry

56
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:40,310
purchase Sourcefire 2.7 billion dollars

57
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:44,880
item chump change is a I'm is a

58
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:50,440
Senate talking Mexican run Rapids and
the news just broke about Cisco

59
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,800
I've got a maybe a little bit of history
trolling Cisco or

60
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,900
the years and some do much talking to
Paul

61
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,320
Cisco's just brought some slap a 2.7
billion dollars

62
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:07,220
a 2.6 billion dollars guy gets off in
the middle

63
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:11,700
my talk and stops my talkin says you're
wrong really

64
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,420
yeah

65
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,850
this is show up the source file written
across the top of that

66
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:20,799
I think you'll find it's 2.7 billion I'm
like

67
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,449
right everyone that's got a source file
Cisco product to see this guy standing

68
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:26,260
up right here

69
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,300
he's in sponsors area if you've got any
problems with false positives

70
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,530
was not working correctly go see this
guy here

71
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:36,710
the way to everyone the checkpoint guys
in the back to the room like

72
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,610
with you okay love you you're next

73
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:44,000
check a so

74
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,220
we have to look at the issues the IDS
itself

75
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:52,139
has an issue with K so we look back in
the day

76
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:55,350
in people's you know people were
surprised to find out

77
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:58,370
actually I D S is older than anti-virus

78
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:02,190
10 piece a few she you not worried

79
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,550
for the IDS industry income right now
virus industry

80
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:09,150
no really I'm a bit more worried that
the antivirus industry will become like

81
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:09,539
that

82
00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:15,750
IPS industry min 67 eight years
researching the ship so the star of back

83
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,270
in the day be on static string analysis

84
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:21,580
right mean we're gonna look for bad
strings

85
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:25,910
missus the problem when you get
engineers trying to fix problems

86
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:29,870
gas to come up with an engineering
solution so what we're gonna do is we're

87
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:30,599
going to

88
00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:34,740
look at the data stream from the bad guy
and in there

89
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,880
that's gonna tell us what the bad guys
doing right makes perfect sense

90
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,470
well when you understand the protocols
themselves

91
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:47,810
a very easy to talk about some wings
boats

92
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:50,949
the very hard to implement you know

93
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:54,320
is not adage which I'll talk about later
on BER

94
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,659
implementers people who implement RSC's
at this adage that is

95
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:02,909
send conservatively

96
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:06,220
receive liberally what that means is

97
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,599
be very very defined in what you send
out

98
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:12,710
BB very very liberal and what you send
them

99
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,099
because we all want approach goes to
work right

100
00:06:16,099 --> 00:06:19,990
we want networks interconnected networks

101
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:23,670
we want gives could stop

102
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,250
the problem is is when you're looking
for

103
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:29,150
things that go wrong when you don't know
how the

104
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:33,720
and point is going to the apt this is
when you stop collecting slip through

105
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,440
the cracks

106
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,650
thinking 96 K

107
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:41,990
HTTP evasions come about the paper was
called

108
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:47,100
the final nail in the coffin right to
tell you this is ninety six right

109
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:51,370
2010 spend a billion dollars on
stand-alone IPS

110
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:55,710
yeah that man in the coffin really did
well the so

111
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:59,370
when you look at protocols protocols are
an interesting thing

112
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:04,150
because they should be able to tell you
what's happening in that they too strict

113
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:07,990
so they should be able to do so when I D
S

114
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:11,600
should be able to look at the issue and
no what's about to happen

115
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,880
right makes perfect sense so

116
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,660
let's talk about compression
compressions an interesting issue

117
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,480
because the some things that I guess can
do some things and ideas County

118
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,070
the case if compression and HTTP chum

119
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:31,370
is an interesting issue so we send

120
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:34,680
compressed data over the Internet with
you

121
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:39,820
SNG zips deflating all this good stuff
and

122
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:43,320
in the Hat is it tells you exactly how

123
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:47,270
they the G's payloads going to be the
IDS can go

124
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:51,280
right I'm gonna of additional space and
then I'm gonna look inside and I'm gonna

125
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,400
see the back things yeah

126
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,750
yeah then also enhance TTP chung's

127
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:00,060
is a protocol it doesn't require you to
find the line

128
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,910
at the compressed format it just sends
you chump data

129
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:07,350
Sony ps4 90 s has really

130
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:12,040
long one solution all actually have one
solution one file

131
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,920
the solution is Wiebe for everything

132
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:20,440
before all this Chuck Baker and when we
stopped at Mercy champ de a

133
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:25,650
will analyzer right makes perfect sense
yet

134
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,590
problem is if I know it up

135
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:33,050
I'm just miss Angie Cheung data into
your system falls over

136
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:37,330
you know what storage is finite you know
we don't have infinite storage

137
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:41,250
some dismiss endurance endurance
endurance engine crop

138
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,380
to eventually you follow all

139
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:48,860
what do you think other solution is
basically

140
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:54,150
and of context they go not message you
know

141
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:57,220
we're not going to inspect the stuff
because this could be too much of it

142
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:00,440
or we can only use where are you can
reserve a megabyte

143
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,670
or two max whatever why don't you turn
off HTTP chung

144
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:09,709
when we do that let his network
defenders which not gonna let

145
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:16,800
jumped into our network up r.i.p you
choose you know i mean

146
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,420
you gonna lose streaming services very
very very quickly

147
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:24,080
while you're using a park in Longview
that they are

148
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,580
hey i pocket Facebook com Watch that

149
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:32,520
cap on Facebook they're not funny thing
yet to be working

150
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,040
but still HR and then we see

151
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:40,410
so we've seen this that protocols
himself

152
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:43,510
land problems that are very hard to
seoul

153
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:49,470
malice interject sent conservatively
receive liberally

154
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:53,230
one of my favorite paper evasions so
simple

155
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:57,070
why I love her love the law so if you
imagine

156
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:01,380
this static string to be right moves to
like hate like a GET request

157
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,850
me I get HTTP

158
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:09,920
Ian evil website not palm forward slash
even payload I HTML

159
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,010
doll whatever the case here

160
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:21,350
HTTP version as a one-point Wong
whatever is to stop it

161
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,070
that if you changed you know the

162
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:26,360
the hay CTP 1.1 bet

163
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,530
see if you change that to a comma
Sanderson Sen

164
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,940
27 receive liberally what do we think
the web server did

165
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:39,000
accepted the request because you
obviously meant of what do you think

166
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,680
happened to stack stern analysis

167
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,200
okay we don't have much for of you go

168
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,000
this is this is the beginning this is
when you start looking at this stuff got

169
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,370
are

170
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:52,220
really as a holistic

171
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:57,890
issues along the way that happen with
this a invalid HTTP versions is a

172
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:58,740
brilliant one

173
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:02,420
so HTTP goes up to 1.1

174
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:07,440
so you can send one point a

175
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,090
bypass taxing analysis what is the
seventy

176
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:15,550
has fuckin support one point a tell you
what you probably mean 1.1

177
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:18,620
he is the resource what what

178
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,770
long surpass fashion houses

179
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:24,780
all the stops played out and out and out
again

180
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:29,260
this is the beginning you know you've
got to love the IPS industry

181
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:32,310
it folks all and what does it do

182
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:36,160
it produces a new product and goes to
market with it we call this protocol

183
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,210
normalization

184
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:40,980
we'll talk about that a little man as
well the protocols

185
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:45,610
are complex known director self
referencing worked against

186
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:51,470
IDS is all the shit commonplace problem
is

187
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:55,560
is there

188
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,040
we have all these problems here and then
we have is the

189
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,320
our season written by people remember
this and sometimes they're not very good

190
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,850
at defining what they say and what they
want to say so we end up having

191
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:07,839
protocols on

192
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,589
clearly-defined if you go through RFC

193
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:16,360
okay and you see an area it's not
clearly defined to the implementer

194
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,380
K come to a penny

195
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:23,500
network invasion technique in there
somewhere because once you leave the

196
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,829
implement a to make their own mind up
guess what they all

197
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:31,060
fucking do it differently and then we
talk about implementers

198
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:35,660
we're talking about Microsoft we're
talking about UNIX

199
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:38,899
you know this TCP IP stack is an
implementer

200
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:42,870
who had gray areas in the RC my okay

201
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:48,920
the middle of the different interesting
this differences between stocks

202
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,470
the No not saying you can't move nike
stock

203
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:56,209
from windows and how they behave the
same way they behave inherently

204
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:56,829
different

205
00:12:56,829 --> 00:12:59,829
have different like at moes basically

206
00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:03,070
which is interesting

207
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:06,260
because you should have these gray areas
like you can

208
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:10,390
overwrite segments in TCP okay

209
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,810
so now proposing to protocols

210
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:17,110
TCP I P so

211
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:21,269
you overwrite you might want to change
your data stream a transit when she sent

212
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:22,290
some packaging Michael

213
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:25,410
some things change and I need update

214
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:29,070
of course the protocols robots protocol

215
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:32,560
allows you to do that I'm a coalition
overlapping

216
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,519
said okay so we can be my update your
new danger

217
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:40,269
the RFC did not quite clearly define

218
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:43,829
in black and white which takes
precedence

219
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:47,779
if you got all day some new data which
is the most important data

220
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:51,699
Council panning you know exactly what
happened

221
00:13:51,699 --> 00:13:55,100
they broke different interpretation

222
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,760
which led to the situation where if you
had a window system

223
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:03,009
and you sent overlapping fragments

224
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,819
faded old over New Windows

225
00:14:04,819 --> 00:14:08,759
always favor the ok date or new data

226
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:12,709
to you in the middle we have this IPS
shuttle %uh politicians going on

227
00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:17,819
and it doesn't know it is a Windows
system is being talked to or not you

228
00:14:17,819 --> 00:14:18,350
know this is

229
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:21,419
you know early days should want that
shit quite

230
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:25,410
your so what we can do that as we can
start

231
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:28,999
camouflage our pockets because

232
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:33,379
we know and as an attacker we've known
we speak into our

233
00:14:33,379 --> 00:14:37,189
apache server on a Linux system we know
that

234
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:42,069
fuckin system we know that the ICAST so
then we can start to

235
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:46,329
tight messages because we know the IPS
restructured things in a certain way

236
00:14:46,329 --> 00:14:50,499
critics not clearly defined so straight
away

237
00:14:50,499 --> 00:14:53,859
we've already got two issues before
we've even kicked off before we've even

238
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:54,600
look to

239
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,529
other interesting issues and talk with
us we call this press corps

240
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:01,799
ambiguity I'm a pro goals ambiguous

241
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:07,470
I so this is not just a case for this is
no

242
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:11,359
which which flag takes precedence is not
clearly the fights on

243
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:15,470
an IP header with overlook contract
overlap second TCP

244
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:18,939
you can set some freaky head is that

245
00:15:18,939 --> 00:15:22,160
given certain conditions should be
dropped the IPS

246
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,369
doesn't check those all sudden you can
start to

247
00:15:26,369 --> 00:15:29,439
make the IPSC one thing like the
rope-a-dope

248
00:15:29,439 --> 00:15:33,429
you know you just show them happen with
the Left Behind exactly what's happening

249
00:15:33,429 --> 00:15:33,789
here

250
00:15:33,789 --> 00:15:39,709
the

251
00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:43,199
the there's if you guys are interested
in this stuff

252
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,350
or if you have a need to like if you're
insomniacs you need to get some

253
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:50,500
sleep give me now I've got books on this
ship that could

254
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,860
fucking bore you to death is why these

255
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:59,230
not much my soul left but this is all
based phones and conserving

256
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:03,760
received literally this is a big issue
now of course the uses one

257
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:08,420
yes its defenders this is the last thing
you want you want predictability because

258
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,850
we do in a science-based

259
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:15,190
discipline okay it's not supposed to be
black magic and voodoo

260
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:19,209
names post it's a pro corresponds to
know what's gonna happen

261
00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:26,260
the IPS doesn't have the option gotta
then

262
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:30,240
let's talk about black frock and
fragmentation attacks

263
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,339
are my god so this starts kicking out
about 2,000

264
00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:38,660
this bears group about that so to give
you some historical context just come

265
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,670
back for second I'm

266
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:44,480
coming to you like use Necto

267
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,730
direct result but P technicians research

268
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:54,579
the Briscoe so all this stuff all these
tasty TP evasion techniques

269
00:16:54,579 --> 00:16:58,240
you can test right now but

270
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,860
which owns the you're already using just
like first hit

271
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:06,419
man nicked up know I did that just me so
good

272
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:10,910
so the beloved Steve Lord 44.com on
street mean Sat

273
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:14,829
the night is called the one in front
pocket fragmentation

274
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:17,890
about out response to him was spoke
often still using them

275
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:21,209
the problem is is this is absolutely
true okay

276
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:24,429
soft-core tricks its

277
00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:27,850
grew IDS is up all the time and a half
done

278
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:31,799
for like a decade we still haven't fixed
it

279
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:35,870
psat way still talking about my DS's I'm
gonna keep on talking about intellect

280
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:36,730
complex

281
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:42,620
six years have been talking about a ship
nothing's changed I just might own shit

282
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,340
is new again

283
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,360
jar mean it happens all the time on it
segue

284
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,600
this we figure in my opinion that

285
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,340
and itv4 and what happens is you can
implement a

286
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,630
the they be introduced this issue into
ipv6

287
00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:00,040
I we fix the problem with you

288
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,730
ipv6 sheik ok don't sit with the pain

289
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:08,160
company is called much the same case
here

290
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,110
the let me make an issue because

291
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:15,730
the pro the RC allows is to implement
things

292
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:20,520
with our own interpretation we make a
mistake

293
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:24,010
we'll actually fix it all we do is
perhaps you so when they come to

294
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:24,680
implement

295
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:28,080
TCPIP or I P or ICMP

296
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,860
on a new stock I mean I'm clearly
defined in the protocol

297
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:37,230
guess what we don't learn from history
we just started just doesn't happen

298
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:41,130
this is what happens of ok

299
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:46,030
it's working now there's no test cases
here you fucking system's down next

300
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:49,270
but this happens all time

301
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:53,350
trust me many start looking about at
this you'll be surprised

302
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:56,830
by how much happens this old versus new
issue

303
00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:03,860
we really need to use understands the
situation I'm gonna hear from you very

304
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,550
often

305
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:09,920
okay and if you know anyone a source
fire Cisco or checkpoint don't ever tell

306
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,100
them I said this to you

307
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,980
people feel a little bit sorry for them
at this point okay

308
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:19,950
because at the moment cannot judit

309
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:23,700
they have protocols are clearly defined
they have

310
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,430
protocols the multitude berries

311
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:30,680
different ways that you used the
protocol a different stocks

312
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,890
how we implement a and then

313
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:37,860
let's talk about will just completely
fucking ignore the RFC

314
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:43,460
that's always a lot of fun soul we need
two examples of this happening

315
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:47,250
the first one I'm gonna who I won't
raise your hands again

316
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,790
the oceans torn meniscus are no one ever
put stands at the moment in ensuring

317
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,130
people into the hands of my

318
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:54,300
you

319
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,790
you definitely accion right

320
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:00,530
have you heard of it hands up if you
heard of it

321
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:05,070
use well right how do you stay

322
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:10,650
you know I'll right right degree I'm
style

323
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:16,710
so Bay how many viewers follow someone
on Twitter that you suspect there

324
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:20,060
let me get this fuckin little tweak like

325
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:23,810
sex is what forced easy past think

326
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:27,180
we see this all the time I so if it does

327
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:30,970
the pic like you going to say you
connecting connected to the site's

328
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:34,090
okay gonna upload my treat my share

329
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:37,880
and what happens is is that that goes it
does it's cloudy

330
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:43,830
fuckin social media thing will you
unfortunately

331
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:47,790
the developers at FIT Bay did not
conform RFC standards

332
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:52,270
so get so when you're making a request

333
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:55,780
you have a user agent string this is
quite clearly defined in the protocol

334
00:20:55,780 --> 00:21:00,610
right well they did so what happened is
a local organizations with a lot of

335
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:01,080
stuff

336
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,590
so OK now where alerts

337
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:09,300
wouldn't send the site the fire trucks
because the side the Chinese are coming

338
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:14,300
woop woop woop woop malware malware
malware turns out now

339
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:18,310
just lost it uses because the fact that
uses the

340
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,690
back the developers were conforming to
the standard

341
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:25,880
then put the user agent string n you
know who else was like but user agent

342
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,190
strings in their software

343
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:31,560
malware office surprise surprise

344
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,450
so then we have a developer completely
out of the Comptroller

345
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:39,860
Beach snake-oil vendors completely out
of their control

346
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:43,970
doing stuff that doesn't conform to the
standards well

347
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:48,330
let's not get the violin out for that
the world's smallest violin

348
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:51,710
out for the IDS friend is just yet so

349
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:56,180
it was discovered so the protocol for IP
is pretty clear

350
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:59,810
if you company in Bali checks on

351
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:01,330
you drop the

352
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:05,350
ACA K when it was discovered by some

353
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:09,730
spurious stripes what they could do is
they could send a mock pockets

354
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:13,410
and guess what this where you think the
IPS find his cock on

355
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:22,600
they were not checking the IP check sums

356
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,990
the run throughs okay

357
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:28,460
roads get bad run so

358
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:32,480
the one second when checking the
accu-chek some so what we could do

359
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:38,809
is we could be put in spurious nintey
sticker on your fuck sake

360
00:22:38,809 --> 00:22:42,620
some badass coil a map thing I

361
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:48,170
banks

362
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:50,640
expect in X mother fuckers from here

363
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,320
so I can't accept Mike by checking it
would pay an extra pack as we can

364
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:01,860
camouflage what's going on right clearly
defined in the promo code clearly

365
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:06,220
drop welcome packet and they did then do
it and I paid the price for that

366
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:10,860
which is blinding your ideas you know
this billion while

367
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:16,610
now presumed to be nearly 2.9 billion a
year blinding it´s fuckin protocol

368
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:19,740
we've only just got to network with only

369
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,850
one layer here right really done
anything

370
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:26,390
that's hacking through right now this is
just

371
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:30,680
all of ok about the protocol if you got
IPS

372
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:34,600
the you look after follows the shit out
other write a

373
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:39,390
just but bus all day every day just
don't do it from you test machine I P

374
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,380
kisses go up to

375
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:43,500
defection you might have to wait a
little while

376
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,550
so we have this issue

377
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:50,040
and as I said earlier on you quote tool
of

378
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:53,190
IPS vendors scamper the problem

379
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:56,440
they're making combined a little bit
with ours

380
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:01,190
what they did Islam they didn't stick
their hands up and say

381
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:06,570
where wrong no what they did is they
went back to the drawing board in mind

382
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,940
meh protocol normalization

383
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:13,320
we've got a new product all OVR

384
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:20,040
en ligne devices

385
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,309
I'll need lights okay

386
00:24:21,309 --> 00:24:24,390
school to talk myself

387
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:27,919
I've been told that when that's on its
my tournament that's official term

388
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,780
so my efforts go off again

389
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:34,830
so big produce a new product you know

390
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:39,950
in line protocol normalization how many
have you had experience with this

391
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:43,880
me know I'm talking about when I talk
about protocol normalization

392
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,540
how many have you seen maxi n aliens

393
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:52,900
where directly says unique nuke it from
orbit it's the only way to be sure

394
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:56,270
that is protocol normalization

395
00:24:56,270 --> 00:25:01,140
okay and I will explain why solve these
issues

396
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:04,390
skipping perhaps the defense's is
because we don't know

397
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:08,840
what the endpoint yes right to this
different ways that we can talk to

398
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,799
different endpoints

399
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:13,419
so some smart guy and IPS world when

400
00:25:13,419 --> 00:25:16,860
we should totally be the endpoint animal
analyze

401
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:21,650
day because they me know what we're
sending out to the endpoint the kinda

402
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:25,220
nuke it from orbit two issues with this
first and foremost

403
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:29,010
you can only normalize protocols if
you're in mining

404
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:33,220
K doesn't work if you're a passive
member of the network

405
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:37,660
cost you passive not even the most
passive aggressive person to do an issue

406
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,340
at this point

407
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:42,679
and secondly these welcome people that
do not

408
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:45,760
read RF sees rewriting

409
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,280
data streams on your network that guilty

410
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,309
ignoring a defined clear stand it

411
00:25:53,309 --> 00:25:56,710
we did some research

412
00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:00,100
a bow I a numerator IPS is

413
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,370
I am not really in your Marie IPS is
what you do is you

414
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:06,940
and %um right the the signatures

415
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:11,490
this who gives a fuck what the IPS
actually is at good for I care about how

416
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:11,980
you

417
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:15,760
interpret a practice don't care if
you're a Cisco

418
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,039
Sourcefire

419
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:21,179
or Kinross reply why care about is the
rules that you're doing

420
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:24,519
so we did some tests about how we can
you make this year

421
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:28,419
and we did this practical normalization

422
00:26:28,419 --> 00:26:31,579
is so easy to pick up with unbelievable

423
00:26:31,579 --> 00:26:34,609
so engine a solution here

424
00:26:34,609 --> 00:26:39,289
there is a we call these insurgent
attacks were you answer

425
00:26:39,289 --> 00:26:43,199
extra pockets into the data stream
knowing that the IPS sexy

426
00:26:43,199 --> 00:26:47,259
I one picture not the other picture so

427
00:26:47,259 --> 00:26:50,629
some spirit times discovered

428
00:26:50,629 --> 00:26:55,349
that what they could do is they could
produce a data stream with one hot last

429
00:26:55,349 --> 00:26:56,509
destination

430
00:26:56,509 --> 00:27:00,029
so the IPS would see this day belonged
pilot pockets

431
00:27:00,029 --> 00:27:03,099
all its okay just downloaded the Windows
Update

432
00:27:03,099 --> 00:27:06,159
by the time the packets get the

433
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,569
all the camouflage is dropped because is
one hot

434
00:27:09,569 --> 00:27:12,659
sure host Wow what what

435
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:18,299
long you know bingo got your so the guy
still you know we should totally do you

436
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:18,669
ship

437
00:27:18,669 --> 00:27:23,289
hariri right time to lives to people
like me are able to put pockets

438
00:27:23,289 --> 00:27:24,199
internetwork

439
00:27:24,199 --> 00:27:29,179
and then with like trying to live a full
and I'm gonna watch it suddenly

440
00:27:29,179 --> 00:27:32,259
p become 8 and go %uh

441
00:27:32,259 --> 00:27:35,749
you use in source file okay

442
00:27:35,749 --> 00:27:39,229
because he's a clearly defined what they
do in these situations we can send

443
00:27:39,229 --> 00:27:40,769
packets in an ordered structure

444
00:27:40,769 --> 00:27:44,379
i watch so fire reorder them %ah

445
00:27:44,379 --> 00:27:48,769
I've got this rolling gauged as well I'm
totally gonna change my attack

446
00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:51,999
now because I know that you can't do
this but I know you

447
00:27:51,999 --> 00:27:55,709
lookin good at this so let's leave now
and let's push here

448
00:27:55,709 --> 00:28:00,379
that's what we want to do you know what

449
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:03,519
I'm not having anything you don't know I
mean I'm probably tell you some

450
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:07,609
nice anecdotes maybe make you think
about when you text me an IPS

451
00:28:07,609 --> 00:28:11,419
you might be now me some funny stories
as this one was

452
00:28:11,419 --> 00:28:15,729
you know York's at detection d when your
friend push up the middle of the day

453
00:28:15,729 --> 00:28:20,159
and says dude June never gonna fucking
believe I've just heard

454
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,199
playset I was in a cost to me

455
00:28:24,199 --> 00:28:27,769
with the Senior Network Administrator
and they've been having some

456
00:28:27,769 --> 00:28:29,740
issues with the law

457
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:32,030
on their IPS okay

458
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:35,770
so he advised them that they should

459
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:39,300
SSL encrypted all the traffic to take a
load off the IPS

460
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:43,480
okay let me just

461
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,420
clear this up for you okay all the
traffic

462
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:51,560
is completely blind to the IPS normal
load issues

463
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:58,710
more false positives no more true
positives either I think that we're all

464
00:28:58,710 --> 00:28:59,940
a point where we can fit

465
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:04,550
clearly fairly say the may be using SSL
is a load balancer

466
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:07,650
is not such a bad thing nowadays you
know

467
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:11,080
maybe is fit for purpose but us

468
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,840
why not think green mother fucker turn
the thing off right

469
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,100
if you gonna do shit like this just
unplug a

470
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:22,210
you know well loretta right how many
have you

471
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:26,600
are involved in the PCI industry is
packing

472
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:31,820
up mean not no disrespect but the PCI
industry requires you to have a third

473
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,100
party applications gonna

474
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:36,340
and ideas or web OPP

475
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:40,760
whatever you fucking want to call it
right third-party applications gonna

476
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:45,650
not Iran from a third party this country
application to ship detection system in

477
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:46,250
other words

478
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:50,030
K also requires you not to break into
some funnel

479
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:53,660
you can break in a cell phone on the
certain requirements

480
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:56,980
but pretty hard and having so long story
short

481
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:01,680
must have a detection system cannot
break the time to look what's inside

482
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:05,150
been quick to traffic okay I'm gonna

483
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:09,560
point the obvious out to you but that
fuckin sucks

484
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:13,490
because you have and kept and point

485
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:16,590
and cryptic and point encrypt to traffic

486
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:20,080
IPS we don't get any false positives

487
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,570
ok in any true positive either you know
and this

488
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:27,910
this happens to be more more more more
than you would like to believe

489
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:30,930
I constantly if someone says to you

490
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:34,930
that the IPS doesn't get any false
positives

491
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:37,380
I can assure you that they ok

492
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:40,720
configured it wrong right if you have a
IPS

493
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,970
know how many false positives is because
someone's unplugged a

494
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:47,630
Friday so

495
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:51,830
encrypt eternal encrypt a tunnel IPS
trust me it to talk to people in the

496
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:52,320
world

497
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:57,520
go buying ammunition right now one
people that know exactly what's going on

498
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,580
at this point in like

499
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:02,870
PCI compliant and another bunch a people
that go

500
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:07,570
have no idea what this man is saying I
mean do you think actually to

501
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:11,580
more than you'd like to believe against
me

502
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:16,400
so much two-handed oh I have mother
fucker with another mother fucker

503
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,640
that's how my dad makes okay

504
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,750
it just does it

505
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:26,090
looking how much money we wasting

506
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:29,200
on this shit honestly

507
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,270
so if you're like a few the people on
the PCA Council

508
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:37,150
right instead of saying we should have a
fair play applications Connor

509
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:40,430
you should say you need to have a Reg
the detection rate

510
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:43,750
right watch the game change overnight

511
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:47,200
so we talked about the fine protocols

512
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,620
we've talked about people ignoring
protocols

513
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:55,240
we've talked about protocols are being
clear we've talked about

514
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:59,940
fuckery in the middle we've talked about
using Pro cost impost on the protocols

515
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:03,120
and I we could up a little bit ago don't
really quickly here

516
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,200
now less interject something that's a
lot of fun

517
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,750
de facto protocols

518
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:16,400
so even if you can read there's anything
to ok im read

519
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,600
the factor brokaw's what i mean but
factor protocols

520
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:24,020
the CrPC not defined in RFC

521
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:28,150
musical amasau PCR believe it was for a
while

522
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:31,900
so we have the situation

523
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:35,380
that happens god bless on Flickr

524
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:38,690
got blacks and isolate 67 I'm not sure
if I miss

525
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,970
John McAfee more I'm SOA 67

526
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:46,420
a low sec to be honest with you i'ma so
a 67

527
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:49,700
we would never be able to do damage
conferences if it wasn't for this

528
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,910
protocol but this pro collect a little
bit if I D S research

529
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:56,260
because what we discovered

530
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:59,580
is that you know when you don't clearly
define a protocol

531
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:04,280
it's kinda hard to write signatures for
a with the problem is

532
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:09,220
in the case that SMB how many you

533
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:14,150
use axe Mb and Copeland fuckin
corporations love this shit

534
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:17,830
who woulda thunk a the Colts want to
share

535
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:21,960
documents with each other we use

536
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:27,340
fuckin breaking protocol for shifted
some if you ask how hard it is to make

537
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:31,830
right reverse engineer paper caused the
SNB case just as the Sun but guys

538
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:34,900
okay I know if you have them

539
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:41,170
animals like the week I know exactly why
this is something Kisha and

540
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:46,070
oh my god so these innovations to be
seein SMB easier ones that you can find

541
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:46,820
a match played

542
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:51,190
as one speck on stuff that you can get
your hands on now okay

543
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:55,340
I'm not going to talk about SMB pipe I
read right because I've spent five years

544
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,500
talking about this

545
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:01,100
I can google it right it's a clusterfuck
every situation

546
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,350
a I can totally 8

547
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:08,990
hell I could tell from a TCP stream that
you're using Metasploit

548
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:13,120
because this thing is turned on by
default and there's no way to turn off

549
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,560
so soon as I see these hanky pockets
come along

550
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:22,470
the don't conform to documentation about
how you should stop in SMB communication

551
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:25,909
you know that the only tiny bit
documentation and much love gives us

552
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:29,830
you know lookin that's happening pasty
discovered a

553
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:33,360
a but I guess patient acting and he was
like

554
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:38,490
with who I wrote a maternal shown by
default get rich or die tryin

555
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:43,850
problems that's why is that and also
called a document and shit like if u

556
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:47,280
right module do hope documentation

557
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,950
understand how things work is a little
bit different but it's reset kinda takes

558
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:52,450
place

559
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:55,580
from I situation we had

560
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,849
about four years ago

561
00:34:57,849 --> 00:35:01,690
with the band I have totally trolled for
a long time

562
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:06,910
storms of I'm they've released like 300
art

563
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:11,079
i DIII months evasion techniques ADT's

564
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:15,109
haha ATG all susceptible to it

565
00:35:15,109 --> 00:35:18,170
shit industry shot a break

566
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:21,369
right and well

567
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:25,670
wasn't months the patient acne con tell
you responsible disclosure

568
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:29,970
me like gay do know that we'd like to
detect like

569
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:33,589
me detection right yes two hundred and
book combat

570
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:37,940
dude over we can be detected but shit
your foot

571
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:41,160
give us some information responsible
disclosure

572
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:45,049
welcomes CV ease and looking for
anything in them

573
00:35:45,049 --> 00:35:48,450
gotta love em well it turns out

574
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:51,609
that wall

575
00:35:51,609 --> 00:35:55,109
and advanced evasion techniques case you
take up

576
00:35:55,109 --> 00:35:59,369
fucking own to beijing techni and I'm
really old evasions hanging

577
00:35:59,369 --> 00:36:03,069
you put them together you call them in
months the Beijing technique you like

578
00:36:03,069 --> 00:36:04,359
you're mocking she

579
00:36:04,359 --> 00:36:08,710
going to the rush to the work review we
were the first to discover them

580
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:12,359
know you welcome one RMS 1 2006

581
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:15,789
you can use more than one evasion tech
now

582
00:36:15,789 --> 00:36:19,410
the reason that most systems and get
tested

583
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:22,710
for advanced evasion techniques is quite
simple

584
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:25,710
really review whether testis

585
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:29,329
because abdication of Europe's

586
00:36:29,329 --> 00:36:33,059
cation is obscure right more education
you use

587
00:36:33,059 --> 00:36:37,049
tends to look a little bit fucking where
who thought that coming

588
00:36:37,049 --> 00:36:40,130
you know to

589
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:43,619
I at the benefit speaking with one of
their researches

590
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:48,140
a little while ago I was a fun
compensation I

591
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:52,080
the more lines he said to me were your
victim by marking she

592
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:57,050
so I don't feel like a victim right now
you like this when

593
00:36:57,050 --> 00:37:01,609
but on and what it is is a certain I
know quite clearly that you have been

594
00:37:01,609 --> 00:37:02,099
wracked

595
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:05,790
the achilles heel detection systems so
what how do you know that

596
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:10,460
because it clearly states that very
amazing technique that you use

597
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:15,270
when you saw at the mall your detection
service increases by six-fold

598
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:20,500
so what happened is he see this DC ERP
see

599
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,770
fragmentation style small the fucking
shit the canal

600
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:27,050
this is the CrPC 34 systems apps

601
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:32,109
know anymore up the use like TCP
segmentation

602
00:37:32,109 --> 00:37:35,710
which snow are really fucking good

603
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:39,700
so all of a sudden you see where I'm
going with this

604
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:43,270
if that he just left the attack the DC
RPC fragmentation

605
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:48,220
it would have been detected but they put
the TCP segmentation and guess what

606
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:52,540
they detected a the surface gets bigger
and bigger and bigger

607
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:57,180
more shit you at to it six times
apartment and

608
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:00,980
their electric yeah to missus and PDF

609
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:05,140
yes please then they released in free
after that so

610
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:08,420
but helps occasions obscure K

611
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:11,760
you do lots about case like those in
Dubai about tested

612
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,349
right if you do you like more than two
obfuscation to either your

613
00:38:15,349 --> 00:38:19,300
attack is not working all some fucking
homes going up somewhere and if they

614
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:19,760
don't

615
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:25,109
man discuss that checking your winning
think so

616
00:38:25,109 --> 00:38:29,820
good old stones of and its top economic
to go back class eloise now

617
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:33,190

distribution network apparently

625
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:04,080
but when he realizes

626
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:07,180
John McAfee's knob at fucking insane
don't you bro

627
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:11,220
write a even he wouldn't do this crazy
stuff

628
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:15,020
now I get us reports about about it and
I

629
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:18,460
ever not gonna have to give my opinion
on stuff the best one is

630
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:22,310
what do you think about the the Maccabi

631
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:26,290
and I'm like I have known fucking idea
but what I can tell you is

632
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:30,580
they purchase detection system company
acid detection system coming

633
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:34,660
that's just been purchased by processing
company and

634
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:38,070
there's going to be pushing in the
middle and yeah thats

635
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:41,180
gonna be fun because this lots of
changes going on

636
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:44,750
meanwhile John market to get his name
back so

637
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:49,500
a mentor John men of course we have this
interesting in

638
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:53,590
issue of Sourcefire a 200 million euros
who

639
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:57,760
but payday you know as good as 2.7
billion dollars though is it

640
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,570
national just like a hateful have a
second on Cisco

641
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:06,380
and I catch 22 hang on

642
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:10,060
why are we seeing IPS fenders buying

643
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:14,030
no one's and believe it or not so
spyware no company

644
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:17,670
to be honest with you they kept

645
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:20,770
paid doe loadings people get pay

646
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:24,050
11 years before checkpoint right by

647
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:29,010
I Sourcefire $225 million dollars

648
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:33,870
I was inflation the price do you know
how

649
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:37,090
you increase your net worth

650
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:40,450
by an eleven thousand percent in seven
years

651
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:44,110
you become an IDS fun because

652
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:47,900
Cisco go and buy them for overpriced
stock market value

653
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,070
a 2.7 there we

654
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:53,550
hatch bone take that to the bank

655
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:57,780
who people ask me what do you think is
gonna happen with

656
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:01,240
source file all water point was gonna
happen personal

657
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:05,200
so phoenix gets his crystal ball out

658
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,090
okay gonna by the Manhattan communities
in

659
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:13,640
I'll try and the septic in and come see
the future my sees a

660
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,730
I don't anyone except that which
discusses goes like a

661
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:20,150
cooking oil tanker right but they don't
turn quickly

662
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:24,020
I everything is Laurel like a

663
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:28,260
Cisco diarrhea realize the NSA fuckin do
shit to them until they saw the pictures

664
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,120
in fuckin

665
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:32,980
like on the Internet which shit fuckin

666
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:36,200
dhol they didn't know ok and what he say

667
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,500
think they're too big to know what was
going on well i think is gonna happen

668
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,580
source file auction or more to the point

669
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:44,730
is this normal is not gonna be closed
down by Cisco

670
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:48,750
the Republican is a situation where
against out to the community

671
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:52,800
much like Oracle date where OpenOffice
Bob Loblaw

672
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:57,730
K what do we worry about rules we will
see in loans would probably gonna see

673
00:41:57,730 --> 00:41:58,780
Cisco stop

674
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:01,810
doing moons for snow

675
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:05,610
but we're gonna see lots of ancillary
businesses pop-up that will write

676
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:09,150
specific group s like matching threats
and so on and so forth

677
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:13,160
SAR we want you to do some scholarship
for is his X amount we want a monthly

678
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,490
subscription for stardom stuff to the
dump

679
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:22,400
we'll probably see an increase in action
you talk about

680
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:27,990
one more story quickly so I love what we
do but detection systems is

681
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:31,210
based on the paper and the late
seventies

682
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:36,560
call the common intrusion detection
framework as is really cool ruling it

683
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,300
that makes the most sense when she text
something you should always fucking

684
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:40,890
detector

685
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:45,180
right he detected once you should detect
a million times

686
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:49,730
thank not a lot to ask for is a okay

687
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:53,470
so welcome to IPS spend the club

688
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:57,059
the cartel right

689
00:42:57,059 --> 00:43:00,650
3.3 per throughput throughput throughput
3.3 per

690
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:04,289
a pretty much just save you time
listening to any idea splendid package

691
00:43:04,289 --> 00:43:07,569
right known talks about tax rates who

692
00:43:07,569 --> 00:43:11,670
first love I P S Club is don't talk
about tax rates second invite the

693
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:12,980
established sheesh

694
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:16,410
talk about texan's her

695
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:19,930
throughput throughput throughput so
there is a Banda

696
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:23,410
he thinks is a really good idea to
buffer

697
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:26,890
have a system the buffers alston popular
threats

698
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:31,900
by looking fantastic through per
thousand popular fraps

699
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:35,670
so what you think happens when you
popular

700
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:39,440
right comes onto the market to the one
on the and

701
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:45,440
got somewhere you detect trackback let
me get this right to you what you were

702
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,220
detected

703
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:49,579
six months ago does not necessarily mean
you can be picking up

704
00:43:49,579 --> 00:43:53,960
anymore you know the invasion technique
here you should own ship

705
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:59,000
a you gonna find all boxes nothing about
this when a cop pick up shit

706
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:04,690
PCI compliant no I mean really as in all
aboard the fail

707
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:08,130
the trust me if you want to hear from
our stories I've gotten to my my ass

708
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:15,079
I all applaud the fuckin fell copter on
this one kill chain

709
00:44:15,079 --> 00:44:20,630
my god so I'm going up up really quickly
with us on the coach is fucking awesome

710
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:25,500
so how many have you know what the coach
anus

711
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:29,589
Ryan home and you guys are so much fun
to come

712
00:44:29,589 --> 00:44:33,820
shooting at the ship shut down your
throat this is like NextGen

713
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:38,530
2.0 love our industry Ryan decided to
kill chain

714
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:42,000
trademark I was very disappointed find
out the side to kill chain

715
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,680
did not kill all the site is ball

716
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:50,030
lockheed martin and the somewhat with
the military

717
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:54,530
you seen that coming and the military
have this thing called coaching

718
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:57,960
his you gotta love the military to
fucking reflex

719
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:01,970
killing other people or legal insurgents
and wherever you want call

720
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:05,700
and that what I discovered is it's not
just the case

721
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:10,000
shoes you need to go and tell each put
boots on the ground

722
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,640
you need to get him that need to buy
them guns need to give them bullets

723
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:16,880
he took an Intel right and all along the
way

724
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:21,050
the steps and if you don't safeguard the
steps

725
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:24,119
you don't get to kill the bad guy

726
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:27,869
all the legal a surge in a way I have a
column in today night don't get to do it

727
00:45:27,869 --> 00:45:31,230
because tobacco disruptive what he also
did

728
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:35,099
sort out what's what to change that's
really good for defense

729
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:38,910
because the bad guy niece get gongs

730
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:41,910
needs to get bullets Lisa and tell me to
get bodies me some

731
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:44,970
pull the trigger shoot them if we break
all these things

732
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:48,980
very very hard for bad guys the killers
write a

733
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:52,720
well keep mine come along the way you
trademark I was the case I been tryna

734
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,680
and Happy Days payday

735
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:58,730
rightness exactly what happened because
it turns out and attacks

736
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:02,740
exactly the same thing happens the you
need to be profiled

737
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:07,770
you need to get Intel eat again exploits
you feel like any command control

738
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:10,980
all these points in very very good
places

739
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:14,490
Indic did to detect or indicate some

740
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:17,530
threatens coming so rather then

741
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:21,760
as usual East kinda manpower make the
world a little bit better we trade Monta

742
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:26,410
and now like probably on the Royal if
speaking about it something but that's

743
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:27,280
what we're at

744
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,660
the finance

745
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:35,550
in the end the real problem the IDS
always happens you can get context-aware

746
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:36,460
shut down from

747
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:43,710
is any context context contact the
problem is we don't need more beta

748
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:47,360
right this is a real issue you really
don't need no one day and why don't we

749
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:48,220
need more day a

750
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:51,940
you can eat talking big about if we
carry on write a

751
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:56,060
the in the end all the stuff that we
need to know

752
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:59,250
to be able to talk about Press the
actually already logged in how

753
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:04,180
you know we just don't do a lot refusal
don't keep the data long enough to do it

754
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:07,580
K so we don't need any about wrapping up

755
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:11,590
i watch but the slide in Somerset way
they said

756
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:15,860
for 2014 in a fucking good year for us
okay

757
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:19,470
I mean if you don't get paid this year

758
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:23,620
write a your business models Sox because
there's been enough mark infers out

759
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:24,020
there

760
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:27,220
that we should be doing things better I
am

761
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:30,280
you gotta love our industry we felt we
get paid you pretty much said that

762
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:30,960
yesterday

763
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,670
I we don't get paid for you get your
paper when we get paid for losing

764
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:40,350
with a fork in my game showcase of run
important part but we managed to gather

765
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:45,750
I guess renders there but let's stop I
will protect you from

766
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:50,470
all the known APT 0 days and then who
goes to go

767
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:54,640
that's exactly ideas find is

768
00:47:54,640 --> 00:48:01,079
