1
00:00:08,389 --> 00:00:08,750
with

2
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:09,850
ordered the tonsils

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,950
bag Bali does

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:16,129
alright well welcome to stop

5
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:19,080
heatmaps by security visualization is so
hard

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,029
right up front heat map is what you see
here

7
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:27,689
just so everybody is seen that on

8
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:30,699
don't let my action for you I might
sound like an American but

9
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:34,339
actually was born and raised here in
Switzerland moved to Silicon Valley

10
00:00:34,339 --> 00:00:34,860
about you

11
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,220
eleven years ago and now live in
beautiful San Francisco

12
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,899
I've been doing data analysis

13
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:45,940
log analysis and visualization for about
the past 15 years of my career

14
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,739
I worked at all kinda companies like
ArcSight Splunk

15
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:53,809
which you might have heard of started a
company called loudly at some point

16
00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:56,870
and for the past three years been
running around

17
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,960
site starting my next company which is
cool pics the cloud in

18
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,080
so I love what we do and showing you
here as so the research that

19
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,660
goes into that now this is nothing new

20
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:11,740
you all know attacks have changed lately
motivations of change

21
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,140
not just the script kiddies anymore that
we have to worry about but it's

22
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,600
nation stages its criminal organizations
that make

23
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,899
real lotta money by hacking into our
systems by stealing information

24
00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:26,810
but the one thing I want to highlight
here on this side is that

25
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,989
why so much of security

26
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:34,420
has fielded in the detection rail is
because you're trying to learn from past

27
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,349
knowledge

28
00:01:35,349 --> 00:01:38,349
your billing systems today that

29
00:01:38,349 --> 00:01:42,530
are relying on signatures EFI are things
that we know about the past

30
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:45,959
and you believe that they gonna happen
again going forward

31
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:50,069
so looking at attacks it's very unlikely
that

32
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:53,629
really motivated attackers gonna break
into your organization just the way he

33
00:01:53,629 --> 00:01:55,520
is going to break into the next
organization

34
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,119
it's going to be very specific to to
your organization so we need to build

35
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,000
systems

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,119
that scale better in terms of the
different capabilities to have to it

37
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:07,619
to detect these attacks and not just
rely on past knowledge the network-based

38
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:10,660
intrusion detection systems are probably
not the way to find

39
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:15,239
tomorrow's latest attack if you look at
some numbers

40
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:19,150
on this really frightening I stole a
buncha these

41
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:23,830
statistics from different research and
was really surprised me was from the

42
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:27,580
I'm engine report where they showed that
33 percent

43
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,840
are

44
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,450
breaches at companies were detected
internally so they had some systems in

45
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,090
place

46
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:39,220
to actually texted tax but two-thirds
all the attacks the company's

47
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:44,099
where somehow reported by outsiders
external people that might be to reflect

48
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:47,209
a threat feeders something like that or
someone calling in take a

49
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:51,220
we get attacked by your machines what's
going on that is really frightening

50
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,440
we're doing something wrong with
cybersecurity we can't even detect our

51
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,680
own attacks internally

52
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,140
if you look at these other numbers
they're even worse 222

53
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,459
to 129 days the average debt they found

54
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:06,700
hackers to be in your systems are ready
before he got detected

55
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:11,269
imagine what you can do if you own a
network for 21 in 30 days

56
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:14,060
there's a lot of stuff you can do you
get if you can take your time you don't

57
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:14,579
have to

58
00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:20,269
to rush into anything arm and then an
annual loss of 7.2 million dollars

59
00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:23,390
there's a lot of product that you can
sell to accompany on

60
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:26,989
if you want to start your own company to
do that so

61
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:30,920
what I want to talk about today I saw
the pics three goals

62
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,010
that i won a chief if the technology I
wanna show you which is

63
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:37,810
we want to find insurers a new attacks
stuff we have you don't know about we

64
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:38,870
have no idea

65
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:42,870
how these guys going to our network so
what they're doing I wanna find

66
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,630
exposures early and I want to
communicate my findings to other people

67
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:50,239
I just I don't want to ship a terabyte a
log files to you and say here's the

68
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,569
proof that things happen here is how it
happened so

69
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:58,239
the approach them taking is basically
I'm saying well

70
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,900
and taking a whole lotta data on
collecting from my network from packet

71
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,440
captures proxies

72
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,700
anti-virus whatever you have and I want
to visualize that stuff to start finding

73
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,780
interesting patterns

74
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,510
the problem is this is gonna be over a
terabyte of data

75
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:16,130
and generally if you throw in some kind
of visualization you end up with

76
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,180
something like this is

77
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,280
which is a hairball now if you actually
look

78
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,700
if you actually generate a graph it look
something like this:

79
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,270
it is really hard to interpret this if
not impossible

80
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:30,010
still

81
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:33,810
the first conclusion is already security
visualization is hard how do we generate

82
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:34,530
a graph

83
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:38,640
or some visualization a bit error by the
data that actually communicate something

84
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,500
well let's start the basics

85
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,880
we can take different types of
visualization

86
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,250
to present our day-to-day I have a whole
bunch on this side

87
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:54,470
we can start in the top left and a pie
chart and taken firewall log

88
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:58,200
I'm breaking up the different event
names here

89
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,210
in two different slice of the pie chart
and

90
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:05,020
I don't see very much I see a big red
slice legal what does that mean

91
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,270
okay well let's go on if the bar charts

92
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:11,900
here I just use on a different event
names that I see in my system

93
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,990
no-show to the distribution in a bar
chart

94
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:19,040
maybe I can see something in here maybe
I see that there are some revenge

95
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,650
showing up a lot and some others don't
and maybe the ones that don't show up

96
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:23,940
that much might be interesting

97
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,820
against not that mean for me that much
information that can actually convey

98
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:32,440
here all its rule on the link graph here
I have a whole bunch of relationships

99
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,410
that I start see between different
machines

100
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:37,680
but as I showed that the previous
example the hairball

101
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,680
if you take more than a thousand nodes
this gets really messy

102
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,310
what can move on is it something called
the tree map

103
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:49,460
which has the capability of actually
putting a lot of information into one

104
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,650
single visualization

105
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,570
but it's also it's pretty hard to
interpret and read all these different

106
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:54,460
labels in

107
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:58,980
so maybe not the right visualization
either this year something called a

108
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,520
parallel coordinate graph

109
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,700
where this is the first graph in this

110
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,930
selection here it actually has the
capability of showing

111
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:10,390
morning just two dimensions of the data
here

112
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:13,710
we had sort of one dimension one field
right the action or the

113
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:17,480
the thing that happened on the firewall
here had all my event names

114
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,510
here you can have different fields on
each of these axes

115
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:25,190
and but also if you look is already
pretty messy

116
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:28,230
if I throw million two million invention
here

117
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:31,550
it's actually going to get really hard
to even render his thing in

118
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:35,490
due time if you an optimized nicely so

119
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:38,410
if you look at how much information is
actually conveyed by each of these

120
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:38,980
graphs

121
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:42,830
this one here my probably when well

122
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:46,340
I'm gonna suggest you something that is
called the heat map

123
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:51,510
heat map in this is just a fancy way of
presenting when it's basically a matrix

124
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:55,010
if you ever studied any statistics are
an anus is

125
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:58,910
pretty simple if columns your rose and

126
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:03,080
every value in here is basically you
encoding the caller

127
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,890
so just have some kind of color scale
number 42 would be

128
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:10,580
fall somewhere in this blue and this is
an example of

129
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,750
of wannabes heatmaps how they could look
so

130
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,170
how do we map data to heat map well we
have

131
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:21,850
the columns here and usually what I do
is a nap time on here

132
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:26,000
so time goes from the left or right into
the future that's going to be on all my

133
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,670
heatmaps

134
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:30,370
you could also put some other dimension
on here and then you end up with

135
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:31,790
something more like a scatterplot

136
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:36,240
and now my rose I can use anything else
I can use my source IP they can use my

137
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,330
port numbers I could use your elves and

138
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:42,410
whatever you have and then wannabes
fixing here

139
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:45,790
is basically the value that says in this
time frame

140
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:49,610
I saw this whatever IP address in this
case

141
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:53,010
this many times and then in code in a
colour make sense

142
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:59,150
pretty straightforward so let's take a
log record in that isn't here right

143
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:02,390
so we have some kind of his to do
someone

144
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:05,530
that Jesus s you on a machine to become
root

145
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:10,080
so the first thing we gotta do is mall
we have this heat map here

146
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,370
we take the timestamp and find

147
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:17,420
the time been that it falls into so
which column are we going into

148
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:21,910
and what we're doing weird not every
time stamp has its own column in here

149
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:24,980
but we're bringing things into back it
up see an hour

150
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,600
so this is what year would go into the
Mayfair

151
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:33,370
2300 our I which is this slice ear the
next one will be to midnight

152
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:37,940
this 1 a.m. and so on through making
babies and then

153
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,450
we take the user roots here which
determines

154
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,959
the row and where it intersects

155
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:47,100
we apply some function in this case I
just added one because I saw

156
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,649
so one more showing up there i think is
should be still pretty straightforward

157
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:52,839
although it's early in the morning

158
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:58,129
yeah K good alright so why heat map
eighty

159
00:08:58,129 --> 00:09:02,220
heat map actually scales really really
really well I can throw

160
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,799
a billion records in here although
information is getting

161
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:10,679
more more aggregated or more more more
course if you want I

162
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:14,720
it shows quite a lot of information more
than a bar chart

163
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,859
because I have multiple dimensions I can
count different things

164
00:09:17,859 --> 00:09:21,850
and what is very interesting I can
actually use different measures

165
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:26,549
for an individual data point so when I
show you just before as I just added one

166
00:09:26,549 --> 00:09:30,779
whenever I saw another one day right so
if I have another user root at that time

167
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:34,299
just adwan keep adding one if I see in
that time being

168
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:37,609
another one at the user's but I said
what I can also do is

169
00:09:37,609 --> 00:09:41,669
I can say well instead of just counting
how many times to see something

170
00:09:41,669 --> 00:09:45,910
if i'm looking at network traffic I can
say well for this IP address

171
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:49,679
how much traffic it actually are sending
the wire

172
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:52,980
and I'll just sum that up so I some up a
third variable

173
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:57,269
or what I can do is I can do a distinct
count

174
00:09:57,269 --> 00:10:01,769
and say well if I had my users I wanna
see how many different machines

175
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:07,129
it a log into in a certain time frame so
if I do that for my user has suddenly

176
00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:09,959
see who is using a lot of different
machines over time

177
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:14,209
also is an example but

178
00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:19,040
the prom if the heat map is still well
the information content is still limited

179
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,959
it's still better than the other
visualizations but it still sort of

180
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:22,899
limited because

181
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:25,959
we acted very highly you don't see all
the detail

182
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:31,040
underneath the data anymore well

183
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,170
here is an approach that can help you

184
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:37,329
so that eliminates all some of the
drawbacks of the heat maps

185
00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:42,250
this is a process that professor Ben
shneiderman at University of Maryland

186
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,000
came out with

187
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,170
ben is also the inventor of the tree
maps if you've ever

188
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:50,029
plated three maps before what he said is
basically like

189
00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:54,269
if you're taking a dataset what you have
to do is you can just dive in and go

190
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:57,730
into what are the details and look at
something very specific unless you know

191
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:58,720
what you're looking for

192
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,160
so you have to start this some kinda or
you first

193
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,420
and I'm using the heat map here's my
overview then from the overview

194
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,470
you find something that looks
interesting you going through man

195
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:14,550
and now I can use it a graph it doesn't
feel that well like the link graph here

196
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:18,180
you don't have that much information
anymore and then from here

197
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,389
I might soon around the might move
around them it look at different things

198
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:25,259
and then I see a certain area that I'm
interested in and then I go back to the

199
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:26,050
details

200
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:29,860
but i wanna look at they're all of a
record to actually understand what

201
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,019
exactly happened here

202
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:34,310
that's usually the workflow that you
would go through

203
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:38,139
to analyze the largest to date so

204
00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:42,519
again the overview I'm using these
heatmaps because they can pack millions

205
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:43,720
of records into them

206
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:48,639
they also allow me to eat inside the
heat map I can already zoom in

207
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:51,850
and basically reduce the data i'm
looking at

208
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:55,439
ended already start showing me certain
patterns in the data that might be

209
00:11:55,439 --> 00:11:56,670
interesting to look at

210
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:59,720
and by itself the heat mat might already
reveal

211
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:04,899
think that I'm interested in but it's
also a fantastic navigation tool to

212
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:09,100
drill down into some other kind of
visualization and really no other

213
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,630
visualization kind of process these
capabilities

214
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,750
now in the next few slides

215
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,939
I'm going to still use the heat maps now
wanna show you

216
00:12:17,939 --> 00:12:21,290
that even something as simple as this
heat map

217
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:25,389
has a whole bunch of challenges when
you're trying to implement

218
00:12:25,389 --> 00:12:29,819
a mapping of data to heat map there's
all kinds of things you need to think

219
00:12:29,819 --> 00:12:30,410
about

220
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:34,399
many design it and heat map is still a
pretty simple visualization

221
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,160
and what I'm trying to illustrate is
that if you trying to take something

222
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,439
else like a link graph

223
00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:42,850
questions that you have to ask yourself
and implement it

224
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:46,620
getting even worse so let's look at some
of the challenges with the heat maps

225
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:50,920
the first one is a pretty simple one I'm
showing you a pretty packed heat map

226
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,440
here

227
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,980
of a lot of data and I have let's say a
thousand rows

228
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:00,190
well if I want to label these rows so
that you actually know what they are

229
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:04,180
I can't draw a label next to it because
I just don't have enough pics

230
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:08,600
because right now in mapping one row 21
pixel I haven't seen a font that's just

231
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,420
one pic slim

232
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,839
hi right can really label so what are
you gonna do that

233
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:16,430
in that case second as well

234
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:19,430
maybe one solution instead of having
labels might be have a mouse

235
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:22,459
over so when you moving around in your
in your heat map

236
00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:25,579
it will actually show you something in
that tooltip that shows up

237
00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:29,420
well you can show different things you
can show for example the position

238
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:33,190
meaning I'm showing you what role I'm on
to the root user

239
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:36,300
and what time been a min that might be
interesting

240
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:40,139
you could also say well but i wanna show
they're alright

241
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:43,690
the roll records logs that are actually
making up that data point

242
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:47,750
and nekesa quelled the cashola that on
the client

243
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:51,630
which could potentially be megabytes of
data or even a gigabyte or something

244
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,189
like that it might be allotted a day

245
00:13:53,189 --> 00:13:56,860
or you can try to do every quest
whenevers you hover over something

246
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:00,449
action you have requested a server in
you bring that data back but

247
00:14:00,449 --> 00:14:04,350
that might also be a little too
compute-intensive in too much data

248
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,519
transmitted all the time

249
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:10,050
the next question is of sorting and
business probably wanna

250
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:13,350
the key problems heat maps and we were
just talking about that over coffee

251
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:13,980
earlier

252
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:17,699
on if you have say

253
00:14:17,699 --> 00:14:20,920
you look at user activity well you could
sort

254
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,399
the user's alphabetically in the end the
alphabetical order the user name doesn't

255
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:26,490
mean anything

256
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:30,600
just because my name starts with an R
and I'm after you go

257
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,029
I doesn't really mean that we should be
sorted that way maybe you should sort

258
00:14:35,029 --> 00:14:36,589
this or the other way around right

259
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:40,649
on so alphabetically are usually doesn't
matter maybe

260
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:44,310
be sorted based on the values we might
want to see well if their similarities

261
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:44,939
in here

262
00:14:44,939 --> 00:14:48,560
if to have these lines look similar
media wanna put them together

263
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,980
today I see groups of different user
showing up in here while the question

264
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,949
then is what I under is either using for
that

265
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:58,019
and even worse what's a distance metric

266
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:01,490
that you're applying to this distance
metrics

267
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:04,439
are becoming very interesting when you
do data mining and you start to

268
00:15:04,439 --> 00:15:05,769
clustering for example

269
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:10,000
how far away is one IP address from
another

270
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,199
how far away is my user

271
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:17,459
from somebody else else's user I might
have different user accounts I might

272
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:20,760
have ran outta arm Rumi to Rafi as a
user account

273
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,850
well they should probably very close
together but how does the system no

274
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:28,329
so I have to teach assist these kinds of
things and they can really really

275
00:15:28,329 --> 00:15:32,029
nasty here you see an example this is a
random

276
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:35,380
order of my data and what I did hear

277
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:39,309
is I applied a clustering algorithm with
are think anyone knows our

278
00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:42,410
I'm if you just use the heat map
commanded actually like sequestered

279
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:46,699
things but you see that there's a band
of users or or

280
00:15:46,699 --> 00:15:50,370
here to IP addresses that belong
together up here

281
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:54,180
but I also have won it looks very
similar down here to somehow

282
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,680
the distance computation was done such
that

283
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,930
it somehow separates the data and too
big buckets in and start sorting does

284
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:06,069
so the algorithm behind this is not
exactly what I wanted I want to have

285
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:07,930
these guys show up next to each other

286
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:11,680
so I have to go in and start changing
these kinds of things which gets really

287
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,990
gnarly and and pretty complicated
sometimes

288
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:17,610
the next challenge over plotting

289
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:21,339
I think about you have a 10,000
different users

290
00:16:21,339 --> 00:16:25,439
but you only have a screen with a
thousand rows or 1000 pics hi

291
00:16:25,439 --> 00:16:28,819
so now you have to map 10,000 into a
thousand

292
00:16:28,819 --> 00:16:32,130
you can do all kinds of things you can
choose to a

293
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:35,800
various simple some so basically if you
take

294
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:41,170
five or six or seven rosita map them on
one row and you basically to sum up all

295
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,279
the values in here

296
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:46,120
that's one way but that might not
exactly sure you wanna show

297
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,850
maybe you want to preserve neighborhood
properties and you wanna have sort of it

298
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:54,759
a function that you live you're putting
over it more like a caution

299
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:58,170
on curve or something like that
depending on what you wanna show

300
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:02,860
now if you have is one heat map with a
1000 pixels

301
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:06,040
you encode 10,000 users when you start
zooming in

302
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,870
I gonna and nudism ordered over plotting
how you gonna do that

303
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:14,200
then if you start making these

304
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,910
heatmaps interactive and instead of just
having a static picture like this

305
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:20,920
all kinds of other issues the very first
simple one is

306
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,370
well the user probably choose the time
frame that you want to visualize

307
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:29,650
start time and end time is what I wanna
show nothing about the case where

308
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:32,990
I have a 1000 pixels arm

309
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:37,640
horizontally and I wanna map thousand
five seconds on to it

310
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,770
so I I would make 1.00

311
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,820
well as if I've seconds per pixel

312
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:48,940
that's kind of weird if I napped is out
that way so how do they do that

313
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:53,900
on well maybe all you could do is the
user to specify sISTAR time

314
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,310
the end times automatically chosen by
the number of pixels you have so it's

315
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,620
always an income in 2002 something like
that

316
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,960
I may be a fraction thereof like 500 or
something think it's actually pretty

317
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,210
interesting if you start implementing
this kind of

318
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,850
something then

319
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:14,540
when you zoom and I'm selecting a
certain frame here and I Z will so

320
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,300
Manuel

321
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,389
if you just keep zooming in your

322
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:22,600
your tiles get bigger and bigger right
so in the end I end up with his one big

323
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,660
rectangle but I zoomed in but maybe that
was that over plot

324
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:31,470
that I had actually I have a thousand
rows in that it just aggregating 21

325
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:34,630
so i sux have to start and doing my over
plot

326
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:38,120
and potentially faction new data from
the server which

327
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:43,180
might get interesting if you have to do
that then

328
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,610
I talked briefly about color mapping I
showed that

329
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:50,660
blooming on call arranged I'm at my
values to

330
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:54,450
well as all kinds of ways you can map
your callers when I was using was just

331
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,130
wanted these

332
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:58,550
scales here but you could also use
something like this where you have more

333
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:58,840
pic

334
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:02,830
a discrete sort of mapping of things
that might be this is a firewall block

335
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:05,280
is the file past as might be something
else

336
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,430
tonight Money Map it to something more
discreet you have to figure that out

337
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:12,150
maybe you want to have multiple entries
that have just

338
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,100
I get

339
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,510
a blue or red scale I might have
something like a a

340
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:19,510
a rainbow scheme here for example but
then

341
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:22,740
if someone sees a green know what value
was that

342
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,390
was that five hundred and this is a
thousand or it was that four hundred her

343
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:30,250
it's getting hard to interpret right so
you have to think hard about what color

344
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,090
scheme to use

345
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:36,289
then something else that we found very
early on we started generating the seat

346
00:19:36,289 --> 00:19:37,399
maps was that

347
00:19:37,399 --> 00:19:40,850
the distribution of your values is
actually not very on

348
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:44,270
normal or its not even very on I'm

349
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:48,130
even here so if you look at so the
frequency of your values showing up you

350
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,460
might have something where

351
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:52,620
these values here show up make much much
more cities might be

352
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,690
certain port numbers show up way way
more than others

353
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:59,110
port 84 for 322 you might see all the
time

354
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:03,950
or support I know 1434 or something else
that might show up barely ever

355
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:08,090
now if you visualize that you might see
something like this here

356
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:12,679
where they see one of these very bright
on bars showing up in the rest is fairly

357
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:13,320
dark

358
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,750
well if I change my exposure basically
meaning that I

359
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,190
moving around these curves a little bit
in terms of the map into the data

360
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:24,500
then some the MIT different patterns
through some leaders thing here shows up

361
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,760
that I didn't really see before so you
have to

362
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,480
be able to play if these exposure values
a little bit I wish you an example where

363
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:31,880
this

364
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,809
becomes much more clear later then

365
00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:39,100
one last issues said I will present you
here

366
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,820
in terms of challenges for heatmaps is
say

367
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,610
and analyzing some data like my IP
address communicating

368
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:49,610
and I'm zooming in and zooming in and I
find this one machine

369
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:52,610
that seems to have an interesting
pattern like this guy here

370
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:56,010
well now have to serve one dimensional
data that shows me

371
00:20:56,010 --> 00:21:00,610
overtime this is the activity in machine
had but immediately I bought a question

372
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:01,320
like well what

373
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,840
other machines that it go to what sports
did he use so

374
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,870
I call is a pillar where basically I
wanna

375
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:12,679
tell does the the data locked everything
at this stage the Nation Address here

376
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:16,549
I wanna look at the sources what sources
were connected to that day

377
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:17,929
so then

378
00:21:17,929 --> 00:21:21,659
you can pitch to some other on you see I
might

379
00:21:21,659 --> 00:21:26,419
wanna do the same thing for destination
ports now

380
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:30,539
the last challenge here is so that the
back and you're using for something like

381
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:31,110
this

382
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:34,899
and we could talk about big data for
hours here

383
00:21:34,899 --> 00:21:37,980
is a sister my one side on on

384
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:41,940
large data as I decided to call it from
now on on

385
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:47,279
you have to think about what kind of
large data back and you want to use for

386
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:47,990
this stuff

387
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:51,440
there's all kinds of things if $key
$value store like a Mongo dB or

388
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,769
Cassandra RH macy could use a search
engine like elastic searchers solar

389
00:21:55,769 --> 00:21:59,869
you can use a graph database depending
if you have relationships in your day to

390
00:21:59,869 --> 00:22:02,409
you might want to have a graph database
to compute centrality

391
00:22:02,409 --> 00:22:05,889
between SR shortest path between
different machines or something like

392
00:22:05,889 --> 00:22:06,269
that

393
00:22:06,269 --> 00:22:10,850
you could just go for it plane old
relational database that everybody

394
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:11,809
understands

395
00:22:11,809 --> 00:22:15,549
like something like my sequel and I can
guarantee you most the time that's

396
00:22:15,549 --> 00:22:16,570
probably what you wanna do

397
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:19,919
people are ditching these data bases
because

398
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,509
if you getting into larger scale has a
lot of data you have to start charging

399
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:27,850
yet to figure out what machine in your
cluster you going to put the data into

400
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:28,409
how do you

401
00:22:28,409 --> 00:22:32,460
partition your data that's the biggest
problem with relational databases like

402
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:36,330
people move to no sequel and all that
kind of stuff often you can probably buy

403
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:40,039
a big enough machine into everything
into one node and my seat was probably

404
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:41,769
less headache than anything else

405
00:22:41,769 --> 00:22:46,190
but if you want to do it right if you
want to do these kinds of computations

406
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,549
for heat maps for example

407
00:22:47,549 --> 00:22:50,769
you will need a columnar days and

408
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:54,379
good luck finding something in the open
source world actually works pretty well

409
00:22:54,379 --> 00:22:57,720
arm what you can try to do is using
something like Impala

410
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,370
or

411
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:03,970
shark if you've heard this park stack on
those are very interesting technologies

412
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:04,570
to you sir

413
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:08,490
I'm I'm crossing out Hadoop and
MapReduce here

414
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:11,830
because just throwing Hadoop cluster in
there

415
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:15,940
and running MapReduce jobs over your
data to compute these heatmaps

416
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:20,059
is not the right thing to do MapReduce
the great technology

417
00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:23,710
if you wanna process a large amount of
data generally all of your data

418
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:27,789
with the same thing you want to do you
want to parse all your data or something

419
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:29,200
like that you want to compute

420
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,230
beat I get over all of your data then
you can start doing MapReduce but if you

421
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:33,690
having

422
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:37,860
ad hoc questions like how many different
usernames to having this system or in

423
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,840
this time frame

424
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:42,490
show me all the different IP address is
showing up Hadoop

425
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:46,799
absolutely wrong technology for that and
we can talk more about that

426
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,830
and a break if you want now

427
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:54,280
and motivating my hips are so great but
they also have to challenge is obviously

428
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:58,690
and wanted a big challenge is obviously
that you can see relationships in

429
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:04,049
and the scraps here I'm much better
suited for that so you see relationships

430
00:24:04,049 --> 00:24:05,730
between different machines here

431
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:10,539
other communicating what ports they're
using so relationships are not well seen

432
00:24:10,539 --> 00:24:11,270
in heat maps

433
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:14,940
the other thing is and I mention is a
little bit earlier

434
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,350
these these parallel coordinates if you
have multiple dimensions

435
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:22,409
my heat now back in maybe sort of map
three dimensions are three data fields

436
00:24:22,409 --> 00:24:23,049
in today

437
00:24:23,049 --> 00:24:27,370
but if I have more 12:15 I can't map
that anymore

438
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:31,549
so I can try to use a parallel
coordinate where basically every access

439
00:24:31,549 --> 00:24:32,919
here is a data field so

440
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:36,940
my source IP addresses my destination IP
is my destination ports the number of

441
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,039
bytes transmitted

442
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:42,440
and line in here basically represents
one log record

443
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,549
so this IP thought that is it. on this
port

444
00:24:45,549 --> 00:24:49,630
transmitted this much data he can start
seeing certain patterns in here

445
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:53,320
I'm like here you have one one very very

446
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,620
long lasting connection and all the
other connections were not that long

447
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:00,429
so why was there one out liar in here
that the kinds of things you could see

448
00:25:00,429 --> 00:25:00,789
in

449
00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:03,850
so

450
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:05,929
I hope that you saw heatmaps

451
00:25:05,929 --> 00:25:09,460
are fairly simple to understand by
themselves there's a whole bunch of

452
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,769
challenges we actually start
implementing this kind of thing

453
00:25:11,769 --> 00:25:15,409
and then if you were to implement a link
graph like this

454
00:25:15,409 --> 00:25:19,450
what happens when you hover over No what
happens if you select one

455
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:23,039
as it select everything that's connected
to it how do you be fine patterns on

456
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,100
there and things like that

457
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,289
it gets pretty complicated alright

458
00:25:27,289 --> 00:25:32,779
so thinking back if you slide showed his
process right we started an overview

459
00:25:32,779 --> 00:25:37,380
resume and you get the details on the
man well or we're actually working on is

460
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,010
something

461
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:41,659
a little more advanced even its

462
00:25:41,659 --> 00:25:45,840
even if your heat map it's often not
that easy to get to find a starting

463
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,389
point you must be really messy

464
00:25:47,389 --> 00:25:51,210
some other just screenshots you saw
we're just a big mess

465
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:54,659
rain well you can try to do is you can
try to use data mining

466
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:59,470
mainly clustering to half the system
computes areas in your day is that it

467
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:00,279
looks similar

468
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:04,380
in this case here what I did is I took a
firewall log

469
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:07,760
or network flows and I was trying to
show

470
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,580
or trying to find are there groups have
machines that seem to behave similarly

471
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:16,840
and basically what you find here they
were a couple of clusters these dark

472
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,830
parts here

473
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:21,880
and the rest in really cluster well so
this might be on my web service down

474
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,820
here and this might be all my mail
servers

475
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:28,230
and see that now I can start zooming in
and sort of work from there and already

476
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:29,830
reduced my dataset

477
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:33,720
by a lot so it kind of helps me
summarize the aggregate my data even

478
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,190
more

479
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:38,440
so here's another one of these guys
dessert called self-organizing maps

480
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:42,500
your interests and what it is on it's
basically clustering

481
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,710
are based on a single dimension and

482
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:50,480
when we started doing this work rection
not quite happy with it yet

483
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,860
there's so many different challenges
here

484
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:57,480
one the biggest challenge is figuring
out what it what are the features what I

485
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:57,809
def

486
00:26:57,809 --> 00:27:01,610
the things you actually input into you
are going to by default you would take

487
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:05,049
something like how many bytes have been
transmitted between different machines

488
00:27:05,049 --> 00:27:08,309
you might say well what ports for the
communicating on

489
00:27:08,309 --> 00:27:11,320
but what happens if you do these naively
is

490
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:16,160
let's see your traffic in your network
is eighty percent Facebook

491
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,780
pretty much every corporation today
probably eighty percent

492
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:22,760
network traffic is Facebook right so if
you throw it in here

493
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:27,360
guess what your self organizing map you
will learn to Facebook traffic so

494
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,970
in my start training certain clustered
in this big one hears is all the

495
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:31,850
Facebook traffic

496
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:35,940
and then the other 20 percent of the map
here will will be designated to other

497
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:36,490
things

498
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:39,740
that's generally not what I want I want
to kind of throw the

499
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:43,010
that traffic away and haven't learned on
the rest is that the really interesting

500
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:43,600
part

501
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,520
there's a lot of different challenges he
will have if you try to implement

502
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,530
something like this

503
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:54,940
alright what I want to do now is I'm
gonna show you a whole bunch of examples

504
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,290
and

505
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:58,420
its kinda getting more complicated the
further India

506
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:03,210
we're gonna start with this one what you
see here

507
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:06,630
is again over time you have different
users

508
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:09,840
that were active on my sis and here

509
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,510
the caller is basically the brighter it
is the more activity I saw

510
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:18,890
from that one user at that time now if
you look at this

511
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:27,100
do you see anything interesting well you
can also read the text

512
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:30,250
if you can open your eyes that much in
the morning

513
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:34,810
it looks kind of random write

514
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:38,580
you have maybe some kind of a cluster
here it is a day just might be nine

515
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,530
o'clock in the morning

516
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:44,450
you maybe have something here that might
be midnight but it still sort of random

517
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:48,310
but if you look at the user to fifth
from the bottom that Vincent guy

518
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:51,920
and sorry if anyone is called been
sitting here there's no association I

519
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,980
don't know that person

520
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:58,230
on but this guy here has a very light
pattern over the entire period time

521
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:02,320
and that looks completely different from
all the other patterns in here

522
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,720
just visually I have no idea what the
data is behind this

523
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,420
I don't know what the users are but just
visually this looks different from

524
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,350
everything else

525
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:13,410
them I P absolutely B-nine

526
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:16,700
when I was working at Splunk we actually
graft

527
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:20,000
the check in history for our source
control server

528
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,260
and we look that what times do

529
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:26,530
developers commit we had this guy image

530
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:30,850
I think he's a robot on because his
check in history was pretty much flat

531
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:35,050
so add it four in the morning he checked
in as much as he did at four in the

532
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:35,630
afternoon

533
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:39,240
maybe it between eight and nine in the
morning he didn't check in that much

534
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,630
it's probably his time to sleep

535
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:44,740
but this could be absolutely okay it
could also be that someone

536
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:48,240
is abusing this user as a service in
there on some kind of a script or

537
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,310
something that you might want to know
about

538
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:53,770
maybe it's something malicious if you
got lucky you found something that is

539
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:54,420
really bad

540
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:58,460
here's another example that

541
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:02,170
arm I actually stole with permission
from Thai

542
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:05,460
this is different users again

543
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:08,670
overtime you see

544
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:12,190
the log in history basically so when did
users log into the system

545
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:15,750
you see the blue ones here is actually
the root user

546
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:19,100
which I already don't like why are
people

547
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:22,680
logging in remotely via Route it's
probably not necessarily a good thing

548
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,720
on but then you see is kinda patterns

549
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,940
you see something like this here which
is probably some kind of a a brute-force

550
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:33,740
scan across different usernames were
someone is just trying out things over

551
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,260
time

552
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:37,890
but then interesting challenge here

553
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:42,370
was to figure out well are there any
interesting patterns behind the scenes

554
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:43,570
that we don't see here

555
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:47,790
you could now try to apply all kinds of
data mining in

556
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:51,110
complicated processing and what not to
figure out that the any interesting

557
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,260
patterns in here

558
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:55,590
do you have periodicity like things to
keep repeating in

559
00:30:55,590 --> 00:31:00,000
the same manner something like that but
can also take a couple analysts

560
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,850
that have some intuition and say well
let's try this we think this might be

561
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:04,470
happening

562
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:07,590
in fact what happened here is that

563
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:10,700
in ties organization and analysts at you
know what

564
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:14,360
I wonder if I look at traffic coming
from

565
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,550
turkey or just from different countries

566
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:20,690
so he basically split up although that
the traffic

567
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:23,890
into where did the logins come from

568
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:27,790
and he generated a whole bunch of
different same types of visualizations

569
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:32,220
and I he found this the top one here all
the logins coming or the attempted

570
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,650
loggins coming from Turkey

571
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:37,379
and down here the logins are coming from
the US

572
00:31:37,379 --> 00:31:46,830
what you see what do you notice the blue
one looks pretty similar

573
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:52,850
it seems to be that these are almost the
same

574
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:57,509
right that visually day the we could
probably overlaid and almost the same

575
00:31:57,509 --> 00:31:59,230
day might not be exactly the same

576
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:03,009
if you 1 I'll go with them over this
this is not going to match up probably

577
00:32:03,009 --> 00:32:06,740
but visually looking at is like you know
these are pretty darn say

578
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:11,590
now letter now is that someone you some
kind of an attack toolkit

579
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:15,440
Mitch with predefined user names and
they just ran it from different

580
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,309
locations and scans on this organization

581
00:32:19,309 --> 00:32:23,059
so this is the same script running from
different sources coming in

582
00:32:23,059 --> 00:32:28,480
there was a pretty interesting
revelation is another example

583
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,450
I got from I know region friends I
someone was running

584
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:36,559
a a firewall at home and these two
gentlemen here

585
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:40,309
new that this person was graphing their
data in this kinda way

586
00:32:40,309 --> 00:32:43,679
so what they did is the scanned in a way

587
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:52,650
that their pictures started showing up

588
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:53,090
now

589
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:57,140
here's another quick example what I did
he resides just take

590
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:00,490
some sources or destinations here's a

591
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:04,050
every single row years a different
destination in my network

592
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:07,660
and if I look at this site well yeah

593
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:11,920
interesting there seems to be a whole
bunch of machines that were not active

594
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,640
here

595
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,300
there might be some other things showing
up in here I but really

596
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:20,440
let's see if I can find something else
interesting and what I did is

597
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:24,380
between these two slides I'm changing
the exposure level

598
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:28,880
the graphs are the same but I'm changing
exposure

599
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,720
today I see lower values better and
while you might know is that this thing

600
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,730
here shows up

601
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:38,010
by just changing exposures and suddenly
I'm I have to sort of periodic behavior

602
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:38,880
in here

603
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,150
now that might be interesting on a zoom
into that

604
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:46,030
that is just as zoom in on it and I see
that is this

605
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:49,780
IP address here hope no one recognized
that IP ranges

606
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:55,110
not real data this is fake on when I
detainees

607
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:58,390
I basically and pivoting now so I had
this

608
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:01,950
one source here I wanted this one
destination

609
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:06,650
and i wanna see and the next night what
sources are connecting to it

610
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:12,520
and if you look at a this looks really
messy nothing really I could see

611
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:18,120
I i can. not sure if you can but then
what i'm saying is I'm gonna change

612
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:22,629
I'm gonna use some data mining money you
some intelligence sorting of the rose

613
00:34:22,629 --> 00:34:27,629
and see what I see a pattern and in fact
I just restored at the Rose

614
00:34:27,629 --> 00:34:32,149
and I start seeing this staircase or use
this step pattern here

615
00:34:32,149 --> 00:34:35,870
and this is exactly if you overlay and a

616
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:41,220
this is exactly what we saw before where
on that one destination had that kind of

617
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:43,220
pattern so that matches up pretty nicely

618
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:48,760
so I just applying some analysis steps I
was able to find what was actually

619
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,919
responsible

620
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:53,570
for this kind of pattern now the other
thing that you can do now is like well

621
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:54,330
okay

622
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:57,700
I now know there's a bunch of sources
involved in our generation is pattern

623
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:02,450
what exactly is a what I'm doing here is
amusing apparel accorded plot where

624
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:06,660
you see these different sources here we
had one destination right

625
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:10,920
that one that resume then and animals
showing the port number here

626
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,430
and you see there's there seem to be
some interesting ports down here is a

627
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,770
lot of traffic going to that

628
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:19,280
there's also some higher port numbers
that are being used here

629
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,650
but you don't see is the exact scale so
you don't really know what this port

630
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:23,570
number here is

631
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:28,050
so I should probably put labels on here
but what I did danny's I i kinda know

632
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:31,349
is just for illustrative purposes here
we had this one destination

633
00:35:31,349 --> 00:35:35,079
some eliminating that in this crap I
just have sources and destinations

634
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:38,820
and you can for example select one of
the sources and you see that

635
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:42,780
it's going to decide to this port number
and there's a bunch a couple for numbers

636
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,630
down he rolls

637
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:48,329
so you can start investigating what
exactly was this traffic and it seems to

638
00:35:48,329 --> 00:35:50,730
be some kind of a scan if you notice
that

639
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:55,490
there's only one love line that all that
crosses here all the others are sorted

640
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:59,359
nicely going over there so there seems
to be some some kind of a scan going on

641
00:35:59,359 --> 00:35:59,839
between

642
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:07,550
eyepiece that are almost already here
just gonna be interesting is another

643
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:08,200
example

644
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,470
arm what I'm doing here as I have my
users here this time

645
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:14,480
again over time and now

646
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:19,420
one of these individual blocks here
shows me how many different machines

647
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:22,420
did someone log into so

648
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:26,170
for example here the red ones this one
guy locked into a whole bunch of

649
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:27,550
machines let's say 10

650
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:30,780
in that time frame if it's if it's a

651
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:33,890
darker value year might only be one or
two machines

652
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:39,420
now if you look at this well you might
be able to see some things in your

653
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:44,750
is a day worth of data services like
midnight and goes to the other midnight

654
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:48,740
you might see that their soda and
boundary here

655
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:54,079
and maybe year which might be workday

656
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:58,099
8925 to the scene seem to have some

657
00:36:58,099 --> 00:37:02,609
normally uses in his network so we can
do that is there well

658
00:37:02,609 --> 00:37:06,530
okay district with this restoring my
rose

659
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:10,099
work pretty well earlier we found that
those steps

660
00:37:10,099 --> 00:37:14,660
let's try that here we're sorting based
on the similarity of the rose

661
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:19,570
and okay well now we have two ones that
have a lot of activity on top here

662
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:24,070
anne gets less and less down here not
sure how much that tells me really

663
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:28,180
well what else could be due to
potentially find some interesting

664
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,160
patterns in here

665
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:33,650
well every user

666
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:37,020
belongs to one or more

667
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:41,250
group or rolls so we could try to
visualize to define roles

668
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:44,670
or sorted by Rose roles so here

669
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:48,600
on there seem to be some pretty clear

670
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,720
to have separation showing up rate and
i'd have

671
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:55,310
on the very active guys here might be a
top-five

672
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:58,640
until about here that I pretty active

673
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:02,290
they don't seem to adhere to a nine to
five pattern it seems to be shifted

674
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:05,500
and then I have said it is big block
here

675
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:09,480
and then something else starts down here
they seem to be more active

676
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:14,190
over the entire period time again now if
I actually show you what the rules are

677
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:17,220
you have administrators Friday

678
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:20,270
they start later in the day you have
salespeople

679
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:23,890
if development their little more radical
overtime

680
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:28,530
and he might finance people to come in a
little earlier in the morning I'm so

681
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:28,890
that

682
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:33,460
now start showing some interesting
things for example inside sales

683
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:37,220
what is this guy looks like an
administrator

684
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:40,530
maybe again it might be

685
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:43,540
okay may be out of power sales person in
there

686
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:47,390
I just use a lot different machines or
something might also be

687
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:50,690
someone is doing something that's not
really part of their

688
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:57,350
role at work and they shouldn't be be
really doing this alright

689
00:38:57,350 --> 00:39:00,320
last example I took if I will log

690
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,430
whole buncha rose and

691
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:08,210
money the challenges in in network flows
and firewalls that

692
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:11,840
the cardinality of summer the field is
really high meaning that

693
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:16,140
if you look at the different fields that
you have in your data like source IP SAN

694
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,430
destination eyepiece

695
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:20,910
you might have a lot of them potentially
a few million

696
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:24,520
showing up in a log file now if I want
to generate heat map

697
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:29,170
for my sources I have white house
hundred thousand different wanted in my

698
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:29,660
network

699
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:33,040
how am I gonna visualized they might be
pretty hard

700
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,330
well how do we start analysis

701
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:40,920
what I did hear I think he came up with
some ideas that I had about the dataset

702
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,890
and say you know what

703
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:45,480
I bet or what I'm interested in is

704
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:50,100
if the machine a source comes into my
network and

705
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:53,100
generally I machine should you be
blocked

706
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:56,279
because doing something stupid or should
be allowed

707
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:00,500
because I really want them to access my
webserver my mail so whatever it

708
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:04,890
but if a machine gets blocked and then
passed

709
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:09,450
they might not be so cool because they
may be someone is trying to fix Kenny

710
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:12,730
and then getting successfully so

711
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:15,820
I really wanna see activity where I have
blocks and passes

712
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:21,400
afterwards and what that helps you edit
me if this hypothesis with this idea

713
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,550
I can actually pre-filter all of my data
I can throw everything away

714
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:28,660
that was only passes and i cant for
everything away

715
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:32,320
it was only blocks and now I'm left to
the dataset and I might be able to work

716
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,690
with its a little smaller

717
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:39,200
now the other thing that I said is is
low frequency sources so sources that I

718
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,630
don't see that much

719
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:45,980
and my kid pass unblock I might not
being just as a much is the only show up

720
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:50,460
two times in a log file over two months
had sprawling okay

721
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:53,700
mean I might stretch in a little bit
here but I'm just

722
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:57,010
I'm making this assumption for now so

723
00:40:57,010 --> 00:41:00,440
what I'm gonna do then is I'm using my
heat maps again

724
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:04,210
and I have a very simple visual mapping
I'm saying well the sources

725
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:08,340
I'm going to put my rose time again is
going over

726
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,550
here two columns

727
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:13,500
and now my collar mapping is a little
different the column mapping is such

728
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,270
that

729
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:17,819
if in a certain time frame so in one of
his time bins

730
00:41:17,819 --> 00:41:21,230
at sea in an hour if I only saw it pass

731
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:24,470
it was only let through my fat firewall
can agree

732
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:27,700
if I only thought blocked it's gonna be

733
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:32,440
orange unified if I thought both past
and blocking the same time

734
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:38,079
it's going to be dark red and so

735
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:42,190
now I said the low-frequency want to get
the ones that I don't see much in my

736
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:46,020
firewall might not be interesting well
here's the ones that show up less than

737
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,930
10 times they feed it to some

738
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:51,190
or a row it would be less than 10 here's
my

739
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:56,670
outbound traffic and here's my inbound
traffic on the inbound traffic I have

740
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:58,420
something like thirty six thousand rows

741
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:02,300
and those who were around like you this
morning last night arm

742
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:06,220
I was trying to actually apply some data
mining on this thing to sort it

743
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:09,690
like we did before said with the
arrangement of my farm

744
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:13,599
heatmaps and I actually implement my
servers and ran our

745
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:16,960
I think the process is still running
from last night at like ten o'clock it's

746
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,780
not done yet

747
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:21,500
so and probably just using the wrong are
going to do this because it shouldn't be

748
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,069
that hard

749
00:42:22,069 --> 00:42:25,069
the sort 36,000 rose if anyone knows

750
00:42:25,069 --> 00:42:28,180
are no Serie A Xin please come see me I
need some help

751
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:33,280
arm but what we see here is it's really
kind of random in here i i cant really

752
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,970
see any parent but on this one

753
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:39,910
I do see a pattern which I kinda didn't
expect

754
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:44,319
so let's quickly see what that is so I
have some outbound blocks

755
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:48,040
traffic going out blocked and I did some

756
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:51,069
just command line witchery

757
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:54,440
don't look at my regex is your horrible
they were working Creek

758
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:59,589
in it worked on but he basically when I
did is I took to some of the columns in

759
00:42:59,589 --> 00:43:00,180
here

760
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:04,329
and just summed up so every time being I
counted how many times

761
00:43:04,329 --> 00:43:08,859
these guys showed up and I found that
rule number two hundred thirty-eight

762
00:43:08,859 --> 00:43:12,890
in my file along is actually spiking
here

763
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:16,549
over that period of time and if you
actually look at some of the log records

764
00:43:16,549 --> 00:43:17,760
that were behind this

765
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,839
its kinda funky I'm still not sure
what's going on here

766
00:43:20,839 --> 00:43:24,500
but there seems to be arm basically the

767
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:28,550
arm the responses so that the server to
the client

768
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:32,540
is being blocked going out of my network
so he was not even

769
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:36,180
the initial it's not the incoming
traffic is not too soon

770
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:40,500
that's being blocked but its outgoing
traffic and it's not even too soon act

771
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,030
but some

772
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:44,950
are to react that's being blocked now I
have an idea

773
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:48,869
he might be at the file a lawsuit state
at that point maybe it's a long lasting

774
00:43:48,869 --> 00:43:51,210
connection to drop the state table or
something

775
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:54,540
otherwise I really don't know if there's
one also is kinda suspicious

776
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:57,900
is it's not that the show up four times
in here

777
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:01,859
but that the source port is 1338 which
is kinda low port number

778
00:44:01,859 --> 00:44:05,740
I would not expect that as a source for
generally so still not sure what it is

779
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:07,339
but this seems to be interesting to

780
00:44:07,339 --> 00:44:12,530
to look further into now to go back to
the high frequency stuff right

781
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:18,050
everything that showed up more than 10
times arm I only and left if 6732 rose

782
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:19,619
67 72 sources

783
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:24,070
so that seems I'm pretty interesting
actually see a bunch of patterns in here

784
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:28,010
right so the first thing I did is a
split it up between inbound and outbound

785
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:28,960
traffic

786
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,089
outbound very nicely

787
00:44:32,089 --> 00:44:36,810
here's my IP address range internally
and then I had these two eyed pea I just

788
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:37,910
seen here

789
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:40,990
I've no idea what they are I'm pretty
sure

790
00:44:40,990 --> 00:44:45,700
is was a misconfiguration a box sitting
inside that was blocked going out

791
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:50,390
bound right he was only blocked and then
probably someone here knows oh crap

792
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:54,420
be configured to Sky wrong change the IP
assignment on the machine

793
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:57,859
and then it was okay might actually be
this guy here because that guy start

794
00:44:57,859 --> 00:44:58,930
showing up from here on

795
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:02,480
have no clue what this is

796
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,339
there's a machine my network has some
weird IP address try to go out every now

797
00:45:06,339 --> 00:45:07,420
and then being blocked

798
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:12,220
but it is being blocked so whoever
administer sis file a party at their job

799
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:14,329
is a bunch of other stuff

800
00:45:14,329 --> 00:45:18,869
been here that I might find interesting
and there seems to be his

801
00:45:18,869 --> 00:45:22,810
sort of break hear something happens
there seems to be this can align you can

802
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:23,579
draw through their

803
00:45:23,579 --> 00:45:27,579
I have machines that stop being there
like this guy

804
00:45:27,579 --> 00:45:31,350
machines that have been blocked in past
up to here then they were only path

805
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:34,590
ask on there's an interesting pattern
here

806
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:38,710
some leaders guy gets passed then it
goes away and he comes back in Effingham

807
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:41,720
past all the time to something going on
here

808
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:44,990
when I did is I took this pattern and
then generate a link graph

809
00:45:44,990 --> 00:45:48,420
sorry for the resolution stealing things
here but basically

810
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:52,160
PCs are these two things the green stuff
here the past things

811
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,870
are showing up in this graph fiercely
have this is a it just know that this

812
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:58,040
past it goes to all these

813
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:01,300
destinations here and these different
ports support eighty

814
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:05,770
port 53 and eco replies that's probably
alright

815
00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:08,950
and then the block parties this here
where

816
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:12,460
I had a couple destinations there is a
multicast addresses

817
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:16,430
on some weird sports 5353 and 4:30 or
423

818
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:20,410
423 you can go crazy trying to figure
out what that is

819
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:23,620
its Bonjour on the land the max where
machines like

820
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:27,560
lol oh i wanna talk to you talk to me
talk to me so fortunate leaves

821
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:30,860
this is blocked by firewall on

822
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:34,530
I can keep going on here right we can
look at the inbound traffic know stuff

823
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:35,200
coming in

824
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:39,410
i'm looking only my top pros I'm gonna
zoom in to this pattern here

825
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:42,830
it looks very interesting and then

826
00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:46,670
I noticed that there's all kinds of
stuff happening here

827
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:50,200
all kinda blocks and there seemed to be
so that these periodic behavior

828
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:53,440
what the hell is that I also have this

829
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,970
green-line showing up here I

830
00:46:56,970 --> 00:47:00,440
actually this is one of the blocks here
on again

831
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:04,510
its I think I wrote this fireball rose
and I hate myself at this point

832
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:07,880
because ICE seem to have written the
rules

833
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:11,720
on the axe on the going out trafficking
said over coming in

834
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:15,230
because here again that i block on ACK

835
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:18,380
I to buy axis in ACI even

836
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:22,380
from Port eighty so I'm not quite sure I
don't have my roots that anymore

837
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:26,600
it's really hard to verify really what
the the underlying rules where the cost

838
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,670
is kind of behavior

839
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:33,120
but that was interesting and it turns
out I have the same pattern here

840
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:37,310
these guys are all blocked this guy was
passed he was actually the same kind of

841
00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:39,350
traffic is all port 80 traffic so

842
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:41,860
it seems like this is actually going to
the web server

843
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:45,630
that was being able to talk back out or
was allowed to be a web server

844
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:49,090
there's another pattern is the last one
year

845
00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:53,210
arm that I found interesting is really a
lot going on

846
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:57,430
and what I did that is why I generated
this graph for you basically

847
00:47:57,430 --> 00:48:01,030
this is the source right coming into my
network I'm showing

848
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:04,890
all the destinations it's going to and
what port number

849
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:08,740
it was actually using if it's ready with
blocked so my source

850
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:12,650
this guy coming to this machine was on
echo request was blocked

851
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:16,790
and there was this one guy on port 135
that was kept being blocked

852
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:21,080
that the paintings came through but then
it was blocked in 135

853
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:25,340
just ms plaster but there was one node
Wales actually passed as well

854
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:29,440
that's a little um concerning

855
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,810
alright with that I'm actually out of
time

856
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:35,810
but on I think

857
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:40,140
be sought at attackers are still very
successful getting to our networks

858
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:43,730
we need to do something to be a
generally has the information inside

859
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:47,440
they could help us find the attackers we
have a big data problem in the end

860
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:51,210
we need some analytic some probably some
visualization to find interesting stuff

861
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:54,520
hope I was able to show you
visualizations kinda hard but

862
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:57,810
I think it's worth trying and playing
with that around

863
00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:02,170
play some heat maps and arm if you had

864
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:06,580
any ideas for sort of cool heuristics
are workflows for analyzing certain

865
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:09,850
datasets please come see me in let's
kick out thank you
