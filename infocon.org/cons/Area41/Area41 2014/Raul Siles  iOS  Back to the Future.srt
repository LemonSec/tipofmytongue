for me to be here with you these week
and

5
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,440
I think the conference people are doing
a very good job so let's see what we are

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,550
going to govern X

7
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,680
my name is role to SA came from spain as
you can see from my action

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,449
and I do information security gay
founded a small

9
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:33,989
a company called a Michigan we have been
doing interesting stuff

10
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:38,540
there for years day so what we're going
to do in the next 50 minutes

11
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,800
is to go through the hollywood movie or
a serious you movie scene really

12
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,360
to explain you Sam current state of the
art of

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,520
durability research in and markets K
we're going to see also

14
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,280
a what is the for you to understand the
current peace in this

15
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,440
Apple hacks okay on the market

16
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,940
a specific feature that the implementing
the

17
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,060
move I'll devices and we're going to see
if it is winnable or not

18
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:11,600
and if we can manipulate it somehow
going into the details of the different

19
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,530
attacks and then

20
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:16,710
some conclusions that be at the end sure
starting with the

21
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:20,400
we know we need to research markets if
the first thing they want you to think

22
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,400
about East

23
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,610
K what is the impact in the society

24
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:27,939
over the Phoenix we as researchers found

25
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:31,330
day that whenever it is we found in
different technologies K because

26
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,939
more more we are trusting technology in
the four it's going to impact

27
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:38,670
our society sure thing think about it
get

28
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,079
them if you find something interesting

29
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,229
who is going to buy that again and what
they're going to do with it

30
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:50,909
so regarding who's going to buy it it's
typically close group could be

31
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:55,659
cybercriminal could be the freemen
broker assured nearly the markets that

32
00:01:55,659 --> 00:01:56,390
are available

33
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:00,479
okay undead you are going to find
government security private companies

34
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:06,470
all their ended the show the people
regarding what is going to be used for

35
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,989
think about it can be used to attacked

36
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,720
all the political systems that are
affected by that nobody without people

37
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,810
knowing about it

38
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:18,720
because if it is not even a zero-day
base unknown unknown no

39
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,950
no one's know about it they cannot be
silly different

40
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,070
act against it

41
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:28,400
show the best option is to assume juror
compromise

42
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,830
basically because you need to be aware
that there are people that know a

43
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,330
boo-boo now will be to the know about
that affects

44
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:38,200
your systems so that's a reality the
researcher

45
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,450
double a good paper system was percent
in yesterday about them

46
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:45,180
okay that I recommended you take a look
at regarding this

47
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,880
perspective air show us a researcher

48
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,390
from at this close you point of view
what can you do you have multiple

49
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,070
options

50
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:57,330
sure the first one is would be called in
the past and we will be back to that

51
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,960
responsible this bush

52
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,180
the problem is that responsible the
pension

53
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,630
air the responsibility of the bindle the
responsibility of the

54
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:08,870
researcher and a little responsibility
of each of them

55
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:12,380
which typically not the same so when

56
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,440
go back to it you can do nothing
basically

57
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,000
you can say k willing to keep table
early for my soap in it going to publish

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,910
it and it will serve the community but
this is like the

59
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:26,520
is scurry movies from from the US UK
Lake

60
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,430
a screaming all that movie is that you
know that the bad guys going to come

61
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,340
after judy

62
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:35,440
anymore okay no matter what you do at
the end it came back

63
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,709
come back to you show be careful with
adults

64
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:43,050
get the second one is would now we call

65
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:47,150
Gordin eighty dish blocks are not
responsible disclosure anymore because

66
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,840
responsibility is not very clear

67
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,390
gordon et demeans you gordon et as a
researcher with the van

68
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:56,100
case that's the the point and typically

69
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,350
researcher look for some kind of
compensation gave

70
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:04,239
just be the burgers that's fine K as he
was mention just a day to research you

71
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,220
need to think about

72
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:09,530
do we want to pay the mortgage of my
house or do a 180 shipped

73
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:13,980
some things you even need to build up
your t-shirts

74
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:19,180
because you don't even get a tissue it
would you can go to rethink this

75
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:19,799
brochure

76
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:23,330
food disposal is there more debates
somehow

77
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,919
them indoors think that's the idea show

78
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:30,580
final option to cancel it through the
bug bounty program

79
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,000
or through

80
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,260
a any of their broker sure really deeper
chase problems okay

81
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:39,480
in order to get some somebody the other
option is

82
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,610
you police they believed in a conference
she could be called conference

83
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,270
disclosure or something like that

84
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:49,910
sure regarding liability recert in the
past I fall

85
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:53,250
responsible or coordinated this poster
with the vendors to get

86
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,470
and the really stand up a story on that
was funny but this time

87
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:01,210
I wanted to research some of those been
ability prints and the markets and

88
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:04,320
they will be the go to cepted in one of
the problems

89
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,320
worse there no one was very interested
on it

90
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,700
what I learned is that may leave these
problems are focused on remote code

91
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,730
execution

92
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:15,520
local privilege escalation or some kind
of memory display issue

93
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,680
to exploit the other two so this is
their main

94
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,850
interest K it civil liability if i'm
wrong.

95
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:26,890
at the info sorry at the beginning of
2012 so about two and a half

96
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:30,500
years ago gay and it's difficult to keep
it private

97
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,860
and do you know if it is still Bali any
if it is still working

98
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,480
K and we will go deeper into that

99
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,630
after what to take with a a few days
expressly no

100
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:46,090
in wash kept repay the lightest lucid

101
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:50,010
two months ago I dreaded but they don't
need you are aware of that but

102
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:54,900
in Spain had a a huge controversy during
the last 23 years because they were

103
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,300
going to build a very

104
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,890
be casino gaming center there for europe

105
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:03,830
in Madrid so I figure out the mideast
like big cocks

106
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:08,820
what happens the madrid station buddy
and no one's know about what we person

107
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,160
there

108
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,270
so it was a very good opportunity to
came here for the

109
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:16,600
first anniversary care for your 41
instead of just days

110
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,220
I'm person that to you soul

111
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:24,510
all the things you need to think about
when you find something is and what He

112
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,670
depend someone find what the

113
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:31,850
defenders fix it in there a difference
in areas where

114
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,160
Germany ability will lose value because

115
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,190
it has been face or is not valid anymore
that today

116
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,150
the idea

117
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,680
K Shaw let them think you

118
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,520
the disclosure process from the past

119
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,620
I learned that some vendors do not take
seriously some

120
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,630
security issues with came Cup multiple
examples

121
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:58,900
show what I T like three months ago is
through to reader I asked the community

122
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,360
ayyash

123
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,880
get what do you think should be the the
Rio

124
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,949
where r researchers not be fights have
been go okay

125
00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:09,940
about WWE defender doesn't have any but
ninety bran or any other

126
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:13,060
is a brain in place like that

127
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:16,710
in a good mood bubble responses gay
people saying it depends a lot on the

128
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:19,000
bend or the researcher the complexity

129
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,560
the school the back Kate their
relationship

130
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,570
that the been there man things with the
researcher

131
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:29,910
with updates about the vulnerability
lots of different so what they decided

132
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:34,240
that somehow team show up the maturity
of our industry

133
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,289
is that they created and you okay policy

134
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:41,090
because I figure out the police East are
I mean disclosure policies

135
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:44,870
are like ash falls everyone has one okay
so

136
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:48,659
I created the moment into the room Casey
Miller two-day

137
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:52,300
the whole sentences one month into they
be four German too but what did you

138
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,150
notify them in

139
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:56,520
well because you can do it he basically
we r

140
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,639
very much to redirect even in these kind
of things okay we don't

141
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:06,159
agree on a common points so they will
literally be was notified to up along

142
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:09,710
furry 6 okay before I was going to the
person

143
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:14,400
okay be four we go deeper into the
believability

144
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,240
let's jump thank you the BBC's show that
you understand

145
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,789
what could be the impact of the nobility
NY some technical stuff that is already

146
00:08:23,789 --> 00:08:24,840
believed there

147
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,130
Easter okay what is the purpose of it so
basically

148
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:32,950
a couple as you know has a broody
business based on how was some were

149
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,250
services contents

150
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,880
lot of stuff an to give you an idea

151
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,930
they made like $60 million dollars
revenue

152
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:44,110
on the last quarter 4.4 for billions

153
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:47,279
are related to convince ID in short
we're okay

154
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,660
un in total humility gay they have made

155
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,240
mates

156
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,610
$65 billion okay in ups IRS

157
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:57,870
iPhone and iPod ops okay pain

158
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,080
15 buildings to developers okay and we
have around one

159
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,510
deal 1 million ups already available in
the market so

160
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:08,190
big numbers get this is

161
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:11,750
how the Apple all the golden apple looks
like brawl get

162
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,200
so apart from that a ball implements

163
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,839
or has a extensive program regarding
businesses

164
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:23,320
that is how you can use iPhone iPod soon
this report in your business with

165
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,250
different documents

166
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,140
a recommended to take a loop they
updated it all last primary

167
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,330
the security did Dale

168
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:34,410
okay of the IRS platforms and it's an
interesting document

169
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:38,529
okay and we have been too focused only a
very specific feature

170
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:42,339
that is implemented on the devices and
in school this Eastern Shore were

171
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:46,920
l3c so what's that this is a system

172
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,130
okay somebody that it's available on IRS
devices to prevent

173
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:55,339
downgrades the optional you installing

174
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:58,709
up reviews a US person so

175
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:03,029
because we know reviews russians put up
with nobility sergei

176
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:06,300
we don't want people to split but the
Apple message is this woman

177
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,149
is an attacker who gains possession of
iDevice

178
00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:14,130
I'm a while a nice buddhist all in all
the Russian of IRS an exploit

179
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:19,850
I would nobility there to take advantage
of that i'd you worried about that

180
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:26,860
from a business perspective for those of
you that have play with Apple devices to

181
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,209
help

182
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:30,520
downgrade a more changed if we were
bursting

183
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,980
what happens when you change the femur
person

184
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:37,820
especially you downgrade all

185
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:48,930
reinstall dipping what happens with the
you should date

186
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,910
is removed show

187
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:54,700
I'm not concerned about someone finding
my phone and I'm grading it because my

188
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,209
data is not going to be there

189
00:10:56,209 --> 00:11:00,450
what is the problem with that with
downgrading

190
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:03,990
what it allows do the community

191
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:07,769
jailbreak the devices

192
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:12,360
basically take full control of the
devices I'm break the UPL business mogul

193
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,810
because people come parade absolutely
miserable so be careful with the

194
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:17,450
messages

195
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:20,670
you get from the bindles no

196
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:24,300
the updates can be done over the year
OTA

197
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,070
okay and basically would the device is
going to do is ET

198
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:31,760
you want to update the device it's going
to connect to the %uh police deletion of

199
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,890
the rescission server

200
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:37,079
and it's going to generate Sun
measurements Creek two measurements

201
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:38,240
about the different elements

202
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,730
involved in the feel toward you are
going to booster delude let the

203
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,200
low-level Google over

204
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,610
the kernel they made I bought all the
different components

205
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:50,940
arse 3 till evaluated and you generate
some passes

206
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:55,560
about that what did you do next then
you're going to should meet those passes

207
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,300
to the up a loaf indication sure but but
the server

208
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,899
only allows you to install delete this
person

209
00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:06,600
when a new version is released they have
a very narrow window when the yellow

210
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,750
both missions the previous one in the
new one and then

211
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:13,149
only be logged in anyone

212
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:16,480
based in the device you okay that's the
the overall idea

213
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,190
the same process is based on the person
you want to install

214
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:25,029
jury unique ID for troubled banks

215
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:29,570
and an orange a run them string K we're
going to see why

216
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:30,220
it

217
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:34,130
we have three these three different
elements this

218
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:39,350
capabilities were implemented from my
arse 3 around night from 3G 3GS

219
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:43,780
financial long time ago but the region
only the only were implemented

220
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:47,310
without their knowledge so only with the
free more on the unique eighty

221
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:50,940
so what people need wash okay let me
take me three were

222
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:54,050
let me take my unique ID should meet up
to a pool

223
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:59,930
get the signature and what can I do I
can reuse the same signature

224
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:03,520
for future downgrades because is the
same device

225
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:08,220
say maybe seen fewer I want to return
back to so UPL three gran

226
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,630
that and with the introduces the a

227
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,830
nuns okay sir run them by you that is
bear

228
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:19,260
restore showed you cannot reuse a
preview seeing that you

229
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:23,080
okay because it was saying four unknowns
that is different from the one you're

230
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,740
training

231
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:27,220
its demand for danger ducing Irish by
get

232
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:30,450
so be signatures are called

233
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:35,260
SHSH blobs ok eight games for it comes
from signet you haz

234
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:39,460
basically K burn there has been a little
research especially in the

235
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,650
jailbreak CD a community with different
tools

236
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:45,750
that'll oh you do in or provide you

237
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:49,840
capabilities to be able to downgrade the
device if your store these previews

238
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,490
blobs

239
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:53,770
when Jean didn't have the knowns day as
we have

240
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:57,150
we have covered do Cup mobile details
available

241
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:01,130
these lobes are basically someone has
sis

242
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:05,000
so let's recap the process basically
what we do is we want to

243
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,670
installing if you were owned a IR device
we go to

244
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:12,460
Apple server I mean we calculate some
measurements speak to mister means for

245
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,360
the different elements

246
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,240
she did you feel we want to install we
go to a pool

247
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,050
the UPL services will get you are
running or do you have an iPhone 5

248
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,650
okayed you want to install

249
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:26,410
I S 711 therefore I'm now seeing

250
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:27,230
signing

251
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:30,620
these Russian for these device it's
going to return to you

252
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:36,030
the SHSH blobs basically a seeing a few
that validates the updating process and

253
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,170
you can update the device

254
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:40,490
that's the the norms that was introduced

255
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:45,510
he would be called the AP deak okay is
what made some possible to

256
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:50,590
be able to restore breed I mean previous
versions with your preview sis 80s a

257
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,030
table

258
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:54,100
because the bloods wilting every time to
try to

259
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,780
update or restore database that's the
okay

260
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:01,470
there was superior were it was possible
to them great devices

261
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:05,060
okay and the different options are
available there on this like basically

262
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:09,570
it is based on let's would the device on
a very own personal

263
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:12,940
I use free for example where their worst
not known

264
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:16,290
and therefore I can reuse my blow-ups
all

265
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:20,240
let's play w nobility for example all
day 84 based

266
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,000
devices Apple devices are vulnerable to
the Lima rain bootrom exploit should you

267
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,860
can exploit that dude I'm reading device

268
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:30,130
all otherwise you're pretty much limited

269
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:33,860
okay we can see that seen scientist
seeks around April

270
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:38,560
last year okay you can know the silly
downgrade the newer devices

271
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,700
is the situation we have right K in any
case you need to save your previews

272
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,230
flops

273
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:47,330
in case you need or to cap an
opportunity to

274
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:50,340
done reading device in the future you
don't know so it's a good

275
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:54,160
practice to shake them just in case if
you want to

276
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,190
say what versus are supported by which
device issue again all the company with

277
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,050
a leash usually recommend you to take a
look at

278
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:04,120
at the IRS as support matrix okay

279
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,720
so the next question is who we felt

280
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,640
abudrahm this point like the one we have
for the 84 devices can

281
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,370
we somehow manipulate the sub they
persist and do something with it

282
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:19,840
so let's take a look at it a very
significant change

283
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,890
we Apple introduced in a rest five wash

284
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:27,990
wireless capabilities in the past you
can use wireless for example to

285
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:31,420
a big the device but they introduce
over-the-air updates

286
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:34,820
so what people are doing this they are
you seeing more and more Wireless

287
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,690
stability

288
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:39,230
wifi 3G shown this report instead of the
USB cables

289
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:42,930
and they are you seen that to update the
device sold you can go to

290
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:45,990
Settings General software update okay

291
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:49,420
you can use that also to seeing or
backup your data

292
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:53,110
okay wirelessly through iTunes so in
order to do that to go to

293
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:57,459
is Settings General K AT&T wifi see

294
00:16:57,459 --> 00:17:00,600
you need to enable that first on iTunes
the first thing you gonna

295
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,689
that through USB or even you can do
backups wirelessly

296
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:08,449
in iPod occasional multiple options
people are getting used to these

297
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:11,720
they started is

298
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,880
when I was doing the research to analyze
the update process

299
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,400
and 180 school birds that the mobile
devices from Apple

300
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,270
clinic TV Apple server through HTTP

301
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:25,910
instead of HTTPS so he said would begin
in for their researcher

302
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:29,670
to be able to manipulate and no what's
going on there

303
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:33,750
in particular they connect to you miss
you though doubled it going

304
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:37,330
this is the update chicken server okay

305
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:40,690
and this is done automatically by the
device or

306
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:43,730
the user can manually force a an update

307
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:48,030
and see if there's any update K a story
short would you are going to get

308
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:51,190
he sup be leased file you know XML file

309
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:55,280
with all the current by US Marshals and
all the pointer Sun

310
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,450
descriptions regarding it spurs the
different pointers are going to point to

311
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:02,750
did tell the old server decision from
where do you get

312
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,860
then you feel worse okay which are
steeped fight scene really

313
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,900
okay so were the spiral

314
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,990
that contains the new update is located

315
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:17,610
basically send a mission server and its
cool calm Apple mobile assets software

316
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:18,090
update

317
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:22,320
the recess email our documentation file
with documentation about the latest

318
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,050
updates

319
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:27,120
okay and the fresh ones that we offer
over the year

320
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,520
using this method where they once she
did do IRS

321
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,920
501 okay some by by Bettis

322
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:38,179
also got them but deal let the first
official public

323
00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:41,870
when wash thanks you soul

324
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:42,730
let's see

325
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:46,740
how it works how in a West 5.6 we can

326
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:52,200
update our devices chauffeur support
with the device is going to do is going

327
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,220
to send the head

328
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:57,280
request okay should brace Lee in a rush
fight the use a rage in

329
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,470
a Hasson on initialize viable

330
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:04,419
so basically it was wrong and in I R six
days

331
00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:07,740
the replace that by the the the more you
that this

332
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,419
it taking place overreached a a carrying
the updates

333
00:19:11,419 --> 00:19:15,330
basically sorry second request a social

334
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:18,950
you get the response and the device is
going to check the response

335
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:22,270
and he's going to say okay the response
herself last more the fight

336
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:26,000
date so eat Mike current version

337
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,600
okay East great too

338
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,130
sorry let's say that in a different way
if the person I'm getting

339
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:38,260
is greater than the 1i aka really have I
need to update

340
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,570
I need to get the new contents so
basically this is what the device that

341
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:45,710
went to take that values going to take
the multitask stored on the device

342
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:49,270
if this one is graded what's going to do
is going to should meet at

343
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:53,070
get request gauge going to try to get
the contents from the

344
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:57,450
Apple server showed US 48 and you get
the same response

345
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:00,770
okay with the same obviously last
modified by you but now to get the

346
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,750
conference in the quantities basically
the

347
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:07,040
the least fight we mentioned before with
all the different versions available

348
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,360
covering burst 4b different mobile
devices

349
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:14,140
okay Wiese and that's important a
signature

350
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,400
so the spire has been signed with
digital certificates

351
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,260
in owned by Apple okay and the same
process

352
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:24,370
its apply to the documentation file we
mentioned before

353
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:27,419
okay sold the next question is

354
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:34,680
can we somehow manipulates the force

355
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,640
yes the delorean comes in place

356
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,990
based on what we have seen

357
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:48,530
ideas change the date somehow

358
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:51,860
remember back to the future would we
dished same states

359
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:55,680
to move to the past present or future so
wat

360
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,030
warning we change the last modified date

361
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:02,400
in the 60 DB a change would can we do
with it

362
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,100
so let's take a look at that whether you
prefer

363
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:09,730
Star Wars format REITs each your choice
now

364
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:13,360
Star Wars how many people go for Star
Wars

365
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:18,060
if you the older ones probably matrics

366
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:22,720
the more people go to format shipping
what so let's see which one is more

367
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,810
effective because these are two types of
attacks we're going to implement here

368
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:30,880
so help first of all how can we exploit
the vulnerability

369
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,300
basically what we can do is long someone
in the middle attack

370
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:38,120
it we can in person at a wifi access
point or any other mister

371
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,230
to stay in the middle between the
between the rice

372
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:44,960
and the rest of thing that's the idea in
order to do that with AD the same women

373
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,560
did a

374
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,860
a2 by some baseball call a proxy okay

375
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:52,100
that is based on police that probably
you know it is the one used in

376
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,490
nationalist report some police and even
driven

377
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:57,810
networking library and Sue Bryce only

378
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:01,880
okay twister the solo it's available in
peace that the matrics dot com

379
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:06,640
sold in much each team was already there
okay and implemented both attacks

380
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,590
so let's look take a look at both get

381
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,870
remember them

382
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:16,400
happen

383
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,660
day

384
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:23,430
is

385
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:36,980
you

386
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:41,040
very silly for support you can see the
hidden request and you can pick okay

387
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,730
let's drop the kids request

388
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:46,810
should that it doesn't complete be the
same work because he did you book the

389
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:49,350
hidden request it's going to ask for Ag
get

390
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:52,390
request okay you can book to get request
to

391
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:57,200
but what's going to happen this is not
through sprint for the usual

392
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,440
for the victims because it's going to
get up about sage sane

393
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:05,800
I cannot check if there are new updates
available she doesn't work but what the

394
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,920
we do the following: we get the hit
request

395
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,630
and we say okay the last modified
together of the response

396
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:16,120
is from two years ago basically

397
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:20,410
don't worry device did the last update:
is from two years ago to our find you

398
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:21,420
have the latest win

399
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:24,590
get and it seems that

400
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:29,320
that will be okay that will be fine so
let's take a look at that

401
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,570
let me show you these women over here

402
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:37,710
okay we're with up the device it these
devices running

403
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:43,010
613 you see that it's sending a it
request we let it go through

404
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:47,740
and we get the response from January
seen the last update is from January 20

405
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:51,790
okay because it's a new one it asked for
a GET request

406
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:55,380
and we get the response sane there's a
new one

407
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,380
but here's the content okay and didn't

408
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,820
these when he spoke burstyn 7 04

409
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,950
day the light late there's one at that
okay

410
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:08,070
we drop it because we don't want to
update the device at this point

411
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:12,350
so next weekend going to show you that
these devices running 613

412
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:15,620
okay so and all their when we are going
to play

413
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:19,190
the Star Wars or did the trick so
basically we take

414
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:23,680
I proxy we though the two to implement
the did I treat

415
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:29,580
okay and

416
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:32,169
we can impersonate any version we want

417
00:24:32,169 --> 00:24:36,250
K in this case 6-1 3-6 1-3 and we run it

418
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:39,419
so when the device connection again

419
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:43,039
to check if there are new updates what
we're going to see is that

420
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:47,350
we thought the proxy in the middle so we
take bourbon point it to i proxy so that

421
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,690
I proxy can manipulate

422
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:52,450
request on responses and its second for
that

423
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:56,570
and what's going on here it since they
hit request but now I proxy

424
00:24:56,570 --> 00:25:02,179
say don't worry the latest update is
from

425
00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:08,240
2010 okay that stated I treat okay these
are not the updates you're looking for

426
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,130
and

427
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:12,179
the device when we let the response go
through

428
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:15,630
and it is received by the device the
device s okay I'm fine

429
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:19,460
613 delays is the latest although we
know

430
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:22,630
7 04 it's available there okay

431
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:27,640
so let me only be there this is for both

432
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,990
you that selected Star Wars what about

433
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:35,370
okay this was my face when I showed that
it known I can

434
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:39,970
the SEC s that just you manipulate the
update process this way

435
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:44,360
but its so wonderful does a view that
selected matters

436
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,440
what happen in my dreams one of the year
seems

437
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,450
them him cover more view football field

438
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:54,010
right on the Blue Room saying okay to
take the blue pill

439
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:57,250
okay to wake up in your bed and eating
whatever you want to be

440
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:02,059
you take the red one okay I was just
being warm their land and we'll show you

441
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:02,710
how the

442
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:06,350
the rump holbrooke basically just a in
couple lines

443
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:11,320
and it will show you call the the update
call go did so let's know

444
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,640
did not reach the way okay

445
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,750
what if I changed a last modified hither

446
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:22,500
of the hidden request to the future so
what I'm doing is forcing the device

447
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,960
to update so the device sis

448
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,370
is there any update NaCI yes of course
these 14

449
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:33,270
twin to 2020 okay six years from now

450
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:36,700
okay we already have that update didn't
he

451
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,580
and it's going to ask for the GET
request

452
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:43,640
and I could try to modify the response
okay I'm putting the response change

453
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,140
brake

454
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:47,429
for example 704 by 511

455
00:26:47,429 --> 00:26:52,200
okay the Polynesian remember the recent
integrity check their biggest day

456
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,690
file is signed by Apple should you
cannot modified

457
00:26:55,690 --> 00:27:00,220
so what is another option we have we can
use

458
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:04,330
replay attacks because I cannot modify
the file

459
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:07,559
would be funny send you a party

460
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:11,390
quien from the past 18 recorded when

461
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:15,929
511 what's available so basically this
is the debate 3

462
00:27:15,929 --> 00:27:20,280
if I send you a file that say it's not
the latest one is 5-1-1

463
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,669
although we have 704 the device is OK
everything's fine

464
00:27:23,669 --> 00:27:27,510
so I'm updated in 511

465
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:31,370
EDS and not only that eat fight

466
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:34,650
bro bites you our last modified think

467
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:38,340
of the future saying this is twenty 2025

468
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:43,510
okay wouldn't judge or device going to
do is going to catch that

469
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:47,179
and think that 511 is the latest update

470
00:27:47,179 --> 00:27:53,500
and his body dumped in 2025 occasional
Jory inside the much

471
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,530
now the amount of time I want

472
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:59,640
YouTube either basically you're not
going to check for new updates

473
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,940
at to 2025 so that's the

474
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:06,780
the idea let's take a look at that in
the video

475
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:10,010
okay where again we see the device to
indicate request

476
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:13,610
its s 2010 okay so it's fine

477
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:16,950
it things is updated so now we are going
to implement

478
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:20,520
the matric said that K so the device is
going to

479
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:25,010
we're going to change a proxy cape from
from the did I option to the magic shop

480
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:28,250
option basically with these when he's
going to do is it's going to force the

481
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:29,780
device to look for a new update

482
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:33,799
seen there's a new one in the future and
it's going to manipulate the get

483
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:34,580
response

484
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:38,809
to provide a response that response to a
previous

485
00:28:38,809 --> 00:28:42,030
a US person that's the the overall idea
we can even

486
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:45,140
put their whatever date we won

487
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,820
okay we can manipulate the day

488
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:49,900
as we won't and CEO candidate is 2015

489
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:53,320
in this case K so there's a new update
okay

490
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,620
a that this coming from next year

491
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:59,920
basically that's the the idea so we run
that

492
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:04,240
same thing as before we take that we are
going through a proxy

493
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,520
and then we sick from the device

494
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,680
if there are any updates it gets or
since the head know the response s

495
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:15,470
2020 send yes of course there is a new
update coming from the future

496
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:21,240
going so the device n stick get request
and the response is going to get

497
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,410
is the one we manipulated through a
proxy from Sabah lead when

498
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:27,860
is bloodied up to September 2015

499
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:30,970
but what is the first thing we are
providing their Julie

500
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:35,280
we go to the other specific request and
response you can see that we're danger

501
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:35,990
their

502
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:39,440
is a the least

503
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,940
file associate the two 613 okay

504
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:47,530
613 there instead of 70 for so the
device things that seeks 13 is the

505
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:48,440
latest version

506
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:52,060
up to you next year 2015 and that's it

507
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:55,980
we remove a proxy we remove everything
showed you now connect to the network

508
00:29:55,980 --> 00:30:00,140
we felt the attacker being okay on the
money in the middle position

509
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:04,430
and you can see it since their head
request it receives the response because

510
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:04,780
he's

511
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:08,900
from 2014 it says no till 2015 and done

512
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:12,850
so he thinks its updated and it will
remain

513
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:15,900
there forever fielded a we decided to
eat

514
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:19,030
to be there okay saw at the point

515
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:22,080
when a show that you can not even that
temporarily

516
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,260
but permanently okay this was my fix

517
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:30,600
okay obviously change and I said no no
no this can not be possible

518
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:35,140
okay but remember I discovered that in
2012

519
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:40,190
okay two and a half years ago in order
to be able to launch the attack

520
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:43,730
basically you need to call a all these
the least five

521
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:47,020
from previous versions show with ATT se
created a repository

522
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:50,380
over the years collecting all these
different file so K

523
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:54,630
and the documentation fights to so that
you can air force a device to be

524
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:58,020
in any person okay you want it to be and

525
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:01,090
a I'm releasing today I to

526
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:04,680
that is a complementary tool I use
during the process and

527
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:08,590
it could be useful for you if you're
going to research about

528
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:11,780
a US updates I basically called the two
I come ashey

529
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:15,670
coming from okay I S pombe Obama while I
sit somewhere update

530
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:18,750
yeah I know doc very worried you know
about the tunings but

531
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:22,760
okay is not my business and would be
stall

532
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:26,860
the I'm releasing today is going to do
by the way the person

533
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:30,420
it's available here okay it's been
released today

534
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:33,720
the personage 41 because we are in area
41 of course

535
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,250
okay and what is the lowest you do
dollars YouTube rushed day

536
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:41,310
the least 52 struck the information from
them sorry to play some baseball so it

537
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:43,300
works fine in Windows Lena max

538
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:46,830
Mac okay as you can see here it has
multiple options

539
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:50,680
just would you do take a look at it very
quickly because it's not the main

540
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,110
purpose of the talk but

541
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:56,130
just for you do not you can stick to
meet him in person that this

542
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:59,440
available on the police file or the
maximum burst your own

543
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,810
or both their skills and you get what
you can get the

544
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:08,090
okay a brief summary for the file not to
minimum number of devices assets

545
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:12,260
and Amber seems you can get honest and
its summary about the

546
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:15,320
the file what you can do all their more
interesting sort

547
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:19,250
so you can see let me see all day US
persons that are available there

548
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:22,400
and it's going to classify all the the
three names

549
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:27,000
buyers persons on the basis that allowed
to go to those questions right now

550
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,170
based on the file all we can do the
opposite we can say

551
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:33,890
okay lemme sorry let me check all the
devices

552
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:37,410
and the different a US persons that are
specific to each device

553
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:41,570
good you can classify Bible or you can
make things or such things you can see

554
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:45,690
okay lemme for our US press you let's
say 713

555
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:49,000
I want to know what devices are
supported or I want to get more

556
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,330
information about those devices and you
can see

557
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:54,600
all the different entries or updates
that are available for

558
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,440
AIS 613 in this case for a night for for

559
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:02,470
K or even you can get even more details
with the pool the disruption

560
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:06,500
K with all the different links to the
difference if I settled he said he went

561
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,350
to process the

562
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:10,640
their big fights K just to get you to

563
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,860
a brief brief overview of it it's
available

564
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:17,390
for you seems the small get

565
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:22,500
what about I R seven when remember I've
discovered the scene not own a I Spy

566
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:26,610
the updated to I R six I reject
everything and everything worked

567
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:29,710
so when they release a i7 I thought

568
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:32,850
okay the it's not going to work anymore
obviously because

569
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:36,090
what I saw is that date change the
update process

570
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:40,830
so no based in to get request from

571
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:45,080
starting point there's no head anymore
so the severity

572
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:48,850
get try cannot manipulate the fact that
we need before

573
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:52,020
is there anything different you seen
these request

574
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:57,149
from the previous one coming from a rose
5.6 its ugly

575
00:33:57,149 --> 00:34:00,529
there is any motif I scenes together dad
thanks

576
00:34:00,529 --> 00:34:03,970
Uppal it's telling me what is the latest
version that these

577
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:07,529
extort on the device should now I can
know

578
00:34:07,529 --> 00:34:11,290
that the latest update injured thereby
says that it's from

579
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:17,070
January 7 2014 is a kind of information
is pushing this can be good or bad

580
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:21,419
we're going to see that depending on the
escenario so

581
00:34:21,419 --> 00:34:25,320
if there is no new updates what you're
going to get this appeal for from

582
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,399
Apple's servers

583
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,970
get three or four there's not a if there
is a new update

584
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:33,830
you're going to get okay that's fine a
$200 to date with the contents of the

585
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:34,330
new update

586
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:38,290
the new persons that are available
everything works like previously a step

587
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:42,770
four-decade get again matter expressions

588
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:49,030
Star Wars okay what we've got Eve we
launch this the worst attack

589
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:52,210
see missionary for if we'd love to get
we get a

590
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:55,480
a I never so basically the victim you
sure will notice

591
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,770
but what can we do we can send a three
or four response

592
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:03,930
unknown modify response we can do both
things in reality we can modify big get

593
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:08,050
request saying the latest Russian a half
each from the future

594
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:11,790
so I get a feel for or I can modify get
response

595
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:15,580
Saini some three or four even if the UPL
service are are standing up to 100

596
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:15,960
because

597
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,970
remember we need a man in the middle
esiner

598
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:21,650
okay what about the

599
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:23,910
the okay let me show you

600
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:28,430
that very quickly through different
media so basically

601
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:31,859
what we have here is no %ah a US$7 their
eyes

602
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:36,339
say missionary ice before gay with your
paper optional that you see that

603
00:35:36,339 --> 00:35:40,440
we get to get requests for saying
October 22 that's the last one that the

604
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,180
device cast

605
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,210
and the reason you when on Apple servers

606
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:48,520
so we will get a if I remember probably
at 200 response coming from January

607
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:52,080
there is a new update available okay so
we drop these when

608
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:55,880
so that the device cannot see it and we
launch again the

609
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:59,260
did I attack in this case limny speed
this up

610
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:02,560
a little bit so weak go to a proxy we

611
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,660
lunch they did I attack and

612
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:09,849
from there we go through the I proxy to

613
00:36:09,849 --> 00:36:13,260
the device is going to check again if
there is a new update

614
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:17,280
but we're going to reply with a three or
four say no there's no annually

615
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,680
there's this R&D updates you're looking
for Star Wars Attack

616
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:24,400
okay wonderful day matric said that

617
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,550
same idea okay lamee'a speed this up

618
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:31,170
we go to a proxy again we launched the
matrics attack again

619
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:35,060
K and now what's going to happen when
the device

620
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:40,160
ghosts and sex through the gate request
if there's any update

621
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,240
what are we going to do we're going to
say yes of course there is a new one but

622
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,030
we are going to

623
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:48,530
again provide up the least mile from the
past okay

624
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:51,680
that the such a shitty to a previous
version and we can say

625
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:56,510
this is bloodied up to 2020 again we can
see if you're going to trust the spy

626
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:59,940
up to whatever time in the future we
want

627
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:04,190
that's the the overall idea and as you
can see now

628
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:07,320
once the device has been Boysen with the

629
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,589
Freese basically with the a all

630
00:37:10,589 --> 00:37:14,410
police pile if were removed by proxy and
everything from the

631
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:18,650
a scenario next time the device will
check for future updates

632
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:21,650
equal receive updates whose status

633
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:25,140
from the past and therefore is not going
to be so that's the

634
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:29,790
day the it's it's not there the the last
one a hapless from 2020

635
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:31,660
you see that there know they need the

636
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:35,630
latest months from January these years
so I mean drop dropin

637
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:39,839
you have the latest get and again during
site did not reach their

638
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:43,329
and everything has been compromised

639
00:37:43,329 --> 00:37:46,720
on the device okay so this is visual

640
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,030
let something to conclusions and what is
the current

641
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:54,039
esiner irregular daschle some will be
leading the dates

642
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:57,990
it affect all the Irish russians from
five scenes they introduce the

643
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:59,400
over-the-air capabilities

644
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,400
56 n and seven up to the latest one

645
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,789
okay remembered the fight was released
at the end of 2011

646
00:38:06,789 --> 00:38:11,170
I found that early 2012 so I have been
checking

647
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:15,150
for every new person that everything is
working fine but it has not been

648
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:19,020
the that everything is Bali K and
collecting the police by assessing

649
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:19,880
mentioned before

650
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:23,270
this kind of attack alone you bury
targeted attacks

651
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:26,819
good you can select the specific meeting
the CEO

652
00:38:26,819 --> 00:38:30,829
of company and you can see ok im going
to freeze your device

653
00:38:30,829 --> 00:38:34,829
they are going to forced your device to
stay on the current version it is right

654
00:38:34,829 --> 00:38:37,410
now and we're going to see how can we
exploit that

655
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:41,190
a afterwards K for future attacks

656
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:44,390
and it's also very stealthy so I can

657
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:47,440
forced your device to be threes to the
current version

658
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,880
for two weeks and after two weeks
everything returns back to normal

659
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:55,490
should you go in an old of the metrics
very silly

660
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:58,960
manipulate candidates which is
interesting to okay

661
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,000
some limitations each June

662
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,440
try to update to the right through
iTunes the attack

663
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:10,779
dashing white the site huge you should
check complete different update

664
00:39:10,779 --> 00:39:15,000
taking mechanics a talks two different
servers it talks through the from

665
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,520
message that are not

666
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:20,059
she did to database the beauty of that
is that more and more

667
00:39:20,059 --> 00:39:24,599
Apple you source are getting used to do
everything wirelessly

668
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:27,609
not through the USB cable so it
increases their Reese

669
00:39:27,609 --> 00:39:30,849
of this kind of attack how we can be
used

670
00:39:30,849 --> 00:39:34,339
it can be even used outside of the
security field

671
00:39:34,339 --> 00:39:38,250
okay I remember when I S seven was
released lot of people were complaining

672
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,390
on the Internet

673
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:43,160
because they preferred the graphical
user interface a fire seven

674
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,520
you know that there was a huge change
between the two back

675
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:50,060
their device showed that there was a new
update and unloaded

676
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:54,370
so you have to cease 16 GX iPad and 1d

677
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:57,760
okay is occupied by the update that has
not been applied

678
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,400
that you don't plan to apply buddy to
steal their remaining on your

679
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:05,830
memory K so people complain about that
we could use this technique to freeze

680
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:06,910
your device to see it

681
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:10,110
it 1c7 and therefore okay we can exploit

682
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:13,780
okay regarding are more significant
exploration

683
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:18,480
I come three sure device make it remain
on the current version

684
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,960
and wait for vulnerabilities for the
current version such as for example

685
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,620
big go to fail will now be you probably
remember from

686
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:30,550
of week a few weeks ago okay sure
bracingly

687
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:33,570
ok and this is just speculation I notify

688
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:37,090
up alone for Murray 6 on February 21st

689
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:41,410
their release to go to fail in a hurry
to remember they didn't really didn't do

690
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:43,030
it release it for my brakes

691
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:47,320
they did on Friday night Huron in Europe
okay very very

692
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,720
re helpful for the administrators of the
forensic

693
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:54,190
a company so that they can protect their
use urs gay

694
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:58,470
hunt not for marriage says we mention
and basically the load you do

695
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:01,720
intercepting 50 traffic without
generating any warning

696
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:05,300
manipulating day she sold the less
traffic we're going to see that in a sec

697
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:09,240
so beautiful history for the nobility we
know when

698
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:12,780
it was discovered okay I obtain the

699
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:16,450
could be from all the researchers for
the update fines they didn't happen that

700
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:16,830
time

701
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:20,830
and then started to collect I notify MM
for every six

702
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:25,490
I got the 02 may take response from
there we have received your submission

703
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:28,710
then on 314 Apple came back to me and
say

704
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:31,820
you mentioned that you can do that
temporarily or permanently

705
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:35,040
can you please explain how can you do
that permanently

706
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,430
so I explain them technically how to do
it and they

707
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:42,970
I receive another email say think I mean
saying thanks for the clarification

708
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:46,390
and that muscle show which repairing my

709
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:50,120
this brochure agreed to go and one of my

710
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,059
mobile

711
00:41:51,059 --> 00:41:54,660
Apple devices that we're beating of this
attack over these two years

712
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:58,059
and one of my eye patch on Saturday much
first

713
00:41:58,059 --> 00:42:01,780
show on you update I thought all

714
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:04,980
what what's going on I mean this was a
bit in the bank's

715
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:08,460
I didn't notice that there I said in an
update if you were but it has

716
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:12,420
seen any update so %uh perhaps modify
something on their servers

717
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:16,319
show that no devices okay can see the
new update

718
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:19,829
okay so they mislead you shouldn't do
that

719
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:24,380
a seven okay for researcher has notified
you not even getting a t-shirt

720
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:27,730
be having to build their own t-shirts
okay and

721
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:31,359
it's going to percent about it don't try
to break that the mall

722
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:34,970
on the conference's okay this is
something you shouldn't do

723
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:38,599
okay so keep calm okay I'm fucked up

724
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:42,670
a in adept okay somewhat is

725
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:46,280
what what changed and what is the status
today about this movie

726
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,530
okay so this is my ipod again me up a
part

727
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:53,220
okay had a new balloon there see if
there is any update

728
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:56,780
and a when there are any excess 706 is
available

729
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:59,809
miss it what's going on with touching
show it started to

730
00:42:59,809 --> 00:43:02,869
research about it and basically this is

731
00:43:02,869 --> 00:43:06,420
see you the code a portable implemented
in their servers

732
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:10,770
basically what they did in the mission
mobile that comes every even the hither

733
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:13,980
it might be facing is missing okay or
eats

734
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:18,650
wrong the future okay because they
manipulated before to be from the future

735
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:22,089
then going to fail again then go to fail

736
00:43:22,089 --> 00:43:25,200
okay and what they do they provide you
their response a No

737
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,890
there is any update you cannot come from
the future okay

738
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:32,270
if not if it is from the past or current

739
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:36,920
everything works normally strike at 25 I
proxy

740
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:41,440
not to use through to you future day but
to use the current date

741
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,210
okay should be limited somehow the Reese
but the steel

742
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:48,859
everything works remember in a US seeks
everything works

743
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:52,540
well because the there is no Heather
from the device indicating what is

744
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:55,750
the current day and therefore they
cannot check anything

745
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:59,299
in a US 7 however they can so

746
00:43:59,299 --> 00:44:03,040
mister wash the back is the works you
can we play with i three or four

747
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:07,060
and it works and thematic setback which
is the most interesting one here because

748
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:08,290
she's the permanent one

749
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:11,860
cannot can not be extended in the future

750
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:15,150
basically what you can do as you can see
you can say to the device

751
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:19,000
keep or I'm going to fried you on the
current version

752
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,110
and you will remain there up to the next
update

753
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:26,040
so do do step one update basically
that's the idea

754
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:30,760
if you re be divulged in s think that
over time but now you can extend dash 1

755
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:35,150
wanna so let me show you that a plan to
you to run a

756
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:38,510
I like them up here but I don't have the
space on the table 2

757
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:42,390
be able to with the camera and the
devices and all that the stuff I figured

758
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:42,680
out

759
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:46,730
that yesterday so instead of being party
in just a day

760
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:50,910
with you what I was doing at night is
recording a new media producer I hope

761
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:51,970
you %uh proceed

762
00:44:51,970 --> 00:44:55,020
okay dot involvement a so

763
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:58,470
just joking do you have seen that these
device

764
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:02,280
let me go back here for a second is
running 70

765
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:06,920
704 okay so it's in an old person

766
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:12,220
and we are going to check for updates so
it's going to see the latest one

767
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:14,070
available now which is 711

768
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:18,160
so we enable the WiFi network lemme
speeded-up

769
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:22,210
a little bit okay we go to software
updates

770
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:27,870
it since the get request we get the
replacing the Lakers 1711

771
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:32,350
its comin

772
00:45:32,350 --> 00:45:35,520
from Apple servers okay

773
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:39,820
and its strong mertz no April 22

774
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:43,610
okay that's that initially we drop that
is just for you d

775
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:47,270
to look at that and we repeat the
process we did before so basically we're

776
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:48,590
going to point barb to

777
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:52,580
a proxy we are going to lunch both
attacks so that you can see that in

778
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:52,990
action

779
00:45:52,990 --> 00:45:56,170
differs Wednesday did I attack so

780
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:59,680
did temporary one we are going to

781
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,830
force the device to check if there's any
update

782
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:05,850
because we are in the meal basically we
can manipulate that

783
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:08,870
weekend should meet up 304 as you
already know

784
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:12,610
and the device things it's on the latest
person soul

785
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:15,569
let's wait for their response here we go

786
00:46:15,569 --> 00:46:18,650
we should meet that and this message
yeah 704 is the latest

787
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:23,839
although the 7 11 as we know and then
let me speed that a little bit we launch

788
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:25,380
know the matric setback

789
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:28,569
again we change that 215

790
00:46:28,569 --> 00:46:32,509
occasional we get the request for the
device is just for you to know the new

791
00:46:32,509 --> 00:46:33,900
implementation we say

792
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:37,849
their request I mean their dead last
updated: I have is from the future

793
00:46:37,849 --> 00:46:41,650
and you're going to see held Apple
server says no no no no it must be

794
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:42,400
current

795
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,240
so this is what the chains okay with the
April 22

796
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:50,200
date and what we're going to do now is
to

797
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:53,980
a compromise the device with the the new
update with the mattress

798
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:58,259
attack we point to a proxy again we
launched the metrics

799
00:46:58,259 --> 00:47:02,589
attack here me speed that up for a
second we check for a new update

800
00:47:02,589 --> 00:47:06,440
own the IRS defines the areas that I
sense the GET request

801
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:10,430
and what we do is we should meet back a
good response

802
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:13,809
that says okay the latest update these
days one

803
00:47:13,809 --> 00:47:17,279
704 for example and it's from now
basically

804
00:47:17,279 --> 00:47:20,369
June to yesterday okay

805
00:47:20,369 --> 00:47:25,410
11 something K so their device will take
the sub day

806
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:28,519
and will think it's their leaders 1704
so

807
00:47:28,519 --> 00:47:31,700
it we take a look at the police by we
will see that

808
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:34,789
it contains the update 4704 not the
latest one

809
00:47:34,789 --> 00:47:38,650
701 sorry 711 soul

810
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:44,369
know the device thinks delete this
update is 704

811
00:47:44,369 --> 00:47:47,829
and dick the date that is money for it
is the current date

812
00:47:47,829 --> 00:47:51,390
so the label releases a new update Irish
a tall

813
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:54,720
with the readings it will become a will
be threes

814
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,869
into that person okay and you can see
here how

815
00:47:57,869 --> 00:48:01,230
now it's a king that it has that update

816
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:05,739
earned that the UPL services not three
or four I mean there are no new updates

817
00:48:05,739 --> 00:48:09,660
so steel it's there what can you do with
this kind of

818
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:13,779
of attacks assay mention if your device
is in a previous version which is being

819
00:48:13,779 --> 00:48:14,749
able to something

820
00:48:14,749 --> 00:48:18,319
would we are going to see here is mine
in the middle proxy that implements the

821
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:19,549
goto fail attack

822
00:48:19,549 --> 00:48:23,730
should you can exploit for example to go
to fail attack so here I am going to

823
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:26,930
Google okay you know that Google now

824
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:30,150
even the search engine a syncretic she's
going to connect through

825
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:33,650
first of all it's the DB and then its
reach into

826
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:37,809
HTTPS okay we are going to see the look
he wrote you can see but there is

827
00:48:37,809 --> 00:48:38,369
nowhere

828
00:48:38,369 --> 00:48:42,619
but I'm in the middle in launching a man
in the middle attack based on going to

829
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:44,319
fail any shirts

830
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:48,569
any interactions you will have with the
target obligation to https will be

831
00:48:48,569 --> 00:48:49,270
intercepted

832
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:52,510
by the attacker with so they beat him
knowing is just one of the

833
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:56,809
moved my abilities that can be exploited
basically that's that's it

834
00:48:56,809 --> 00:49:00,480
you see that I'm looking or searching
for area 41

835
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:04,500
there okay and here we come the area
forty one query

836
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:08,400
day going to the Apple service but
encrypting through HTTPS

837
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:12,059
and the same idea if we go to the

838
00:49:12,059 --> 00:49:15,130
I account okay if we go to the

839
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:19,049
Apple account we enter a username and
password over here to open a

840
00:49:19,049 --> 00:49:23,470
a new session authentication we can
intercept all the traffic basically you

841
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:24,549
should name and password on

842
00:49:24,549 --> 00:49:27,920
and collect so this is what's going on
by me

843
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:32,420
speeded-up so we enter here username and
password okay

844
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:35,480
a limit show you how we can collect that
through the goto fail

845
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:39,460
at so its opening a new sexy number

846
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:42,660
we are collecting the post request as
you can see here

847
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:47,480
okay and inside dot balls request we
kept the username and password of course

848
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:48,289
in the clear

849
00:49:48,289 --> 00:49:51,359
us you can see over here

850
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:55,210
okay area 41 every year forty-ones

851
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:59,589
okay enable Napoli

852
00:49:59,589 --> 00:50:03,789
saw what is the really

853
00:50:03,789 --> 00:50:08,900
okay do you remember I'll in metrics we
could have glitches in the matrix

854
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:12,420
remember when okay things that's a lot
like like the

855
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:16,329
got like at appearing to times and
things like that the same thing happens

856
00:50:16,329 --> 00:50:16,980
sometimes

857
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:21,140
during this process of researched what
could happen is that the device

858
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:24,250
a cease one one update and therefore

859
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:27,309
would you go to check for debates there
are no updates

860
00:50:27,309 --> 00:50:31,010
showed you have the balloon there but
then jeweler have updates strange things

861
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:31,510
like that

862
00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:35,140
this is if you didn't implement the
attack properly I discovered this kind

863
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:35,400
of

864
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:38,849
of the shins shop its 2014 now

865
00:50:38,849 --> 00:50:42,720
should make questions are okay why Apple

866
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,890
you can use https for the update chicken
breasts to start with

867
00:50:46,890 --> 00:50:51,099
gay interesting probably they put too
much trust

868
00:50:51,099 --> 00:50:54,420
on the integrity verification process of
the few more files

869
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:58,420
and the in thing anyone could manipulate
the updates checking process

870
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:03,349
K he could be an issue of performance

871
00:51:03,349 --> 00:51:06,619
okay the good thing okay we're going to
have a lot of people asking for the

872
00:51:06,619 --> 00:51:06,980
fight

873
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:10,809
let's use HTTP but you can differentiate
content

874
00:51:10,809 --> 00:51:14,559
upload content from a load seeking okay

875
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:19,269
and secure one and not the old that's a
an option to pay its the BSing 1x TB

876
00:51:19,269 --> 00:51:22,589
in the other okay you can have a
conspiracy

877
00:51:22,589 --> 00:51:26,259
conspiracy theory again thinking this
was made on proposed there

878
00:51:26,259 --> 00:51:30,549
okay who knows it's open to you if you
have a name the embroidered

879
00:51:30,549 --> 00:51:34,190
least signage or devices are running the
latest version that you know that this

880
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:34,789
available

881
00:51:34,789 --> 00:51:37,910
Steelers you have seen the devices are

882
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:41,289
bootable okay and obviously we don't
Lynn

883
00:51:41,289 --> 00:51:44,489
from the past so what is the real thing
okay

884
00:51:44,489 --> 00:51:48,849
the real impact these dots me or anyone
that knows about the vulnerability

885
00:51:48,849 --> 00:51:53,119
good of this point that nobility K to
freeze devices

886
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:56,839
and display all they bring their
abilities others like to go to fail 1

887
00:51:56,839 --> 00:52:00,099
that we have seen during the last two
years okay

888
00:52:00,099 --> 00:52:03,960
or they almost 200 you have any dish we
had you know your seat

889
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:07,670
day eighty-one event this week after you
know your 7 show national

890
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:11,140
it lots of different options that
obviously Andy

891
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:15,059
wrecks that we have got you in this
two-and-a-half year period to

892
00:52:15,059 --> 00:52:19,420
okay there's only one exception went you
can easily detect

893
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:22,539
the attack which one do you think it is

894
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:27,519
if someone Freese's Joe device in a our
seats

895
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:31,529
are you going to figure out that you're
not running a $7

896
00:52:31,529 --> 00:52:35,440
most probably because the graphical
interface

897
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,799
completely change okay so that's the
only

898
00:52:38,799 --> 00:52:42,190
a scenario where it will be detected
unfortunately

899
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:45,410
just finished up okay this is the world
really be

900
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:48,640
okay we happen over dependency on
technology

901
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,280
and still the technologies

902
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:53,820
very mature insecure so I mean

903
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:58,720
its again and cannot understand how we
are still were you seen for critical

904
00:52:58,720 --> 00:52:59,320
processes

905
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:02,410
HTTP stuff HTTPS in

906
00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:06,710
devices the trip or a very be business
model as we have seen before

907
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:10,470
okay so without fun to do okay

908
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:13,490
credits for all the people that fill me
