1
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:12,530
is a press conference that makes me feel
like Justin Bieber I

2
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:16,640
see the speech just off

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,440
somebody asked me to mention something
before I started talking

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,810
is very hard to see all that it's not
important and

5
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:26,820
that's better who had their barbecue
last night

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,980
who notice to do guy that's been three
hours

7
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,060
speaking need for us candid and area

8
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:39,899
be

9
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,399
we I organized a conference myself and
the often forget a volunteer so I think

10
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,370
it's important to

11
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:48,790
whenever you see somebody in a blue
t-shirt think they're blue or black

12
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:53,900
anybody wearing a t-shirt just give them
a hug

13
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,510
good and

14
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,280
so and i win and I do absolutely nothing
actually have

15
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,100
proof the city should I got from do
security for doing absolutely nothing

16
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,740
I think everybody should be do more of
absolutely nothing

17
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:14,720
no and I'm managing to salute I active

18
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,110
I'm the chairman of the board over a
square don't hit me for that no tomatoes

19
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,300
and I'm in organizing a group home and

20
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,340
I who developed a penetration testing
execution standard if you're not

21
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,260
familiar with its

22
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:29,640
look that up but that the standard or
and

23
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,390
its bc2 around that time when we started
developing the today

24
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,960
and basically fell in love with rippling
and was looking into how can apply that

25
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,659
more work with my clients to

26
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,400
a.m. do more traveling build security
into systems from the beginning

27
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,729
and everybody knows that trip molly is
very

28
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:49,830
a

29
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,910
known in the software development area
and

30
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:56,160
its all-star at Microsoft with data
shows that he wrote

31
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,860
at by now two books I think Ian mid what
mentioned one of the books in his

32
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:04,210
the talk just a few hours ago and

33
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:07,400
that's recommended I can just stop
giving my presentation

34
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,450
let you read a book notice mister and

35
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:13,470
I think certainly something that more
people should do

36
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,110
and three important to remember and I
hope you will learn it during

37
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,020
presentation

38
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,380
and is that we are not limited to
software alone

39
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,620
we can also print model hardware weekend

40
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,290
trip travel complex systems weekend trip
model

41
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:33,440
like a car ECU is a little black box you
can still travel that

42
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,820
we're going to talk about

43
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:41,280
a.m. ever going to a back in history and
in 2004

44
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,459
yesterday went back to the 80s I'm going
back to

45
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:48,800
67 leader in presentation so we're gonna
look into history

46
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,600
and they were gonna see at good morning
computer science

47
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,519
and we're gonna go to the good morning
basics what you can do which tools you

48
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:57,170
can use

49
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:01,220
to from traveling and then we'll make
some

50
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:06,420
conclusions before key questions

51
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,170
that we want to answer when we do trip
traveling and is

52
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:13,209
what are we building we have to know
what your what we are building

53
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:17,050
what can go wrong and this is where i
think is very important

54
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:21,230
and who does been testing or anything
offensive security

55
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:25,810
week he goes and Rep

56
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:31,110
and who's more into defensive security
so why don't we all worked worked

57
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:31,910
together

58
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:35,200
and to build more secure systems its all
some fun

59
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,950
to brake systems its even more fun at to
actually build secure systems

60
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:43,910
it is true and

61
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:47,080
if you know what can go wrong that's
thinking with the attack remains that

62
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,090
and what can we also do about what can
go wrong

63
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,150
and how would you turn on analysis and

64
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,180
why do we do tripling and I I hope this
works

65
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,920
because we don't want definitely coming
in two appendices

66
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,130
AL this sure know that's inside you

67
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:11,420
anyway and if you go back to history

68
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:16,540
and now we're talking about physical
items their work

69
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:21,389
no it wasn't the skinny a.m. a buddy

70
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:25,450
by anybody know what what is is a.m.
when the first car came out

71
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:28,660
they need to make it stop is a Berlino
why we have

72
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:36,050
improved a.m. breaks exactly

73
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:39,280
breaks are not developed for murder and
a.m.

74
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,440
technologies much research for dir at

75
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,990
to make cars stop better it's made

76
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:49,350
to make up cars go faster and there's
some prime

77
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:53,360
examples of traveling going wrong his
three and there's the

78
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,030
the Tacoma Narrows Bridge

79
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,490
it was a very nice bridge at a time that
it was built it was a long as bridge in

80
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:01,039
the world

81
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,500
and body didn't take into account the
wind in the area where to build it

82
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:10,320
so when it was finished and there wasn't
very specific situation wit where was

83
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,160
a a lot of wind it started to vibrate
enough for five minutes

84
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,280
just collapsed everyone knows the

85
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,330
in number very familiar with that

86
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:23,450
it was actually very safely or plain

87
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:29,390
flying thing

88
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,030
Zeppelin

89
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,440
yeah and and

90
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,870
it was not supposed to be but it was a
very specific see

91
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,210
set of situations based purely

92
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:44,070
on arrival they had to do some very fast
movements

93
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:47,980
the cable broke a rib 21 on the backs
the actually thought about

94
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:52,060
a.m. safety issues when the bullet there
were several bags of

95
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,420
a.m. hydrogen indiscipline to keep it up

96
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:58,680
and then when the tests at the mouth
while the cables

97
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:04,280
ecstatic and its basically just got fire
some other examples

98
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,280
that everybody's probably familiar with
where some kind of traveling with Dom

99
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,690
but very specific situations we're not
taking into account and

100
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:16,820
that they can you picture to local so
this made me think when I was looking at

101
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,760
the situations

102
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,060
how can we

103
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,230
build systems better to meet a more
secure and actually

104
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:30,790
think about all the things that can go
wrong and is everybody from you would

105
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:31,560
wear report

106
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,840
is a report that was written in nineteen
seventy

107
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:40,130
it was actually mandated is 67 and we're
gonna go to

108
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:44,710
a few details of this report here so

109
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:48,659
it

110
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:51,849
it was supposed to recommend hardware
and software safeguards

111
00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:55,709
would set satisfactory protect protect
classified information systems in all

112
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:56,389
the X's

113
00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:59,739
resource sharing computer systems what
are we to

114
00:06:59,739 --> 00:07:02,939
trying to do today we are more than
forty years later

115
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:06,889
we are trying to protect multi-axis

116
00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:10,019
resource sharing computer systems
basically

117
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:13,579
were removed from was it doesn't matter
what you call it you can call it plowed

118
00:07:13,579 --> 00:07:14,029
you can

119
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:18,249
call it the Internet of Things you can
call it big which is computing

120
00:07:18,249 --> 00:07:22,059
and I always select difficult were to
say so I'm mispronouncing

121
00:07:22,059 --> 00:07:26,789
and is basically systems like they were
used in

122
00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:30,909
and a raspberry PIs every everything
that we have now is a computer

123
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:35,029
and the analyzed this and it came up
with

124
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:38,379
what I found was the first documented
threat model I'm

125
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:42,469
in Computer History is actually a very
awesome

126
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:47,049
do also design do you know it kristin is
in here

127
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:51,829
no seriously so remembers thought he was
a maintenance man

128
00:07:51,829 --> 00:07:54,879
they talk about him and I said

129
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:00,199
97 he wasn't even born by then right
mean you

130
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:03,749
and two ish if you look at it

131
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:08,110
threats that the document it in 1970 the
sound familiar to you

132
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:11,279
is is what we're trying to prevent

133
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:15,839
now and week we should do more of these
drawings

134
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:19,999
more and this is over computer system
that we're trying to build and

135
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:23,519
but they don't need to be perfect I
think that's a very important message

136
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:28,179
we don't always have to be Batman it's
okay to look like Batman I

137
00:08:28,179 --> 00:08:32,110
if I send my my child to Carnival he
doesn't need to be Batman

138
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:35,189
he's a few a.m. and think

139
00:08:35,189 --> 00:08:40,250
that he's Batman if it

140
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,810
that is the concept of minimum viable
products

141
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:45,970
if you look at the way report and I just

142
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:50,520
everybody reason we report good those
people that don't know history

143
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,840
about to be did we're talking about
middle viable product

144
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,620
to do a report identified all the issues
in ninety-seven

145
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,180
the first and know when one of the
issues that he identified

146
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:07,550
was memory corruption a shared memory as
an issue and

147
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:11,490
if you look at all a lot of the exploits
a moment memory

148
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:15,130
a.m. related exploits the first time
that

149
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:18,360
is enormous actually implement its
wasn't 2001

150
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,890
that is more than thirty years later and

151
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:25,330
and the final implementation was in 2007
when

152
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:30,990
all the major wishes or is a large is
actually

153
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:34,470
another example minimal but viable
product and

154
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:38,800
everyone to play a game we were out last
night

155
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,610
and is actually pics from last night I
like to use pictures and

156
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:46,740
there are just really to nothing and
we're having fun

157
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:50,850
we entered a bar and there was this game
it's just a simple wooden law

158
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:54,870
you get a hammer a good news you don't
need more to have fun

159
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:57,950
you talk about least

160
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:01,310
and product that is valuable for your
customer that time

161
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:05,550
an not a good example

162
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:09,070
minimal viable product is Windows XP
what

163
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:13,080
we've always focused on the news Windows
XP as a as the fall

164
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,630
a.m. part of our existence is basically
why

165
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:20,400
why we we as the industry's protecting
Windows XP right

166
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,840
and but there's very important message
when you talk about minimum viable

167
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:35,480
product your own true should be

168
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,880
when I when I talk about learning to
learning to shipping

169
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,960
we as a as a security community is
security consultants

170
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,110
always talk about the cost of repairing
bridges in the past

171
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:50,150
what we forget is that there's also a
cost not shipping products

172
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:54,150
if you don't ship a product you don't
make money so you have to accept that a

173
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:57,670
certain point to run a ship the product
there's probably a formal

174
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:01,150
but people want to be free if you wanna
make money even be able to improve it

175
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,510
and that's how

176
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:05,970
Microsoft min from Windows XP windows 7
and no

177
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:15,000
should show did you know the total
threat modeling

178
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,120
the basics and this is basically the

179
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,270
process that I use when I work with
clients and Detroit morning

180
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:24,910
and there's two streams you look at a
system a

181
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:29,200
holistically UBC just look at the system
identify all the components

182
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,240
a you can use different tools that I
will mention leader and

183
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,810
and you also in identify to counter
measures that are in place

184
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:40,250
and we look at assisting you don't only
look at the software is your building

185
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,740
you're also looking at the that
furniture building on

186
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,910
and security properties of the heart
which are building you know

187
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:50,390
already is supposed to run on because
there are under measures there that you

188
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,090
can leverage

189
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:54,310
you shouldn't think that a.m. for
instance

190
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:58,620
you should build your own crypto I think
that's the worst idea we see it a lot

191
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:02,430
but is all always be that you can use

192
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,550
in 20 s and and on on the hardware level

193
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,640
that you can leverage their tried and
failed took countermeasures

194
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,080
at the same time you can identify the
traits when you

195
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,300
have a proper diagram for a story behind
your

196
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:19,730
the anchor system it was also important
is that you identify different actors

197
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:22,980
because it really is nothing on its own
you need somebody

198
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:27,550
that basically hits you in the face
leverages threats than

199
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:33,560
you define a strip mall a report if you
didn't do need is known to be a final

200
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,120
report

201
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,310
and you hopefully put it in a loop and
make sure that your

202
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:41,890
sisters better again I stress that

203
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:45,070
if you make a treadmill all it doesn't
need to be perfect

204
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,490
you need to be good

205
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:49,930
and understandable doesn't need to be
perfect is noting

206
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:53,930
like perfect first thing you can use

207
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:57,360
diagramming ever familiar with a.m.

208
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,760
beautiful diagrams probably so

209
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,630
and vidor's what you base your try to do
when you look at a system

210
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:09,360
and is in the best-case scenario is a
etsy.com

211
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,860
more complex system gonna start
diagramming and

212
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:16,510
you if you're your actors you job is
squares

213
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:20,670
your different processes which are
symbols in any

214
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:24,390
the datasource which are two lines with
this texting between

215
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:28,140
and that for me the best way to

216
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,820
to look at the system but sometimes is
not enough you're gonna have

217
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:36,230
a.m. very small part of your if your
system that you need to analyze for dir

218
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:39,280
and for that when I normally use

219
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,620
is assuming that gramm so you gonna

220
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:45,620
is basically the same diagram at a as I

221
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,760
a.m. drop through before

222
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:55,120
that is titled I roomies from the easier
to look at very specific parts are that

223
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,350
you need to delve further into

224
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:59,350
the most boat important thing about a
diagram

225
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:03,850
when you make a diagram is that it tells
a story if you can go to your diagram

226
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,960
and there are no what's where who

227
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,650
any any questions left you can just tell
a story from your diagram

228
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:13,760
emissions by the whole user experience
on what happens with your

229
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,000
with your system then you have a good
enough diagram

230
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,650
there will be moments that you

231
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:24,950
cannot use diagramming for instance if
you use an external

232
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:28,350
API and you don't know what happens
inside

233
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:31,880
you know what send with you you know
what to get back and

234
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:36,090
the you don't you don't have the quote
and you don't know the whole system

235
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:39,440
and by yourself so in that case

236
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,390
what I normally do is work do workshops
with the team and

237
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:47,230
that are scenario-based the

238
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:50,750
ideal way to approach that is to

239
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:54,970
think like in the movie and we actually
call that movie blocking scenarios

240
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:58,220
you think what what is the worst thing
that can happen

241
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:05,120
and in this in his application and again

242
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,190
and I don't have any ash into quotes

243
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:11,510
oval terrible this is very important to
remember

244
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:14,510
and you get always do do better diagram

245
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:19,320
a certain point you have to live with a
diagram and when I suggest there is

246
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,140
you also also record your assumptions
there's always things that you don't

247
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,320
know about your system

248
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,070
and that you will have to just assume

249
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:32,960
just to record those and s your as a
diagram or else you're a treadmill is on

250
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,620
a.m. those a assumptions are gonna be

251
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:41,460
proven true or false and because you're
recording

252
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:45,470
you can you can track them and then and
the

253
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:49,910
dergham the out basically a.m. on what
you're in for a major system

254
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:54,990
washers build

255
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:58,330
a.m. builder

256
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:02,980
diagram or I'm they see me the story
about your system

257
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:07,120
the next if you're going to do is I did
find a dress and hinder 7

258
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,280
several ways to do that Microsoft a.m.

259
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:14,020
he suggests just right is everybody from
you with right

260
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:17,580
and some people are

261
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,670
a.m. just strike is basically just 'em
no money to

262
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:24,370
remember and the them the most common
types

263
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:28,000
of after its you see

264
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,010
disproving basically means pretend to be

265
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:34,820
something or some someone else in the
system and

266
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:38,170
at decide important important because it
indicates

267
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:47,429
will you find those if we go back try to
go back again

268
00:16:47,429 --> 00:16:49,939
so if you look at this diagram and I'm

269
00:16:49,939 --> 00:16:53,049
very sorry that don't have to whitewater
anything

270
00:16:53,049 --> 00:16:56,179
and between pretty to abrasion your

271
00:16:56,179 --> 00:16:59,489
processes there are boundaries dude
boundaries

272
00:16:59,489 --> 00:17:02,549
are very very important to remember
because

273
00:17:02,549 --> 00:17:06,510
the they're mostly the places where your
full your trips will

274
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:14,539
will exist if you go back to the
straight side tourist indicates

275
00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:17,970
spoofing pretend to be somebody or
something else in the system

276
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:21,600
and these to her usually found in
external entities

277
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,870
squares you saw and users or processes
and procedures were two circles so

278
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:30,059
and tempering which is basically

279
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:34,580
at changing information in the system
that usually found in data stores

280
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:37,649
data flows is on the lines between two
different system

281
00:17:37,649 --> 00:17:41,490
between different processes and the and
the actors in a datasource

282
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:46,240
and oren process repudiation

283
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,039
and always forget what it what it means

284
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:54,779
i'm looking and

285
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:59,100
repudiation is bisbee being able within
your system to see

286
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,880
who did what when why a.m.

287
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,010
if you can suffer death you can break a
system to those are usually found

288
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:12,179
in process interests are we going to
information disclosure is

289
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:15,950
well everybody understands information
disclosure and those are usually found

290
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:16,679
in processed

291
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:20,320
the distortion data flows talking about
denial of service

292
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,299
at to those are phony processes data
source

293
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:28,610
and data flows narrow vision of
privileges which is

294
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:32,019
golden source I are you he found in

295
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:39,190
in process themselves

296
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:42,049
that is the point where I have to
mention the card game that is called

297
00:18:42,049 --> 00:18:45,500
television religious is a free car game
is developed

298
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:49,520
by Microsoft team you can download it
concur departure self

299
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,830
NBC would with your whole team you can
play the game you need a diagram

300
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:57,520
your application and you start
identifying threats by playing the card

301
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:57,820
game

302
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:02,159
it's a bit like poker their trump cards
it's actually very fun to do

303
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:05,539
a should read it to do that with you
with two different systems

304
00:19:05,539 --> 00:19:09,110
oversee stride is not always enough

305
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:12,620
it's very good tool but it's also a
limited because it s

306
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:15,809
only do five traits and the D

307
00:19:15,809 --> 00:19:20,159
mister so there's no other way

308
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,690
at Wieden & identified threats and it's
based on a dock levelers

309
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:26,720
everybody's familiar with the was put
them

310
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,110
that's basically a tech lab where you
can use and

311
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:33,280
but there's you can also make internal
checklists

312
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,700
as you travel you build a body of
knowledge

313
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:40,450
that you documents and that you can go
to and

314
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:44,780
you'll be able to treadmill applications

315
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:48,230
that are similar two previous
obligations or systems

316
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:51,789
that you have built and better also

317
00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:55,159
travels out there from other systems
that are similar to your system's

318
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:59,039
that you can leverage and k take

319
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,659
I've tried to work with the pic it's a
very complex system is very

320
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:06,440
and very deep there's a lot of
information there but its

321
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,440
it's hard to relate that to morning
exercise

322
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,909
and I'm much more if every using stride

323
00:20:12,909 --> 00:20:17,880
and building your own attack left my res
because all the applications a system

324
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,480
that you will build a human being

325
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:25,130
a.m. are very similar so using your home

326
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:28,580
a glamorous i think is the best way to
do it

327
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:31,700
they are very useful

328
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,260
if your developer he is not very
familiar would attack a stretch

329
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:38,990
so if you don't have a lot of people
that have a.m. the

330
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:42,330
attacking mindset then it's very very
interesting to

331
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:47,710
use attacked my res another tool that
you can use

332
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:50,830
and you see that I don't offer

333
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:55,450
one way to do traveling and I can't
written warnings about knowing tools

334
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:56,360
that you can use

335
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:01,350
in applied in in a different situations
Bruce Bruce Schneier had a nice thing to

336
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,309
say about the

337
00:21:02,309 --> 00:21:05,799
a factories and I find them very useful

338
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:09,640
when you do traveling for for blackbook
systems

339
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,940
if you talk about a car ECU or or

340
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:18,539
the man and payment terminal you don't
know a lot about two systems

341
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:22,150
and analyzing them from from the

342
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:26,030
to up to the silicon is very expensive
so

343
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:30,450
will you be gonna do is see and where
are the essence in that thing

344
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:34,120
should if talk about payment the term or
phrase: is going to be

345
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,630
easing their a.m. there's gonna be
forwarded you can obtain

346
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,799
and you I don't produce as balls

347
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,980
you're a techie did those dues as has
become

348
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:47,039
what the attacker once out of your
system

349
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,480
that's valuable to that to the attack
and then

350
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,870
you going to do step-by-step analysis of
what rather than a decade need to do to

351
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,030
obtain those assets

352
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:59,179
was when daily those assets your system
is compromised

353
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:03,090
a.m. act right you

354
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:08,080
draws some kind of attack issues you see
that references issues step 3:

355
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,940
3.1 you don't want the city a tech tree
but you can also first

356
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:15,890
facility ektu what I really like about
at the crease

357
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:19,100
is if you build in building this we you
add

358
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:23,220
identify two places in your system that
you can protect your

359
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:30,850
application on your system and in the
most economic manner

360
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,530
know what can you do the different
approaches

361
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:37,820
and in traveling there's assets and
reproach

362
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:41,340
and that is the easiest way to do it for

363
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:46,640
teams that are not very familiar with
the we with wooded attack reminds

364
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,240
and so you can identify at the most
critical

365
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:55,100
assets what is valuable to you manassas
as it is not only what is up with vote

366
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:55,660
to you

367
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:59,700
want to protect what's WG valuable to
you but you also want to protect

368
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:03,340
what's valuable for the attacker what
does

369
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:08,120
what does he want to have out of your
system too good at it and then tried

370
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,420
assets and from there

371
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,780
you gonna build your travel your
approach

372
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:16,610
is again the attacking mindset an
attacker central Bruce you focus on your

373
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:17,660
dressing your truth

374
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:21,250
trip actors and culture and travel to
their

375
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:24,420
the four-step

376
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:28,110
and I believe this is the most important
part

377
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:31,280
for me doesn't and when I generate a
report

378
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,010
you will be very disappointed where you
see it at Morning Report

379
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:38,190
everybody expect like a fancy diagram
with all

380
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:41,600
like bombs exploding should your doesn't
happen

381
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,570
its basically me to excel sheet where
you list all your different threats

382
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:48,860
and what did weather impact this and

383
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:52,280
how you gonna medium trade-in you
identify traits

384
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,290
document them and Excel is best to ever

385
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:59,390
I think like ninety per ninety percent
of the company's the world still run on

386
00:23:59,390 --> 00:23:59,850
XO

387
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:03,690
and you validate address I would very
different attracts

388
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:07,490
and you see the are feasible a dar
protectors

389
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:10,500
within your print model and that are
actually

390
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:15,210
should issue

391
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:19,150
credible to to use those threats to
compromise your system

392
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:23,240
and they have three choices get
eliminated

393
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,950
let you take it away by reengineering
your application or system

394
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:30,750
and by building in safeguards you can
mitigate it read

395
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:34,559
and with mitigation you don't take it
from Pune but you make it more costly

396
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:35,450
for your attacker

397
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:39,440
I'm to to actually use to treat and then

398
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,650
and it's very was English word

399
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:48,770
it doesn't from national security
professionals to see

400
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:52,840
we accept it read but at a certain point
we go back to the concept of minimal but

401
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,400
viable product there

402
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,450
there is a need to accept different
sometimes and

403
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:02,010
it's too costly to root mean mediated
and some thank you users are not asking

404
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:02,450
for it

405
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:06,120
so why which one to spend money on

406
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,510
a mitigating them or you can

407
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:14,750
eliminating them the pentium

408
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:19,610
we too fast and conclusions

409
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:22,690
good morning it's not rocket science
a.m.

410
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:26,290
I'm not the smartest most smartest guy
in the room if I am then problems

411
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:30,130
wrong and to I believe everybody's can

412
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:34,550
and would both no really focused on
experience and it's what you know about

413
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,600
your system's about your organization

414
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,540
and and that that's why I don't like to
do the trick morning on my own

415
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:44,730
if I do it with the with clients and I
can work with these themselves

416
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:49,020
because the No what's valuable to the
company and in order system better than

417
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:49,440
I did

418
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,080
or denial would ever do and models need
to be good

419
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,320
reliable but they don't need to be
perfect I guess it before

420
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:01,160
and its important know that

421
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,640
cross-disciplinary function talking
about experience

422
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,000
the best way to do it is work to
developers but also work with your

423
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,990
security people

424
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:12,750
if you a people and and a few people

425
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:18,059
every you

426
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:20,320
1

427
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,740
and to you a people know what goes wrong
in your system

428
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:27,610
ABC that all the time developers build
functionality

429
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:31,340
to a people beat the shit out of action
on the issue what goes wrong

430
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:36,030
so they didn't give a very valuable in
the truck moving process a.m.

431
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:39,570
through what you will notice and

432
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:42,820
when I when I do too morning train I

433
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:47,669
I don't have likes it exercise do with
the woodland I was with her all systems

434
00:26:47,669 --> 00:26:51,179
BBC three different groups and people
start modeling on the

435
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:56,299
on the whiteboard in on them and flip
charts

436
00:26:56,299 --> 00:26:59,890
and

437
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:04,210
you see that they are familiar with the
concepts you through jury

438
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:07,720
and with you see that they are familiar
with doing this

439
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:11,900
did you already have a week diagram know
me and everybody in the

440
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:15,309
in from me diagnose in the same we

441
00:27:15,309 --> 00:27:18,750
it just about Trish structuring the
tripling

442
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:24,640
everybody talks about being an agile

443
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,520
goes you know we don't need to document
any more and it's much faster to create

444
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,210
fillable application a

445
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:35,720
the tripling is about requirements just
as

446
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,390
and agile processes but it's about
security fines it's about building

447
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,760
better quality products

448
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:47,000
it's about building building resilient
products what you need to do

449
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,150
as an organization is built right
moments Brisby into your

450
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:54,500
engineering culture and boo trini but
also to process

451
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,809
you make the process that is also
already this be there

452
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:00,820
and explicit make it mandatory

453
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:04,299
if you look at my pursuit for instance
if there is a.m.

454
00:28:04,299 --> 00:28:07,820
fortunately that somebody wants to build
into

455
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:12,140
into a product at the need to come with
a treadmill before it even considered

456
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:16,130
to be implement I think you're over
musicians do software

457
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:20,429
ordered all systems a.m. should
implement a process like that

458
00:28:20,429 --> 00:28:24,120
that makes traveling mandatory so you
start thinking as an attacker

459
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,460
a start building the fences from the
start and oats

460
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,560
have been treated Justin come in

461
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,410
in if you report with two hundred to
cross site scripting a sequel injection

462
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:38,160
for BP's see

463
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:49,690
or something else I wanted to see

464
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:53,350
right a.m. was also important to you you
know

465
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:56,780
is that true morning is not something
that you only do

466
00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:00,840
when building new systems thinking there
there was a very good presentation I

467
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,070
think one or two years ago at forty fort
Mumbai

468
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:07,000
only white house and gonna forget with i
think is

469
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,440
I'm not not gonna mission which
companies would because I don't remember

470
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,230
and bed he provided than

471
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:17,780
mythology to truck moving existing
systems

472
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:21,580
and that something you can also do his
truck moving

473
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:25,470
is about reading the diagrams meeting
the story behind your system

474
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:28,750
and if you look at a at an existing
system

475
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:32,450
you can build from the ground up you
look at yours as understandable your

476
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:35,460
operating system then you install

477
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,630
prerequisites for you for this is to
your building

478
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:41,700
issue a change in the system order extra
use created

479
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:45,020
goes across boundaries if process run on
their

480
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:48,960
different a.m. users there's trust
issues

481
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,380
you're going to see which no which
components are installed

482
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:56,280
you gonna go to System for deferred you
actually traveling

483
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:00,070
an existing system was not limited to
only building new system

484
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:03,650
systems is also applicable to existing
systems

485
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:08,110
and in the net since defense news ken
starr print morning

486
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:11,309
the whole organizations system by system

487
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:14,580
to to build better defenses

488
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:18,730
and I think actually everything I wanted
to see about

489
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:30,110
morning for any questions

490

what some these things look like

491
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:39,160
that do you have any examples that you
could show us

492
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:43,590
love what an actual threat modeling
exercise looks like

493
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:47,040
a.m. you don't know me that does anybody
