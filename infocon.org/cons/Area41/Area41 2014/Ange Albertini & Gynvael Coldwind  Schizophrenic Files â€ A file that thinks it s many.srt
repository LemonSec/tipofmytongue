1
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:11,230
okay that's all

2
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,580
we'll talk

3
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,400
and

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,220
this is I

5
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:22,860
so menem's can be programmed I'm a
security researcher general secretary

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,250
city often

7
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,960
and pick up to as the sites say like
hamburgers

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,070
and actually all opinions expressed the
range I express linguistic

9
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,260
to me and opinions my

10
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:41,040
my lawyer my employer and

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,180
I'm a reverse engineer and I'm the offer
with cycle go to me

12
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,750
which is about reverse engineering and
visual documentation so

13
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,329
first to introduce what we mean with
this gives a pretty fun sits like

14
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:56,190
it's one file dots doesn't generator no
its not about expedition a crush

15
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,609
here its working under two different
tools book or

16
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:02,910
more and each time giving a different
outputs so

17
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,200
not a rosebud something different the

18
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,420
in the also very important it's not like
to file is just check comparing some

19
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,410
internal russian and then behaving
differently

20
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:16,000
it's like made passively because of a
discrepancy

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,500
between two passes for example so

22
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,240
the reason behind this are your full
first to arm

23
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,870
in fate and I have been re experiment
with the

24
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:31,110
specific fis independently in the past
and then

25
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:34,770
together we have gathered in of much
gerald for: all talk on the subject

26
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,080
the roof main reason was fun because

27
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,400
usually such case don't generate any
kind of security

28
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,370
but they could but it's not like it
would be calm a CV by themselves

29
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:49,490
so the first reason is fun and then of
course they are application so even if

30
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:49,780
its

31
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:53,940
sounds like fun there could be several
applications like bypassing security in

32
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:54,740
various ways

33
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:59,020
N one of the most to a famous example is
due and region Seidenberg

34
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,540
much to keep saw first a 102

35
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,759
been found which we talk about this
topic okay to serve the first example

36
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:08,670
because we have quite all the examples
here

37
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:12,390
first example is the zip file who is
familiar with the piracy

38
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,880
okay just getting this is actually a
mixer

39
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,390
experts from my talk which lasts done in
Polish language I don't expect to be

40
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,170
slow

41
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:24,930
everyone knows posed by rissoli written
English the

42
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,760
so the first zip trip which was actually
100 must 30

43
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,030
bike basically in the archive you can
place a couple of fights with have

44
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,940
which have the same name like the exact
same name offers a can of compressed

45
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:41,670
response from by the system became
change my name to hex edit or whatever

46
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,019
right

47
00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:45,330
so what the standard

48
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,840
and you should read research paper it's
actually pretty awesome is

49
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,720
hit return in our home which had 25
member same way

50
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,980
and torrents talk about signing

51
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:00,400
westtech on 15 about actually the second
by russell bliss used

52
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,150
later on which means would bypass the
signing because required to use for

53
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,290
signing was okay but the second loss
last

54
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:10,549
second one of the body so this is the
most simple to just like having a couple

55
00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:14,870
same names for are number

56
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:19,430
second trick with that is actually a
little more pacific Sunwear slights

57
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:23,079
and well as you know visit fight begins
with T

58
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:26,190
taylor's right wrong so

59
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:29,519
extremist mature actually nobody knows
how to

60
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,799
interpreters but we'll get to it so
basically you start summer at the at

61
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,379
and very something cold

62
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:40,989
about and of central directory which is
a small head there

63
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:45,260
which has a pointer to Miller boat more
factors which are in the middle

64
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,620
now the problem here is that actually

65
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,750
we don't know how big this header at the
end is

66
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,980
ver for we don't know where to look for
it because

67
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:58,250
it s a bit and was Heather versa comment

68
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,180
and the comment is variable size which
means but my head there can be anywhere

69
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:02,799
from

70
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,879
like just into profile with no comment
at all

71
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:10,180
or it can be welllll 64k

72
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,790
in to to the beginning of the file with
a really long

73
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:17,949
comment so this is the first problem

74
00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:21,570
exiting a defined and visit standard
where to start looking for a bit because

75
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,019
we can

76
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:26,280
look for it in two different ways right
we can look stars as the hands and then

77
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,830
assume we have a comment of length 0 and
three

78
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:34,050
look for Heather van very but and very
likely to rate

79
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,300
maybe there is a comment %uh flank one
maybe of to me.

80
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,580
move to that beginning cover fire
looking for a header

81
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:44,039
and central directory on the other hand
we can do it the other way

82
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:47,760
I mean we can assume but there is a long
commenter is a 64 kilobytes

83
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,229
comment and then decreased the size of
government by one and look

84
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:54,699
very so Visser to ace

85
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:58,300
which leads to schism from you but I'm
going to get to it because no

86
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,580
I'm going to talk about something
completely different which

87
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:05,000
is in three different because I'm going
to talk about the another had the riches

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,220
in the zip file so

89
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:10,840
but decided to begin in here this is
actually this isn't as a pet services

90
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,330
usually what we see silver is a local
file header its it's actually a

91
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:16,240
structure which

92
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,440
but the strikes one single file

93
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,030
one single file which has been as it and
actually very quite a lot of local file

94
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,320
headers and as a pile

95
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,530
and now for so actually

96
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,659
each fine as it has has this and

97
00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:33,659
now there's also something called the
central by rectory

98
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:37,169
its place newbie and to visit file and

99
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:41,990
it also has an entry for each file which
is compressed these are kinda redundant

100
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,789
so if one is broken you can always use
the other

101
00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:47,660
and there are quite a lot of problems
with it

102
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:51,040
and however getting back to to the point

103
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,610
sorry okay some getting back to the
point the band

104
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:59,050
central director if we find it it
actually has a pointer to the central

105
00:05:59,050 --> 00:05:59,770
directory

106
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:02,770
and invest central directory there are a
lot of files

107
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:06,540
as the entries for refiners and there's
also a pointer to the

108
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:10,240
well to the local file header and the
data because the data is always the

109
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,390
report profile Heather

110
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:15,380
so against the question arises why do we
need the central directory we can just

111
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,110
go through

112
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:19,240
feathers right another problem is

113
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,380
about actually a local file header
doesn't have to be a good

114
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,180
the beginning over files but what they
said about is wrong to assume but

115
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,370
to tell you that there's are always at
the beginning to fight because at the

116
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:30,640
beginning to the file you can have

117
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,270
anything and the local file header can
start somewhere else and persist through

118
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,370
a valid zip file

119
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:38,450
because well the central directory will
point to the parser

120
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:41,620
to whatever restructure its and now

121
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:46,590
you can of course try to and they say
assumed you can build one and the other

122
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,080
like

123
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,400
would one and the comment of the other
however and

124
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,770
thats drivers and it doesn't really work
so well

125
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:57,940
Parsons stupid now a you're looking for

126
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:01,290
well you're looking for how to parse

127
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:04,660
zip file am we can actually do it

128
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,710
a couple ways I already mentioned two
are you looking for rentals

129
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:11,900
introductory from assuming we're there
is a large come into some members 0

130
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,640
comments tho

131
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,400
another way but is down is we can assume
about we just ignore it

132
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,250
and go through local file header them
but they because we have a sizable data

133
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,910
recovery skipper even get to the next
fight and so on and so on services

134
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:24,750
through policy

135
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:28,860
am and while most others that fights can
be

136
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,990
passed in this way because their
properties that buys

137
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:36,350
rich don't put any government in between
also

138
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:39,830
for something I would like to go
aggressive string parsing which means

139
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:43,900
maybe a parser cam look for the
signature

140
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,900
in the file and when it finds it it can
assume we'll missus

141
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:51,560
missus some filing does that I'm going
to try to pass a try to extract

142
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,289
let's call this aggressive strain now

143
00:07:55,289 --> 00:07:58,699
created actually think growth abstract
zip which

144
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:02,259
modus all these ideas into one file so
we have one file

145
00:08:02,259 --> 00:08:05,610
which can be parsed increase for
different ways using

146
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,360
well the and and where it is

147
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,800
because maybe skip your and

148
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,240
thirst riches meaning but there is no
comment at all

149
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,469
vendors arts first 30 means there's a
huge comment and the comment

150
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:24,909
this actually there is this and first
look and the central bank three Heather

151
00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:28,580
and also like all the other headers vers

152
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,909
also another stream a sheer and the
place in this

153
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:35,219
I'll missus actually not linked to
neighbor vis

154
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:38,219
nor vis business is a separate file
which

155
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:41,819
if you start parsing from and like you
should you never encounter

156
00:08:41,819 --> 00:08:45,339
and there is also something thanks
brokerages that which is actually got a

157
00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:46,290
bit in between

158
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:50,089
and after but there is another local
file header with data now

159
00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:53,779
let's look what how different
programming languages

160
00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:57,399
reacts to it missus pipeline and pipe
from the sort that should we do

161
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:00,930
it means that actually when I give it to
this so

162
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:04,680
sorry this opens new abstract zip file
and Prince it and it

163
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,069
this place on the band's first five
which is the proper where

164
00:09:08,069 --> 00:09:11,230
way of Parsons now if you do

165
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:14,880
did I'm in PHP's obvious culprit right
everyone something

166
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,240
weird mineralogical for beauty and each
piece ace

167
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,010
starts versus and decide it's the same
archive as before us

168
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:25,360
items submitted actually refers to
different fire and this is fully a

169
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,160
different file

170
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,510
now let's go for some more weirdness you
da bomb

171
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:32,990
at so dumb has something called
InputStream

172
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:36,449
and the dust string parsing so opening
the same obstructs

173
00:09:36,449 --> 00:09:40,480
archive well it it sits on the bed read

174
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,730
underscores 35 which is totally
different now if we

175
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:49,980
am if we go been look which been looking
aggressive forensics tool but

176
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,420
is supposed to find many fires 265 over

177
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:57,209
by Syncrude including aggressive one and
lists so

178
00:09:57,209 --> 00:10:01,519
what's really good am to some obvious
actually most the publication

179
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,260
and most other libraries libraries in
programming languages

180
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,510
open

181
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,960
and first base assume there's no comment
at the end and third

182
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:14,180
looking for a header from better and I
guess on the pH

183
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:18,320
the and CEO does goes for the 31st

184
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,540
bio and top and rub the ghosts

185
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:26,290
for forest stream RC quitters this is
the body incorrect I mean this may pass

186
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:29,260
but this is a link or you shouldn't do
it his way unless you're like

187
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:32,670
RC streams see but citizens

188
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:36,750
correct to do it a I guess on the forums
extols

189
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:42,100
do am well finds this aggressive strain
which is which is good

190
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:47,160
now I would like to thank these people
wonderful excavation and you for

191
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,960
actually run it'll dissipation recess
for me I'm assuming but payroll

192
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,230
okay and %uh don't have any explicit but
thank you

193
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:58,790
and but why do we care so well it could
be

194
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:01,930
used to bypass some signing actually did
during

195
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,940
code review find a bag like this them

196
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:08,880
and our papers verified using and first
method but when it last

197
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,480
extracted using extreme from the
beginning to the final

198
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,510
service happens however

199
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:19,200
what they did I started a bit for copies
of despite and thirst

200
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,270
putting a car by roosters inside

201
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:27,060
each position and well most and two
purposes perhaps

202
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:30,610
which is which is actually good because
this means that well

203
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:34,580
most applications opened it this way so
much but should be OK however some

204
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:39,460
applications thirty-some anti-virus
likes of towards try to open this

205
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:43,020
and passes stream only which means it
doesn't buy never finds

206
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:46,400
the fire switch opened by am

207
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,990
well by using most of the applications
which is which is that for all tests you

208
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,940
can you confirm

209
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,300
you can see from here I suspected which
has

210
00:11:54,300 --> 00:12:00,980
over results

211
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,449
so

212
00:12:01,449 --> 00:12:06,139
I look on with the PDF from it if you're
not familiar with the PA fight for my

213
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:10,110
I did a one on one with videos and
examples here's your own

214
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:13,839
and just serve as a reminder so PDF file
is made

215
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,680
of different objects that refer to each
other your structure

216
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,839
aircraft struck just for you see the
trailer the route to pages and so on

217
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:24,379
and basically here the trailer is the
one pointing to the root

218
00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:27,910
and if you have an extra object that
would be wouldn't be used by the other

219
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:31,069
refrence by the other object that would
be fine so you can I do

220
00:12:31,069 --> 00:12:35,279
to do so far is it object which means
that the

221
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,910
so when PDF reader sees a document

222
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:43,199
it means it's actually file found the
right trailer and the roots

223
00:12:43,199 --> 00:12:48,180
a new route object and then everything
can be can independently quick system

224
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:48,899
the same file

225
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:53,230
so basically if we see to fight for
late-stage to start X revlon should be

226
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,550
preceded by the trailer

227
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:58,089
bla bla bla an orange importantly there
is a comment

228
00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:01,550
so if each if it's not with percentage
is a comment

229
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:06,240
and should be ignore so what happens if
you have by tumbled is kinda traders 01

230
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,579
trailer defining route

231
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:10,689
but this one is a tree commented this
one is

232
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:14,750
is normal and is 100% does and how to
train a keyword so what would happen

233
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:19,329
if those two should be rejected and
actually you can put all those three in

234
00:13:19,329 --> 00:13:20,720
the same pilon you get this

235
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,290
so that's the same file so that's chrome
and that's the

236
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:27,960
when you see each is this trailer

237
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,340
thats Adobe Reader and then that so much
I will

238
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:35,100
in this is on the same file in it's not
about just a different picture

239
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,380
it Street complete different documents
so you can

240
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,400
you could say that on the other way this
is a perfect document in this is

241
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,020
exploiting document for Adobe

242
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:46,640
and then if someone opens its and
doesn't see the right document that

243
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,280
would just ignore the other objects

244
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,380
unless you have some foreign sycophants
0.6 ability

245
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:55,470
another problem so this was clearly a
problem with the

246
00:13:55,470 --> 00:14:00,420
non respecting specs but sometimes it's
in the specs but to space out to obscure

247
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,310
and PDF is a very good candidate

248
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:06,780
so it's like that so many things into
PDF I from other the gene

249
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:10,200
I didn't know about det until recently
and I

250
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,080
expect most viewed on a budget so do
anyone see anything

251
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:21,930
suspicion with this file so first who is
you use it usually using Adobe Reader at

252
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:22,550
some point

253
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:27,130
beautiful just for skis apprenticing of
course

254
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:30,140
so he was unusual is that there's this
little icon

255
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:33,860
it's not really a problem in itself just
means that the fine has layer and this

256
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,720
is a feature

257
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:41,230
and now you see what's wrong so
basically what you see on the screen is

258
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,420
not what you gonna print

259
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,560
and this is transparent when you do that

260
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:49,660
this is a future so you because this
file has layer

261
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,480
nd layer a plane with the printer
village in June view ability

262
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,090
then you don't have one because it is a
feature so now

263
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:01,020
with conceded so it's called optional
content configuration

264
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:04,810
and you can see I define two layers I
called invisible unprintable

265
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:08,060
but usually a documented a professional
printing documents

266
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:11,810
has like 15 años all this kind of thing
and then you just defined

267
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:15,730
default state export printable used
usual

268
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:20,160
for each of the neophytes even about the
future sold is no warning

269
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,600
n you could argue that you see it in the
preview then I would say

270
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,150
either just live page 1 unchanged or

271
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,640
urge us to a minor change

272
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,680
in butcher difference fewer the text
pages

273
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,090
or just do a minor change that to people
are likely to spot

274
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:38,900
in the difference on the file so in this
case is not

275
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:43,960
even the um yeah it's in the specs
there's not even a magic trick or

276
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:49,100
misinterpretation thirdly not so good
for PSEG a phone because it's

277
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,060
other be only and know what then
displays with other readers that don't

278
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,080
handle this feature

279
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,410
will vary with values readers but then
you could use the previous

280
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:00,710
is a friend type likely to trailers: so
that's

281
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,730
uhhh only activated under a doobie so
you could

282
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:07,830
the if someone is using another reader
they have a normal document

283
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:11,670
I need to use Adobe then the humble a
gym

284
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:15,180
document with the pitching trop and no
warning so

285
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,760
this is very late used form but that
purpose

286
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:25,120
and if it is can be abuse for obvious
reasons okay

287
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,020
now let's gets to some tricks rich

288
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:32,060
I don't think they have some security
implications but

289
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:36,900
are still funny so missus a cute little
trick published two years ago

290
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,350
in hacking my cousin went through

291
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:43,380
decent enough to publish in yes

292
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:47,350
so basically the PMTs a really simple
form right were more or less

293
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:52,280
you have a file header you haven't
another header here and when you jump

294
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,000
into pixel

295
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,700
data now versus yes upset

296
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,680
bits fields which basically points to
the beginning cover data

297
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,560
us might suspect a some applications

298
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,400
ignore it and supplication expected the
data to be after heathers

299
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,520
which means but you can put some pics so
they to hear

300
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,910
with one bitmap and you can put a proper
pics

301
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:18,520
sorry proper but up here and point to it
in the header

302
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,030
and some applications mites display

303
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:25,329
well proper limits and the other by the
does go for

304
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:29,870
for for ignoring was through so missus
lumfile

305
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:32,140
two different bitmaps again

306
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:36,620
and missus looks thankfully most the
publication actually responded

307
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:40,850
sorus and other chick

308
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:44,430
which is something that actually spoiled
wanna my city ft

309
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,790
posts but they created but thankfully no
testing

310
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:51,070
is related to compression the empty so

311
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:55,830
actually be empty can be compressed its
compressed by run length encoding

312
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:59,270
which is kinda quite pretty interesting
actually so it s

313
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:03,100
what you would expect from line
run-length encoding

314
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,260
sorry oprah's love go there's like you
just put

315
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:10,220
blank of like for example 12 and venue

316
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:15,310
the sorry put the Kolor and this means
that the next 12 pixels

317
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:20,140
will be fiscal and now you should
actually assume that this is some kind

318
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,650
of a script rendering a bit up and this
is not

319
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:25,650
not pixel-based which is over second

320
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:29,040
go to any lengths to 20 this is actually
a scapegoat

321
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,160
and the next value is more than two

322
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,780
its go to rolling which means about

323
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:39,390
you are supposed to actually but the
code there is supposed to us

324
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:43,100
expect this many pixels

325
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,640
not on compressed afterwards and just
copy them

326
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,500
to to bed about bitmap now

327
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:55,030
actually it the MPK text that extended
mister

328
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:58,600
sorry are the it at its prima up goth
one is

329
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,810
is just and offline which means well
wherever the cursor is

330
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:07,470
on the rendering output but up just
dumped over and II

331
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:11,230
and various also the same for and the
bitmap and there is something to just

332
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,820
move the cursor by

333
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:16,860
X why bites to a different

334
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:20,560
sir sorry pixels a different position
now the question is

335
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,200
against what happens what data will be

336
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,250
in the output bitmap if you just damp
over

337
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,740
some areas of space will it be
background will it be I don't know

338
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:34,320
well mister actually for free options
here

339
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,540
the first one is the well but blank
spaces

340
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:42,620
are actually filled with the background
colour here in the background colour

341
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:46,159
0 which is why 0 Aston Villa 0

342
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:49,309
index in the part of course and two

343
00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:53,650
this is how properly I think I expect
BMP should be displayed

344
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,770
if we go for a different viewer however

345
00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:00,390
it doesn't display its at all but at
this place a different

346
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:05,289
from different part of a bitmap because
it assumes that the missing

347
00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:09,610
pixels are all black and it feels the
missing spaces

348
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:13,100
black so you can already see what they
did with his butt but actually

349
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:16,409
rendered both told it to render

350
00:20:16,409 --> 00:20:21,010
some background color pixels and be
serious and just dump

351
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:24,590
between them some again

352
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:28,010
this is there is nothing couldn't hear
missus well something is actually

353
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:28,620
shouldn't

354
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:32,480
for the pentagon with your YouTube
you're using and if you used in home &

355
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,809
I think I have de noms but the fold view
it on under

356
00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:39,039
want to know you can actually see
everything

357
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,929
because it assumes that background is
just transparent to reduce great

358
00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:46,299
rewritten or BNP's because you're not
use I guess the BNP's

359
00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:49,570
having transparency am but where it is
so

360
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:53,230
basically the same bitmap but three
different things you can see

361
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:58,990
and so

362
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:02,909
the let's go on with image and now to
PNG files from it

363
00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:08,140
so the nice to treat highlighted with a
very cute book from the Mekong River

364
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:08,590
City

365
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:12,570
so basically you have the same image
data that is combining two image

366
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:16,600
and each images actually using only a
part of the corrosive but then they are

367
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,130
too pal

368
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:21,340
two pallets actually even though it's a
breach over the official specification

369
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,840
so issued use to palette data into fine

370
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:29,309
what happens is pretty technically
speaking it should reject define

371
00:21:29,309 --> 00:21:33,450
or it at least more we will it take the
first one or the second one

372
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:36,760
and so that's a very cute QC because you
see that

373
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,299
in one case so that's same pictures
using the same

374
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:44,220
not to pictures using the same image
data each of them using 16 colors

375
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,549
all the whole elect and you see that one
elect

376
00:21:47,549 --> 00:21:50,909
is using the higher your nipple the
height do highly bull

377
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:51,750
I'll do

378
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:55,560
do the palate itself and the other the
palette that this image

379
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,640
is using lower the lorne able

380
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,120
so you see two way to encode the easily

381
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,860
to pallets in one and then 15 you were
texting

382
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:09,200
first ballot challenge and another
viewer

383
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,590
take the second one saw this shouldn't
be there should be only one pallet chunk

384
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:17,170
but in standard to take the first one
and ignore the next months from now on

385
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:20,680
but still in any case it's again to
specs end

386
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:24,960
the this with this one is the one with
the unusual behavior most of them just

387
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,870
take the first

388
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:29,050
chump but the election I'll

389
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:32,390
12 no let's move on to some executable
files

390
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:36,520
I do some stuff about the P finds and I
won't go into details

391
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:40,870
because typically 2 p-5 loader
executable so we'll

392
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:45,500
a fine form at the window the ISM is
pretty

393
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,740
backward compatible and whenever there
was a change for the version

394
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:52,490
the actually just kill some weird bugs
or something

395
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:55,740
so typically must have the time when
there's evolution it actually

396
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:59,870
can something nasty in from the past
there are very few differences

397
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:03,110
among do a distinct to change

398
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:06,270
among the version of Windows so here you
have XP

399
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:09,730
Vista Vista 7 and Windows 8

400
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:13,600
and only in the relocations types there
were some variation

401
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,890
cell for you to Berg type for hi I

402
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:20,960
much too high arch was actually doing
nothing in the case of

403
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,870
a

404
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:24,620
XP and Vista 7 n

405
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:29,030
that was fixing the windows 8 now there
was two obscura

406
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:32,850
them type 9 that Israel more that was
used for

407
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:37,520
it on you that is doing different
reserved under XP &7

408
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,820
but now is not supported anymore because
they dropped it on your own from Windows

409
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,240
8

410
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,650
all so actually now what can we do say
it's very easy to do a difference

411
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:47,820
between those two russian

412
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:51,460
all those two version but well I wanted
to do a

413
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:55,309
the risk is a friend that would work
independently owned I would it would

414
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:57,080
work already on the three versions

415
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,130
but with the different behavior so the
trick is that you can apply your

416
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:00,830
location

417
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,980
on other relocations father in the least
so basically

418
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,320
I will use this one to actually patch
that one

419
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,320
type 9 into a type 10 and tight end is
hopefully

420
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:15,490
look at you supported by or diversion so
in this case it won't do anything

421
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:20,010
because it still here because it's not
budge and indicate that Windows 8 my

422
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:22,340
type 9 has been changing to type 10

423
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:25,990
I apps a shoulder team to help you see
cheerful

424
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:30,780
issue 2 I think at this a magazine after
its good speed if you not to wear it

425
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,990
and the surface basically different ya
Pro is dot I

426
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:37,690
my first relocation is processed then
under

427
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:41,179
XP and Vista is the seven it won't do
anything n

428
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:45,360
under within who we know as a kid we
actually patch relocation to

429
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,750
then relocation to is in any case
because just

430
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:53,860
the next one in the file is processed
and now under Windows 8 it's a type 10

431
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:58,809
in then and the XP &7 is to type nine
then it creates different result

432
00:24:58,809 --> 00:25:03,210
so now we have as he's a friend that
works in no case no I don't know bucks

433
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:03,660
but

434
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:06,160
a chewy has a different loading be

435
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:10,750
behavior is def loaded different re the
under different versions of Windows

436
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:15,840
a if you are fun if you are interested
in a a full

437
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,500
eccentricities I her you deeply
Riggleman the stock

438
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,590
by situation but getting so good but use
as you see plenty of fun with the

439
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:28,780
this time data K

440
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,809
well we already have bbm you had

441
00:25:31,809 --> 00:25:35,900
into town for okay versus

442
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,549
I was also writing and summers ago to
years ago

443
00:25:39,549 --> 00:25:43,750
and stumbled upon this behavior but
never made a few cm

444
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,929
as a schizophrenic you see yesterday
with a refined

445
00:25:46,929 --> 00:25:50,590
actually came up with this so and you
may not well you

446
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,650
Argus well if you're familiar with
animated sprite

447
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:57,679
but animation us other later in the
standard at the beginning for us

448
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,120
the idea of having multiple logical
images or sorry

449
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,600
one logical limit and multiple physical
images and do you define

450
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,970
each physical image the party into it
also tho

451
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:12,429
well it would have its size and do tell
here and there

452
00:26:12,429 --> 00:26:15,860
this obvious coordinates on logical
image

453
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:20,160
so if you define three distinct images

454
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,330
event didn't well render it into

455
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:26,740
this now the if

456
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:31,590
you defined another time but the tank
which was added later and would last the

457
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,830
speed of animation

458
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:36,290
it actually interpret this image is not
us

459
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:40,530
physical and Madison logical limits but
a strange the fun in Asian

460
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:44,100
now various again let me it was a
different way

461
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,299
various no 3 sorry friends

462
00:26:47,299 --> 00:26:51,630
be to define but means that this is
Justin old school but if we're

463
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:56,040
one image now certain parcels especially
grocers

464
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:00,590
but not only tends to animate everything
I mean if they don't have a defined with

465
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:04,150
friend Steve may just I so miss frames
some default friends

466
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:08,280
which means that the image to before
within like this but it would actually

467
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,230
be animated

468
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:13,210
the first fracas always treated as
background and it's always

469
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:16,300
Uruzgan see but aristophanes just like

470
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:19,679
switch now

471
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,309
sex abuse R Us well a way to create a

472
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:27,059
schizophrenic you see which means we
define the first frame which is the

473
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:27,720
backdrop for

474
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,800
again with one image and when we do
quite a lot of friends with liked us

475
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,929
this pixel basically rendering an exact
response and

476
00:27:35,929 --> 00:27:39,760
and at the entry to find another whole
image I would like to

477
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,200
well say but every which has its own
power

478
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,540
or can have its own pilot so is like

479
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,740
funders with the six colours and and

480
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:52,960
well so if this is interpreted the Surah
animation

481
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,940
what would happen is that you would see
this and well you didn't notice

482
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,100
is because as a single or smoothies and
it will take quite a lot

483
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,150
of long time to actually split into this
image

484
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:06,770
however if the the parser actually
interprets this

485
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:11,160
do it correctly it will not strike two
animated stomp to this image and it will

486
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,059
show this image

487
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:16,330
so for example paint well versus total
commanders

488
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:20,380
you are actually do show it incorrectly
according to me however

489
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:24,570
all the process I tested try to animated
also if under Title

490
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:27,950
try to animated and dip

491
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:33,120
however us quite handled it quite well
because it created

492
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,140
a lot of players coping

493
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:39,580
value sorry time frames but territory
layers

494
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:42,850
the background image was the first image
and last

495
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:46,760
famous like city splintered use it to
see both images

496
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:52,010
okay

497
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:54,519
so now we have we presented about to

498
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:57,929
to schizophrenia between different tools
so basically to tools

499
00:28:57,929 --> 00:29:01,980
behaving differently with the same fine
but sometimes it happens it even worse

500
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,080
that actually we think the same to you
have to mean

501
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,919
part of the two that behave differently
and then it's really difficult

502
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:12,019
the so actually the first one was WinRAR

503
00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:15,519
when you open your an archive with
winrar as if with a WinRAR

504
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:19,559
the behavior to eg view the content of
the file is not the same as

505
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:23,710
when it you up to us to extract and it
was a problem for me when I was playing

506
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:24,649
with polyglot

507
00:29:24,649 --> 00:29:29,399
because I had a quick opened a fun but
not I couldn't extract so in one case it

508
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:30,179
was failing

509
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:33,460
but in the worst case it was doing
nothing it was

510
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:36,730
starting to do something that it was not
crushing but not saying anything

511
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:40,570
so feel free to experiment about that
and also worry

512
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,720
know what we saw earlier the problem
with Adobe that

513
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:47,919
the you re her Julian the difference
between viewing and printing

514
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:52,230
a if you think about your next letter to
a child could have a nice consequence

515
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:56,760
right so the and also underway to do

516
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:00,620
perfect is a friends we had a couple of
for experimentations

517
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:03,840
failures or maybe a in just in progress
and we need

518
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,139
maybe your input for that so I'll

519
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:11,380
year early we initially wanted to have
heard

520
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:14,660
kind of perfect is a friendly ya

521
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:18,120
on images via KERA profiles so color
profiles are those

522
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,200
complex data that %um bed we defined

523
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,710
so that define is displayed is printed
correctly

524
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:27,960
and the or a render correctly on your
screen and so on

525
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,480
that's quite complex to be honest n
basically

526
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:35,429
you have to hear different standards of
color profiles and you see the maps and

527
00:30:35,429 --> 00:30:36,620
Carlos differently

528
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:40,000
and what happen if you would use some
colours a

529
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,450
that only works with one profile and not
the other

530
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:46,980
the problem here is dat the in

531
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:50,169
the had to say the not so many

532
00:30:50,169 --> 00:30:53,870
the easily accessible tune actually
handle those

533
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:57,370
it's really complex 0 you know that for
the shop do

534
00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:01,659
can handle that and so on but you well
for experimenting you just for the sake

535
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:03,360
of experimenting it's not so nice

536
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,650
and especially creating those five dunno
real you libraries aren't you manipulate

537
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:08,450
those files

538
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:13,110
the does not fights but this profiles to
be embedded with the fights are usually

539
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,330
just open

540
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:18,030
picture but they are not don't care but
karla provides our whole

541
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:21,630
so basically it's difficult to
experiment with that /url

542
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:24,890
another thing I experiment when playing
reach a pic

543
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:29,900
for another good to the topic was that
knife so that if and you even though

544
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,840
it's commonly used

545
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,230
is supporting a lot more I'll irregular
Chan

546
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:37,559
types than all the others so basically
you you are you use a

547
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:41,380
the Ghia and and officials from type if
Rangers happy

548
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,149
or the other a

549
00:31:43,149 --> 00:31:46,289
the file a viewer viewers are and

550
00:31:46,289 --> 00:31:50,349
are unhappy but they couldn't get the
others to work so den

551
00:31:50,349 --> 00:31:54,159
it didn't work and also a bit like BNP
which has an offset to the next

552
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:59,969
data a truck with FLV us a flash video
is not so complex in a format even

553
00:31:59,969 --> 00:32:01,059
typically we

554
00:32:01,059 --> 00:32:05,589
think that videos are huge but dick and
make pretty small and I try to stay to

555
00:32:05,589 --> 00:32:08,759
get some discrepancy very similar to the
first game patrick

556
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:12,109
but he didn't to work on the at some
point I had VNC

557
00:32:12,109 --> 00:32:15,769
saying I cannot load is video but still
it was playing some random sound so

558
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:16,659
maybe there is some

559
00:32:16,659 --> 00:32:20,190
placebos thing to be fun a dystopic I
also

560
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:23,960
yet just for if you remember this guy
who said she had writer access on you to

561
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,200
be uploading a video

562
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,919
I created PDF FLV polyglot and the
ability to YouTube

563
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:34,839
that YouTube refused after it uploaded I
mean I still have it on my list but say

564
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:38,099
the of fun is incorrect X try maybe

565
00:32:38,099 --> 00:32:42,179
but I have writer writing right on
YouTube so

566
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:46,049
PNG a PNG has many stuff like you

567
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:49,099
a so and and theory chance that will

568
00:32:49,099 --> 00:32:52,450
affect the rendering levels like a
profiles third

569
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:58,320
gonna in the transparency so for pallets
a specific site speechifying hmm Well

570
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,669
if a collar will be transparent with
pallet images its

571
00:33:01,669 --> 00:33:06,299
often supported some stuff that could
help me for the color profile parts

572
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:09,469
like a significant bits and from the
city's it's never supported

573
00:33:09,469 --> 00:33:13,659
ends I was a bit disappointed that
something I think use less like a

574
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:17,820
the physical size which means you define
a pic so racial so instead of having

575
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:21,450
square peg says if you want to squish
your your your image

576
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:24,779
when you say dis my pics are largely two
pics and wide in one pixel

577
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:28,589
sundry DPI i think is pretty useless but
they will I was a bit disappointed to

578
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:30,179
see touchy supported anywhere

579
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:33,330
but they couldn't abused at so

580
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:34,299
maybe

581
00:33:34,299 --> 00:33:37,990
failures currently butts maybe with some
input or suggestions

582
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:41,330
I will achieve made something out of
that organ failure course

583
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:44,830
so conclusion

584
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:47,999
a.m. if you think about it

585
00:33:47,999 --> 00:33:51,419
or most of his file formats the specs
are public

586
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:55,740
the some passos's often public and yet
the result is very

587
00:33:55,740 --> 00:34:01,230
messy so this the sometimes suspects are
okay but in the case for example loves

588
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:03,450
it even now the specs often very messy

589
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:06,960
n even worse the buses don't even
respect done then

590
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,290
it Wiley or makes the out CRM

591
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:14,000
security or the computer at the software
level I'll

592
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,918
less strong then the when the Red
whenever there was such a burden

593
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:20,970
you cannot claim a CV for that you
cannot blame

594
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:24,919
on full disclosure or anything yet for
badly parsing a feature

595
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:30,210
so basically until there was a crash in
exploit or something major like to and

596
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:31,399
read much turkey back

597
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:36,389
then there's nothing we can do to Shane
highlight report

598
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:39,740
you know this kind of thing up your
season slide

599
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:45,349
are available at this address I like to
thank all these people for their

600
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:46,230
contribution

601
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:49,450
and so so there's been faithful he's in

602
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:53,230
and the thank you for your attentions

603
00:34:53,230 --> 00:35:04,130
any questions

604
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:06,470
thanks as well so we do have time for
questions

605
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:09,570
have a question please rage and psych
race to you with the mic

606
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:14,760
any questions

607
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,530
just listen to the voices in your head
is not that scary one question would

608
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:23,470
just a note to do looking on this lies
you have a bonus round

609
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:27,260
yeah

610
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:30,540
we all know from security point of view
that

611
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:36,120
the format is a huge mess TIFF and

612
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:39,320
like it of the facts for much

613
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,750
yeah truly makes year am

614
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:46,160
have you found something fun to do these
images archie

615
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,610
multi-page documents in

616
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:53,530
so I didn't recieve if I do it through
it

617
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:58,310
I E the did some experience with diff
but not reform is a friend so

618
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:03,540
not re into retirement suggests summers
a similar note we didn't go for like

619
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:07,220
HTML interpretation or CSS
interpretation because right click

620
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:14,400
like somebody who's there are doing from
the ground more questions

621
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:20,130
order I

622
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:23,500
mmm how many files were able to put

623
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:27,160
into one file so that all of them were
still

624
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,370
correct I think so as polyglot

625
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:34,720
three or something so severe company a
sense cuz a friend I think voters that

626
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,640
plan was for

627
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,020
for but for different interpretations
rights with their questions about

628
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:42,950
I don't believe we did one which more

629
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:46,450
their position but doing so I i just
like so I

630
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:50,620
did mention visit part but you can look
for and of central directory

631
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:53,630
header from assuming but there is no
comment assuming but

632
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:57,770
Paris huge comment right but actually
what you can do you can also

633
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:01,010
start looking and the Middle and may be
viewed like

634
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:04,790
place quite a lot of and the central
director is Heather different possible

635
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:06,590
locations may be something close to

636
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:10,790
dampen the middle and and you'll be able
to make

637
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:16,230
trick another tool ever closer Russian
one more question

638
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:19,750

actually favorite pony boring us and we
didn't do anything

644
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:42,010
out of what you'd expect them to do it
for us

645
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:48,310
which was surprising and I was unhappy
about it actually like effing

646
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:51,940

on Windows if you want to test scores a
friendly or like weirdness

648
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:00,740
and parsers but as the perfect choice
because they're like horrible to

649
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,320
everything

650
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:10,140

00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:20,340
yeah on the years it Paul passing have
resulted AB engines and

653
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:24,590
have prices or like when you tryin since
it falls through Gmail

654
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:29,360
instance haven't 6

655
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,640
the instant sorry good sure

656
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,240
with a zip file processing have you
looked at how AP engines

657
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,420
might look at it as if I'll all for
instance gmail

658
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,420

660
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:50,800
with de Mayo and unzipping that's about
as your question

661
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,310
I hope it's all correct because I
actually do

662
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:57,430
security review for so the

663
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:01,030
but being said I just depressed because
as you know to me

664
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:04,580
sconce also files for viruses amid the
tornado tears through it and it was

665
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,890
actually behaving very well

666
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:08,900
