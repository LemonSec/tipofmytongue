as PowerPoint super fun I

28
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:01,620
I give disclaimers on my talk because
apparently if you say the wrong things

29
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:06,210
on people write you up in magazines and
then they bitchy

30
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,280
and then they start foundations to like
fight

31
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,890
against the tyrannical evil that you are
because you're on stage because he made

32
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:13,340
like a

even though I that exists but that
certain like Virginia somewhere

80
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:19,900
think and a so we have the shittiest
investment industry ever

81
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,460
write a like a we r

82
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,940
the absolute worst industry you could
ever invested I mean not

83
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,310
not to make money off of dumb people
because we're one of the best that the

84
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:33,570
railey really go away

85
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:36,890
PA vans what we call it let's call it

86
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:40,720
advanced okay and then will call at

87
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,340
act no if we okay if you say that their
persistent will have to buy that shit

88
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,540
every year write a no I yeah like

89
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,430
so that same day and

90
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:56,830
and people sped fears persist risk now
there is enough money being spent on

91
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,320
risk management right now

92
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,290
threat threat intelligence threat thread
manager AP

93
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:06,380
yeah there you go will call ABT because
it means its advance so they'll have no

94
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,370
idea how to fix it

95
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:12,070
that's up to us persisted because you
gotta pay their shit every single year

96
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:15,300
and threat because the know anyone that
wants

97
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,640
to the thread money in the fuckin

98
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,990
back Friday we lose money every year

99
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:27,790
but the amount that we spend on empro
sec

100
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:34,320
every year goes up so

101
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,400
way to get to you mean to tell me that
what I get

102
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:42,540
if if you give me more money the only
thing that I could guarantee is that you

103
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:42,860
will

104
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:49,080
definitely lose more money this year and
we're the ones pigeon to our management

105
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,310
like you're having a Monday

106
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:56,020
looked repeated like if we were stock
brokers always be fortified

107
00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:04,060
so that confuses me

108
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,850
we can really confused about what

109
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:14,139
like our industry even mean sometimes
what the fuck is this picture

110
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:19,110
I would look at the pictures do the
talking Robert personally love their

111
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:23,389
I was like dude what does is bitch we're
all so confused that i won this shows

112
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:24,190
that I'm confused

113
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:28,419
XO we fail at this stuff

114
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:31,650
write a like were not were not good

115
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:34,800
at success we're really good at failure
like that's why I have

116
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,260
suffer pen testing right it's like built
around proving

117
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,370
failure like women industry that's
really

118
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:45,220
interested failure so I think about that
Mike why

119
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:48,710
because I've been in this industry for a
long time I'm

120
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:54,070
one of the problems I know that I'm
trying to figure out how the hell

121
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:58,300
to St Exeter do something to actually
make it make sense

122
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,949
I'm so the first thing I did like we do
every one else

123
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:07,800
I blame someone else vendors so I blame
all the vendors first

124
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,660
because they're like you know money on
the minor China

125
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,900
get paid go back to the suburbs where
they don't have to talk about

126
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,449
anything I am and then I started looking
at okay we'll

127
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:25,010
we use really ancient technology right
like when that fire walls in the

128
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,139
nineties sir

129
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:28,979
you know self-fulfilling warned that we
figured out how to work in that you know

130
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:29,789
seventies

131
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:33,050
Anya buffer overflows still around
unless he wasn't

132
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:36,080
box talkin teacher fix it but

133
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,930
all this shit is so old

134
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:43,250
cloud computing like what a shitty

135
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,370
repackaged cool leg itches the pool

136
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:51,270
but in like a really box Android week
you've never seen this before you get

137
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:51,700
your

138
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,029
wouldn't know it

139
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:58,810
candy in you like it's candy in there
like a look at the sprinkles do it

140
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:04,360
it can be at the mercy mission repair
yet it's sold em

141
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,569
like it first-rate so

142
00:09:07,569 --> 00:09:10,689
as I get frustrated there's a good time
to go over stats and the other is my go

143
00:09:10,689 --> 00:09:13,019
over these is so that you can tell
somebody else

144
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:16,389
because I'm sure you already know most
of this stuff what are the things that I

145
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,319
thought was interesting

146
00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:20,740
in the DVI recently is that eighty
percent the intrusions

147
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:24,629
they're actually intrusions arm were
later fishing

148
00:09:24,629 --> 00:09:29,319
like that pretty it's pretty bad

149
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:32,670
because we spend a whole lot of our time
talking about everything else

150
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:36,569
we obviously haven't fixed that shit so
we'd like to pry were gonna

151
00:09:36,569 --> 00:09:39,810
you know these direct attacks the

152
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:42,779
you know the fact that now where
infection is going up what we're

153
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:44,019
spending more money

154
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:48,129
an anti-virus I mean we have regulations
that are what you have to have

155
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,209
anti-virus

156
00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:52,339
but like every piece of proof that we
have

157
00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:57,279
restart apply science in for a sec
proves that if you have anti-virus you

158
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:57,720
are

159
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,990
more likely to get a virus that's weird

160
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:06,350
we decided to apply use a condom or more
likely to get pregnant

161
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:10,410
me I think I have no excuses

162
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:14,100
I am so this one's hilarious

163
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,170
and this is just so that I could use my
slider the dog taking a poop

164
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:20,899
I seventy-nine percent respondents

165
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:24,269
in opponent study which their studies
are shipped anyway

166
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:27,699
but it's funny to look at and read their
words seventy-nine percent of

167
00:10:27,699 --> 00:10:28,949
respondents selected

168
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:34,220
end-users as the number one group
responsible for the security

169
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:41,140
of cloud service providers what

170
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:45,740
what would it be so the end users are
supposed to protect the cloud service

171
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,460
providers

172
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:53,220
write a that as a dog picking up its own
shit that's ridiculous

173
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,650
had to use that because I know this is
going to Daves favorites lights

174
00:10:56,650 --> 00:11:00,270
it is and it's funny

175
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:05,650
and it's true so right sorry we got our
stats are all screwed

176
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:09,040
so start you know I look at a tax I
think I've will how can I make better

177
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,880
changes and what I do based on shit
that's going on out there

178
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,360
and we look at like de los TB which

179
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,960
you guys gone today lost TV before right
awesome the

180
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,400
kick ass were three but you can
reference all the time

181
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,880
what's going on actually in attacks and
you look at this

182
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,640
you figure out that only at all this
crap together to boil it down

183
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:36,080
hacking is 28 percent web attacks

184
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:40,930
right you know all the web people are
like when's the next hardship with

185
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,690
everybody for some webapps

186
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:45,920
fix your web skills broke a yet

187
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,110
9 percent in the attacks that really
happen happen through about packing

188
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:54,170
I would say our eyes not necessarily on
the ball there

189
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:58,180
I mean its reality right reality means
that

190
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:02,720
you know back to my condom if my condom
only works 9 percent of the time

191
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,400
it probably wouldn't be the first thing
that I went to protect myself

192
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,840
you know if my girlfriend was

193
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:15,150
28 percent cue

194
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:18,830
I might think about take a look at what
else is there

195
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:24,150
so sixty-three percent so I figured that
my career so far has been

196
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:28,130
wasted sixty-three percent of the time
because I was doing all these contests

197
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,950
in all these web at SC Code Review

198
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:34,410
in reality I miss sixty-three percent
ownership that I was supposed to be

199
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:35,960
teaching people by doing my job

200
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:40,210
I suck I get that so

201
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:44,430
worried a my favorite quote I've ever
heard

202
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:48,570
is that hard work beats talent when
talent doesn't work are and

203
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:52,070
I apply that to myself apply that

204
00:12:52,070 --> 00:13:01,930
our industry and it makes me think maybe
we're just not working very hard maybe

205
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:06,120
maybe we're just kinda like clicking the
button and and hoping we get paid so

206
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,280
that we can get a drink somewhere

207
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:12,250
maybe we expect the users to do more
they don't do it

208
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:16,640
so we say market I can teach in because
they're its

209
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,290
maybe that's the reason is eighty
percent fishing

210
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:24,310
everybody's don't write a but I think
that it's

211
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:27,600
more little bit about us not working
hard enough to communicate

212
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,930
what we need to do to make this ship
actually

213
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:35,330
go forward you know you might wanna do
those things in

214
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:38,930
and I look at a thing that's been
successful in my career doing consulting

215
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,000
said been a consultant

216
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,570
for all of my professional career for
the most part

217
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:48,060
except my you know seven years spray and
whatever the fuck I was doing KPMG

218
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,700
looked at place if you work there

219
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:55,200
sucks should get drunk more

220
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,880
quit

221
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,200
autos gonna go over

222
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,380
so i digress. I

223
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:08,460
people need proof Friday I mean a lot of
times you just have to prove it

224
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:12,470
in order for people to really connect so
when you you look at security programs

225
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:16,190
you see the stuff that we tested before
how we test where we test

226
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:19,870
break it down pretty much the physical
stuff social stuff electronic stuff

227
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:24,040
it's tough to the Minstermen American I
can't figure

228
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,890
rest I'm so we look at physical

229
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:31,660
we did a half ass taiwan physical right
we go through

230
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:36,780
and we're like yeah you have cameras
writers were doing i will audit

231
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:40,670
like to have a centralized system to
look at those cameras what we know it

232
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:43,770
we're talking about and other what yeah

233
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:48,510
we have here in the control room in
there some way 400-pound dude who could

234
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:51,510
saves like in life in a room

235
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:58,210
watching 50 cameras and bro and I'm a
fighter is only watching Oprah and

236
00:14:58,210 --> 00:14:59,490
there's also to ship

237
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:03,290
the cameras of whatever else we would
looks like you've got a pretty advanced

238
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:04,470
operations center

239
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:09,430
check do you review the tapes

240
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:12,560
yes check

241
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,090
her do you have for camera coverage

242
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:21,500
yep look at the outside would like the
outside jed

243
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,740
that those nothing that you click the
ship were already

244
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,880
is even what the cameras were intended
to do they were intended to catch

245
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,330
someone in the act of doing something
shady and give you a view into that said

246
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:35,650
that the human looking at it could get
some private interpretation

247
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:39,990
understand if we needed to respond or
not yet

248
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:44,260
that response ability is not tested

249
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,820
any those assessments all you're doing
is saying

250
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:52,690
is the tool on yes that's like are you a
good race car driver

251
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:57,510
and they're like here's my race car like
would like a race car

252
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:01,170
he's a good driver nothing to do with it

253
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:06,650
write a so we also have some
misconceptions that allow that

254
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:10,030
like you know what just gonna walk into
my building really

255
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:13,900
which I write a

256
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:18,370
so the you know with the disconnect a
little bit they think it's a little to

257
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:19,290
change Bondi

258
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:22,870
you know you have social stuff I mean
for the most part

259
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:26,850
the way that our industry has gone and
tried to test social things

260
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:32,090
is by doing fishing fishing is some
antisocial should

261
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:35,990
you're sick group telling people email
that does nothing social about that

262
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:40,070
socials the interaction between people

263
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:44,910
yeah I sent them an email it's like you
TP really doesn't help much

264
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:48,100
grated you can test the couple things if
you're doing fishing

265
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,540
properly most the time suck it fishing
so bad

266
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,950
this we can figure that out now

267
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:59,150
more less call them on the phone
interact with them in person

268
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:02,540
figure out if there's intelligence
leakage do all over OSA profiling

269
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,240
properly

270
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,530
so we could see if people are just
taxing us because they don't give a fuck

271
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:10,470
write a if they're just putting their
passwords out there

272
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:13,600
how many people on the tech help desk
have used

273
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,050
the you know what the bleep in computer
or whatever and published your entire

274
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,440
registry out to that thing

275
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,620
with keys

276
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:24,809
passwords else you know in and then we
try and test electronic

277
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:29,100
and I she's been trying to do this stuff
for a while and the reason I make it a

278
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,080
little bit more green in that one
because graphs are totally arbitrary

279
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,680
legs you want I feel like we've done a
little bit better in electronic

280
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,309
right we're working at the apt level
working at the

281
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:43,320
operating system level we're starting to
teach people more to

282
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,380
review their code in building securely

283
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:50,650
it's really important stuff but the way
that we scoped

284
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:54,090
tweet us we had to cut off Ryan fee

285
00:17:54,090 --> 00:18:00,040
well I only want you to test between the
7 o'clock at night /a

286
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:04,380
and four in the morning okay

287
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,429
so you want me one I am

288
00:18:07,429 --> 00:18:12,679
in my shadiest performance ability
that's what you want you want to test

289
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:14,100
when I'm fuckin tired

290
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:18,920
and I'm all I'm thinking about is
grossly like that's the level of

291
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,280
commitment you want from me

292
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,620
they don't even think about that shit
though it took just one non-production

293
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,400
hours have contested

294
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,170
want you to only do externally

295
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:34,290
yeah cuz there's no word on the inside
the tax people fair enough

296
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:37,890
you know maybe we could actually use
some %uh this

297
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:42,320
trick slow the bullshit to tell people
like hey

298
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,030
attackers are on the inside there their
turkey

299
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:49,830
there it happens no but I'd and bag as
on the outside

300
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:54,090
you know we only allowed direct attacks
no you can't fish are users

301
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:57,360
why because it would offend go

302
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,850
apparently sets things that hackers

303
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:07,190
care about is your users feelings

304
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:07,980
here really

305
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,530
hughes's me sometime I think and I don't
think this is their fault

306
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:16,450
I think that a lot of this stuff we need
to learn how to teach them

307
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:19,700
that this shit is important without me
just make

308
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,160
as we do that day is silly

309
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:27,059
but I think we need to do a little bit
better at

310
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:30,280
trying to teach them instead of just
like gaming the system

311
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:34,720
because you know you can get a genie you
could just say hey or more which is

312
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,950
like knowing the right and I want more
days like ok

313
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:41,300
you know you win ido

314
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,960
his records this is what we do for a
living

315
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,760
it I absolutely not concerned

316
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,530
what it does I am only concerned what it
can do

317
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:58,820
that's I want

318
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:03,260
it's a it's a marker not to me it does
something else

319
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:07,720
what does it do I snippet it's spelled
you know you like what you like

320
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:12,300
yet what portable get hired device like
know Chris

321
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,659
marker and what whatever I'm 3 I'm
ripped don't care

322
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:19,290
its good don't wanna call with this way
more fun

323
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:22,650
this Wed I so

324
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:26,840
sure most you've heard me say that mike
tyson

325
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:30,050
is my impulse ek profit

326
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:33,170
right that man's

327
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:37,309
said the most profound impose technology
ever which was

328
00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:44,659
everybody has a plan until they get
punched in the face

329
00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:47,769
every single person has a plan until
they get punched

330
00:20:47,769 --> 00:20:51,309
directly into their place they have no
fucking planned all

331
00:20:51,309 --> 00:20:56,409
they may have planted like rather like
you know Burton like I'm going to be

332
00:20:56,409 --> 00:20:57,409
able to go a bit someone

333
00:20:57,409 --> 00:21:02,669
shocks I am a newbie did but as soon as
you punched in the face

334
00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:06,640
laying on the ground crying China fix
the classes and shit

335
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,360
your kick in on the head and stomach
like

336
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:16,809
their whole plan sucks in the only thing
that they could think about

337
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:20,980
is how to make amount of pain that is so
serious

338
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:24,179
stop regular talk about plans

339
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:27,669
and then there's somebody like you know
some light

340
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:31,620
impose a guy in the corner like use the
planter

341
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,980
at present the SP like

342
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:38,429
a good spot overcame follow point like

343
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:42,159
okay clear the punch to the face seaview
read your book

344
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,029
read a book while somebody's biting you
it's super hard

345
00:21:46,029 --> 00:21:50,090
I tried as a demo in the person

346
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:53,700
be tough gotta it was not cool

347
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,630
so the red tube all this to me

348
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:01,510
is that in order to educate people

349
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:06,029
on what we do and how we need to fix
things the thing that I found most

350
00:22:06,029 --> 00:22:08,000
successful in my career

351
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,279
out of all the different types of
testing that we've done is

352
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:17,820
the type of testing that makes real for
them some people all they need to make

353
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,779
it real

354
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:23,860
is a threat write a some people all they
need to do to turn off their computers

355
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,510
do it quite happy with the road for
Batman

356
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:30,059
but the really don't change anything
because

357
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:34,639
they turn your computer on the next day
legal right back in the same time

358
00:22:34,639 --> 00:22:36,010
situation that they're

359
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:42,029
right so we gotta figure out those ways
to make it real for them it's not going

360
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:43,799
to be the same for everybody else but

361
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:47,389
eyes looked at a bunch these attack
patterns and

362
00:22:47,389 --> 00:22:51,559
how people do stuff than you know it
clean this red team

363
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:52,370
time

364
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:56,380
and coopted from military shit years
years years ago

365
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:00,440
because whatever gets you know we gotta
make up terms and that sounds cool

366
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,930
roadside I want to know that means ily
now

367
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:07,830
%uh probably it's good for words like
you're trying to use a noble ago

368
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:12,980
but when you're looking at stuff is an
actual attacker you want to find the

369
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,040
weakest point right

370
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:18,670
units would so we do is it's funny

371
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:22,680
and that's the lazy way is always look
to the weakest shit so I just getting

372
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:27,580
be done arm but if you look at anything
in physics

373
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,850
anything in the world in the material
world the weakest point is

374
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:34,580
always when two things join together

375
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:38,270
the park in which those things join
together

376
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:41,890
inherently is the weakest part that
entire design

377
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:45,870
right chemistry

378
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:49,540
physics all those things so one

379
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:53,880
when I'm looking at attacks tax that are
that are pertinent to people and i wanna

380
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,890
find some those

381
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:57,890
easier attacks that also make it real
for them

382
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:01,520
I try and come by those areas

383
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,060
so I combine those areas in those areas
converge right we start to see some

384
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:09,860
other areas that we can test that may
not be the same way that we're testing

385
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,370
for

386
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:17,560
I have found some of these affected so
you've had a son somebody

387
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:22,190
anyone star converging this area's go
for the batch system

388
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:26,430
I mean you can make bad you can make
badges

389
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:30,270
at your house you don't even have to do
super cool spy shit

390
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:35,380
you could just own the bad system after
you get in on a pen test and print a bad

391
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:39,380
and if you're on there is about doing a
co-worker breaking in the building

392
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:42,300
you're like you wanna feel like James
Bond or whatever else

393
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:46,140
smoking nothing like good n you you get
right inside

394
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:49,200
and its so

395
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,260
shocking and cool to their

396
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:57,559
they he did it makes them want to die

397
00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:01,159
okay no other way have I ever seen

398
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:04,509
a usergroup respond to me

399
00:25:04,509 --> 00:25:07,519
with ship all over their pants three key

400
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:12,480
how not knowing who to blame in like
whole panic and chaos

401
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,990
as I am when I go through some of these
attacks

402
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:20,259
and we you know I'm sitting at my laptop
outside the parking lot

403
00:25:20,259 --> 00:25:24,690
might pay Chuck yep

404
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:28,110
so we're outside could you go over to
the door

405
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:31,769
in two days in a row quick know I can
assure like K

406
00:25:31,769 --> 00:25:34,899
on yet secure that noise that clip

407
00:25:34,899 --> 00:25:39,789
yep you go ahead open the door design
the open the door

408
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:44,980
and you hear the phone go because they
don't want to talk to you anymore

409
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:48,850
on all the sudden

410
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:52,860
the vote ability that you showed them in
the 10th St outside that was just red

411
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:56,009
you soon they will fix a good read all
the sudden

412
00:25:56,009 --> 00:26:00,549
that becomes real to them that's
something that you brought directly in

413
00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:01,570
front of their face

414
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:04,600
it's something that it's hard for them
to ignore

415
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,240
it's hard for them to be like well look

416
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,110
Nexus S really only affects the user
that clicked on that link

417
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:17,129
okay time but if that user was targeted
specifically in their sys admin and I

418
00:26:17,129 --> 00:26:19,190
got into your VPN that I use that

419
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:23,570
because I could get into the VPN dude
had rentals I could find a bad system

420
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:26,909
I can log on to the badge system in the
net open the door

421
00:26:26,909 --> 00:26:29,980
now XSS is really picking important

422
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:33,519
right because without that is just me

423
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:37,629
I couldn't have opened the door to the
data center at a real long stretch

424
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:44,279
but we have the skills to make those
things happen and we show people in that

425
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:45,360
manner

426
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:51,070
holy shit today respond now I try not to
talk about sexual things considerably

427
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,129
smarter than I am

428
00:26:52,129 --> 00:26:55,970
but just as some tips just in case

429
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:58,169
as

430
00:26:58,169 --> 00:27:03,130
Joan is all these are they were like
considered me drop in or near Derby Conn

431
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:04,490
when I was talking about the switch

432
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:07,580
still in which like will be a

433
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:11,720
default password is okay you but didn't
get it

434
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,510
that's our industry is devolved to I
know the password is

435
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:20,309
who I got a vulnerability footballer who
dis is da right

436
00:27:20,309 --> 00:27:24,610
but these things you can find really
easy when the SX is one of the larger

437
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:29,080
units that's controlling bad systems if
you go look

438
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:33,669
for court 555 556 right that's where
they run their database

439
00:27:33,669 --> 00:27:37,750
the kinda cool part about how they run
their database

440
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:40,880
yes is there's a web app

441
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,429
that runs I'm 555 and they passed

442
00:27:45,429 --> 00:27:48,639
database commands to the web app

443
00:27:48,639 --> 00:27:53,889
from the controllers using HTTP POST

444
00:27:53,889 --> 00:27:57,610
into a form that accepts

445
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:03,110
strip sequel that's all real

446
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:08,200
say muth I would look at that the test
the mic

447
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:13,230
bullshit select I yet hope

448
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:16,740
hey we get the stuff you know this by
most in the room that we're not supposed

449
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,659
to be in the first place

450
00:28:17,659 --> 00:28:21,169
and we like laughing our ass off and
somebody comes into

451
00:28:21,169 --> 00:28:24,990
were like making a shitload annoys lol
what do you do with Mike to

452
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:28,360
this and they come in and they were
somebody from it.

453
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,750
um like with the bottom one ever knows
it's almost a foregone abacha from look

454
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,500
at this dumb shit

455
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:38,010
lavender bringing other people into it.
and Mike guys who were sitting at the

456
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:41,960
table laughing I like picking bad as
often for declining shit like trying to

457
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,279
get

458
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:46,039
laptops I could use their time

459
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:49,470
arm on guard 10

460
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:53,500
leno's one of the top to on

461
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,679
look for these ports you know

462
00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:00,720
Lindell multimedia is one of the ones
that I find on almost

463
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,620
every single window system that's out
there because you know the smart people

464
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,740
are like oh god it is yes a password

465
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:10,630
because it was my hard cock all gotta
change the admin password

466
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:14,370
hardly not there's nothing I hardly got
social about well for that now

467
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:17,980
don't care probably doesn't do anything
except for

468
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:21,910
admin everything on also cool

469
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:25,980
yeah any viewfinder 10 system you wear
that people

470
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:29,040
please go to these

471
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,600
you or tells I will see talks

472
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:37,250
from you the day after three key

473
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:40,930
out about the number of web app own
abilities that are in this year

474
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:45,040
freakin how let you get accepted fucking
black

475
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,390
guarantee a guarantee you I mean

476
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:51,810
up a if you don't get it how about that

477
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:54,960
straight up paid research

478
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,940
if you don't get excited about that
because you're me adsystem: used

479
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:04,770
I could find stuff I'm retarded
seriously

480
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:08,050
like I'm one step above just clicking
Next that

481
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:13,100
and I thought so one attacking bad
systems remember rape

482
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:17,960
replace and promote exploit because
those

483
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:22,290
all the things you need to test in a bad
system with clever

484
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:26,110
I one find a reason to use the portable
battery I'm

485
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:30,280
because you know you want to open it

486
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:34,539
good love I so you get a bad systems

487
00:30:34,539 --> 00:30:38,270
some things we need to test were
converging those services to teach them

488
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:41,850
about how to monitor their bad systems
better electronically

489
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:45,130
again bringing physical security or
transferred together

490
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:49,770
right wanna be able to replace them so
replace a user's picture

491
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:52,880
with well your engineers picture who's
breaking

492
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,390
now this one was really helpful because
the dudes name was Eric Smith

493
00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:03,200
and that dudes name is Eric Smith so I
was like maybe get a free pass to show

494
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,179
your license

495
00:31:04,179 --> 00:31:08,610
and of course what happens oh won't you
show me a license and then they give you

496
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:09,520
your badge

497
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:16,220
because you're a rich Smith employees
now

498
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:19,990
really really simple you could have
talked this attacker by monitoring

499
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:23,039
picture changes inside if you're bad
system

500
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:27,030
how many people monitor picture changes
inside a bad system you put your hand up

501
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:29,649
your fucking line

502
00:31:29,649 --> 00:31:32,999
you are alive summits effect

503
00:31:32,999 --> 00:31:36,629
no one knows K

504
00:31:36,629 --> 00:31:42,149
I so maybe we want to add stuff doesn't
respond to that Chris Cates that but I

505
00:31:42,149 --> 00:31:43,350
put his legitimate like

506
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:46,809
you know real social security number and
everything on it cuz

507
00:31:46,809 --> 00:31:50,230
whatever I paid so I know what is a
scary numbers so it's funny to troll

508
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,470
your engineers 21

509
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:54,610
arm and then they can go get a badge

510
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:58,119
would if you have other Badges make sure
that you can promote

511
00:31:58,119 --> 00:32:03,470
you know take a crappy baggage cloning
get into the bad system

512
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:08,450
add privileges to it right because they
should be getting alerts my physical

513
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:11,859
security guy should be learning
electronic security guys or vice versa

514
00:32:11,859 --> 00:32:15,499
that shit is changing in the bad system
because bashes

515
00:32:15,499 --> 00:32:18,889
really shouldn't change a lot it's
pretty static

516
00:32:18,889 --> 00:32:23,299
like you get a new employee issue its
new employees add them to the matches

517
00:32:23,299 --> 00:32:24,080
today

518
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:28,460
to do employees came on you really
easily figure that out you can script it

519
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:32,249
by going into peoples of the world the
Hells you have a love your ATP

520
00:32:32,249 --> 00:32:35,799
year you know other payment systems
figure out that there are new employees

521
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:38,379
ok cool they've been employed within the
next couple days

522
00:32:38,379 --> 00:32:41,489
got it I can automate every single piece
of this

523
00:32:41,489 --> 00:32:45,269
to def out the people that are supposed
to have changes posed to have privileges

524
00:32:45,269 --> 00:32:45,879
added

525
00:32:45,879 --> 00:32:51,590
or not be there yet we do not have it
and badges and a wide open for you guys

has a

538
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:41,330
mobile app for guards to use

539
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:49,750
to go on guard tour so they don't have
to use their backs would

540
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:54,040
so we were like that's cool download the

you get from those peoples pretty high

550
00:34:35,169 --> 00:34:36,020
after that

551
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:41,970
you know how do I make it so that some
random person I don't know who talk shit

no one cares anyway I'll just tell you
about it om

558
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,110

560
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:13,780
so these couple walks you see me as a
lot around europe

561
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:17,630

thousand euro by

568
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:41,610
click

569
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:45,980
K for you are talking about a
convergence of these things that

570
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:51,050
make an impact the show right physical
so she could play dress up

571
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:55,760
you know I at yes I look like I'm really
stoned at this time and I was also

572
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,850
really fuckin stone

573
00:35:56,850 --> 00:36:00,410
on so this company

574
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:03,750
a Dominion power up because

575
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:08,330
so many cats are from Virginia DC area
you know that too many power runs

576
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:12,340
a certain large man in that area you can
look up what power companies are

577
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:16,010
running what pieces are the power grid
very very easily and every country a

578
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:16,790
government

579
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:20,820
I'm on the contest ash standard outward

580
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,890
in the guide in the intelligence
collection

581
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:27,460
and gathering section there's like a
hundred links

582
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:31,380
how to look up some other shit so we
look it up we walk in the data center

583
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,360
what air quotes in the data center said

584
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:37,090
hang out for a second I'm a parking lot
because I didn't want to get burned if

585
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:38,120
he's going to fight with

586
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:42,150
you know we got one more shot I could at
least make out like crazy

587
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:45,170
mad dash just go in like 10 points
security guard face

588
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:50,900
run up you got plan B

589
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:54,630
so egos and he tells the guy him from

590
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:57,840
to empower haven't some faults in the
area law

591
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:02,070
does not bind it all right he's a
decently train security guard he wants

592
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:03,650
nothing to do with its bullshit

593
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:07,120
everything's cool he's like well

594
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,200
is gonna hang it up in the air it's
really press and try and all these

595
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:10,650
different

596
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:14,240
see techniques trying to pace and trying
to do all this

597
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,710
somatic reading ship Ankara on Lee's

598
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:24,310
is really give them work right now raizy
turnarounds but give up warnaco

599
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:27,870
you know hit another method do runs out
in a data center is OK

600
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:30,970
are you from even and was there's a

601
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:34,710
yes of course and friend eaten

602
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,070
yet

603
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:39,830
and so he looked to the guard like he

604
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:45,320
and walks right by the guard in the do
grabs early roles and because the data

605
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:45,880

with them getting their data center fix
and we even signed out to be polite

738
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:45,410

00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:59,630
like I

743
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:03,960
or we have to get into some other stuff
is like hey here's the diagram above

744
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,730
where all the physical secured by the
way attacked the physical security

745
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:07,840
people Bay

746
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:12,380
but they also have things like keys

747
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:15,220

Richard

748
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:19,340
hell no get a key box it's the shittiest
lock that they have in their entire

749
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:19,970
enterprise

750
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:25,270
holding all the fucking keys to their
daughter rise if you can't go get the

751
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:26,530
keys to getting

752
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:31,030
make them want to leave happy h-back
system

753
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:35,330
internet up all locked people will just
go outside

754
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:40,100
people will open doors to their offices
hot because the office is hot

755
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:43,460
would you do open window or door

756
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:47,130
great what I do home in 10 or super easy

757
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:51,540
why it was that window open ok because I
compromiser age that system

758
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:54,760
you should fix that right to me

759
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:59,050
you can fake being a police officer or
you could just make up your own steak

760
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:03,020
organization that fuckin nothing in it
on a legal because it's illegal to

761
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:05,830
impersonate a police officer but it's
not illegal to be part of the

762
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:10,200
computer crime cyber in investigative
unit above 50 vision

763
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:15,870
old the world military

764
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:19,170
here I

765
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:23,230
real quickly add to these things
together right

766
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:26,600
and you start looking at social and
physical you can start reading people's

767
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,140
email

768
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:31,290
finally how to get into the physical
things through social constructs

769
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:34,980
so do that bring it the other way

770
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:38,230
I saw this the email I know the
authorization process that I have to get

771
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,240
into to get into this building cuz I
lived

772
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,420
you know I have offices big New York
building we have a fancy

773
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:47,400
ten dollar an hour security guards in
the bottom whatever just own most people

774
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,180
figure out the processes send the email
down to the front desk

775
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:54,140
they will walk you in happily right
because they find you

776
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:58,320
you don't need to find that I'm into

777
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:01,880
go to exile have no time right when you
find boxes use what you have on the

778
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:02,400
environment

779
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,540
you need to install script Windows is
really really good at finding shit so if

780
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:08,360
you need to find a certain person
machine

781
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:12,100
because you need to figure out how to
get access to another area physically

782
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:16,830
electronically you sum up the tools that
you have right be able to go query all

783
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:17,660
that on the fly

784
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:21,900
know these commands because by the time
you get in you need to find someone's

785
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:22,510
box

786
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:26,890
to get your next piece of information
you don't have time to go through

787
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:31,100
your and map above seventy-five thousand
hosts you won't have time

788
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:34,150
figure out how to find the host right
now where it is

789
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:37,810
to a trace 28 figure out what ports on
based on the naming convention

790
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:42,210
go to their office the all their shit
Lee trust me

791
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:45,590
so you will find it let refile users

792
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:48,970
figure out was on the ship and

793
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:53,490
go converge these things together I know
I have

794
00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:56,400
well

795
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:01,099
not all is lost the only thing that I
can possibly leave you with

796
00:49:01,099 --> 00:49:04,390
after all these dumb stories re:

797
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:08,900
don't even get me started on the number
times then shot her for now to see you

798
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:11,529
later broke my nose and somebody break
my nose

799
00:49:11,529 --> 00:49:15,660
thats although I put a picture on my
face in the final report just

800
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:20,190
give it to 'em over your security guard
was affected because we stop in one

801
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:21,000
attacker

802
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,430
Elsword blood all over my face K

803
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:29,480
I went to the hospital undertook the day
I'm

804
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:32,839
the only reason I told the stories

805
00:49:32,839 --> 00:49:36,400
trying to communicate this way give your
script

806
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:41,260
is that I have found through the
execution some other things that we've

807
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:41,809
done

808
00:49:41,809 --> 00:49:46,079
in my company companies and people that
have worked with the industry over the

809
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:46,700
years

810
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:50,049
is the people really

811
00:49:50,049 --> 00:49:53,109
really really you get what we're talking
about

812
00:49:53,109 --> 00:49:56,980
really get it man really truly get it

813
00:49:56,980 --> 00:50:02,730
if we told the story correctly and if
you learn how to tell the story the

814
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:03,619
right way

815
00:50:03,619 --> 00:50:06,660
you'll be shocked at the amount of stuff
people this

816
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:10,270
so my challenge to everybody in here

817
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:14,279
is to learn how to be a better
storyteller is to learn

818
00:50:14,279 --> 00:50:17,529
how to take the awesome technical shit
that you do

819
00:50:17,529 --> 00:50:22,150
and make an approachable from the
absolutely

820
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:27,109
everywhere and of the population you
know if your report

821
00:50:27,109 --> 00:50:30,869
could go to your mother and she could
read it

822
00:50:30,869 --> 00:50:35,490
and know what to do next you're doing a
good job if you're reporting go to your

823
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:36,529
grandmother

824
00:50:36,529 --> 00:50:39,990
and your grandmother gets pissed about
how insecure people or

825
00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:43,880
and how things need to really be fixed
it's usually goes from like

826
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:47,690
you know like for computers you know
like to like really involved in it when

827
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:50,130
you're doing a really good job told the
story

828
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:53,789
but please don't point your finger at
the user's

829
00:50:53,789 --> 00:50:58,549
it's like having a child was your child

830
00:50:58,549 --> 00:51:02,140

like pro mother fucker can even talk

832
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,650

833
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:16,660
