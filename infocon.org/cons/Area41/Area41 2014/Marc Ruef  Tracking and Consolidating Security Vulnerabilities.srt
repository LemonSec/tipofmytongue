1
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,010
so hello to my

2
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:15,200
ability management and

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,010
I have to admit the cool thing about my
presentation is the title of the

4
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:23,380
the flight deck and the saddest part is
the title wasn't even my idea

5
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,930
am and the problem is a bit bility
management

6
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:30,850
is a bit boring basically a it's very
hard to illustrate how to

7
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:34,440
to manage abilities I have had

8
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,170
and awareness training two weeks ago and
are usually put my favorite cat

9
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,840
funny cat videos in in my Venice
trainings so unfortunately I can't

10
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,500
includes caps using in the slight ache
am

11
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,040
but I feel try to show you how we do

12
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,790
mood ability management we have firmly
vulnerability database which is public

13
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:59,469
and we've doing this for quite some
while and

14
00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:03,090
as I think wanna be with the management
is very important for our

15
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:08,130
industry because it doesn't matter if
you are a pen tester or an administrator

16
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,170
researcher would have been these are
always important for you

17
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,700
to to understand risks and to put em in
in the context

18
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,290
so base he mine names mark roof I'm

19
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,950
if in Switzerland i have a web site and
now you wrote a few books

20
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,049
a.m.

21
00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:30,659
so what's I'm going to talk is so what
I'm going to show you is

22
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:33,820
how we approach the vulnerability now
database

23
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,229
and I will show how the woman bilities
are maintained

24
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:41,590
by other on the bill the databases so
what this woman ability database

25
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:44,720
the definitions quite simple it's a
database

26
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,750
which collects with her abilities and
there might be different reasons why you

27
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:50,770
want to do dat

28
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:54,140
and basically most people's do that for

29
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:57,409
vulnerability management's to see but

30
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:00,299
bility some available and which picture

31
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:04,510
might be applied to to guarantee a
minimum level of security

32
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:09,250
and will its databases might be fun to
do some statistical analysis

33
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:13,650
perhaps if you want to see how many
advisory Scott released for a specific

34
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:14,580
product

35
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,680
before you for you purchased this
product you might imply

36
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,030
how often you have to pay action how
much of maintenance

37
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,530
you have to to approach so this is

38
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:30,320
just a short overview of are willing to
build a database

39
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,930
and most will build databases have have
a listing of the

40
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:38,140
the latest entries and if you click on
an entry you see details for the

41
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,209
specific entry

42
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:42,959
this morning's Microsoft Internet
Explorer offer overflow

43
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,519
which got released recently so

44
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,390
from when you start to do bility
management and to collect

45
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:56,480
bility you have to think about how you
wanna do that

46
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,410
and the first thing you have to think
about this how many

47
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:04,310
bility Steve wants to to maintain your
ability database

48
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:07,850
I'm ideally you are going to

49
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:11,150
to provide a full coverage going to to
ads

50
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:15,100
everyone ability there the terrace but
this takes a lot of time

51
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,260
so most companies or ability database
man there's

52
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,610
use a selective collection for example

53
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,480
if you're

54
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,549
company and try to maintain ability
database usually do only

55
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:33,650
at products that use that you have in
your inventory

56
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,700
but they're my rice the problem

57
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:41,310
what if you am at woman abilities for a
specific product today

58
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:44,340
and you're going to introduce a new
product tomorrow

59
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,060
you would have to at all dolled
abilities to see

60
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,489
how this product acts in life cycle
security

61
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:55,280
I am our

62
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,910
vulnerability database is covering the
most popular products and and the most

63
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:00,680
interesting

64
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,890
bility so this means if there is are
very unpopular

65
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:08,609
where CMS with some

66
00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:12,780
obscure across its creeping you're not
really interested but of course fee

67
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,310
provide information for microsoft adobe
and

68
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,400
the more big players in

69
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,500
in the business and if you start

70
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,669
to do bility management you have to
think about am

71
00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:29,310
for whom are you doing this is this

72
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:33,349
a public service you wanna provide like
do we see

73
00:04:33,349 --> 00:04:37,270
this as a and as advertising for our
company but you also use this

74
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,990
information internally for

75
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:42,500
and tasers and the try to to map

76
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,380
a finding in a penetration test to our
bility database

77
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,340
I'm some there are some commercial

78
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:54,180
vulnerability database players like
Secunia which provide commercial feeds

79
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,650
you have to pay them and you gets

80
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:00,130
more or detailed information and I know

81
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:04,400
of several companies which uses an
internal database

82
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,539
which to use foreign inventory
maintenance and patch

83
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:11,389
pitch management so

84
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:14,530
this is the information that usually

85
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:17,720
is the minimum for for and intelligent

86
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,039
entry and then she usually has an ID has
fight

87
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,259
small description a.m. need Ely

88
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:27,930
and risk rating and if you're

89
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:31,039
a bit more fancy you provide additional
sources:

90
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:37,660
so you might be able to do some more
research but details are true

91
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,220
from in our database we have different
groupings

92
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,720
of information so we have softer
information ability applies to exploit

93
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,100
countermeasure sources through

94
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:50,430
and miscount and a.m. I have choice

95
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:54,530
displayed a few of exploit information
you're collecting so

96
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:58,860
for example is an exploit available what
was the disclosure data exploits

97
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:03,169
the name of the more per in which
language was explored written in how

98
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:04,669
reliable is to exploit

99
00:06:04,669 --> 00:06:08,090
and stuff like that and and the problem
is

100
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:12,130
as more details you are collecting as
more data you have to man who

101
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:15,300
am we have in the last 11 years

102
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,500
compiled more than 13,000 entries

103
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,949
from and we

104
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:26,130
use approximately 150 data points per
entry

105
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:29,510
that means we have 150 different
information

106
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:33,260
details available in an entry and

107
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,360
because its impossible to

108
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,400
at all of them because you don't have
time and often you don't a few

109
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,159
information

110
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:43,599
so we have to to provide priority which

111
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:47,169
data which information which data point
is important for

112
00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:50,560
foreign entry in which must be added and
which shall be a

113
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,250
am in our priority we have to find 233

114
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,310
information

115
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:59,930
facts must be added if they are
available 32

116
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,950
or a.m. available if they are available

117
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:06,600
you might at them and you have if you
have a lot of time you have

118
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:11,020
for you can ask the other 85 information
data points

119
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:14,270
the statistical analysis of all the

120
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:18,790
the entries we've made in the last 11
years show stopper usually

121
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:22,570
at about 50 data points per entry and

122
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:26,430
the worst entries have just 20 62 points
and the best entries

123
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:29,810
have ninety data points and as more
popular

124
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:33,030
vulnerability is more interesting as
more time to invest

125
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:36,730
to to add more data to do some some for
analysis

126
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:41,360
try to develop our own exploits to to at
additional data which might be

127
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,290
interesting for us

128
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:46,110
internally and for our customers and

129
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:49,690
just as the trivia usually at
approximately 15 entries

130
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:53,090
workday that's the average

131
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:56,640
we have had in during 2000 forty

132
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,090
so

133
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:04,180
where'd you get information about
fuhrman abilities i think thats nothing

134
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,580
really new you have to learn bility
databases

135
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,790
you have contributors like CDI

136
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:13,130
you have a lot mailing list intrinsic
mailing lists like

137
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:16,860
track full disclosure or you have a
divisive

138
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,390
vendors mailing list which might also
include men's advisories

139
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:24,760
we are also very much focusing on

140
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,740
code repositories because we think thats
whenever

141
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,020
a committee a.m. is available and

142
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:35,560
the security-related of course it might
be in the future

143
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,970
pop up in the release notes or in an
advisory so

144
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:42,100
the moment we are monitoring the country
for stories

145
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,220
sauce some advantage because you might
be much faster

146
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:49,330
and you'll just have to wait until the
public advisory which

147
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:57,620
sometimes takes a few days or even weeks
until it got three least

148
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:02,810
here are some of the the major players
who've my ability databases knife try to

149
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,730
compile the pros and cons of them

150
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:13,499
a.m. sorry

151
00:09:13,499 --> 00:09:16,920
in there was some

152
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:22,079
some interesting shift in the last few
years for example with BBB

153
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:26,730
close listing on the main page a few
years back

154
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:29,769
and day close to the horse's feet and

155
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:32,990
day prevent you from downloading

156
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:37,149
database anymore which is very sad and
securing introduced

157
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:41,809
a few weeks ago the requirement that you
have to login

158
00:09:41,809 --> 00:09:44,939
on the website to see you there terrible
ability listing

159
00:09:44,939 --> 00:09:48,809
and I think that's not very good
progress because

160
00:09:48,809 --> 00:09:52,870
it makes in the informational really
visible anymore you have to

161
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:56,639
to put much more efforts to gain
disinformation

162
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,240
your interests I've tried to rate

163
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,910
these different vulnerability database
sources I'm

164
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:07,559
three means that the source is
supporting this feature

165
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:11,350
often or fully number two is a

166
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:14,920
just partially supported one is
sometimes known as you race that

167
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:19,579
resources in supporting I'm like to
point out that

168
00:10:19,579 --> 00:10:23,509
on the bottom is our own boonville it is
a division of course we got the best

169
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:24,160
scoring

170
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,459
that's not a surprise not because you're
much better

171
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:32,290
but because am that the attributes that
are important for the slider also

172
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:33,319
important for me

173
00:10:33,319 --> 00:10:36,649
and that's the reason why we have
implemented all these features of course

174
00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:39,540
if somebody else is going to do an
evaluation of the different sources

175
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:43,839
might not come out on top I am

176
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,620
to list is sorted over basically by the
name of the

177
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,809
of the source and a.m. what's

178
00:10:51,809 --> 00:10:54,920
interesting to see is that the coach

179
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,470
is different between the different
databases there are some which covers

180
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:58,860
just

181
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,709
a few will it isn't there some the cover
everything was

182
00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:05,220
BBB might have to press coverage

183
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:09,770
for the last 150 years I'm the quickness
is also

184
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,950
very different some very quick some or
rich

185
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:16,120
on average I'm I think it's very

186
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,710
its depending on how much manpower you
have behind your project

187
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:23,630
and that's the reason why we don't cover
every product because

188
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:26,640
we don't have to have the manpower to to
at all

189
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,150
ability the country's everyday am

190
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:33,260
what I think it's very interesting just
a few

191
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:37,110
just to let ability databases from Mike
their own risk rating

192
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,110
one of them Secunia one of them is

193
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:44,500
aus and it makes me very sad to see that
cVS is course

194
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,550
or not very popular still a very popular

195
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:53,310
when the CSS got released I wasn't a big
fan of it I have written a few articles

196
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:53,890
about the

197
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:59,830
which aren't which burned ferrier I
wasn't very supporting the project

198
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:04,010
but over time I realized it's
unfortunately the best solution to its

199
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:05,530
it's open it's available

200
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:08,530
and it has some level of consistency and
I

201
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:12,050
hella people of beef temporal score
CBS's temples course

202
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:17,610
I'm temples course mmm respect am

203
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:22,950
every information that might change over
time for example is an exploitive

204
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:26,350
available research the sand is a patch
available

205
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:29,500
so CBS's temple score changes over time

206
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,620
and the moment some odd reason patch to

207
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:36,360
the score keeps hi and at the moment
some boundaries and sorry

208
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,630
the moment somebody reason exploited
skolki ty

209
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:44,640
the moment somebody release a patch to
score falls down an inset to cede its

210
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,230
the other databases don't really support
at what's he's very popular

211
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:53,080
and I'm very grateful for this costs as
the we'll see later it makes

212
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,510
work a lot easier and Remy

213
00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:00,490
remaining one he's feats or very
unpopular I'm

214
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,650
from time to time you sign lost RSS feed
user

215
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:07,180
on this planet but I still like horse's
feet

216
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:12,310
nobody else does I am

217
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:15,670
technical details range from bad to
goods

218
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,910
some databases do not really provide
information how to

219
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:23,820
the context of attack might look like
with a technique to stand and

220
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,840
how you might exploit something

221
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:32,570
and some others too so if you just so
simple title and the description

222
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:35,650
small description what the woman ability
might the

223
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:39,250
its very hard to understand how to
classify

224
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:43,280
your own system so thus a reason why you
have to use different sources

225
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,870
from them but if

226
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:50,040
I have added search you exploit TV knees

227
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:54,660
and BD meet recebi and they aren't
really believe in the database in the

228
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,460
classical sense like extort I've exclude

229
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:01,699
Pakistan because Pakistan has also
exploits and

230
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:05,540
and all the documents which orange
really important

231
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:08,739
tools which aren't partner for ability

232
00:14:08,739 --> 00:14:13,339
and this is it before it's very sad to
open

233
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:16,660
was found to be isn't really that open
anymore

234
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,929
I wish will change their mind a bit

235
00:14:19,929 --> 00:14:25,069
so they are will build a database isn't
there is a

236
00:14:25,069 --> 00:14:29,009
for or mentored by cerise here or a few
vendor center

237
00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:33,769
pros and cons a.m. once a game

238
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:37,639
I from a your rating and this time be
sorted tied the score

239
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:40,899
the forty cartons I'm a take on top

240
00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:44,989
provides from a viewer vulnerability
database maintained

241
00:14:44,989 --> 00:14:50,319
the best information and as you can see
on bottom

242
00:14:50,319 --> 00:14:53,769
or Google and Apple a.m. and

243
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:57,970
what is surprising is that Microsoft and
Oracle

244
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:02,749
aren't that bad Microsoft advises became
much better over the years

245
00:15:02,749 --> 00:15:05,859
and they provide a lot of information

246
00:15:05,859 --> 00:15:11,720
about what I have two sides

247
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,769
say some vendor applies URL's are
extremely ugly

248
00:15:15,769 --> 00:15:18,989
I'm for example HPC a.m.

249
00:15:18,989 --> 00:15:22,759
hewlett-packard's mmm by see where else
are usually

250
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:26,160
700 meters long and contain ten
different

251
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,169
gets her meters and

252
00:15:29,169 --> 00:15:32,410
that feels a bit like they don't really
wants that you

253
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:36,789
were able to share it is this link they
try to make you don't be so we don't

254
00:15:36,789 --> 00:15:37,169
ship

255
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:39,920
I am

256
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,440
CBS's course and own rating systems
remain also very unpopular

257
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,839
among bender advice Reese

258
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,430
and I think the reason is that it's very
hard to rate

259
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:55,690
yourself and and I've been doing some

260
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:58,860
CVSS analysis of fiscal for quite a
while

261
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,020
and I have to feeling a comparably Jets

262
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:05,190
but they have to feeling that they
always try

263
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:08,510
to provide a CVSS score below 7.0

264
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:12,339
perhaps they treated don't want your
exposure

265
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:16,080
that comes with an believability and
higher score

266
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,480
so day trying to tweak to CVS risk or
repeat so they

267
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,220
silky below this threshold I'm

268
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:27,649
still a good thing is that vendors

269
00:16:27,649 --> 00:16:31,320
also rely on CV which is pretty cool and
from vendors

270
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:36,010
to be extra for example juniper has
field on the vendor by city

271
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:39,089
Colts most updated and its

272
00:16:39,089 --> 00:16:42,830
it's really the updates that a lot the
date of the last update of your eyes re

273
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:46,660
which might change over time boats they
don't have a disclosure date

274
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:50,529
so if you look at the vendor advisory
public enterprises of

275
00:16:50,529 --> 00:16:53,890
juniper you can't really see when the
supplies they got released

276
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:57,290
and they are different men the switch
have to problem

277
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:01,250
xn had it a few weeks ago and the poster
didn't return the two

278
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:05,290
they changed it which is very nice but
orders

279
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:08,300
to also Wittstock

280
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:13,599
and SAT is a very good example because
they are very very restrictive means

281
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,500
it comes to information about bonneville
it is in the products for the public

282
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:22,400
availability the only provides the
mentor vice information for their

283
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,110
customers

284
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:26,280
would you have to provide the
information that your customer

285
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,620
intangible gets looking and you're able
to axis

286
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:32,700
venture advisory with this introduces
launch

287
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,900
big problem for for non-customers like
we are you not

288
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,220
across my face like so we can't really
ads

289
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:44,540
SAP advisories in a timely manner we
have to wait until the information goes

290
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,250
public

291
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:49,100
for example from multiple ability
database with a customer relationship is

292
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:49,559
able

293
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:54,080
to to collect this information So we can
get inspired and try to its decision

294
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,460
tree am

295
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,970
so as a customer

296
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:03,080
or or you might think okay if you're in
mississippi customer anyway you have

297
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,000
taxes and you're going to look at the
Ventura

298
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,490
by six white uni w/ bill its database in
external ability

299
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:12,669
base and the problem is that many
customers as we will see

300
00:18:12,669 --> 00:18:16,200
maintaining different vulnerabilities
from different sources is a lot of work

301
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,990
and that's the reason why many

302
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:22,060
customers use external

303
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:25,900
ability databases because the civil
liability for precompiled then filtered

304
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,200
and sorted and stuff like that and

305
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,360
they don't really want you to to feet

306
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,270
everything from the industry would have
dozens of different feeds and

307
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:38,490
this takes a lot of time so if the
vulnerability database is

308
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:42,480
are behind schedule for it's the
advisories also the costumes

309
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,850
good behind schedule that's not too so

310
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:49,480
I in my opinion

311
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,600
publicly making information publicly
available is a good thing for everyone

312
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,930
only detect ice get on a plane to see if
you don't

313
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:03,060
to some then they are willfully
contributor sign defense

314
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:06,460
and cdii which also provide information

315
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:10,880
or availability is I'm dislike is not
very interesting

316
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,090
and indeed the only at the moment two
major players

317
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:17,090
and they are very similar a.m. and

318
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:20,690
I'd like to see more competition order
or I like to see them go

319
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:25,640
I'm not really a big fan of such
contributors

320
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:30,340
I think there are better ways to
contribute so

321
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:33,970
the basic idea if you

322
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:37,870
analyze or if you want to add the
vulnerability

323
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:41,000
to your database issue you check the
different sources there are many

324
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,420
different sources Middle East

325
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:46,740
before and you have to review the entry
tickets available to you

326
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:51,290
and then you have to side if his entry
is already available in your database

327
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:54,750
you might want to merge the the daytime
and you might

328
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:59,590
12 X the reference East the new source
or if the entries not available you have

329
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,010
to create a new entry

330
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:05,350
or if the source is the fourth positif
you might want to deal with it

331
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:08,810
you might want to ignore the entry or
flack

332
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:12,740
extent report flag it so you don't would
have to process it

333
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:17,290
in the future this sounds very easy

334
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:21,840
what isn't really chuffed because they
are so many different sources

335
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,010
and their is not a very good
normalization of

336
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:28,890
how the information is available

337
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:32,110
for example DC's a CV entry

338
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:36,040
when I go to the website the CDC be idea
of course

339
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:40,110
list trypsin sometimes the softer name
the version number is

340
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:43,340
mentioned in the description you have
for advice URL

341
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:47,010
and you have some additional links

342
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:50,350
which is a good thing a good starting
point to at this to you

343
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:54,320
ability database but there are a lot of
things missing for example

344
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,450
the disclosure date isn't mentioned a.m.

345
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:01,230
CV is usually not naming to correct
mobility cloth

346
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:04,480
so you don't really know if its if

347
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,360
it is a memory corruption is suitable
for a flow is that the format string

348
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,810
music to own the

349
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:12,820
denial-of-service whatever a.m. there's
no risk rating

350
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:16,130
their is no mention of the researcher

351
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:19,370
which is responsible for the disclosure
so you have to use

352
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:22,690
on the source to find this information
with might be available

353
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:26,030
or might not just examples

354
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:29,560
West need to be in this you can see
there there is much more information

355
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,200
available

356
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,050
you have for example you know if

357
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:37,230
an exploit this public you have detailed
information which

358
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:40,880
version is affected in which one is not
and you have additional links

359
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,230
I'm this is a very good starting point

360
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:50,340
to compile your vulnerabilities course
what

361
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:53,630
then comes another problem you have
different sources

362
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:57,670
and what is the disclosure dateable
ability the different sources have

363
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:58,830
different definitions

364
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:02,040
of the a disclosure dates for example

365
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,360
on the the left hand side East the
comics

366
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,000
of patch which fixes the vulnerability
in SMP

367
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,660
and on the right East

368
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,370
to

369
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:16,600
release notes of diversion which fixed
it and as you can see 22

370
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:21,710
dates or parts and you don't really know
which one is now that that the

371
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:23,350
disclosure date if the moon ability

372
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:26,360
and this little fly

373
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,860
tries to illustrate this problem I'm

374
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:34,919
you have two different sources a.m. our
vulnerability database uses

375
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:38,690
their 19th of February as this closure
date because the crust

376
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:43,049
moments patch cops committed for the
project

377
00:22:43,049 --> 00:22:46,669
so in how to finish in the moment our
vulnerability

378
00:22:46,669 --> 00:22:50,080
might the available to the public
without restriction

379
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,870
that's the moment where the disclosure
happens but

380
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:57,039
we are the only on ability database
which

381
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:01,049
use the state with me be realized from
the release notes

382
00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:06,010
which were five days later so they have
to 26 to February

383
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:10,909
security focus into Q no sometimes three
of each other

384
00:23:10,909 --> 00:23:15,289
which leads to the fact that stay have
the same

385
00:23:15,289 --> 00:23:21,750
wrong disclosure date or whatever as he
uses to assess security posting dates

386
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:26,080
and security trickery uses the redhead
advisory date

387
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,190
and is pretty interesting as you can see
the disclosure dates for the same

388
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:31,110
vulnerability

389
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:34,630
this approximately one month for parts
so

390
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:38,480
man got this would be the published it's
a question

391
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:44,030
which is not easy to answer so

392
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:47,780
if you have different sources you might
wanna put this information together in

393
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,460
that right

394
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:52,679
22 to rates the quality of the
information from the different from

395
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:53,970
ability databases

396
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:59,000
I'm and as you can see product and
version is usually available

397
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,789
sometimes not always that is

398
00:24:02,789 --> 00:24:07,150
some sources don't you should disclose
date: and the DNC

399
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:10,610
meet receive the don't usually
disclosure date and

400
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:13,940
what you might see on the first glance
is

401
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:17,390
that information about exploits became

402
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:22,380
over the years pretty rare 10-15 years
ago when somebody published

403
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,740
and vulnerability in not my city on the
mailing list

404
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:29,730
you we're very proud the moment you were
also able to provide an exploits

405
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:32,790
and perhaps the noble more books for
free movement

406
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:38,010
destroyed this idea and aunt people
became too lazy to provide exploits

407
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:41,390
there's just the vulnerability which
claims a.k.a for memory corruption

408
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:45,940
and its good luck to guess what kind of

409
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:49,880
memory corruption despite the vendor has
confirmed to build ability so the resume

410
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,380
ability but nobody knows

411
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:54,630
what it really does a good example rpm
their

412
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:58,230
advisories I'm I've had a customer which

413
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:01,450
which d-mont it's that we are going to
exploit a.m.

414
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:05,679
and you're in there environment because
quality report police report a simple

415
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:06,940
ability some high-level

416
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:11,820
high-rated abilities and the problem was
we haven't had any chance to know what

417
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,330
kind of a liability issues are

418
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:18,940
so if no information is available you
can confirm that this will be the Texas

419
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:23,840
her definition or in your environment
and

420
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,080
what is also very sad is that a few
vulnerability database is

421
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,230
don't link to outsource which I think
it's not a good thing

422
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:35,260
in different ways because it's not very
motivating if you don't

423
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:38,310
if you don't get it tribution and

424
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:41,380
and as a customer of of a source

425
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:45,630
I'm very interested in different sources
because it helps me to validate into

426
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:51,420
to collect information so

427
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:54,860
West PDB provides the best this
collection and junior

428
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:58,110
provides diverse collection I'm from

429
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:03,630
my rating point a few secure security
focus in Secunia

430
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:07,160
usually don't provide context context
means you get

431
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,230
the information that there is a
vulnerability in this product and it

432
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,310
might be disclosed

433
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:16,170
both you don't know if you know
authentication you don't know if you

434
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:17,260
were

435
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:21,050
whatever if it has to be full moon to
exploit this vulnerability

436
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:24,470
you don't know what's the context
abilities

437
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:28,400
x-force from IBM

438
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,940
secure to trek into junior usually or in
most cases don't provide exploit

439
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:33,640
information

440
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:38,150
saudis sources are on usable if your pen
tester you

441
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:44,620
you have just the starting point but
nothing more so

442
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:48,160
that's the reason why you have to
correlate because the different sources

443
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,220
provide different kind of information

444
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:56,110
and different quality of information to
try to merge them together and you try

445
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:58,560
to cook to compare similar data points

446
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:02,590
as I pointed out if the disclosure date
even some something simple like this

447
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,550
like the public release date:

448
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:08,470
is not easy to normalize so you

449
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:12,820
tried to identify contradictions and it
often happens

450
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:16,820
that for example x-force and security
focus use a different

451
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:22,210
will bility cloth and so you don't then
don't really know which class is correct

452
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:23,130
so you have to

453
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:26,630
to check to a regional advisory and

454
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:30,810
sometimes it gets a lot efforts cries a
lot of effort to find this information

455
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:31,690
to its

456
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:35,920
Reddick or information and the moment
you're correlating

457
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,100
you're running into a possible danger
the moment

458
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:42,880
a.m. if you to republicans in your
database

459
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,940
it's very annoying because you're
suddenly you have

460
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:50,210
more vulnerabilities them there are and

461
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:54,810
what is even more dangerous he's if you
merge woman abilities

462
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:58,670
that means if there is a buffer overflow
on there is a format string

463
00:27:58,670 --> 00:27:59,520
vulnerability

464
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,850
this might get page into same version
the same patch

465
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:07,710
and one of the ability database
contributors claims this is one

466
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:11,270
memory corruption it is one memory
corruption perhaps in the same function

467
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:11,730
whatever

468
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:15,320
a.m. and you create one entry

469
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:19,330
but in fact it is two entries through
woman abilities if different tactic

470
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:22,690
at the connectors and so merchants or

471
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:26,380
o'rourke East Asia national or a problem
which

472
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:32,490
which cannot be underestimated and then

473
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:35,940
is the moment when thinks are getting
tricky and in this if it before I am

474
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,490
very grateful for Stevie

475
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:40,820
because it helps to distinguish between
the different

476
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:44,110
believability a.m. what

477
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:47,750
some vulnerabilities or some advice is
don't have a TV or or

478
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:51,220
get to see the assigned very late so if
you

479
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:55,240
try to keep your database very updated
you have to deal

480
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:00,870
of if the situation that there is no
clear a 25.2% ability

481
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:04,000
and then there's not a problem that

482
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,300
many sources merch vulnerabilities into
one entry

483
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:11,700
a.m. vendors usually do that

484
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,120
mister

485
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,270
releases or a pic status for example

486
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:21,549
never know recoup HD comes out there or
approximately 80 85% from their

487
00:29:21,549 --> 00:29:22,899
abilities in their products

488
00:29:22,899 --> 00:29:26,250
and they are listed in one advisory and
some

489
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:30,120
sources claim this swarm vulnerability
entry

490
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,169
to force these are different bilities
indifferent

491
00:29:33,169 --> 00:29:37,330
products if different data collectors
different from ability close

492
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:42,520
so in my opinion it doesn't make sense
to group them together I am

493
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,610
yeah

494
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:48,669
and and the problem is

495
00:29:48,669 --> 00:29:52,559
if them if benders

496
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,360
or or researchers are in providing
enough details about the vulnerability

497
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,090
you sometimes can't distinguish between
them and

498
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:04,559
the best example is always the de page
day if they release

499
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:08,380
will bilities memory corruption in Becky
or Safari

500
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:11,940
you you have sometimes you have no
chance

501
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:15,929
to to understand which one which will
build it is different only difference is

502
00:30:15,929 --> 00:30:16,580
that

503
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:19,990
the research in a much different and the
become

504
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:23,950
to at to see which is very helpful but
fifties are not available you can

505
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:24,929
distinguish in

506
00:30:24,929 --> 00:30:28,590
memory corruption that keep their or
hundreds of them available

507
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:31,640
so which one is it and do you already
have it

508
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:36,140
in your date so

509
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:39,770
one of the major tasks of

510
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:44,179
vulnerability database management is not
only adding the data to database but it

511
00:30:44,179 --> 00:30:44,980
is also

512
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:48,690
maintaining the sources am you have to

513
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:52,159
to keep track all the sources that you
have reviewed you have to keep track of

514
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:53,230
old blue bilities

515
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:56,360
that you have processed so you won't
process them later on

516
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:00,400
again which might concluding to win

517
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,870
and pollution into and public and

518
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:08,040
because desis this takes a lot of time

519
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,270
to to see if the republicans we have
editor

520
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:15,210
a routine which helps of to determine if

521
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:18,950
durability might already been
established database

522
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:23,180
and easiest way is to see if

523
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:27,390
that my city identifiers already
available or devices where L is

524
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:28,080
available

525
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,980
and and you cans check if the sources if
there are

526
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:35,980
sources if the same references and if
there is a public at

527
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:39,010
you have to check if this is really a
public a story if

528
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:43,950
just chill sources have provided
collected injury am

529
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:47,600
there is a project called you feeds
which

530
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,760
triste to compile all the different
references

531
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:54,160
from different databases from different
vendors some from different tools

532
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:57,780
and you might enter in my view of recebi

533
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:01,660
affordability and you get older ID
softer

534
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:08,470
the sources which is very helpful so

535
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:12,050
I've if I have fared am some benders

536
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:16,420
or bility database maintenance compile
their vulnerabilities in one entry

537
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:22,500
and when you start to believe billeted

538
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:32,100
p

539
00:32:32,100 --> 00:33:09,539
of

540
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:13,470
up

541
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:18,140
blue okay sorry

542
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:21,409
so you have to think about if if you
want to split

543
00:33:21,409 --> 00:33:24,490
mobility sorry if you don't want to
split em and

544
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:27,549
this is a very good example you have one
advisory

545
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:31,419
which might includes two different
vulnerability classes across the

546
00:33:31,419 --> 00:33:33,190
scripting in an escrow injection

547
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:36,860
and the cross site scripting is also
divided because they are to Tulsa

548
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:40,950
cross-eyed strip things or or there are
two different competence affect its

549
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:45,120
in three different files and against
your four different

550
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,990
and arguments which might be used for an
exploitation

551
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:53,809
so the question is when do you split and
how much do you sleep to create one

552
00:33:53,809 --> 00:33:54,330
entry

553
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:58,260
for Delphi seepage to trade two entries
for the win the political

554
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:02,600
or are you going to provide five
increase for 252 from para meterse

555
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:07,130
and this discussion is is really hard to
come to an end because

556
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:11,320
ideally you provide five entries 425 to
prepare meters

557
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:17,270
a.m. because you data collector sort it
exploitation is different so it requires

558
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:17,839
and

559
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:22,040
different entry a party you have in this
case you would have to act

560
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:28,230
and infinite amount of entries so

561
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:32,639
to different sources handled thinks
differently Microsoft for example

562
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:33,570
provides to

563
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:36,820
the page 3 advisory but never securing
our is

564
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,859
often very lazy and compile them in one
entry

565
00:34:39,859 --> 00:34:43,419
but they were not lazy enough to do it
for all the hard pleats

566
00:34:43,419 --> 00:34:47,560
for all the products that got affected
by Howard lead am

567
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,889
TV is usually splits not always

568
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:54,260
pots ninety-nine percent to split
security

569
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:58,830
focuses in this case plates both the
sometimes compiled vulnerability

570
00:34:58,830 --> 00:34:59,490
switches

571
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:03,980
pretty strange for example the Google
Chrome bility Sourav compiled in one

572
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:06,619
entry which doesn't make sense because
otherwise stable

573
00:35:06,619 --> 00:35:10,330
could also compile Safari

574
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:13,760
abilities and everything else and we try
to split

575
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,450
whenever possible about I have to admit

576
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:22,130
the moment if the same product if two
different products from the same vendor

577
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:25,140
but if the same version and from the
same family

578
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,430
we create one entry but we

579
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:31,940
states that no different products
affected usually don't copy

580
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:35,059
he expects a mention because thats ways

581
00:35:35,059 --> 00:35:38,460
so this is a very good example

582
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,990
as you can see that the listing from the
vulnerabilities the law is

583
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:47,150
is how we at the this advisory to our
database

584
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:50,599
and as you can see this is one advisory
which contains

585
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:54,030
a few entries and

586
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:57,420
so if you or Secunia and create one
entry

587
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,790
you have much less worked in had with
this entry

588
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:06,220
so

589
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:10,390
when you split went to sleep and not to
split it depends what your goals or

590
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:13,880
a.m. I think that splitting is

591
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:17,410
is a good thing because you can always
group of the woods but it takes a lot of

592
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:18,160
time so

593
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,530
I think it depends how much man work and
how much time

594
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:27,069
and effort you would like to put in your
database so

595
00:36:27,069 --> 00:36:30,430
you have two different sources you try
to compile all the information

596
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:34,339
and a.m. its get the hearts to

597
00:36:34,339 --> 00:36:37,690
to understand woman abilities especially
if there are only

598
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:40,700
information fragments available and a.m.

599
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:44,390
we always check for plausibility
sometimes they don't

600
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:49,010
pretty weird entry some security focus
which doesn't make sense perhaps they

601
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:53,220
clicked on the wrong entry while they
try to update another entry

602
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:56,410
we try to verify different sources

603
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:59,640
that's that's clear and if

604
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:03,130
vulnerabilities very interesting then we

605
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:06,710
trying to retested in a lap environment

606
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:09,920
and of course we do this

607
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,970
this is usually part of another project
for example if

608
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:16,490
customer really got affected if this
will be the TV

609
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:22,250
put this edition left for in it and gain
advantage in the project and

610
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:27,630
gain advantage affordable ability
database when we started the database 3

611
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:31,680
made much more left testing but it
became

612
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,390
nearly impossible because there are so
many products and so many platforms

613
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:38,550
upon have two left for for everything
exploit them

614
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:42,720
and then you have to to eliminates the
wrong statements

615
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,780
am some mobility

616
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:49,320
database delete old entries some of them
pics

617
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,970
preserve falls and Terese CV in security
focused

618
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:56,300
do this and and what we do is

619
00:37:56,300 --> 00:38:01,200
we've lacked and Terese so we have a
field which is called adviser disputed

620
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:06,040
it's a bowl and field yes number one
means

621
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:09,960
that advisory is this disputed and that

622
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:14,010
it's not clear if this woman really
really axis and CVSS

623
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:18,760
version 2 temples course provides the
matrix report confidence

624
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,790
and reflect im also in this and

625
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:26,090
sometimes be a traditional takes to
explain why my think this is the fourth

626
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:32,280
yeah as I said before the

627
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,800
are different views when it comes to
disclosure dates and there are different

628
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,760
use minutes comes worsening I am as you
can see

629
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,270
a.m. x-force with db6

630
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:47,490
security focus acuna and we try to use
except version numbering

631
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:50,500
a.m. so if version

632
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,690
7 89 and 10 of Internet Explorer got
affected

633
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:56,700
we write affected the seven eight nine
ten

634
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:00,650
but this takes a lot of time especially
if the products or or

635
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:03,840
beats on on popular and if there are

636
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:07,220
minor version increase month which
aren't really

637
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:10,930
linear because he would have to find out
okay which version

638
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:13,160
proceeded the affected version

639
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,860
mistakes in a lot of time am so

640
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:19,890
all the databases and reduce week
sometime in early

641
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:23,720
entries use wild cards and

642
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:27,460
but most often use Rangers and

643
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:30,460
and what is very confusing is if a

644
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:34,690
source uses term intellectually explore
before 10

645
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:38,310
usually means that version 10

646
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:42,360
is in the fact it only on till nine is
affected but if

647
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:46,400
same source uses the term up to 10 it
includes number ten

648
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,350
am and its

649
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:52,290
interesting to see that for example
security tracker

650
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:56,070
has sometimes be tough this confusion
and

651
00:39:56,070 --> 00:40:00,690
yeah you have to to look at very

652
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:04,110
in a much more detailed understand the
maintains

653
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:08,080
think so what about your mom

654
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:11,940
the moment the moment from at the moment

655
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:15,070
very much the abilities or

656
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:20,070
published this with not much information
of defective version

657
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:23,460
if you're lucky them and it is unknown

658
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:26,980
vendors disclosure they include
diversion

659
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:31,750
they have to test it on usually to
exploit published an exploit the

660
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:35,230
contain at least a version that got
perfect and

661
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:39,610
but it is of the case that earlier
versions were also affected

662
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:43,010
and Dan you have to find out if this is
the case in

663
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:46,690
it's different if you write in your
database a que version 10 got affected

664
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:47,530
or if you

665
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:51,220
regulate database version on till or
including

666
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:54,420
10 are affected so you have to do

667
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:57,460
for for validation you have to do

668
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:00,730
more research a.m. and we do this

669
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:03,730
for for dinner interesting abilities
game

670
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:09,280
a better level of quality so if you have
people to build a database

671
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,510
you might want to push this information
mostly bility databases are available on

672
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:14,590
the on the website

673
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:17,650
some of them provide males

674
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:22,470
subscription old school style just a few
provide or sis feats or similar

675
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:27,119
feats a.m. and for example push
information

676
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:30,810
onto Twitter which is not our most
popular

677
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:34,060
channel but I think might be useful for

678
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:39,750
from or other first so statistical
analysis

679
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:43,849
is the conclusion of affordability
management you might be able to do a

680
00:41:43,849 --> 00:41:45,109
statistical analysis

681
00:41:45,109 --> 00:41:48,560
and there are different people which
think

682
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,740
statistical analysis is useless or is

683
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:57,150
even possible I don't share this opinion
100 percent

684
00:41:57,150 --> 00:42:00,240
I think doing a good statistical
analysis

685
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,530
takes a lot of effort and understanding
and it's really hard but

686
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:06,910
it's possible to get something out of
your data

687
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:10,490
them what's is wrong and remain strong

688
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:13,800
is counting vulnerabilities because a.m.

689
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,150
a popular product will always have more

690
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:20,160
advisories or or more vulnerabilities
than

691
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:24,609
less popular product I'm if you have a
big bucks county program

692
00:42:24,609 --> 00:42:26,130
which

693
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:29,160
provides a lot of money you will gain
more

694
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:32,280
researchers which we'll find perhaps
more abilities

695
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:36,510
so you can't really compare apples
differential a.m.

696
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:39,790
but we do provide statistical data on
the website and

697
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:43,510
its free for the viewer to understand
the to work with them

698
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:46,520
don't really pushed statistical data

699
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:51,290
I'm

700
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:54,820
a big fan of timelines because stay

701
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:57,890
the provide some for me some kind of
security

702
00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:01,720
because everything is fine condition is
nice am

703
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:05,580
and we have different data points you
know vulnerability database

704
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:10,070
regarding dates so we have just a few
weeks

705
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:13,140
if the heartbeat with ability which got
released

706
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:17,340
or which got introduced on the 1st of
January 2012

707
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:21,460
I realized it would be very nice to read
the fields which contains the

708
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:22,940
introduction date to formal

709
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:26,900
ability so I have to

710
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:30,350
the introduction date and I have to the
countermeasure date

711
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:34,230
and so you can I can see the time span
how long

712
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:38,380
was this woman ability existing and what
is the theoretical

713
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:43,700
timeframe for 10 the exploits for this
one bility

714
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:47,180
and you have the problem is

715
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:52,410
we haven't had at this data from the
beginning so we have to

716
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:55,460
as its in our backlog think

717
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:58,410
that this is going to be very
interesting because you can see how

718
00:43:58,410 --> 00:43:59,110
different

719
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:03,230
spenders react how much effort they put
in

720
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:06,970
release account here

721
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:10,120
are some trivia for example to Hartley
twin ability

722
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:14,030
got introduced between introduction

723
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:18,420
and fix eight on the 27 days a

724
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:21,580
libvirt denial of service

725
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:23,380
more than

726
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:26,699
1500 ace and the Linux kernel good
ability

727
00:44:26,699 --> 00:44:30,949
nearly two thousand days on tilt
affordability was found and fixed

728
00:44:30,949 --> 00:44:37,679
your so

729
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:40,789
am I liked working with data and I think

730
00:44:40,789 --> 00:44:43,899
its a good service to provide your data

731
00:44:43,899 --> 00:44:47,709
as far as possible so I like to see

732
00:44:47,709 --> 00:44:51,559
XML exports of affordability databases
or or advisories

733
00:44:51,559 --> 00:44:55,299
and be provide some CVS see

734
00:44:55,299 --> 00:44:59,399
3 exports a.m. yeah and I like to see

735
00:44:59,399 --> 00:45:02,429
people look at them and use them in the
paper said ever because

736
00:45:02,429 --> 00:45:05,459
the whole industry benefit from such

737
00:45:05,459 --> 00:45:08,909
analysis I'm you're also

738
00:45:08,909 --> 00:45:13,469
supporting CP which is performance for
standardizing

739
00:45:13,469 --> 00:45:16,539
product naming which allows

740
00:45:16,539 --> 00:45:19,569
to to interconnect

741
00:45:19,569 --> 00:45:24,089
if tools for example I written in
Tennessee scripts

742
00:45:24,089 --> 00:45:27,619
which saw some vulnerability scanning
based on

743
00:45:27,619 --> 00:45:33,169
version detection services and you're
going to at the CP support to increase

744
00:45:33,169 --> 00:45:39,009
reliability and stuff like that so

745
00:45:39,009 --> 00:45:43,899
I hope I was able to show you a bit how
ability management works and what the

746
00:45:43,899 --> 00:45:44,719
pitfalls

747
00:45:44,719 --> 00:45:49,929
of this work or a.m. I'd like to

748
00:45:49,929 --> 00:45:54,289
think Stefan and Stephen which supported

749
00:45:54,289 --> 00:45:57,509
me beef countless numbers of discussions

750
00:45:57,509 --> 00:46:01,029
and I think they are very very much
philosophical

751
00:46:01,029 --> 00:46:02,640
content in this

752
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,150
in this topic and I think it's very
important for our industry to

753
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:12,400
to understand how things work in the pic
so if there are any questions

754
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:21,570
please raise your hand thank you thank
you I have

755
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:25,370
two questions actually first one these
you see

756
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:29,080
takes you extra time to compile

757
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:32,670
yes and can you give us an idea how much

758
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:36,760
Manpower's days it takes you to publish

759
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,980
15 week so

760
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:43,320
how much time do you have to use for one
entry for example

761
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:47,560
yeah it depends them I'm I'm very fast
life

762
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:50,630
at its 24 first four years I was the
only long

763
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:54,150
mom maintain ability to do so when I
became very quickly

764
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:57,640
in when I see an advisor immediately
which information

765
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:00,820
relevant for me and if

766
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:05,330
just a few information is available
sometimes we have two minutes to add

767
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:06,350
woman tree

768
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:09,840
but only if there is just FYI
information and for some entries

769
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:13,640
life invested more than the four hours
but which might also include

770
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:18,680
streaming through Colts to understand
stability in two at more information

771
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:22,200
so it it really depends what do you
wanna

772
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:25,980
came from and the second second question
is

773
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:29,260
one what I'd like to see

774
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:33,460
be database is not only vulnerability
classes

775
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:38,019
based exploitation but also based home

776
00:47:38,019 --> 00:47:41,130
something like see that CW as in

777
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:44,130
what me seeing security control
