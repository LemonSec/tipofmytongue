and you probably noticed that you didn't
get coffee at the entrance

11
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,120
I wasn't really our fault because the
driver was no

12
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,410
dropping off the copy machines had an
accident on the roots

13
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:50,670
but they're here now so we're all fine

26

mention

156
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,750
am yes it's kinda foggy in smoke in here
but thats to smoke machine

157
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,250
it's not because people are smoking
because it's strictly non-smoking inside

158
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:14,620
so

159
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,680
please go outside there's a smoking area
as well

160
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,840
am or up stairs little fresh air

161
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:26,690
this usually healthy as well so please
consider ap

162
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:30,090
with this I obviously we also want to
thank our sponsors

163
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:33,120

not be possible

00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:19,230
exactly

177

184
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,240
days 2012 which is why we ask back
