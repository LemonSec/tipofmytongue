1
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:13,400
alright good morning all the brave souls

2
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,400
here there's one lesson

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,470
going out is making the first
appointment of the next day

4
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,840
so I got that one tactic checked out so

5
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,880
Ralph hi

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,519
I'm here and I don't have a fancy name
for a slide

7
00:00:32,519 --> 00:00:37,430
I i do security have been doing that for
a long time

8
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,780
if you ru interested in what I do just
go away

9
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:44,839
so I saved you I saved his life you can
thank me later

10
00:00:44,839 --> 00:00:49,489
or buy me a beer im what I've been doing
the past

11
00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:52,920
to would say for five years

12
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,080
on a very commercial bases red teaming

13
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,610
which really pisses me off because a lot
of people

14
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:03,059
are abusing that term tremendously

15
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:06,270
and so to I made a slider

16
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:12,490
K the and I'm here to present so for
civil just to set things straight

17
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:15,960
so we don't get confused and if this
this confuses you

18
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,860
again there's a there's another talk in
the strip club downstairs

19
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:25,259
probably more entertaining than this
what's already in

20
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:28,499
air it is not

21
00:01:28,499 --> 00:01:32,140
glorified patrician testing okay I'm
sorry

22
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,259
it's just not and Dustin

23
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:40,840
and if someone tried to sell your red
team and is trying to explain it in

24
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,299
pen testing ways and at the end of the
day you find yourself looking at

25
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:48,979
a school at very that looks like a pen
test

26
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:52,200
that's not ready a

27
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,310
what it is is a fall adversarial

28
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,450
simulation so whatever and actual
attacker would do

29
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,709
that is erecting and that

30
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:06,880
entails by default by the finish in

31
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,330
that there is no scope okay so that

32
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,800
automatically crosses out any kind of
pen testing which

33
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:20,030
is by definition limited by school and
that full scope

34
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,810
entails everything again its physical
and social its electronic

35
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,249
and if you if you've seen the kitchen
stock yesterday

36
00:02:27,249 --> 00:02:31,620
and you should happen if you haven't go
and see it and then come back we'll

37
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,680
just wait for you and we're talking
about

38
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,180
the mean three elements or domains

39
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,620
all of adversarial insulation

40
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:51,049
or got my slights here that's one

41
00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:58,500
that's what they talk about when they
say speaker prep right losing half my

42
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:04,320
spring is better

43
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:10,180
shit

44
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:18,030
still sucks

45
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:29,220
for with me

46
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:35,390
I just don't want you to lose

47
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:45,090
all of the fences like to meet for you

48
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,120
okay

49
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,440
back so with operating we talk about the
three main

50
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,800
domains which are electronic physical
and social

51
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,810
right and the red team is really the
convergence

52
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,520
of those domains again Christakis the
have focused on the

53
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,560
different areas of convergence where we
combine

54
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,280
elements from the physical world in the
social world social

55
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,849
and digital digital and physical and
reading is really

56
00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:20,810
that little piece that connects
everything together which simulates what

57
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:23,810
real attacker with you name

58
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:26,950
and again it's all about the actual
fighting all

59
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:30,840
again all steel purses some Chris top
100 causes

60
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,070
Wieber present that I am a.m.

61
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:37,600
really talk about how it is to feel

62
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,770
or to train for

63
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,870
what happens when you get punched in the
face and then you have to continue

64
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,630
fighting so that's that's why we do
retain

65
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:50,470
now quickly question arises

66
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:54,100
why to reading at all well

67
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:58,710
first of all it's not about compliance
alright if you just wanna be compliant

68
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:02,200
this unholy Realty assessment you don't
even need need to do contesting

69
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:07,159
and Duke were fired from a weird from
vulnerability assessment that someone

70
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,200
will find officer Anderson you'll be
confined

71
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:14,720
you're done that's fine am it is

72
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,010
not about trying to

73
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:23,440
bring the hackers to break if your shit
because again that's not how

74
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,970
an adversary would actually work okay

75
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:30,180
so that's not a that's not a driver K

76
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:34,090
and it's really is conover continuum

77
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:37,110
on the scale of a liberal discounting

78
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:41,050
and testing and then red teaming so it
builds up

79
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:45,790
on the company's maturity security
maturity

80
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:49,060
you that enables them to go from this
level

81
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:54,000
which they usually do for compliance and
slowly turn up the volume

82
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,660
as the progress is to get more mature in
their security practice

83
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:02,230
in their management in the risk
management all the way up to read

84
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:02,690
teaming

85
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:07,830
which is really what they need to handle
as

86
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:12,280
as a company and again it's not about
the compliance if you just wanna be

87
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,010
compliant

88
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:17,000
fun find a big company they'll stamp of
your

89
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,760
paperwork and and you're fine in other

90
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,730
reason to do proper redeeming is to
really kinda

91
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:28,220
break out in the matrix okay a

92
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:34,080
and get I love that state of mind that
securities about it.

93
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,040
because it's not solve the best red team

94
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,520
engagements that I've had a had
opportunity to run

95
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,270
weren't even run by the IT organization
they were run by

96
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:50,300
finance organization see a photo %um

97
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,440
the audit compliance as weird as it
sounds

98
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,720
because life what's in it for me from
work totally different perspective

99
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,000
sometimes even from the

100
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,450
operations organization and why it
matters is because

101
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:14,470
they understand that security is not and
IT problem 'it's just

102
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:18,740
part of it it apart that should be easy
to solve

103
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,810
department were spending way too much
time

104
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:27,750
and money trying to come up with
solutions to problems that we don't even

105
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,470
care about

106
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:31,760
because we're losing focus in terms of
what

107
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,850
a real attacker with you so imagined
orders security outside of it.

108
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:40,370
take the red pill divan and really
discover what's what's other

109
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:44,400
so the next next step in terms of

110
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,460
alright I get it okay I see why there's
a need for RED team

111
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:53,330
how the fuck do I do that because it
will just told me don't look for hackers

112
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:53,990
don't look

113
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:57,700
inside a mighty how do I find that

114
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,850
that T that will actually execute

115
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:04,000
the 13-part in in reading well

116
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,690
it's really about assembling a group

117
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:11,950
of people who are capable

118
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:15,210
of executing this adversarial simulation

119
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:19,690
and again you need to focus on
adversarial simulation part

120
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:23,620
more then the oh my god you're such a
coolly

121
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:29,020
scooper hacker be because if you're just
looking for hackers you're missing out

122
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:33,669
a part of that you know three

123
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:38,150
three-part pentagram and you're just not
going to be able to execute

124
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:41,580
the converts threat so what to look for

125
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,740
on on a red team composition

126
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:48,780
I usually like to again and then you
just focus

127
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,990
on the three elements so instead of just

128
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,230
testing someone or assessing someone's
ability to

129
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:59,060
deal with Windows networking contesting

130
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,250
or with electronic locks or

131
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:07,380
on a with with Cisco core router

132
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,510
hola Realty's you are looking for skill
sets that go across

133
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:16,670
those three domain through just take the
team and assess them on a scale

134
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:19,760
in the different elements coach Bob

135
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,950
is really good on the physical part
alright and can help break locks and

136
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:24,750
bypass

137
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:28,100
CCTV's in whatever but

138
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:33,560
is lacking on the social part you need
to complement that with someone else

139
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,730
with Joe was really good on social
engineering part I'm

140
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:41,820
okayish on the physical and really sucks
at electronic and

141
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,780
really build a team that the end result
the composition

142
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:49,810
contains all the elements that you're
looking for

143
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:53,690
for your specific adversarial simulation
in again

144
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:58,280
that the position will be different her
organization

145
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,560
in the key for that is really
understanding

146
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,209
what kinda attackers are

147
00:10:05,209 --> 00:10:09,470
after you so you need to go through that
basic threat modeling

148
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:14,540
a.m. exercise which we do by default at

149
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:19,209
any beginning of a red team at which you
are

150
00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:22,779
really analyzing what is this
organization doing right

151
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:29,019
how is the business wrong what matters
to this specific organization

152
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:32,749
bill the threat model around it and and
again I highly recommend you

153
00:10:32,749 --> 00:10:36,139
go on watch winds wins talk on on for
calling

154
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:40,019
couple more hours from now and based on
that

155
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:43,300
understand what your at the Surrey

156
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,929
is after what kinda love skill sets
today need

157
00:10:46,929 --> 00:10:50,699
then go back to that skills matrix and
say all right so

158
00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:53,829
this this is what my attacker would
would would look like based on the

159
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:54,589
threat model

160
00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:58,920
based on my business this is the kind of
team that I need to assemble

161
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,920
that will simulate that kind of those
kinda attacks

162
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,970
to you really do need to do your
homework properly

163
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:10,429
and again i'm talking a lot about risk

164
00:11:10,429 --> 00:11:13,699
you need to bill the for a small you
need to understand

165
00:11:13,699 --> 00:11:17,129
that risk is not compose just to follow

166
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:20,240
Realty's it is about the entire

167
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,519
bread of how do you manage risk years
you need to look at

168
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:28,649
at the for the event frequency you need
to look at lost magnitude

169
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:31,839
what does it matter right what if I pop
your your

170
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,049
Linux box oh my god you know you gotta
root

171
00:11:35,049 --> 00:11:39,429
who gives a fuck if it's not business
related if it costs me nothing to just

172
00:11:39,429 --> 00:11:39,720
go

173
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,999
there you go UVM fuck you pop that large
parts only one I'm

174
00:11:45,999 --> 00:11:49,309
I don't care about it because it's not
business critical it's not part of my

175
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:53,839
frugal business assets it doesn't even
computer into my

176
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,029
risk management go have fun

177
00:11:57,029 --> 00:12:01,139
you to spend forty hours on popping
along links box that that no one gives a

178
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:01,679
shit about

179
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,459
so it's really

180
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:10,119
about going for what matters and this is
what you end up after

181
00:12:10,119 --> 00:12:13,819
a proper threat model you end up with a
good understanding of what

182
00:12:13,819 --> 00:12:19,589
the core business assets are and this is
what you're gonna go for

183
00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:22,829
you don't care about that Linux box that
that you can popular right

184
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:27,420
you care about that Windows box
somewhere

185
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:31,569
but contains critical numbers that
contains the secret jus

186
00:12:31,569 --> 00:12:35,509
the organization runs on in that if
someone loses or delete or

187
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:39,230
cells were all out of jobs and probably
in jail

188
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:42,589
through you really need to focus on
going for

189
00:12:42,589 --> 00:12:46,660
we call it go for the jugular okay what
one here

190
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:50,730
that if I'm make that hit connect

191
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:55,040
will punch you down and your Don here

192
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,999
and again it's not about and I i
shamelessly stolen this from my

193
00:12:58,999 --> 00:13:03,420
for like probably going structure im who
talks about

194
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:07,970
martial arts you know a lot of people
going to learn like karate

195
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:11,009
judo on style stuff like that he goes oh
0

196
00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:15,059
again to you you go to dance class right
good for you

197
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:18,980
does that make you feel we punch in the
throat

198
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:22,819
okay and see what happens next with your
fancy news

199
00:13:22,819 --> 00:13:26,220
right so it's it's it's not about
practicing to look cool

200
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,869
right or practicing just for the sake of
practicing

201
00:13:29,869 --> 00:13:32,889
it's about dealing with actual shit

202
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:37,829
right someone's gotta pull a knife on
you how does your fancy

203
00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:41,619
product news work now someone pulls a
gun

204
00:13:41,619 --> 00:13:45,980
on someone else on the train are you
gonna do now

205
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:49,429
right taken away

206
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:52,689
make them bag

207
00:13:52,689 --> 00:13:55,779
and your head of great

208
00:13:55,779 --> 00:13:59,379
out that first contact it's about
finishing

209
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:04,510
what you started and getting over with

210
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:08,090
food on second rule the the first rule
going for the jugular

211
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:12,340
second rule give it all you've got this
is this is not again

212
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:16,650
were in past the point where we're
turning onto volume

213
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:21,370
slowly right were 11 all right we're
past that word 11

214
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:24,400
when shits gonna go down its

215
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,730
for real all right there's no gradual

216
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:31,100
right there's no testing and have poke
around to see

217
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:36,660
no are you awake are you awake no you
give it everything that you've got

218
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:41,330
all the and I'll one shop because that's
exactly how attackers gonna go

219
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:45,000
all right they're not gonna poke around
for for days and test reliability

220
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,200
this tissue test at home Realty they're
going to coordinate

221
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,570
everything and synchronize its so when
they do go

222
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:55,910
for the attack it is going to succeed

223
00:14:55,910 --> 00:15:01,410
and again importing people they are
smarter and more counting to me

224
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:05,390
and if if if there's a if the israelis
and the in the crowd will get this quote

225
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:08,900
im guided

226
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:13,300
this guy is being asked about how do you
how do you swim like a

227
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:17,110
hundred-meter sprint so his answer is

228
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:20,570
well you start as fast as you can and
then slowly

229
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:24,590
speed-up alright make sense

230
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,690
so let's let's we've covered the basic
rules

231
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:32,170
right go for the jugular and hit as hard
as you can

232
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:35,790
let's try to go back to this

233
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:41,950
this presentations title and paint by
numbers

234
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:45,290
so my focus here

235
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:49,090
is not about telling you the horror
stories of home I got that look at look

236
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:49,980
what I found

237
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,840
it's more about going back to those
basics

238
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,990
that's right mauling that risk
management that I talked about

239
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:00,000
initially in really see how

240
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,270
a red teaming gauge mint affect the
company

241
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:08,250
and what the blue team does as part of
that engagement and after that

242
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:08,900
engagement

243
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:12,570
to relieve make this worthwhile not just
a fancy

244
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:15,129
exercise in

245
00:16:15,129 --> 00:16:17,230
look how cool I am so

246
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:20,819
first example there were were running an
engagement with

247
00:16:20,819 --> 00:16:24,100
a a big organization that went through a
lot of a min A's

248
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,999
the bottom companies they sold some
companies are a lot of personal changes

249
00:16:27,999 --> 00:16:32,879
and new executive management really key
in terms of

250
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:36,689
what do you look for next in terms of
more M&A so so the

251
00:16:36,689 --> 00:16:40,480
HR was a big part of that organization's

252
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,549
risk management alright who I mean if
the CEO now talks to

253
00:16:44,549 --> 00:16:48,529
some other company CEO is he looking to
acquire damn

254
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:52,509
is that a competitor is he looking for a
way out because he's done with this

255
00:16:52,509 --> 00:16:53,299
company that's

256
00:16:53,299 --> 00:16:58,119
so those communications are are a key
part of what that

257
00:16:58,119 --> 00:17:02,799
that organization is worth so we start
building air

258
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:06,059
bowling profiles for

259
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:09,789
keep the key people in that organization
here

260
00:17:09,789 --> 00:17:13,089
in the profiles range from

261
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:17,069
kidnapping profiles for you know the CEO
to kind of see what they're doing

262
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:22,699
all the way down to identifying patterns
in communication in movement

263
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:27,220
in physical locations in flights of key
executives

264
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:31,010
to really track in and you know going
back to

265
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:34,679
meta-data right what happens if that
person

266
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:38,960
and that person are in in the same place
for two hours in a restaurant and then

267
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,419
to go back to their offices he probably
had a business meeting

268
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:46,020
right what happens if this ok we're a
Coors

269
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:51,649
week after week after week in a pattern
that didn't exist before

270
00:17:51,649 --> 00:17:55,850
maybe do something interesting bring up
here

271
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:59,789
so we went for everything for four a
home address location

272
00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:03,070
location history for a wife two kids the
whole thing

273
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:07,850
super interesting a and really profile
that kind of behavior

274
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:11,120
in other thing that that we noted was

275
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:17,169
salaries salaries can tell you a lot
about how an organization works

276
00:18:17,169 --> 00:18:21,309
and if you try to pattern that over time
and figure out that oh my god

277
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:24,600
there the really dropping their salary

278
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,940
because they're hiring a lot of new
people their fresh outta college star

279
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:29,790
super cheap

280
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:34,430
right and they're getting rid of the
old-timers we know a lot of

281
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:39,020
a lot of stuff and you can see that the
retention rate starts to

282
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:42,850
to fall down there's a problem there

283
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:46,260
right maybe I can abuse death so that
kind of information

284
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:50,110
any at this this could be just part of
the the intelligence gathering of the

285
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:52,350
rat unity I haven't exploded in one yet

286
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:56,920
alright but just this part in the report

287
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,490
when I look at it from a red team versus
put in perspective

288
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:03,560
im I've identified social social

289
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:07,430
weaknesses in the organization right
have created

290
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:11,910
keepers all profiles from American
perspective really stimulated

291
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:15,120
how an adversary intell

292
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,540
a would gather intelligence on that
organization from approved in

293
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,300
perspective again it's not just about

294
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:24,010
oh my god what did you just do did you
really create a hijacking profile for my

295
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:24,590
CEO

296
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:28,800
now its about identifying common public
information

297
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,940
getting control of what am i lying
leaking

298
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:37,260
or what is my default posture as an
organization as a business and what the

299
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,580
information you can get on me without
even

300
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:43,480
you know lifting a finger I haven't even
touched you a

301
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,550
is about training your key personnel

302
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:51,310
for safety for awareness and going back
to the CEO with

303
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:54,630
with the profile that contains his kids
his wife

304
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:59,550
where he went really patterns behavior
over time were you going

305
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:04,360
it's not just about freaking them out
it's about making them understand that

306
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,160
they are a key element of the user

307
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,890
of their organization and someone will
do that and what are you going to do

308
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:11,500
about it

309
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:15,120
do you need executive protection post
you no longer

310
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,430
you know in in the minor leagues you're
playing with the big leagues

311
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:22,110
and you might need executive protection
here

312
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:25,720
and it's really working with HR on
social issues again identifying that

313
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,910
salary range

314
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:30,700
starting to too wide and up for

315
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,940
for specific position that means that

316
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,530
you for reading a problem inside the
realization

317
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:39,670
right some people are going paleo people
ought to people who worked there for

318
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:40,670
like 15 years

319
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:43,850
but you're getting rid of them bringing
interns that

320
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:47,830
don't cost much you creating some social
issues

321
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:51,520
inside so we get from looking
perspective this is the key

322
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,590
about taking away the main

323
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:58,240
elements of that intell gathering
implying them

324
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:04,490
inside organization Mexico sample that
was one

325
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:08,710
that one was was really hard to crack a
we we dealt with organization that

326
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:12,600
really had a shit together I know it's
not common it's not sexist

327
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,460
say you know it was that I had a hard
time running a red team

328
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:20,530
a and I really could come up with with
anything interesting on

329
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:24,050
have the the usual stuff but then we
went

330
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:27,560
for supply chain people 'It was really
tight

331
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:31,080
mean they knew their shit everything was
configured spic and span

332
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:36,140
encryption and not and coding you know
all the all the fancy stuff

333
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,730
here but then went for supply chain

334
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:44,620
and figured a problem in terms of how
they manage their

335
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:48,870
supply chain a in we found an issue with

336
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:52,130
shipping access points to remote
locations

337
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:55,420
alright everything's pre-configured from
the main office

338
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:59,170
everything gets shipped you but
somewhere along the way we manage to

339
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:00,230
intercept the chip mint

340
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:05,280
and take all that access point or plates
a walk into a conference room in

341
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,150
just rip one from the wall in the stuff
that we found

342
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:12,620
that we could do on an access point

343
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:16,110
was just just unbelievable and and again
thank your room but I don't know if

344
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:18,180
you've dealt with these guys but again

345
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:22,710
the products are are awesome but
sometimes there for the forget

346
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:26,700
some basics stuff so we managed to get
access to

347
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,900
to access point with the from route and
found

348
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,090
thats there's a a there's a

349
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:39,060
option to back up configuration you pull
that backup backup

350
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,850
out extract

351
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:45,230
a the files and you have the i ke

352
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:48,460
a i ke shared

353
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,560
password you get the VPN configuration

354
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:55,990
so we can VPN into that organization

355
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:59,360
just by breaking their supply chain
management

356
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,560
and all that just by physically
compromising an access point

357
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,890
extracting all the key information

358
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:10,190
right super easy so again

359
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:14,130
takeaway here swatching compromise its
not about

360
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:17,350
it. K 'It was solid

361
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:21,810
the blue team does not it doesn't mean
that looking just goes like alright I'm

362
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:22,230
done

363
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:25,920
my work here is awesome call me when you
have an issue

364
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,360
no it's about going beyond that an
understanding that

365
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,070
you need to monitor other stuff okay

366
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:37,240
and if I am able to VP and back into
your organization

367
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:42,130
you should be able to say no that's not
supposed to happen

368
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:47,480
should be able to detect that because

369
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:51,090
I'm sitting inside your your corporate

370
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:54,670
network a.m. should look for role-based

371
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:58,450
access control instead of just
location-based

372
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:02,040
and really focus again

373
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:06,200
on breaking down at part I'm of
everything's configure perfectly

374
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,130
right I had everything they'll down from
a technical perspective

375
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:13,830
but somewhere along the way there
something else there's another element

376
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:14,520
again

377
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,000
physical comes into play what happens if
I lose an AP

378
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,170
what happens if my supply chain gets
compromised next example

379
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:28,610
the Salmons probably go coming over
there in the back

380
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:32,130
im this withering agent with eighty

381
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:38,200
media organization guys are making news
in

382
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,390
go on TV and stuff like that

383
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:45,920
and sorry we manage based on

384
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,530
information that's just publicly leaking
out you know a

385
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:54,190
anchors tweeting photos on the of
themselves before they go on the air

386
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:57,590
in the photo you start seeing equipment
in the back

387
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:02,980
and IP addresses in hardware and
software information

388
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:06,470
a.m. that enabled us

389
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:13,080
to focus on specific element getting
into news organizations not really a big

390
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:13,740
problem

391
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:17,230
because by the finish in there looking
for information

392
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:21,200
to come in right is sending you know a
Trojan

393
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,620
PDF document to to our correspondent or
two

394
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:29,179
to a researcher on news team is really
triple-digit

395
00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:32,600
gotta go quickly could doesn't open
click here

396
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:37,309
right if the story is good enough the
open anything that you want the keys

397
00:25:37,309 --> 00:25:38,610
really going for

398
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:41,650
critical assets inside in identifying
those

399
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:45,010
in going for this again DNF this

400
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:49,059
this actually controls a room you can
see that

401
00:25:49,059 --> 00:25:52,920
it there's like a cameras and lighting

402
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:57,920
this controls the Sep the studio right
and this is life

403
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,830
on live TV im we could go all the way

404
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:05,210
up to a point were here we can control
sound

405
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:09,110
in PA inside the studio me one of my

406
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:13,170
one of my erecting guys sending me
emails like in

407
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:16,530
I'm going home I'm gonna have my own
reality show right now because I have

408
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:18,630
control over cameras thanks to you

409
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:22,290
and their life if he was freaking out

410
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:26,059
like I don't know what I'm doing but if
I got to rethink

411
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:29,300
should go to am

412
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,809
again and that equipment is the stuff
that the use in production

413
00:26:32,809 --> 00:26:36,170
okay in the wee wee went for it

414
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:40,670
is my understanding what goes where
connecting the dots

415
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:44,090
love into gathering in focusing on the
actual

416
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:47,540
assets inside in not just compromise all
I got

417
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:50,940
you know I got the producers laptop good
for you

418
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,259
we're going to do that

419
00:26:53,259 --> 00:26:56,989
what does matter right a.m.

420
00:26:56,989 --> 00:27:00,049
so again the key from from

421
00:27:00,049 --> 00:27:04,409
the wrecking perspective here was
understanding that our new assets

422
00:27:04,409 --> 00:27:07,529
that their organization didn't even
think about because again we're dealing

423
00:27:07,529 --> 00:27:08,679
with it.

424
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:12,549
initially there a and therefore they're
all focused about the network about like

425
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:14,549
the Windows network and the shares in

426
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:18,559
the rest for Kia got it there's a lot of
important stuff there

427
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:22,080
but we took a step back and we like but
you're in

428
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,789
news organization alright your the media
what happens if you're

429
00:27:26,789 --> 00:27:30,169
media doesn't me anymore

430
00:27:30,169 --> 00:27:33,419
right what happens if I turn the cameras
around

431
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:37,070
if I turn the light on or off or just
cook their anchor

432
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:41,259
I mean you can turn those lights up it's
going to be like the faceless somewhere

433
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:46,469
trust your finger air it's about
leveraging technical issues

434
00:27:46,469 --> 00:27:50,899
to affect the physical environment week
later on we simulated

435
00:27:50,899 --> 00:27:53,950
an event when they were there off the
air

436
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:56,960
to show them how we can affect the
physical environment

437
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,479
up the studio so we managed to bring a
guy

438
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:04,409
into the studio I was not supposed to be
there in a fact

439
00:28:04,409 --> 00:28:07,549
using lighting and the cameras which are
all

440
00:28:07,549 --> 00:28:11,359
robotic that physical environment like
move shit around

441
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:15,659
and he was pretending to be a technician
of some sort like the others a problem

442
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:18,299
with the studios lighting and just
subtly

443
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:21,719
lights just went up like poop %uh you're
right you're right

444
00:28:21,719 --> 00:28:25,979
rights just connecting those pieces and
the enabling you to go further

445
00:28:25,979 --> 00:28:31,669
in that environment im a and again it
it's about combining those different

446
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:34,710
elements into one engagement from a

447
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:37,940
dude in perspective it was very simply

448
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:41,589
expanding that breadth of control
because

449
00:28:41,589 --> 00:28:45,039
that specific relation organization had
a problem I T

450
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:49,349
the security in there was just focused
on

451
00:28:49,349 --> 00:28:52,499
I T alright they weren't looking at the
big picture

452
00:28:52,499 --> 00:28:54,110
and the CIO

453
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:58,690
seal c4 doesn't matter been really
understand that security extends beyond

454
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:01,910
pat your Windows box and have passwords

455
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:07,840
that by the way that's their minimum
requirement have passwords air

456
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,980
so it's going beyond that it's it's
really recruiting stakeholders

457
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,780
in the organization to understand all I
got you could have taken us

458
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:18,520
of flying of the air now there are
listening

459
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:22,130
now it was not just at some

460
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:25,580
some stupid technical issue that that
you know

461
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:31,220
the weirdos from security team handle it
again it goes back to training and

462
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,010
educating

463
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:35,410
the business units to the the people
inside their

464
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:40,580
to understand what's what's the real
fact next example

465
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:44,220
we were getting

466
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:47,510
to some some hard to access critical
assets

467
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:50,640
alright again in our organization here

468
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,010
had some really interesting sure inside
fairly secured

469
00:29:55,010 --> 00:30:00,960
and and we couldn't find

470
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,760
a standard way to just accident steal it
and deleted them whatever

471
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:08,440
usually do in writing and in again

472
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,820
we started thinking outside the box we
start thinking so how

473
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:16,470
to the managed at what kinda axis other
day and

474
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:19,870
you know trying to open a show or trying
to open a

475
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:23,690
im efficiency consul into that asset

476
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:27,300
do they use lo and behold we found

477
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:34,470
thanks to deal and basically anyone else
I'm not to picking on they'll hear

478
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:36,480
the of out-of-band

479
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,790
management for those

480
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:43,910
those piece of equipment a in in this
example

481
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:48,660
again we're we're going for some some
hard to get databases and everything was

482
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,450
locked down

483
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:53,919
in we started thinking organizationally
word is that the the live

484
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:58,030
right what's the process where does it
move

485
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:01,110
after it gets created or modified in

486
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:06,179
we went for the backups for some reason
the backups were not

487
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:09,500
as well-protected and again think
they'll

488
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,710
we managed to get full access to the
robotic

489
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:17,010
backup tape Angeles

490
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:21,130
I want to restore that to somewhere else

491
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:26,160
okay so while everyone is focusing on
the big database here

492
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:31,200
and securing a then you can access and
role-based access control and triggers

493
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,059
olin's like it

494
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:36,100
booby trapped in whatever we just went
for the backup

495
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:40,020
like I get the whole picture have
backups for

496
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,960
you know past three years what's the
what's going on so I'd

497
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,270
I'm not even triggering anything on
their fancy

498
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:51,309
fancy detection systems were the
database lives

499
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:55,809
I'm just going for a backup and its
leisure you know its stately take time

500
00:31:55,809 --> 00:31:59,650
but I got the same data right and they
forgot

501
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:05,290
quote-unquote to look other threat model
at the risk management and

502
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:09,900
and say this is my ass it but guess what
this is my ass a to its been copied

503
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:10,210
their

504
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:15,610
all over over over again air maybe I
should look at

505
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:19,900
back up to and again just you know Paul
that stuff out

506
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:24,020
we could even change the firmware on
this one which is

507
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:27,930
this is God kinda you know

508
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:31,920
you know those this criminals that liver
hard

509
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,040
to discover signature changing the

510
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,510
for weren't leaving and I'll active logo
on everything

511
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:43,090
get our hands on so this this was pretty
bad

512
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:47,120
from again going past the Google Korea

513
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,420
am from reading perspective getting
access to

514
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:55,170
assets out of their element alright stop
looking

515
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:58,640
at the big booby trapped database

516
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,420
start thinking about that the rates of
were

517
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:07,460
else does it live in really focus on
securing that and not securing the

518
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,460
technical

519
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:13,300
easy to handle element look for the
business process

520
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:17,450
air it's about really avoiding you know

521
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:20,820
the big Fort Knox of everything is is

522
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:24,800
you know cameras and Rowbottom sharks
with lasers

523
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,050
in Luke

524
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:31,360
well we're off to have that information
because I can you know I could

525
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,300
really use a break not handling with
that you know

526
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:39,430
James Mosher from put in perspective
super easy

527
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:42,460
Luke were

528
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:46,770
the data is stop looking for a technical
element stop looking for technical

529
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:47,550
solutions

530
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:51,070
take a step back understand the process

531
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:54,750
of wordy lives in your organization

532
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:58,050
focus on process stop focusing on the
easy to solve problems

533
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:04,250
a really poorly those different alert
because that Dell machine was spitting

534
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,770
out lot like crazy

535
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:09,380
I mean we were all over it we left
footprints

536
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:14,490
everywhere okay a but if you start
correlating that an understanding that

537
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:17,370
those stupid logs that you've been
ignoring for years

538
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:20,860
actually poorly to critical data

539
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:25,040
that you really protecting very very
well on that and

540
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:33,270
maybe you should do something about it
think this is the last example

541
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:37,540
so bear with me in this case were going
for

542
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:42,080
it stuff that wasn't even in production
yet okay

543
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,090
a.m. so again win for

544
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:50,879
Ford organization trying to figure out
how they work premature get most other

545
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:51,970
issues that you'll

546
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:55,750
you'll run into as a redeemer are

547
00:34:55,750 --> 00:35:00,260
usual again usually in a fairly good
state of mind security

548
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:03,350
a security wise

549
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:07,260
because they're mature enough to
understand that they can go for RED team

550
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,619
largest fall assessment and fantastic a
so in this

551
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:14,240
in this example we weren't going for the
production

552
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,720
we understood how the process works

553
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,080
of getting stuff from testing

554
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,820
to qualifications to pre-production to
production

555
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:30,040
im and found issues with how they manage
the security of that process

556
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:33,619
so at this point this this is again this
is ass

557
00:35:33,619 --> 00:35:37,190
having rude axis

558
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:41,119
to SonicWALL firewall that was about to
get deployed

559
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:44,460
in production and at this point

560
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:48,609
we're creating we r able to manage

561
00:35:48,609 --> 00:35:51,970
if you can't so on top of the VPN that
they do have

562
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:56,609
I can create another one for me right if
this

563
00:35:56,609 --> 00:35:59,700
past testing and no one really

564
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:03,130
focuses once once they set it up
normally looks

565
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:08,050
at the consecration again to say oh
we're about to get production

566
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:11,960
let's check again no they're like it
works in testing

567
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:17,160
let's copy that and move into production
so that was pretty awesome cause we were

568
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,010
able to kinda

569
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:21,840
route or or back door that firewall

570
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:25,869
before it went to production sit down
wait for a week a month

571
00:36:25,869 --> 00:36:28,980
you know three-month whatever it takes

572
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:33,850
and guess what when he goes to
production I got the BN

573
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:40,140
straight into your production
environment writes a less work for me

574
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:43,690
which is always good and more axis

575
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:48,600
so game over Redeemer's

576
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:52,920
I just said that alright it it's really
focusing about

577
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:56,620
accessing non-production it's looking
for the process

578
00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:00,620
how do you manage your stuff right and
this could apply to anything this could

579
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:01,310
apply to

580
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:06,620
2 r.d how do you develop your code and
you'll see a lot of abominations on that

581
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,220
route

582
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:10,850
I mean if you're dealing with with the
high turnover

583
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:14,010
in terms of versions that go from

584
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:17,070
they have to testing to production and
the

585
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:20,470
the process is not really nailed down
you'll see a lot of

586
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:23,550
wanna Realty's just spewing out
production

587
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:28,480
if you can nail down a process down and
that there's something there

588
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,700
or change something in testing that just
passed a thing is about to go to

589
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,280
production

590
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:36,160
and there's just gonna party it up and
moviegoer

591
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,690
your golden from Blue Dream perspective
again

592
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:44,110
it's about the process okay your
production environment can be super

593
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:44,690
tight

594
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:47,700
im but if the road

595
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:51,150
to that production is scattered with
vulnerabilities

596
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:55,000
someone's going to take the advantage of
that and this is where you should focus

597
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,670
your

598
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:59,460
your efforts again it's thinking about

599
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:03,790
the assets thinking about how did they
get there

600
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:07,130
right it database in production

601
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:10,480
have to get there somehow alright
someone

602
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:15,190
has a different version in testing is it
sanitized is a different data

603
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:19,800
are you pushing the back and forth it's
about thinking about the process

604
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:24,290
and again in expanding the the bread of
the security organization and the reach

605
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:24,890
of it

606
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:28,770
to other areas word actually matters

607
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:31,890
right and spending that

608
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:41,340
money word with make an impact years
yeah let's get that this is

609
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:44,990
less of an issue so

610
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:48,200
from from a blue team work perspective

611
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:53,180
the key to to running regimen gauge
which is not

612
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:56,190
right will wield wait here

613
00:38:56,190 --> 00:39:01,890
and you attackers will punch me in the
face I'm gonna die and cry

614
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:07,210
and and try to learn from it no the real
process

615
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:13,610
is being part of that redeeming gauge
great not in the way that'll

616
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:18,210
so tell me what you gonna do next know
it's about

617
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:21,990
understanding that the processes and not
about looking for

618
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:26,040
a specific vulnerability in exploiting
that the process entails

619
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,480
lot of different elements they're gonna
come from different

620
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:34,710
areas of social physical an electronic
really being aware

621
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:38,290
what's happening right now one of the
great examples

622
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:41,760
that I had working with the blue team

623
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:48,260
a in erecting a giant is

624
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:53,640
when the blue t really have their shit
together and could identify

625
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:58,990
spearfishing attempts working with their
employees

626
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:02,010
so employee awareness was that I

627
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:05,030
that I think like five or six emails in

628
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:09,110
out of 10 within minutes

629
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:12,410
the security team was not of notified
that

630
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:16,580
something fishy is going on the the
managed to trace back

631
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:20,170
this email

632
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:24,050
and again this this was crafted by of
this was very very specific

633
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:27,250
to the region of the office that we're
walking

634
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:30,720
working with is to the events that that
happen

635
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:35,250
you know the the preceding couple weeks
so everything's just kneel down

636
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:39,030
in were like we get like two clicks and
that's it

637
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:40,270
date either

638
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:43,650
in stole the the thing it's we're

639
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:46,810
im so the putting was really on top of
this

640
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:50,420
and and again understanding and really
implemented this wasn't there

641
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:54,260
this was not your first rodeo right this
is like this second or third reading

642
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,190
that will render

643
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:59,920
in and at that point it wasn't about

644
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,070
the blue team lick looking for shit it
was about

645
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:08,320
having that awareness program really a
better

646
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,660
into them please and people raising

647
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:16,480
flags by themselves right not knowing
that this is an exercise

648
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:21,320
and everything working together and the
back and get within minutes

649
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,990
they had everything nail down they
started a

650
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:28,470
star into a response and forensics and
trace this back

651
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:31,570
im they got that they the traceback

652
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:35,100
the actual exploit that we're using

653
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:39,670
allies did Star reported that it was it
was beautiful just to watch

654
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:42,980
we on in some we would then focused on
something else

655
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:46,600
because we had to you know we're getting
paid so air

656
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:50,290
but that that was just I mean it almost
made me cry I was it

657
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:53,460
I can get emotional im

658
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:56,790
again quick response minimize damage

659
00:41:56,790 --> 00:42:00,240
the work by the book right the

660
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,760
gain control over that that whatever

661
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,960
we hosted that fishing in really applied
it back to the learning

662
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:12,500
process beautiful and this is really the
key here

663
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:17,320
again it's the process is fun you gonna
have a lot of shells

664
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,400
on a lotta shit that it didn't even know
that existed

665
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,280
all right you can fuck with people
you're gonna break into stuff

666
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,340
take self is in the data center whatever
days

667
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:30,630
but at the end of the day it's really
calming bath

668
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:35,770
in seeing how you are affecting that
organization as a whole

669
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:39,640
not just patcher shit

670
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,660
right a few words I got like five or six
minutes

671
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:45,800
so this is my trigger warning a.m.

672
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:49,130
this is this gonna get a little business
ish

673
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:53,330
because you know at the end of the day
someone's playing for tissue

674
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:56,450
and they're paying good money to get
something out of it

675
00:42:56,450 --> 00:43:00,990
so you need to understand that you are
there to provide

676
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:04,500
return on that big investment

677
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:10,670
okay and that organization went past
again third following 11

678
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:14,370
the when past contesting bullshit
they're really looking for

679
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:18,740
a change in terms of their posture and

680
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:22,420
really seeing the investment

681
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:27,190
reading bath the

682
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:30,870
returns in terms of how how well the
blue team is doing

683
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:34,700
from my maturity perspective right and
identify

684
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:38,210
seeing how it effects the three main
elements

685
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:42,760
of of risk and how I managed risk which
is people processes

686
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:46,300
and technology breaking

687
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:50,220
out of focusing the security

688
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:53,840
budget on the technology and really
seeing how it effects everything

689
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:58,940
as a business that makes an impact that
can be measured

690
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:01,940
again go back to business call or
whatever it is

691
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:05,710
learn how to express those

692
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:10,640
takeaways in terms that you can

693
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,350
you can monitor them over time that's
where you gonna be

694
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:18,870
successful not in here's another shell
is an otterbox I popped

695
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:23,660
years you know here's your broken lock
it doesn't work anything

696
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:26,980
it's really going back to the business
and saying all right

697
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:30,420
here's how you guys are doing better

698
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:34,090
in having the CFL sit next to you and
pull out the fancy

699
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:38,000
you know grass and slides you know with
the lines in the bar charts

700
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,050
in really backing you up in terms of how
well are we doing

701
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:46,440
that's where you go and have you take
away

702
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:49,690
air you're gonna have to do this again

703
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:53,480
but again this is not a pen test right
there's no

704
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:56,920
retest button right there's no option 2
I'll

705
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:01,430
you I I got this overrule teen nailed
down can you re test at

706
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:04,550
well no

707
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:08,320
retesting is about going back

708
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:12,250
to the threat model understanding how
things change now

709
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:16,380
okay because something change your
organization

710
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,700
they fixed something right I need to
understand

711
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:24,070
how an attacker would now look at that
and try to attack it

712
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:27,510
right because it's no longer the same
the same element there's no

713
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:30,790
click to retest button im

714
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:33,800
it's really retesting the core

715
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:37,090
issue and Han it's going for that acid

716
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:42,500
and if that path is now blocked an
attacker would look at another path

717
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:45,610
so that's the retest K remember that

718
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:49,960
and again at the end of the the end they

719
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:53,710
your there to deliver successfully
alright

720
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:56,990
you're not don't sell bullshit don't try
to

721
00:45:56,990 --> 00:46:00,480
you know fancy it up man out

722
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,730
you know bro parables learn how to do
the business

723
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:07,380
speak was these are the people that
you're going to deal with

724
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:10,940
right not the security peaks don't sell

725
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:14,130
right the cells gonna comin

726
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:17,970
by itself learn how to express what
you're doing

727
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:22,610
in a coherent manner as crazy this as it
sounds

728
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:25,770
and I'll just happen Beitzel

729
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:31,730
questions

730
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:33,609
Commons beer

731
00:46:33,609 --> 00:46:38,410
okay

732
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:41,069
right thank you very much use reports
