sort of the point

9
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,550
hash days and every 41 or

10
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:58,040
nonprofit community projects it's very
important that

11
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:02,059
you like it it's not so important that
we like it it's not as important that

12
00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:04,949
the sponsors like it well it's pretty
important the spots like but still

13
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:08,540
so we're happy that you had a good time

14
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,229
I just think that the people that didn't
like it probably left so

15
00:01:12,229 --> 00:01:17,289
other missus mood to go the Raffles

16
00:01:17,289 --> 00:01:20,759

people who have to you

17
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,190
get on the train to get to the airport
to get somewhere else

18
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:27,250
we get the box with all the feedback
forms

19
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:31,720
if you haven't had it yet too late we
can still accept your feedback

20
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,369
afterwards

21
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:35,880
because we obviously like to get it it's
just that you

22
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,950
won't get any of the price can y'all

23
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:42,920

revelations

96
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,880

that solve the duty custom loathsome is
actually offered the

99
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:21,070
other possible that we did a drink all

100
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:25,170
I up with you of view actually went
online and tried it

101
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,140
I

102
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,220
at least some people actually saw fit so

103
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,890
some people gone for it just watching
quickly through it

104
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:36,360
because I don't wanna waste everyone
else's time go to the videos

105
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,110
to recap if it's too fast for strong you
have the

106
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:45,030
wild swings text from top if you notice
to capital and lower cases

107
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:48,090
you get something like binary reputation
of something

108
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:51,480
but actually just uses AV offer 01

109
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,150
for like two and its bacon cipher look
it up

110
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:59,670
Wikipedia bases of 5 rebel group the 5
together

111
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:03,090
he's one letter if she did for ski world
which is

112
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:07,710
many phones so that's it for the first
one moving to the second one

113
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:11,370
alexi think I get the clicker for that's
easier

114
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:14,770
well that was an image anatoly

115
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:18,320
you don't need a laptop to do any fancy

116
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,530
ships the frantic final attack on that
one

117
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:24,990
I want to do that first but well for
dozing you

118
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:29,170
are been there for a while it's just
magic I said just the everyday

119
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:32,310
a even work since most more prone

120
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:35,570
and you should see something like this
in 3d

121
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:39,420
so it's one of those so a lobbyist

122
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:43,960
the second world some people tried
really nice stuff

123
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:49,160
freaking with the frequency getting some
of the callers and maybe that was kinda

124
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,160
seem in a green Colts

125
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,790
which could be Amex Plat something so I
like the way if

126
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:58,000
thinking but yes we went for the easy
one sorry

127
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,380
third one pretty obvious

128
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,960
Morse code the start of with that
results you

129
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,790
or gives you a bunch of numbers between
1&5

130
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,540
I

131
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:13,450
up sixteen want to make it too obvious
but if you I

132
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:16,650
think about it limit its 8 app called so
a

133
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:19,940
I fully deciphered which makes you need
to get

134
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:25,040
a metrics 125 125 and just two
coordinates for each letter

135
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,280
so yes 35 is a p which

136
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:34,120
if you translate it again Lee CT third
word which is

137
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,320
now young from the

138
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,630
Alabi now for those few studying math
I'll

139
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:45,900
let's go quickly to the Force One which
actually quite a few people solve

140
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,050
so looks like your regex kills are still

141
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:52,840
looking good just fill it and hence
there should be a

142
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,230
mirror GE asked loss in Fort Worth

143
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:59,440
so thanks to those who played

144
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:14,640
and the winner is bien Rica the way the
first one to soften correctly so

145
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,970
wild on this often yesterday so

146
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:20,320
before the party maybe

147
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,250
thats the challenge and then gladly when
should a party right

148
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:30,680
what the hell is up with that it

149
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,750
I mean really it's a question all of
while

150
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:38,550
a record six I don't know I mean reader
friendly manner right

151
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:42,360
at it was one of the coffee machines
upstairs arms that this morning when I

152
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,110
try to you

153
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,470
well get them ready so you get your
coffee a

154
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:49,800
or that pop coffee if you don't like the
clock Marty

155
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,730
we saw a few does it help energy they're
really

156
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:57,900
honer machines I mean it would be
awesome but then at least tell us how

157
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,510
you did it

158
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:02,220
we want to know about it as well right I
but turns out

159
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,260
it's actually did one so it's a just
malfunctioning
