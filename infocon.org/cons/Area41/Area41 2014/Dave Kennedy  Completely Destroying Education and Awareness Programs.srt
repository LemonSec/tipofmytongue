sexiest

24
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:22,250
Iron Man Alive apparently as it does not
photoshopped that is 100 percent

25
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:27,390
what was on TV now the funny part about
this is that saddam

26
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,280
when when I was on TV as another in the
United States come to Katie Couric show

27
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,909
and a out on session funny mediating
shown

28
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:38,130
a little later I got time but I IBC got
done

29
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,820
packing into arm someone in the audience
is computer an able to webcam and I was

30
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,270
looking at her daughter and stuff like
that and and also stuff

31
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:48,229
and there is an actor coming up next in
if you know the show Sherlock

32
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:51,590
others again income up assets like the
actor and so said

33
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:55,590
up next won the World sexism in lebanon
then remove the up next in Tennessee

34
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,409
defeated right there and then it just
left that with my picture up there

35
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:01,890
so I'm keeping it i like it like to
think I'm gonna

36
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,990
my title sexy

37
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:08,610
and most importantly letting our friends
and meeting new people so

38
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,450
you know is always great that talk and
hangout folks here in last night we had

39
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:12,780
a great time in Switzerland

40
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,170
I'm so it's always great to get to see
friends and hang out and party

41
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,459
out don't get to do a lot more always
traveling a lot so today

42
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:24,410
you know that this talk you know I look
at education awareness programs a lot of

43
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,730
companies and and I think education when
it's been a really big focus for

44
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,990
a number organizations because it's
really important

45
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,820
see a lot of attacks happening through
fishing or social engineering or

46
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,380
whatever you

47
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:37,190
you want to call it and you know the
techniques that we use in industry

48
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,060
aren't the same

49
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,520
what we see in a while and what's
interesting is our education awareness

50
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,700
programs are based off how we test

51
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,140
as and testers are as researchers or
whatever

52
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:51,290
and so for me personally we have to
shift the dynamics of how we do things

53
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:55,130
on in pen testing and social engineering
everything else to emulate what we see

54
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,560
out there in the wild what's going to be
coming up later on

55
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,990
and you know I've been doing a lot of
the stuff you know I

56
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:04,910
it was funny when when I first got into
you on the security issue at work for on

57
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:08,430
the record in intelligence i'd and I got
out and social engineering wasn't really

58
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,820
a big thing you know known as we doing
as far as a

59
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,490
partner Pentastar know companies were
focusing on education awareness was a

60
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,840
huge threat around teaching uses around
security

61
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,660
we really change a lot which is a great
thing we really have to focus on making

62
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,040
it the right type of

63
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,680
research right up education because
without that gonna get on for a long

64
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,300
time

65
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,480
and there's no way to stop everything is
no question about that we can deftly do

66
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,910
things that at least attacked

67
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:34,610
certain things must like you do on the
network side and so today I'm gonna be

68
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:38,180
you know so you can we do for education
awareness what we're talking to cation

69
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:38,830
awareness

70
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:42,440
on what we do is paint astor's kinda
blowing all out on the water

71
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:46,340
and on the show you some some cool are
techniques the new version above the

72
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,340
social engineers architects just
released our version 6.0 to

73
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:52,950
I yesterday was funny I'm you this was
given a talk on

74
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:57,350
on how to protect against jobs anybody
in any see that one few people great

75
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:01,160
so in the middle this presentation one
of his defensive mechanisms was to you

76
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:01,740
on

77
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:06,200
arm remove the header are the user agent
string PC user it's your job to deny it

78
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,120
so I rewrote the Java applet another
user 83 now the emulator explore so the

79
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,620
job happen now calls out via Internet
Explorer

80
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,030
and now you you know got around to data
released a new version 6.0.2 yesterday

81
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:21,130
don't turn it awkwardly with typical so
fun times

82
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:25,460
so you know we have today now starting
off I'm gonna water or talk are we were

83
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:25,910
taught

84
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:29,230
when water really works and there was
gonna mess and stop of America thrown a

85
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:32,380
lot a misconception that we use like for
example in my favor wants to do

86
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,730
on is innocent exploitation you look at

87
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:39,900
you know I guess the latest and greatest
sexy exploit and it's very difficult to

88
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,350
fire off an exploit on organization

89
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:45,760
like for example on a compromise with a
knife easier day I need to do a lot of

90
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,770
research in Homer

91
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:49,810
beforehand to make sure I understand
what version they have to they have

92
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:50,330
things like

93
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:53,860
and installed or whatever protection
mechanisms them place and

94
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,880
most organizations is already had the
same exact version of IE across your

95
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,900
entire organization

96
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:02,070
no right so you're limited on on your
attack surface and we're actually gonna

97
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,880
go after

98
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,640
and so for me personally I don't ever
really reliable exploits anymore to

99
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,830
compromise an organization

100
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,920
II use methods that there are legitimate

101
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,580
that I know if they have certain things
install on I can take advantage of that

102
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,430
without actually triggered something
like is your day or an exploit

103
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,900
and be honest with you you know in the
real-world scenarios the chances of you

104
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,730
getting burned by is your day a very
small

105
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:25,940
your most people want to burn is your
day and you because what you have

106
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:29,460
so we'll talk about different techniques
that you can use it if the a lot of the

107
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,960
stuff that's out there were gonna we're
gonna get around things like application

108
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,090
whitelisting were you in a row next
generation firewalls gonna get around

109
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:38,710
arm hope to see an america that's the
kind of joking and suffering on

110
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,870
will get around anything they can
possibly imagine I'll get on and it will

111
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:42,830
get around everything

112
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:46,350
nominees in this topic bacall and
additionally my favorite one

113
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:49,370
they were taught which is the harbor
right so we're all taught that you know

114
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,820
if you get a email you can watch
Survivor hover over a link to make sure

115
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:52,910
that it's legit

116
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:56,490
you hover over a link it's good right
over to defeat the hopper today to

117
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:00,370
so gonna get around 100 on and actually
no compromise people with a legitimate

118
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,030
link that

119
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:05,230
looks legitimate but as we go into my
bedside so look at today's

120
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:08,230
fishing we sent hundreds of emails or
whatever

121
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:11,480
sometimes got misspellings really
sensitive because we don't wanna

122
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,650
to arm no impact emotions inside a
people's organizations

123
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:19,210
and we train people on on who click
stuff that you click something may go to

124
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,580
like a a website says hey

125
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,090
you publish an eclectic here's a nice
video on on things that you should look

126
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,800
for is an indicator right that's kinda
far

127
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,780
education once today in what's
interesting about this concept here is

128
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:34,400
you this is pretty much universal across
the board were gross what country and

129
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,830
wherever missus can a white

130
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:39,380
are de facto you know education
witnesses if we go with things like

131
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:43,960
you know I'm companies that provide
services fishing and you know education

132
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,520
awareness is pretty much what you get

133
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,850
and what's interesting you know when we
do arm so sincere Spearfish is for

134
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,390
organizations special the first time

135
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:55,030
I warned I glisten our fish is gonna
piss people off

136
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,570
people are going to be really hurt and
upset and they're gonna be yelling and

137
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:58,160
screaming

138
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,550
we need to understand this is for the
right purpose an STD this one you go

139
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,470
through all the shit

140
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:05,690
after that make it a lot easier if you
do it over and over and over again to

141
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:06,310
let your

142
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:09,150
key people know like BP's and stuff like
that because of those the ones that

143
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,810
usually throw a big because if it
especially like in person in each arm

144
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:12,760
stuff like that

145
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,820
on but really you know it's it's for the
better

146
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:19,290
now this is today right real-world

147
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:23,770
if I'm gonna go after company I'm going
to target a few people like two or three

148
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:24,560
max

149
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,120
so I'm gonna do fish I'm going in a
senate like two or three people that I i

150
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,100
kno have high confidence level that you

155
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,460
press releases

156
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,610
an inner city had a point to contact
person that was there

157

communications for me D and things like

they just released the a big player
post-a_b_c_ said

160
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:57,210
you know hey we were celebrating 100
years arm as being an american-based

161
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,000

you know billions of dollars in revenue

163
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:01,900
about this

164
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,940
so I took all the information I was in a
press release on the times gonna build a

165
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,000
fish office right

166
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,270
as the first thing I did as hiii
register domain name that was like from

167
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:09,560
Mike

168

no news media dock on or something I got
a sensor Newman like here's why let you

169
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:13,790

170
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:16,650
are you know we're going to do a story
on this and I think you know you know if

171
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,170
you guys are really awesome it's a good

172
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:21,530
testament to have a us-based company you
know all this other stuff

173
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:25,310
and so assessor email and she
immediately respond back to me know what

174
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,430
is that when he not tell me

175
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:31,270
don't think technically not technical
was 11 email from a person inside a

176
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,080
company tommy

177
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,430
whose address is that person I the
persons info but most importantly the

178
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:38,729
template other e-mail right

179
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:42,350
to 90 that their know the name their
title the colors at the use the phone

180
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,700
number schemes everything right just
that reason alone

181
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,780
is everything that I need to start
building something sent from their adult

182
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,390
a fish

183
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:52,490
that basically set up the press release
that was in their format exact form and

184
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,200
PDF attached that you have an expert on
now

185
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,470
no need to

186
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,649
the by doing that you can do whatever
you want you so

187
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:03,240
you basically have the right to do
anything at that point because it looks

188
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:03,800
legitimate

189
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,600
send any of the three people that was it
three it was a stupid fisher's like it

190
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,210
they want to do you like increase person
wants their worry about are making

191
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:10,810
people man

192
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:15,540
so Zr was a celebration of the hundred
years of being in this organization a

193
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,260
hundred years above a testament to our
employees and everything else

194
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:21,260
so were the first 100 people get

195
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,660
a free iPhone near the leasing greatest
at the time as the 4s right

196
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,100
and so when the colony when they got to
see me I listen to the three people

197
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:32,130
head like 300 people responsible people
forget to each other inside the bank

198
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:35,600
are inside the company to get it to come
back to make the sweet

199
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,670
so I like shells raining coming back in
everything actually people are like

200
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:42,940
in a row after a while they decide the
block in everything and and and we

201
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:46,070
remove their shells of to our systems we
still had access to infrastructure

202
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:49,779
the best part was like the ladies like
lady emails us at the email address to

203
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:50,839
send the United healing

204
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:54,490
hey our IT people blocked it assesses
security threat how can I get around

205
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,130
this

206
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:59,110
and I might although not as good as new
Secretary all you guys are so helpful

207
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,649
thank you so much we got hurt you

208
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:04,910
an arm was the worst ones about this was
I I got an email from a lady as they

209
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:08,820
I just love this company she's like my
daughter is so sick right now we can't

210
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,900
afford to get an iPhone in it this is
gonna make your life you know because

211
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,550
she's you know

212
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:16,860
cancer and also something like oh my god
I como worst person ever and swirls I

213
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,170
want bought an iPhone anyway

214
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:22,029
like the only person I've on iphone 4
arm but you know he's got a yetta

215
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:26,089
gonna test things out and just simple
stuff he can do as long as believable

216
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:29,230
but again only targeting a couple people
right

217
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:33,040
only in customizing it for that
organization when you look at a company

218
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,320
they bleed information the cutest girl
in 10 and it tells you everything about

219
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,180
a company like

220
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,410
hey we just implement our site or hey we
just implemented as you know the

221
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:44,579
specific PC technology are we had this
happen at a virus we do this we do this

222
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:45,010
to me

223
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:47,870
they give you everything about
organization because we all love

224
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:48,940
bragging about ourselves

225
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,720
link in my favorite I can have my entire
print how much your your

226
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,230
your modernization program it or who use
your MSSP

227
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:59,329
all that stuff is things that I need to
know before actually attack you we

228
00:10:59,329 --> 00:11:00,480
profile on you do it

229
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,200
as we need to focus on on in an real
fish were also some examples

230
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,720
to look at today's training we go
through

231
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,990
I

232
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:13,750
to typically only online CBT training on
its boring a cell like I was a chief

233
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,550
security officer for ER fortune 1000
company United States

234
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:20,960
and you know i close to the CBD so Mike
Next Next Next Next Next Next Next Next

235
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,710
Next finish no internet security there's
no way I'm going to the action that

236
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:24,380
stuff

237
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:28,910
is terrible maybe a one-day training
session if you're lucky

238
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:32,470
on like you have a guy in person session
they do training around I maybe he's a

239
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,130
third party

240
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:36,750
issue whatever but that's kind of what
we do for training arm

241
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,610
for our users you know when it comes to
online tree type stuff real-world

242
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:41,180
training

243
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:45,960
know if you look at some education
awareness you actually if thats haz

244
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:50,130
your users usually go out and say listen
we're going to attempt to go after nine

245
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,500
until mantle after

246
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,380
and you go after them you tryin train
all year long you to make it fun to

247
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,750
on like I do a lot of things with
training I wasn't at

248
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,340
and evil where we actually like Apple
people come and speak

249
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:05,770
we have make giveaways raffles we
related people

250
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:09,470
my favorite ones was you know like how
to protect yourself a facebook how to

251
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,510
protect your home wireless

252
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:14,510
protector kids when people can relate to
that at their home they start to do it

253
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:18,490
on the corporate side and let's not the
secular cells nobody inside an

254
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,320
organization

255
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,760
non-security cares about the company's
data the song care

256
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,470
occurs hours one fish that we did on
which are gonna sales guy

257
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:30,160
and the sales guy was like I'm like a
man can you going down as far as a

258
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,240
cashier easy I'm getting a virus warning
my daughter's right click on fire since

259
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,250
topping exit

260
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:38,520
is it okay cool here something exits me
runs and I get access to make a key to

261
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,340
the company's key just haven't seen the

262
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:43,610
type you can fit a candidate on issues
of warning rain is want to sale

263
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:47,320
they don't care about what you're
actually doing on and so it made him

264
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,020
realize that

265
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:53,110
are much clearer today is like a quick
drops were still doing USB drives

266
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:57,540
really that like the most ridiculous
things like 1984 shit

267
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,690
like I mean are abused his route then
but something like that right

268
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:04,020
run into but I mean autorad already
disabled anyway

269
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:09,080
I in most cases most organizations and
this is even still work understand you

270
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,800
speed drops

271
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,680
personally when I love doing is when you
actually go after company

272
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,040
use the mail system because the mail
system you can be anybody want you can

273
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,240
be an executive in that company to be
whomever

274
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,360
he read a nice a letterhead with your
company name on whoever your purse

275
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,500
meaning having do like step by step how
much to do they will do whatever you

276
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,250
want to because you can be anybody
watching hand-written letter or

277
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,750
you know letter had already sent to them
in the mail to send something the mail

278
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,740
knobs on the getting is just a turn at
the show's waiting though do everything

279
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,350
for you like

280
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:38,180
hey you need to go on update this and
you gotta go dollars fell double

281
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,079

282
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:43,610
Hicks after okay good on you know you do
whatever you want in a leader's one-time

283
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:47,390
armory modified a keyboard I with the
TENS unit okay

284
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:51,230
and sucking on it in this arena basis
tiny and we we open at the back to this

285
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:51,820
keyboard

286
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:55,339
and I'll be soldered to tens device onto
it in line on

287
00:13:55,339 --> 00:13:58,560
arts never too so we can you know
capture keystrokes all that what's been

288
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:58,980
done

289
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:02,370
but was awesome is when they were he
would be sent a letter head from a

290
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:05,079
company thing as part of a refresh
program this is now your new keyboard

291
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:08,339
plug it in news and everything else and
so we did is we

292
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:12,010
we did for the control to the sequence
and we captured using a password okay

293
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:15,269
and then you wait like until our there
was no key sequences type on the

294
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:15,800
keyboard

295
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:20,390
for about eight hours what does that
mean gone or something right

296
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:24,050
and meetings are gone home we detected
that it would who Jigga Jigga mouse

297
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,610
because you keep working late in the
head

298
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:29,420
and I'm so little mouse over scream come
on you take control

299
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,550
leader log with using a passer in and
drop a appealing to the system

300
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,399
government machine

301
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:36,880
do you really want to he will do
anything you want in the mail

302
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,459
awesome might drive USB device anyway so
still picking up USB devices and

303
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:42,680
plugging men and double-click any

304
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:47,260
seized up problems 1990s problems on

305
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,959
as the in person sees my my favorite
right so a season person

306
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,510
and person in delivery people in person
employees piggybacking I mean we we

307
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,850
started a so sophisticated look for
James Bond

308
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:00,940
Lake you know you know busting into
buildings evading security systems when

309
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,430
I need to do is just wanted to fund or
an act like you own the place and do

310
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:04,160
whatever you wanted

311
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,240
right system the key concepts we do
today

312
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,430
real-world make it easy simple you know
don't do anything crazy

313
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:14,560
on really you really need to using the
proxy MARTA bus in the buildings

314
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,270
this is an example I was doing a on a
physical for AR

315
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:22,430
a store store location for big retailer
chain United States

316
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:26,160
and literally Sosa Mike bogeys our
trophies to get for the organization was

317
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,360
to steal on one other point of sale
systems you know so they have a point

318
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,840
you love the points are returned in the
point of sale system in everything

319
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,840
and so the like a hypodermic on all of
it out

320
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,940
in so when I first started I certainly
sophisticated like I

321
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:41,270
I spoke by phone number coming from you
know this corporate headquarters and I

322
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,840
called and I said hey I have two
technicians coming in

323
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,230
miss you brother hard everything we we
meet you know I'm sure that look like

324
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:49,000
we're from the corporate headquarters in
everything

325
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,110
really sophisticated right did you do
any that so it gets

326
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:55,240
me seventeen store location with a Taser
this one works you know just fine

327
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,440
literally the second store I walked into
the store like

328
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,590
just dress like this walking to the
store I walked up to the register

329
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:04,680
at took the whole thing I walked on the
building now that

330
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,420
no one said anything on star me I just
don't have the cash in everything

331
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,150
there's like you know

332
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:12,910
two grand in cash in it I was supposed
to take about 30 cool

333

334
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:23,940
is this heavy duty I'm using is prolly

335
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:24,680
school

336
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:30,250
no problem don't have to do any crazy
sophisticated Sears or teacher users

337
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:30,610
right

338
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:36,250
I on the phone don't provide certain

easy stuff

352
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:18,540
not sophisticated now email

353
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:22,540
is my favourite users are taught the
harbors my favorite one of them all

354
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,820
because the harbor is like everything in
a secret organization I see Harbor

355
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:29,040
when you hover over a link it's got to
be a legit right you see that

356
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,520
that

357
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,790
however this league is going to gmail
dot com or whatever right it's legit

358
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:33,770
right you're good

359
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:37,030
that sort of trying need to be that

360
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:40,200
are you saying yes now you know before
stock in

361
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,970
but I mean your check domain name look
for suspicious activity center /center

362
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:45,460
center

363
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:51,190
so on the talk about arm set version
6.0.2 number to play a little game

364
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:56,270
okay and and this game is going to be
something more ominous show you two

365
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,190
scenarios

366
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:00,830
attack in your income how to defend
against so with the with the new version

367
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,250
ascetic senator listen

368
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:05,750
you know the lot of cool stuff and said
I can cover all

369
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:09,420
but this really cool stuff though just
that insanity that really proud of on

370
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:13,010
but really you know set design be havin
use that to you perform any type of

371
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:16,770
a fishing the new on attack vectors and
they're really provide a

372
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:20,580
high level of success I mean it's really
to test the effects on your program

373
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:25,690
which is that we're talking about here
insists that's the Arco die I rode arm

374
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:28,790
during you talkin pushed out that I does
the new user agent string

375
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:35,520
and one in one thing I was on costs on
his licence s just at all

376
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,170
and how you actually look an
organization hierarchy profound revision

377
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:40,270
what you actually build

378
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:43,400
is what's gonna make it successful just
using the stuff are set

379
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,050
I don't recommend build your stuff and
do it the right way because without it

380
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:47,780
is just a tool

381
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:51,000
you're just using its all your tool
right

382
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,220
so you know the proper a sense read on
homework researcher target know your

383
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:55,790
target

384
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:59,100
on develop your tax and based on what
you're going after mean that's what I do

385
00:18:59,100 --> 00:18:59,580
you

386
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,940
that's what you have to do you have to
build a fantasy my whole goal was of

387
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,600
Engineering

388
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,220
is to make you believe something it's
completely bullshit right has no

389
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,280
relevance whatsoever is completely fake

390
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,150
but they have to believe it so we make
something a little bit writer good

391
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:25,460
just a demo

392
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:31,530
accuracy is OK screen good so this
attack was originally arm

393
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:36,120
are committed are by my name engines and
white Jeep who did this

394
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:40,400
on attack in Scala web checking attack
now the new version of set 6 entered

395
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,490
on 680 woman was released takes it to
conduct a whole new level it's friggin

396
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:45,200
amazing right

397
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,670
and I mess up the credit and white
cheaper for put this in there is is

398
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:49,330
really slick

399
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:53,150
as orders wanna go to the social
engineer on the tag when US number one

400
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,380
and wanna go to the website actors which
number two okay

401
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:00,630
now number two you're gonna slacks on
the web checking matter which number

402
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:06,940
five and i won a close eye on what's I
will do the trick on any website you

403
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:07,420
want to

404
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:12,530
okay so whether it's trust it's like
that calmer gmail or whatever company

405
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:13,330
you're targeting

406
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:16,410
you can clone anything you want to also
you can import your own

407
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:19,540
you make your own fake website or
whatever you can import that as well was

408
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,300
to say Connor

409
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:24,740
and then we're gonna do

410
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:31,790
II gonna are to my IP address in now
we're recommending this attack and we're

411
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,450
gonna see is just a really simple
example

412
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:36,460
wanna build this out I make it look
legitimate in every way

413
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:40,490
right and all registered to mean that's
very similar to it not swim in a

414
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,890
second-round defeat that

415
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:45,470
but we still want to make the user
interaction processes

416
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:50,420
as less suspicious as possible so no my
resume name for demonstration purposes

417
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,100
are not going to

418
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,830
and I was callin gmail now

419
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:58,910
resent to Gmail scott is a form yes
forms on it she could do whatever it has

420
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:03,160
a user and pass a problem times real
ones are like BP ends or exchange or

421
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:07,390
anything that's outward facing I like
benefits web pages for for customers

422
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:11,440
I was great to is like we send this
Michelle you can be like

423
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,840
telling them specific instructions like
me sure you hover over this link to make

424
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,510
sure is legit

425
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:19,520
make sure you do this initiation and by
the way make sure you're using a pass

426
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,090
for the log into your Windows machine
with

427
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:24,880
great its you give me instructions
everything you need to do

428
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,670
make it easy form because they're gonna
they're not gonna know so this is just a

429
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,130
a simple login field here

430
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:37,220
and sonic on the website

431
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,429
animals everything to you on the patchy

432
00:21:39,429 --> 00:21:43,640
so under hard every time I W now what I
would do at this point one cyclone it is

433
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,549
that the web so you can see here's the
second

434
00:21:45,549 --> 00:21:51,140
is really simple right so was critical
issue as good as real quick alright

435
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:57,570
that's not right

436
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:00,530
was messin means can become a cash
reporters caster

437
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:03,910
actually

438
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:13,640
and others stricken

439
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,200
I'm there

440
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,930
so not notice is a very basic site okay
when I would do is a very simple

441
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:24,250
is some of our make it look believable
onerous you perform

442
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:28,000
okay make it look like a legitimate say
make it look good in hearsay

443
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,160
make sure that you're going to a trusted
sec location making sure going to

444
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,390
dislocation when you hover over this
link

445
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:37,230
is we want to make sure that you don't
give fished read this could be a

446
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,290
phishing scheme or

447
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,700
the officials like these techniques
makes you hover over the link and miss

448
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,590
you validate what you're all you're
going to

449
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:46,810
I now again this is looking

450
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:49,990
look nice and pretty for whatever doing
I'm again benefits from years ago gray

451
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:52,800
wanna going after benefits website
things like that in the United States

452
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,600
on the common with the use or any to
affect sleep is important now look what

453
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,700
happened hover over this was assayed on
in the bottom left bc it's a little bit

454
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:04,110
big can you see that and we see that

455
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:07,360
its HTTPS call on 44 slash

456
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,000
accounts doc Google dot com is that the
jet

457
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,840
you're ready before I start talking
think that's a jet

458
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,190
yeah so again accounts dots

459
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:22,600
Google dot com right so it's legit right
so we click on this we should go to

460
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,990
accounts I go back on right

461
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:27,590
don't want to click on this link I want
you to watch what happens live within

462
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,300
the euro bar

463
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:32,860
is it going to be another tab opened
interaction gonna be at account at

464
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,530
google.com

465
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:36,920
iight your machine is actually in a
contact the council gonna come server

466
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:41,070
them into a quick switcheroo I without
any user interaction ready

467
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:47,940
so click it no magic unaccountable a
complex issue

468
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:55,410
to my username enter your password in

469
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:59,540
I'm redirected back to legitimate site
and over here

470
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:04,820
we got these and password game tell
Kenya

471
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:08,580
free messed up I was a lil dirty

472
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:15,110
about about that actually sister being
harbored

473
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:19,090
the next you're gonna see is the job app
attack in this guide the flagship attack

474
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,190
vector and Sat now

475
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:23,800
resides on the job app attack is because
it doesn't take advantage

476
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:29,290
I love any to exploit it doesn't use any
specific exploit in Java anything else

477
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:32,950
to take advantage of the great thing
about Apple its once the run

478
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:35,840
is the run unrestricted there's no
Sandboxie at the break out a there's

479
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,450
nothing you actually attacks were you
little in running a full access my

480
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:38,970
computer

481
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:42,910
now the new version is set actually has
predictive analysis

482
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:46,720
to see what the best method expectation
is so if you're running Windows 7 or

483
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,710
Windows just above

484
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:52,330
it does probability ratio say this in
the best run to attack based on what you

485
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:55,090
have installed as this method I'm gonna
use that as a matter for exportation

486
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:58,800
so it's mister of things that power
shower Excel back doors or

487
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,600
on using the Adobe scripture whatever
this multiplex petition at this address

488
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,110
procedures Windows XP is gonna try
Windows XP sp2 schmitz versus can

489
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:08,100
identify power shot in the arm on the
machine

490
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:12,080
and a partial injection my favorite
attack in all this is that our

491
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,090
again a meta Graber was a rough a
nominal partial guy came out the ability

492
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:16,980
to inject

493
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:20,620
arm of a commercial Cochrane to memory
so you have the ability through

494
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,940
PowerShell natively

495
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:25,910
to inject into r Memory completely
transparent without touching desk which

496
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:26,640
is really important

497
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,780
special for going after things like
application whitelisting or

498
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:33,840
is a memory now sISTAR it's great for
and what's great about this is I did a

499
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,140
talk at Def Con like

500
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:39,210
17 or something like that on partial
beta came out and when the first talks

501
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:42,500
impartially figure out how to get around
work on execution restriction policies

502
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,700
so they're letting us for different
excuse research and policy on all sin

503
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,480
sin

504
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,170
on remote in unrestricted or some other
chick unrestricted

505
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:55,490
and on even with the most restrictive on
execution research and policy can still

506
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:58,880
execute Power Shot machine and and
bypass execution restriction policies

507
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,340
so what happens in in the job app on
here on is it actually compromise is it

508
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,970
purely memory so there's no

509
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:08,950
touching the decision on our droppers
anything like that and they're also

510
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:12,590
on dozen Christian so it actually puts
an ASU his bubble in memory

511
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:17,350
around your show go so when it pops out
coming back in in a good performance

512
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:20,990
when I

513
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:21,770
so go to

514
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:25,380
number one wanna go to website expected
number two

515
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:30,170
and when he got a job applicant number
one and there were a cyclone number two

516
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:33,430
and ask everything at a port forwarding
man had no

517
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:37,650
to my IP address real quick and

518
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:41,490
I mean he's my own job at Apple which is
number two now

519
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:44,940
with Java 7 update 42 I believe

520
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:49,040
they remove the ability to use of signed
a jar Java happens

521
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,630
and the reason for that is because they
are inherently insecure has been a whole

522
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,680
progression economic seven years to do
this

523
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,670
are but what's great is that you can
literally do on register in this in the

524
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:59,320
US the cigarette's are as follows: a DVR
doing business as

525
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:03,330
which is like 30 bucks minutes go by
coaching search by the DB is a flake

526
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:07,160
verified publisher this this is a
legitimate up ap lit you know this is

527
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,110
secure please trusted you did you busy
as whatever you want to

528
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:13,810
and then used by coating certain is
legit so everybody in the wilds doing so

529
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:14,170
just

530
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:17,270
spent a couple box go get it goes
unanswered and then boom you have a

531
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,330
really believable

532
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:22,230
on fish their work on any platform
what's great about this I'm technique to

533
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:26,000
is again it does one expert but it gets
around too much every preventive measure

534
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,370
the nova gets run National Fire also
gets around

535
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:31,510
on application whitelisting its run
antivirus gets around

536
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:35,040
you know everything awesome possum and
challenging our technology the OP

537
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,450
rebels were deputy prevention general
but on

538
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:43,210
gets run almost awesome see a high
probability success so we had to use app

539
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:43,830
a number two

540
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:46,850
now when a clone distrust sacbee.com is
an example

541
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:50,540
to clone it

542
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:53,690
and here we have on payload options now

543
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:57,560
appeal options are kinda interesting
these were only trigger and fire

544
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:01,980
on if the other exportation methods feel
like power Shawn Jackson Excel injection

545
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:06,210
on eccentric centers or a fall back to
this is a very last mechanism

546
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:09,980
on if there's a buy on these are all ABC
can I get started yet or bombing and

547
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:10,580
picked up

548
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:13,880
my favorite to use like a multi-part
injectors number sixty

549
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:18,380
im occupy injector what you can do as we
know any compromise an organization

550
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:22,900
you don't know unless you already diary
con what poor co-opt rights egress

551
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,400
filtering

552
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,410
so modify jacks you can have a spray
multiple ports

553
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:30,960
you want to do if you don't be too loud
you can have a try 21 23 25

554
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,210
you know 80 443 and see which ones go
out you can also use Metasploit

555
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:39,010
is to be an easy PSP lot so that the
proxy where which is great so you can

556
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:41,289
use multi project is free on multiple
ports

557
00:28:41,289 --> 00:28:45,330
and and when you get a are at home in
addition use modify injector

558
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:49,600
it automatically configures the partial
injection same way so when you export a

559
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,539
miss and video machines can use the same
type of show code

560
00:28:52,539 --> 00:28:55,779
spree on multiple ports via power shawna
that works then it's not going to

561
00:28:55,779 --> 00:28:56,789
execute the miners

562
00:28:56,789 --> 00:29:00,179
on additionally with with with these

563
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:05,039
these these actual binaries a good drops
are nothing CNN com does nothing

564
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,799
inspected a guy ya 12v of firearms my
dad doesn't do anything

565
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:12,750
nothings to buy nor does nothing just
runs and exits however

566
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:16,169
you provide ates 256 the block

567
00:29:16,169 --> 00:29:19,799
with a dynamic cipher key which gets
generated every single time and Sat

568
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:23,929
know the Antichrist all of that shoko to
run the show good for you you get around

569
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:24,850
things like fire on

570
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:33,020
I get as low as that which is beautiful
so there were 15

571
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:36,600
and others use a on its over Baylor

572
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:41,130
this is an example and identically Pasha
show perot times does not actually

573
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:42,940
generating mess which open every time

574
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:46,360
so I have all the shock on this damn he
passed with your IP address and port

575
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:55,740
on it before is a faster and that's not
what minutes late

576
00:29:55,740 --> 00:30:00,980
and over here we're gonna go to our
website

577
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:04,990
notice it looks just like trust attack
in every way shape or form

578
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:09,380
right looks good an the Name field you
can make whatever you want

579
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:12,460
obviously I like ghosts on some in my
goats on

580
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:15,690
you can name the name feel whatever you
want to see it had to be the company

581
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:16,840
makes enter Sedra

582
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,090
the publishers what you don't have
control over so

583
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:23,150
that's where you would register doing
business as in the biosensor for

584
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:24,000
whatever targeting

585
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,990
so to get a doing business as any code
signing certificates but two days

586
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:31,670
alright because you have to register the
disaster today and

587
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:34,800
to get a verification call of that
you're doing but doing business as from

588
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,990
the phone numbers related to you

589
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:39,880
takes about a day as well again because
I think certain two days on in the

590
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,680
Polish community want to get that I own
like verified publisher

591
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:46,060
are trusted publisher this this Apple is
secure whatever you want in

592
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:58,310
doing business whatever the hell you
want to make a difference great in Iran

593
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:00,910
know what happens is it redirects you
back in the gym inside

594
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:04,530
so that the on victim doesn't know that
they're at a bushes in the first place

595
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:08,030
so now you're back in the genocide you
go back over here

596
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:14,250
unity have two shells now there is only
two shells as I i'm is a fallback option

597
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:14,850
and Sat

598
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:18,590
though they'll say listen still run the
peelers macias reliable exploitation

599
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:21,690
case something goes wrong so a lot and I
the pipe out two shots and $1

600
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:24,970
just make sure can sometimes get weird
issues with our communication transport

601
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:28,300
you see here we have a mature personals
so in essence the computer through that

602
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:32,330
and we can run exploit nice boy them

603
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:35,570
every re: stuff easy

604
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:39,040
you know issue of asset was set up

605
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,640
is this a couple minutes right long as
you did the rekon had time to find a way

606
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,640
russia targeting

607
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:48,010
and made a big enough pre-tax like tell
them about the applic to listen in order

608
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:50,980
to verify that your company owned asset
or computer you need to

609
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:55,290
run the Apple it that says you know
company name security check

610
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:58,920
call don't run build that stuff into
your pre-tax

611
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:06,100
they will do anything you want them to
you Moscow

612
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:09,150
area okay through play game

613
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:12,720
okay many requires audience interaction
I'm gonna give you a list the multiple

614
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,840
choice or talk about how to fix these
issues because our way stopping is that

615
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,470
attacks

616
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:19,960
so medium of choice ABC new you tell me
which one

617
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:23,210
it's going to be this could be the best
solution to pick multiple ones too okay

618
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:26,350
so for the job Apple attack specifically
as we just saw now

619
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:34,460
was that was the easiest way above
getting ready all the bar very good sir

620
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,250
very good

621
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:38,550
yes sir that is correct now for real
though

622
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:42,850
on

623
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:44,720
sorry had a good time last night I

624
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:51,380
a stock recovers energy efficient sir.

625
00:32:51,380 --> 00:33:01,780
are so ABC or D ABC or D

626
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:06,240
all the above very good yes so all the
above minus

627
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,270
right so a dislikes kitchen tap

628
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:14,620
they'll stop are most now our my most
now rescued from tap it also stops job

629
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,480
updates by the way

630
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,870
on the job requires a time trying to run
again most horrible thing ever

631
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:22,580
on BAE dis allies accuse in from all
user profiles

632
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:26,260
again are commonplace for execution from
our now in sets

633
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:30,380
that will stop the binary dropper piece
because it uses temp the temp directory

634
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:33,480
never see all you fuckers using it I'm
gonna change the directory so to be

635
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,450
something different next time

636
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:37,830
but in the right now no one's ever
stopping times or to be as great anyway

637
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:40,850
so right now if you buy time to stop by
not driving portion

638
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:44,690
now see disallow regular users execution
partial

639
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:48,770
on Ryan in a and Windows Group Policy
actually have application whitelisting

640
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:49,990
built in a Group Policy

641
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:54,350
Scott app Locker it's free an app Locker
we can do is you can say

642
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:58,040
I do not want regular users from running
power to run Powershot in disallowing

643
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:01,179
you do at all with the group also right
now which means that the PowerShell

644
00:34:01,179 --> 00:34:03,090
injection taking the just saw doesn't
work

645
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:06,700
really simple thing doesn't break into
any reviews every year a partial on the

646
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,100
user's

647
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:12,290
now so really quick we're doing it arm
10 jobber security possible

648
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:16,530
I one thing is arm you can actually
strip Apple Tachibana talk about that

649
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:20,639
yeah so most proxy support on work a
whitelist sites right

650
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,760
secundus allow Apple to mining from from

651
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,790
arm from actual HTML on pages

652
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:29,730
and that's why list I'm so things like
Cisco WebEx things in your wireless as

653
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:30,530
well as those

654
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:34,260
and a slow apples from everything else
you can actually rewrite rules to

655
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:37,580
sorry right Apple tax just replace was
something else in the Apple never

656
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:42,760
execute but you know what that nothing's
fool-proof I should ways a by passing

657
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,610
arm excuse restriction policies I'm
circumvent app Locker

658
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:48,490
on also run PowerShell code

659
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:52,610
on when ap lockers being restricted but
again as like more like a defense and up

660
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:54,639
stranger and multiple layers of security

661
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,250
which are the tribe's after getting to
be honest the on the box you want it'll

662
00:34:58,250 --> 00:34:59,020
stop set

663
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:03,240
which is great arm this is a quick point
apricot

664
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,640
I think it's not hard to see visible
Picasa I got around on tap water with

665
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,369
this is our wanna hear once called the
magic Unicorn Attack

666
00:35:10,369 --> 00:35:14,340
eyes itself free tools open source I get
home it was nice but this is where you

667
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,540
actually generates

668
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:19,310
on the power shostak usual stuff or he's
just a quick example to show you

669
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:26,610
so is very sexy

670
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:30,560
so I run your are you going to you I
uses of

671
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:35,420
uniform Union

672
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:43,050
there now area

673
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:48,839
I'm having some major I promptly man

674
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:52,640
okay ever happen for Iran unicorn

675
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,250
specify what people you want to you it
automatically generate the

676
00:35:56,250 --> 00:36:01,040
the shocker for you and then it'll pipe
your shell back on the sport in this

677
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,570
on this this IP in sport what's great
about this is literally gives you the

678
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:05,849
copy in patients whose

679
00:36:05,849 --> 00:36:10,109
the SEO are shell summer-like of a lot
I'm still using PS EXEC commands

680
00:36:10,109 --> 00:36:14,220
and I'll put this into here not
piece/pieces commandments pointed to it

681
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:17,320
and it runs power Sean all the systems
for you get your shot without touching

682
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:17,849
desk

683
00:36:17,849 --> 00:36:28,030
it's a little early for the strongest
man right here

684
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:32,010
my IP 343

685
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:35,150
an automatic into the shop on for me
it'll

686
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:39,070
export democrats RC five minutes before
you so I just wanna mess Boyd

687
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:42,270
mister Council Sr

688
00:36:42,270 --> 00:37:00,800
unicorn RC that alone at the same time a
copy paste Michelle career

689
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,750
so here we have a show code arm its its
encoded began around excuse research

690
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:05,410
policies

691
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:09,230
and you see here that's just a man right
there just a command the paste into

692
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:12,369
a command prompt or whatever you back CD
a remote code execution

693
00:37:12,369 --> 00:37:16,630
you just highlight this and their
leaders pasted in

694
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:20,930
sober person here this is an example

695
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:24,760
obviously in expectation scenario you
might have shell is based in the command

696
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,869
prompt an answer

697
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:29,030
as I suppose to happen

698
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:33,380
are some

699
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:36,640
some having is how it at all

700
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:41,849
America echoes

701
00:37:41,849 --> 00:37:45,030
and capital thing so they overhear

702
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:51,130
yourself again not touching this handing
out early member resident running on the

703
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:52,109
process PowerShell

704
00:37:52,109 --> 00:37:58,849
and you back to the computer was great
and other fun trick

705
00:37:58,849 --> 00:38:02,130
and I'll use another way are is

706
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:06,849
like a monitor and you would allow the
next generation firewalls what they do

707
00:38:06,849 --> 00:38:11,250
is nation firewalls are literally like
anti-virus for the network

708
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:14,740
that's that's it there they basically
right signatures at the dog behavior on

709
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:15,930
houses and stuff like that

710
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:19,400
but you make any changes or
modifications anything next generation

711
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,010
you're gonna get around it okay and so
what this is I want overkill on and

712
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:25,829
never have to use this because we're so
shitty any UN Security

713
00:38:25,829 --> 00:38:29,040
they don't ever have to worry about
doing all this crazy stuff are but in

714
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,359
the event that we someday good

715
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:33,630
all releases on and what it does is it
takes mature printer

716
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:36,690
shoots in the memory case is over and he
estimates bubble

717
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:41,290
tunnels it over SSH over st. Pius
innocence polymorphic so every single

718
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:44,310
get post responsiveness these can be
completely dynamic every single time

719
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:47,490
I'm so you gonna see it basically tunnel
wanna do

720
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:50,740
I'm runnin so it just waiting for first
initial

721
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:54,319
on HTTPS connection then gonna

722
00:38:54,319 --> 00:38:57,970
our check to see if there's a specific
unique code is generated and then from

723
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:58,680
there

724
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,890
its gonna dandy crib deaths each time
over local host and create app interface

725
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:02,680
for us

726
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,980
that we now have an answer for sale its
all ok on on the system itself

727
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:13,569
so worried here for the record the shell
I run this

728
00:39:13,569 --> 00:39:15,290
so it's gonna argue member injection

729
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:18,480
can inject into memory for your in a
capsule in SHRs

730
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,730
a sleepy opting for their own IP address
and RS is it running

731
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:34,609
attack face one second rerun again

732
00:39:34,609 --> 00:39:37,859
over here when triggers you see it
actually turn on here

733
00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:41,710
the second secret identified sending
chancellor for response

734
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:46,070
verify watching Metasploit right now add
credit app interface are over that is

735
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:54,109
assist on all over its BS and then we
should have a shell in your notice that

736
00:39:54,109 --> 00:39:55,580
the show's actually to be at

737
00:39:55,580 --> 00:40:07,320
127 001 because we're telling over local
host

738
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,290
as a shell 127 001

739
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:13,910
rent hot stuff

740
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:21,690
as proxy or two it's great

741
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:24,640
I'm so expanding on that your point
after the powers of deduction

742
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,650
a receipt is added in version 6.0 doubt
one

743
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:31,230
arm one the most common techniques that
was given to you are single servers

744
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:34,720
and physical servers most common
technique is to you on the bed

745
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,120
are talking tough guy like that Khan 14
or something on-base you taking

746
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,030
inexcusable

747
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:42,120
converting it to you have to dust pollen
and basically pushing through

748
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:46,100
are Microsoft's economy can bring about
a binary on instead we used to use the

749
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,450
magic unicorn tech now

750
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:50,520
are within Microsoft CEO Nick cash to
direct power Shawn Jackson through

751
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,600
makers are seeking to show

752
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:55,330
I'm so that's a new version 6.1 our city
find

753
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:59,020
single serve you can use partial
injection for it again shelter Microsoft

754
00:40:59,020 --> 00:40:59,440
sequel

755
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,660
so what checking the hard-won

756
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:08,380
are a three-city 30 what do you think
what are the

757
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:15,240
easiest way to stop it a BNC

758
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:19,890
so AB and C education awareness some
technological controls and sector

759
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:21,610
Uncategorized I'll talk more than a
second

760
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:26,110
I hear something to ponder what you
doing us on education awareness is key

761
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:29,500
me teaching people you know certain
things look for on this was really tough

762
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,520
because I look believable

763
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:35,350
two factor authentication as good I'm a
favor one artifact authentication is

764
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:36,100
when I

765
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:40,530
use an iPhone factor for infected my
favorite own your phone factor alone you

766
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:43,560
every single time period no question
about it and the reason for that is

767
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:46,160
because you literally implemented
two-factor authentication this trend as

768
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,100
we can possibly imagine because you put

769
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:52,880
the air back onto the human as long as a
question the use of actor before

770
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,680
try to not earning on there's a lot on
like this

771
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,930
will do is when you login with username
password that I just Fisher whatever it

772
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:01,200
has a prompt and says

773
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,230
I'm sending a verification tax or
calling your whatever to verify your

774
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:09,770
what is that use are gonna do every
single time I am

775
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:14,630
I'm probably login summer now yes I've
been on 8 individual pentasa form factor

776
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:18,590
I have not once had a unsuccessful
attack everybody's always said yes

777
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:19,570
that's me logging in

778
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:23,130
horrible so you put it back onto the
users emissions rake

779
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:24,850
are too good

780
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:28,630
on to a really good tobacco litigation
Uncategorized sites

781
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:33,040
on Uncategorized sites are official
letter Miami things like skin safe

782
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:37,070
arm Bluecoats on all them have
Uncategorized side

783
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:40,130
margins and those are were ninety
percent officials come from

784
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:44,460
people don't spend the time to actually
register the names and the Bluecoat or

785
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:47,840
arm you know skin safe as a
categorization sites be blocked those

786
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:51,010
usually stop by ninety percent officials
now funny story about this when the air

787
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:51,960
tommy was a

788
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:56,500
on you can actually clone one of the
major on what cattle terms on web sites

789
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,920
looking clone their own website

790
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,500
and it's a minute for proven actually
put you up as a content filtering

791
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,440
software company

792
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,340
it's ridiculous on

793
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:08,490
miss you should have access I am it's a
good 1i think about a kilometer

794
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:09,630
yesterday

795
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:12,480
artillery is one that's all that I wrote
has more on the defensive side any more

796
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,130
information

797
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:16,980
just gonna break down for not using it
really recommended

798
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:21,800
on I'm it can be easily bypassed it's
very very very easy to bypass and

799
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,490
I clearly the five controls you have in
place requires me to do a call on

800
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:26,280
senator return

801
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:29,780
at so I'm using robber made you a call
from religion to function

802
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:33,210
on API instead of doing a return

803
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:36,860
ones that this is an example though on

804
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:40,250
position but this your day is an easier
day I'm is it actually looks for the I'm

805
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:41,280
a daddy lol

806
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,170
of I'll never found it actually kill its
other one run so it's gonna need

807
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:47,750
so there are some good to get tougher
time any recommended but again it's

808
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:48,500
really trivial

809
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,630
offer for us to be able to read
something about it very trivial

810
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:56,240
so talk about fixing stuff we have to
stop the 1990s attacks

811
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,470
we have to focus on getting an education
that really works in it entertaining

812
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,250
people

813
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:03,570
are starting to believe in security now
is we're like the harpley stuff happen

814
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:06,620
right already seen on the news and other
stuff we're getting more by often we

815
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,970
ever have in history into a sec it's
phenomenal

816
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:12,040
we have to capitalize on that mission
people understand the ramifications

817
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:15,680
and some other ways to begin and armed
with the do things that relate to others

818
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,710
relate to people because a personalized

819
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:22,160
for me for me when I was in-charge about
the ski program into

820
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,270
knows a 30,000 employees shop on

821
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:28,760
the most important thing for me was
involved in management wasn't pen

822
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,330
testing

823
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:33,030
whose education awareness like if I can
mess any money period

824
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:35,530
in a in an organization wouldn't be on
Patch Manager

825
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:39,330
when being mean doing wrong as important
things would be focusing on education

826
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:40,710
awareness because it is to me

827
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:44,010
on the struggle pieces once I had in
Education honors program

828
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:48,030
to implement something Mac or something
else was trivial if you understood why I

829
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:51,190
was doing I wasn't that bad security guy
trying to ruin their lives with making

830
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:52,090
things more restrictive

831
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:55,160
years ago he remember them talking about
this the relation to protect us at

832
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:55,630
school

833
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:59,410
so it has multiple benefits aside from
just what we're talking about here

834
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:03,370
so if you look at building a program you
know according to Schneider

835
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:06,260
I and we disagree with them on this one
but he doesn't believe in Education

836
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:07,620
honors programs i think is effective

837
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:10,920
he said ass accused me through attrition
and through what you do as far as your

838
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:11,550
actions

839
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:14,950
I disagree on the first thing is you
know

840
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:19,590
creating a group on the Celtic Executive
Committee mean yet by often the top

841
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:21,150
levels American to build about

842
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:25,290
arm and then once you actually have a
program start building it out actually

843
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:29,860
do about on talk about securities known
right now cares about it I

844
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:32,810
when you build the program they'll calm
I mean I do a lot of fun stuff we did

845
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:34,160
talk ass in our company

846
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,890
I would equally newsletters out there
were videos we do like fun skits and

847
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:39,630
things like that the kinda keep
entertaining

848
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:43,320
arm be needed related information
employees like when target happen great

849
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:43,790
example

850
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:46,730
he is been a big target reach you could
be impacted you know should do this

851
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:48,000
issue this year this

852
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,030
looking after people big difference I

853
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:53,840
and then last you know step three is
really just testing the program actually

854
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:57,360
going in and seeing what you doing how
effective you are actually stopping

855
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,100
different types of attacks we need to
improve on

856
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:03,560
it's like any other program that you had
with the test arm and then lastly

857
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:06,760
you know deftly min team the promise of
mom

858
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:11,450
sorta kinda build out everything they
need to you to talk about this I'm gonna

859
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:12,600
skip to this part here

860
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:16,080
coming out I'm but are you nation
products to me are

861
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:19,300
are just a bunch of watch it doesn't
stop us as attackers and I

862
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:23,720
my funny arm thing about a national
finals let me ask a question

863
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:26,820
does anybody have enough money for
security SP program

864
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:31,680
me enough people the ski program unseen
hands okay

865
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,940
to this question we have only bring a
whole brand new PC technology in

866
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:40,610
you slap in what happens you introduce a
whole new set up one occurs if the whole

867
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:42,350
grains and complexity the fullerene

868
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:46,150
me it means a similar question you have
these guys have been ASA engineers for

869
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:46,890
ten years

870
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:49,290
right their phenomenal ASA

871
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:52,400
knobs on the panache in for one was
gonna happen there

872
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,300
the learn a whole new piece technology
seriously miss question is anybody doing

873
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:57,920
network segmentation environments

874
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:02,120
like make each are going to feature near
their specific things York apartment as

875
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,870
a shrine in the basics that women or

876
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:09,060
assets are at long why we in action
viral were well had are well below

877
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:11,510
we need to run out even be thinking
about this type of stuff we need to

878
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:12,970
focus on the basic things first

879
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:17,910
on some really cool stuff real quick arm
so election cool things

880
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:21,180
and I like it like like the build stuff
I'd on my big hard work I so

881
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:24,260
I was messing up horribly so i've a
funny story show arm

882
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:27,120
basically I've got a new Jeep you
cracker in this is my fourth generation

883
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:27,460
my

884
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:30,830
Jeep you cracker that a bill and saw got
a lot better since the first for

885
00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:35,480
are Rev and the the fourth one so here's
the second time to be built and

886
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:38,890
I was actually really horrible on and
it's funny cuz like this he think you're

887
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:40,070
the metal hook on it

888
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:43,380
and actually sliced my finger in a drip
blood all over the mother born

889
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:47,400
so I take that back and explain like
aids to schema blood on it I don't know

890
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,260
what happened

891
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:53,390
on BBC here though the way that it he
thinks earning us the bad design because

892
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:54,670
it blows their on

893
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:58,050
pretty bad ways we bring those cards up
pretty quick third attempt as this one

894
00:47:58,050 --> 00:48:02,080
on and so this reason the the video to
ninety axes

895
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:05,600
arms you know that was a the only good
one as early as it sounds

896
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:09,220
arm I wanna go big or go home right and
