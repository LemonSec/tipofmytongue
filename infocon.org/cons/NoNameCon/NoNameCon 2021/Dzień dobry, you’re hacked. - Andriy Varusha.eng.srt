1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,200
uh hello everyone uh i'm glad to be here

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,880
today on the at the no name con with you

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,040
uh unfortunately still online

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,120
so this year is

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,920
not possible to to be physically present

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,520
with the eu of course easier for the

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,920
logistics let's hope for for better in

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,439
the next year

9
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,519
as what mentioned i'll talk about the

10
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,920
polish not only incidents but also the

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,640
overall the cyber security threat

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,880
landscape this is all in the country

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,239
and

14
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:35,680
for you to understand why i will be

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,160
talking about poland on a ukrainian

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,200
event

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,879
uh a little bit different about myself

18
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,079
so basically the answer is

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,360
straightforward

20
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,879
because i'm a ukrainian who's been

21
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,520
living for the last six years in poland

22
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,680
and because i have connection to both

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,199
countries and both

24
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,640
business sectors

25
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,480
i try wherever it's possible to connect

26
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,000
the dots and

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,360
facilitate some knowledge sharing

28
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,879
between the countries

29
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,480
and since uh for the last three and a

30
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,120
half years as lord mentioned as well i'm

31
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,680
participating in this endeavor with psg

32
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,360
british security group

33
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,040
uh i think it's no wonder that i'm

34
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,040
with this mission of

35
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,360
knowledge sharing between the upside

36
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,680
communities of ukraine poland and

37
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,320
whoever is present here no wonder i'm

38
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,920
here with this talk

39
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,200
um

40
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,200
logically it would be probably to start

41
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,880
with some overview of poland from the

42
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,640
other side it's pretty difficult and

43
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,240
probably not thankful

44
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,640
uh attempt to do some summary of a

45
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,799
country in a couple of minutes

46
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:35,920
uh

47
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,079
even look for something much more

48
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,720
simpler right like human height we it's

49
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,000
known fact that human height is one

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,920
meter seventy but when you talk with

51
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,600
someone most probably not one meter

52
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,159
seventy there could be a actually the

53
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,840
reason why he or she would not agree

54
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,680
because phone experience

55
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,320
and only people i think the airlines

56
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,159
strongly disagree with these statistics

57
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,240
to my feeling the airlines strongly

58
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,439
believe that

59
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,680
average height is 150 actually looking

60
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,479
at the space they have in the aircrafts

61
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,799
but jokes apart i'll try to to give you

62
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,639
some uh

63
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,720
let's say considerations that my opinion

64
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,160
would help you to understand what will

65
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,319
be discussed later but they are strongly

66
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,879
my private opinion and uh

67
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,120
of course advice so for you to remember

68
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,720
this not to treat this as a golden

69
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,840
source of truth i have this jokey slide

70
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,440
while i will be talking

71
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,080
of polish city translations for like

72
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,400
literal translations of course

73
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,640
they are not perceived like that but if

74
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,959
you look at the words they are like that

75
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,760
so poland poland is a big country it's

76
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,000
like in the top 10 in europe by

77
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,480
population nearby territory it was even

78
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,800
bigger sometimes much bigger in history

79
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,680
but history was not too kind to poland

80
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,080
and during the last forest update which

81
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,800
was world war ii it shrinked it moved to

82
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,440
or shifted to the west population also

83
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,159
was mismatched and then deported

84
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,879
uh in some territories and eventually

85
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,239
poland

86
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,720
was occupied by the soviets but this

87
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,480
series of tragic events actually gave

88
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,239
some unique chance to the country

89
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,560
because afterwards it became a country

90
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,640
with single nation country with single

91
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,480
culture language

92
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,959
uh religion and so on and i think it

93
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,720
helped later when they ran away from

94
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,560
communists and joined eu one of the

95
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,040
first but so this similarity it actually

96
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,879
gives a um

97
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,239
birth or i would say

98
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,560
it causes some pattern behavior in the

99
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,400
society in my opinion and of course

100
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,480
patterns is good for for attackers right

101
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,480
because you know what to expect from the

102
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,879
people or predict their behavior

103
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,120
despite this unity there are still

104
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,120
things that please polls apart for

105
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,519
example the traditional views versus

106
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,920
liberal views the riot views on politics

107
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,480
versus centric use of politics and this

108
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,400
clash gives some hot topics still in

109
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,720
this society like um attitude to

110
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,280
abortion attitude to sexual minorities

111
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,680
attitude to church and and so on and of

112
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,920
course all those uh hot topics or weak

113
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,599
points are used by attackers or

114
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,720
fraudsters to either polarize this

115
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,360
society or to cause some emotions

116
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,120
whatever is needed for the successful

117
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,480
attack

118
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,280
okay then um i would say that

119
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,478
on average

120
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,279
uh polish people are rather you know

121
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,279
close or even suspicious to someone who

122
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,520
is not in the inner circle of their

123
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,120
trust actually you would say good for

124
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,360
security right zero trust in blood but

125
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,720
from the other side the curiosity

126
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,479
doesn't go away and if you can't get

127
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,639
open information you try to look through

128
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,479
the loophole right what's happening at

129
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,080
your neighbor so this gives some demand

130
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,960
for gossip a rumor type of news i would

131
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,919
say or even you know some media

132
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,440
content

133
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,360
uh people here are a little bit negative

134
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,759
thinking there's even the polish proverb

135
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,440
which says if you don't complain you

136
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,479
don't live

137
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,080
so if you want to gain someone's trust

138
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,840
probably you should find for something

139
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,479
similar or common to complain about and

140
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,400
you can kind of gain the trust quickly

141
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,520
in this way

142
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,199
also people are pretty pragmatic about

143
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,320
money so if you want to trigger the

144
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,600
attention and know to to to encourage

145
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,520
some actions you probably should appeal

146
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,120
to this efficiency

147
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,600
it will mostly work i even joke

148
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,199
sometimes that the most

149
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,759
popular social network in poland is oil

150
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,160
x so the place where people buy and sell

151
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,680
things

152
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,280
and uh on a serious note uh

153
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,960
despite huge investments from european

154
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,919
union

155
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,840
poland is still on the lower side in

156
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,840
terms of gdp per capita so it's kind of

157
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,759
low cost location for europe and

158
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,280
together with the great talent human

159
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,520
talent here it

160
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,080
made a good basis to become a a service

161
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,639
location so business processes are our

162
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,360
source here it is outsourced here shared

163
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,560
service

164
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,000
centers are created here so this always

165
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,400
actually a very much influence in the

166
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,479
economics in the first and then the

167
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,400
society as well at least in the cities

168
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,680
where those services are um aggregated

169
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,520
so service economy uh closed uh

170
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,319
mindset probably no wonder you would

171
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,080
expect that there should be interest in

172
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,319
uh securities right uh

173
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,039
overall and and yes indeed and on this

174
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,840
slide i'll uh actually i'm showing you

175
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,720
the

176
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,639
ecosystem i would say of the information

177
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,039
security or application even security

178
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,360
the three

179
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,240
icons on the left uh these are the media

180
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,720
sources for the applications or

181
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,880
information security and use

182
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,600
uh

183
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,600
actually they're pretty popular i have

184
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,919
to say i was even surprised to see the

185
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,759
number of subscribers maybe speaking

186
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,919
which is most popular it has more than

187
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,680
100

188
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,039
140 000 people currently as subscribers

189
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,800
the huge audience

190
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,840
of course the owasp is also a present

191
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,280
and active organization but it's more

192
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,720
like professional

193
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,479
uh

194
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:57,520
audience

195
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,520
i don't enumerate here at numerous

196
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,680
commercial firms so that

197
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,199
are acting in this uh um territory as

198
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,440
well as psg mine company but there is

199
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,919
the uh umbrella that unites them this uh

200
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,759
cyber clusters types ever made in poland

201
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,199
so for those who are curious you can

202
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,479
just

203
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:15,759
take it from there and restore it

204
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,160
yourself and put a couple of labels of

205
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,400
big events here that's not complete list

206
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,360
uh

207
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,440
um but they survived at least the

208
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,120
pandemics and actually the confidence

209
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,560
will be happening next week also in

210
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,800
online format so for those of you who

211
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,120
are curious you could join it and

212
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,680
listen to what people say talked about

213
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,280
in poland

214
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,759
in respect of security

215
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,360
okay that was professional community

216
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,240
what about the broader broader audience

217
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,720
uh of course as everywhere right now

218
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,599
some

219
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,440
episodes and films or series are

220
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,720
happening that are connected with

221
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,080
hacking or technology those here in the

222
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,840
whole speech on the confidence

223
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,440
conference about that

224
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,319
showing these bloopers where someone was

225
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,400
typing email in the microsoft payment or

226
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,639
someone was dumping the data from mobile

227
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,240
phone and then it turned out that this

228
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,879
actually end up so it doesn't dump data

229
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,280
and other other mistakes like that but

230
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,039
there is one thing one book i'm

231
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,039
mentioning because it's pretty realistic

232
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,400
i mean it's still fiction but it's

233
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,479
realistic in its descriptions and it

234
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,319
shows and gives good overview of

235
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,759
potential attack scenarios for this

236
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,639
society and this is the hidden weapon uh

237
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,599
krita

238
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,080
yakub shamalik of course the mississippi

239
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,400
that doesn't has doesn't have an english

240
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,319
version yet at least the last time we

241
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,320
checked and by the way as well as those

242
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,719
medias i mentioned they're in polish not

243
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,080
because people don't speak english but

244
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,919
because probably that's the kind of

245
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,839
local

246
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,159
identification so in case someone of you

247
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,919
will need more information and is in

248
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,880
polish

249
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,800
so it's a kind of blogger for you please

250
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,880
reach out to me i'll try to help but

251
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,040
anyway the book describes this attack

252
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,200
scenarios and they

253
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,480
globally we see it's happening the

254
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,080
attack on critical infrastructure the

255
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,720
political impact on elections the

256
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,760
personal

257
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,880
uh level crime using the

258
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,720
cryptocurrency and the darkness and so

259
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,680
on

260
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,600
interestingly enough the book doesn't

261
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,000
mention ransom as such but it describes

262
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,160
all these elements so i know it's on

263
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,920
purpose or it's just

264
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,519
uh was when the book was written it was

265
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,000
not so popular anyways let's see how

266
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,680
those scenarios which which are on your

267
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,360
screen how they

268
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,320
or if they actually happened in reality

269
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,600
during i i've taken the last past year

270
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,440
for for my research of the incident so

271
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,800
let's see what happened during the past

272
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,839
year and how it uh correlates to to this

273
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,160
fiction piece

274
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,279
um

275
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,120
so i've split the incidence to three

276
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,200
parts state level business level and

277
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,240
personal fraud or mass sector

278
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,000
and before we start i have to say that

279
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
i've used the public sources for for

280
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,720
this research so no insider information

281
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,200
and for this reason i doubt if this are

282
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,279
really the largest incidents maybe

283
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,920
larger state actually on public

284
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,839
uh but for sure it was like above this

285
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,760
incidence those that were people talked

286
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,399
about in media and between themselves

287
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,800
so let's get get started

288
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,839
first uh state state level

289
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,399
and i'll start with with the real attack

290
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,120
so

291
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,040
i'll start from the end right now it's

292
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,959
known that this is done by group this is

293
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,480
called ghostwriter

294
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,959
a group of hackers probably which for

295
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,560
sure are attributed to russian probably

296
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,399
won't have connections with the fancy

297
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,200
bear or sandwarm and the main goal of

298
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,880
them is actually manipulation or

299
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,839
disinformation the target territory this

300
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,160
is the close to russia countries like

301
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,079
poland and baltic states

302
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,240
and what they do they uh find their

303
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,320
victims uh in uh

304
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,160
people among people who are known like

305
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,079
politicians usually they take over the

306
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,760
accounts and then either do some

307
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,399
misinformation through their accounts or

308
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,399
do the manipulation by taking some data

309
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,640
from the accounts and publishing

310
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,240
and uh

311
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,279
in the end luckily the secret service of

312
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,560
poland

313
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,959
got hold of it and

314
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,120
they really started seriously after

315
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,279
actually a year and a half of happenings

316
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,760
and now uh they investigated there was

317
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,079
more were more than 4 000 people on the

318
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,360
list of victims in poland and

319
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,360
seemingly probably several hundreds of

320
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,320
them were hacked in media there were

321
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,600
a dozen or maybe up to 220 uh accounts

322
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,399
that leaked something or were hacked and

323
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,320
something was happening with them

324
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,079
and from technical perspective it was

325
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,959
not sophisticated usually it was due to

326
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,200
uh bad security settings of the accounts

327
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,440
of the mailbox mainly

328
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,800
uh the

329
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,120
manipulation was either small like just

330
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,040
undermining trust in some concepts for

331
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,120
example the woman who was

332
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,360
supporting the women's strike

333
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,200
her account this marilyn monk her

334
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,680
account was hacked or with as it

335
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,200
happened with the recent one we called

336
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,240
worship minister of the government uh he

337
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,320
he was used and actually the content

338
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,720
from his mailbox which some probably are

339
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,639
true some are fake were used for uh

340
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,800
belarusian propaganda so kashanka used

341
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,959
it to prove that poland had

342
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:05,920
the

343
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,880
leading role in belarusian opposition

344
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,600
protests uh last year and this year

345
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,600
mostly last year

346
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,720
uh

347
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,720
yeah so that's uh actually what was

348
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,519
happening in the politics no real uh

349
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,440
highly confidential data leaks to public

350
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,440
in my opinion at least from what i know

351
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,959
we don't know what leaked to the hands

352
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,959
of the of the attackers

353
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,680
but of course this uh manipulation in

354
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,800
information

355
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,079
area it happened and it happened a lot

356
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,600
um

357
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,279
what's next next i will talking about

358
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,760
several incidents which are not

359
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,839
a result of attack as such targeted

360
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,680
attack rather it's a result of some

361
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,079
design flows or some

362
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,160
like ukr due diligence in this state

363
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,120
sector

364
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,320
first

365
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,680
are the examples i gathered throughout

366
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,399
past and first uh

367
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,040
what what is basil right this is the uh

368
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,480
general

369
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,480
registry identification register of

370
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,920
people something like

371
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,760
social security number in the united

372
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,959
states

373
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,480
and by by design in this meeting it's

374
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,680
nothing wrong with that right the

375
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,680
country has to somehow identify with

376
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,920
citizens and uh guests

377
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,839
as long as it's used as identified it's

378
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,320
fine but the

379
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,160
issue is that it's often used as a

380
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,399
authentication or even authorization

381
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,639
mean and then the the issues happen

382
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,639
because even though it seems that peso

383
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,720
is something private that only you know

384
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,279
but in reality it's in a lot of places

385
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,639
and it's not that difficult to get

386
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,720
someone special if you if you need to so

387
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,160
it's not a secret

388
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,959
um there are it's pretty common that

389
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,120
some files are encrypted and peso is

390
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,199
used as a password the example which you

391
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,959
see here on the left is actually the

392
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,279
the copy test results that were stored

393
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,959
in a common folder and each file was

394
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,959
just encrypted by peso actually nabis

395
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:53,760
patient

396
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,519
took this information and proved that

397
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,120
knowing that the password is special you

398
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,600
can break it in 50 seconds on a common

399
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,480
uh laptop so no no rocket science here

400
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,639
and that was in the incident

401
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,399
also it's a big question if you can do

402
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,399
something uh uh

403
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,920
wrong with peso like take a loan for

404
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,839
example and the answer is yes

405
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,160
unfortunately although not very often

406
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,839
but there are some services not banks

407
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,920
usually banks do it more thorough but

408
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,040
some services that uh in favor of you

409
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,240
know usability and to gain uh clients do

410
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,120
it uh simplified to a bad extent so like

411
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,959
you provide the peso you get the loan if

412
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,639
it's someone's else's peso then you get

413
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,320
the loan someone else owes money it's

414
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,199
like

415
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,279
obviously not good also there's this

416
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,800
screenshot here and there was an attack

417
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,639
which was caused by uh ability to

418
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,720
produce a duplicate same duplicate just

419
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,160
snowing the password and the phone

420
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,079
number of a person calling the support

421
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,760
and saying okay i've lost my sim card

422
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,360
that's my personal that's the id of the

423
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,040
new card please link it to my phone

424
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,120
number you take over the phone number

425
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,880
you take control over the accounts that

426
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,160
link to this phone number and that

427
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,639
happens so that's reality and one funny

428
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,560
case well funny for us probably not for

429
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,639
the poor guy who discovered that he has

430
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,720
extra kit in his profile at the social

431
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,880
fund and of course again the root cause

432
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,199
because with the quality was the typo so

433
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,639
when his kid was

434
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,880
has some medical treatment when the

435
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,800
result were entered in the system

436
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,120
they had a typo in the person and in

437
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,720
this way the

438
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,720
foreign let's say to this person kid was

439
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,560
attached to his profile

440
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,560
uh i think this guy spent a lot i know

441
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,480
that the person spent a lot of time to

442
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,839
clean this up it took more than two

443
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,440
months but we don't know how much more

444
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,279
hours he spent explaining to his wife

445
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,040
why he has the third kid

446
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,720
on his account

447
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,040
hopefully he managed to resolve that as

448
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,040
well

449
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,800
okay that was the identification part

450
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,240
but of course there are means for two

451
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,920
means uh that were designed to

452
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,399
authenticate an important uh it's not

453
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,199
one uh something like dia there are

454
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,920
several ways to authenticate yourself at

455
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,639
a

456
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,279
state level or say digital services

457
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,720
first you have the trusted profile

458
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,800
professor funny this is a kind of

459
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,040
centralized directory of users but in

460
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,480
order to have this account you have to

461
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,560
do a physical verification of yourself

462
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,519
either through the municipality or

463
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,279
it can be an editing t provider like a

464
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,920
bank that you use to log into this

465
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,560
profile profile then you can use also

466
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,720
the two electronic signature which is

467
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,600
also when created requires verification

468
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,240
of a person and there is also the new id

469
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,160
documents which have chips in it and

470
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,720
some other ways for for authentication

471
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,880
each channel is good but you feel

472
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,560
probably that because there are many of

473
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,800
them there can be a collision and

474
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,959
actually there is a vulnerability and a

475
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,399
collision between them

476
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,040
especially in the or i would say even in

477
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,040
the trusted profile itself because as i

478
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,120
mentioned you can have

479
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,720
the credentials or use the identity

480
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,560
provider the

481
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,720
issue is or the behavior is such that if

482
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,240
you have several accounts in several

483
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,320
banks as you see here on this screen

484
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,000
there are several banks right and uh

485
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,759
all will be valid at the same time one

486
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,360
will be active but all will be valid and

487
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,800
you can choose which one is active and

488
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,480
the issue is that when you choose a

489
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,640
different one as active the previous one

490
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,720
is only notified but not

491
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,959
required to authorize this action if

492
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,000
you're lucky you will notice the

493
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,439
notification if you're not lucky

494
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,280
probably your account will be taken over

495
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,000
uh silently i mean not noticed an

496
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
account here means trusted profile which

497
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,760
gives access to all your text data

498
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,640
medical data and overall everything the

499
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,880
state knows about you basically is is

500
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,120
accessible with this

501
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,160
account

502
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,120
really powerful and if you will look uh

503
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,840
um attentively to this icons on the

504
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,280
right you'll see one which is called

505
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,520
envelope and probably didn't hear about

506
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,360
such a bank because it's not a bank it's

507
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,360
a post office actually the incident that

508
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,799
happened the known incident happened

509
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,640
through envelope because post office

510
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,720
does not verify your account such in

511
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,720
such a good manner as banks do so

512
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,880
usually you imagine a post focus right

513
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,039
and poland is like not not better than

514
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,840
ukraine so some maybe old woman sitting

515
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,000
behind the counter you come and say okay

516
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,840
this is my pencil i want to verify my

517
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,960
bank

518
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,320
the internet account probably she even

519
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,400
doesn't really know what this is okay

520
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,280
personal password special mark tick mark

521
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,720
is done so yeah it's uh it's a

522
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,400
let's say

523
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,160
risk here by design

524
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,880
another thing interesting thing that was

525
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,480
actually is happening this year in

526
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,760
poland is the uh population census

527
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,240
first it is mandatory so you already

528
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,919
feel the pain right it's like saying

529
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,000
that elections are mandatory kind of

530
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,760
nonsense but it is and if you don't

531
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,320
provide your information in the census

532
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,080
even if you're not citizen if you just

533
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,240
live in poland so the criteria is living

534
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,120
here

535
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,200
you may get a fine fine fine is up to

536
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,799
one thousand five hundred dollars so

537
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,039
pretty pretty significant

538
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,520
and um there are two ways to submit

539
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,440
information online and through a person

540
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,160
who is called rachmisch account master

541
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,640
with the online piece uh from the

542
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,960
security leakage perspective there was

543
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,480
none so far we

544
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,400
recorded it or reported but from the

545
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,240
other side as yesterday in his interview

546
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,640
daniel mr told that if someone gathers

547
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,840
centralized

548
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,120
centralized

549
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,520
database of something he's doing it for

550
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,039
for the other actor who will steal it

551
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,520
later so who knows maybe these sensors

552
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,600
results will still be stolen at some

553
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,039
point in time

554
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,960
no not yet luckily

555
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,960
and here the only thing that was

556
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,720
interesting is by design is that you

557
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,240
could authenticate yourself with basal

558
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,200
again

559
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,039
and some uh additional information which

560
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,640
is not difficult to find like date of

561
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,440
birth

562
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,440
and you will login into the sensors

563
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,120
actually you can provide them the the

564
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,720
data of course you don't get access to

565
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,120
any data suicide channel you can just

566
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,640
provide false data which probably makes

567
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,640
no sense but the other interesting um

568
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,080
consequence is that you can actually

569
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,320
block these sensors for the person so if

570
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,919
you have some neighbors who are

571
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,360
listening to loud music at night and you

572
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,679
know their personal you just log in and

573
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,200
start entering their sensors and don't

574
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,720
finish it never

575
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,559
and actually there is no mechanism to

576
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,240
regain control over this online

577
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,240
submission it is just what was not

578
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,159
designed so the only way is left for

579
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,640
them is to go to rahnesh which probably

580
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,120
they will not do because it's difficult

581
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,840
so you can spoil it a bit their mood and

582
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,760
also interesting thing is that because

583
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,799
uh

584
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,960
the peso requires validation there is a

585
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,799
end point at the back end that validates

586
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,120
pesos and it's publicly available of

587
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,480
course as i mentioned it's not a big

588
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,200
secret i mean you can find pencils to

589
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,200
other channels as well but

590
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,280
having a

591
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,399
state-owned public

592
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,760
i think it's not a pestici idea as well

593
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,559
and the others channel which is uh

594
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:39,760
getting or facing the information

595
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,320
basically by humor human by discount

596
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,400
master this gave birth of course to some

597
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,600
fraud

598
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,000
based on that imagine you get this sms

599
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,159
like on the screen uh hi i'm your

600
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,000
account master please call me this

601
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,919
number you call and then you're starting

602
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,840
to be asked questions which is expected

603
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,679
right about your private information

604
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,600
because that's what census does

605
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,480
um how to check if this person is really

606
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,000
account master so there was even an

607
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,159
instruction how to do it but you feel

608
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,159
the pain right so there were cases of

609
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,000
fraud based on this obviously

610
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,760
and there were more incidents at state

611
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,760
level some of them are on the screen i

612
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,919
will not go into details of them because

613
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,320
uh probably i'll be out of time if i

614
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,120
will do so just as a easy summary

615
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,280
summary is that on the state level

616
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,280
this security is not sufficient of the

617
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,280
state services probably because

618
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,640
the engineers are underpaid the

619
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,559
technologies are absolute lack of

620
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,799
ownership as always in the states uh

621
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:35,840
owned

622
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,280
institutions

623
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,679
but well that house is leaking as in the

624
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,200
elvis faceless song i think uh if cause

625
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,280
corson is looking uh currently at my

626
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,440
presentation he would like this

627
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,760
uh conclusion because it's pretty the

628
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,080
same as in ukraine i guess

629
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,080
and one last example i have here it's

630
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,919
more from the commercial world but it

631
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,320
also happened with the city the city of

632
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,960
ashvansem was ransomed they had some

633
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,600
servers we gave daisy information it was

634
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,720
encrypted

635
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,480
and they were asked for ransom they had

636
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,480
to announce the tender it means city

637
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,640
probably cannot pay ransom officially so

638
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,559
they announced standards and company one

639
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,480
tender for decrypting the data and no

640
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,880
one never told how it was decrypted so

641
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,320
there's a chance that the company just

642
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,880
paid their answer to to to the um to the

643
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,240
attackers

644
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,080
and say the sad fact is that actually

645
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,000
the money for that and you see this six

646
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,080
hundred twenty thousand zlotys it was

647
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,679
taken from the other budget line which

648
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,240
was uh intended for road construction so

649
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,600
poor citizens

650
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,080
citizens of uh schweinsteim they paid

651
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,559
for the ransom instead of paying for the

652
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,440
for the road for the new road

653
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,440
so ransom is probably a good connector

654
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,840
from the state level to the uh business

655
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,919
level the uh

656
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,360
known case as it was in english

657
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,120
language media that's why it's known

658
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,960
it's actually known company producing

659
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,919
the uh cyberpunk and the witcher games

660
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,760
it was ransomed yesterday example talked

661
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,679
about it in her in more details in her

662
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,520
presentation i wanted to provide some

663
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,440
basic info but i think i'll skip because

664
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,799
anyway you can listen to her

665
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,559
presentation if you're interested and

666
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:09,919
get more details

667
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,000
there was another company a game company

668
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,080
that was hacked it's morgana the game is

669
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,880
pretty old but still it's uh it has a

670
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,640
decent number of users but even from

671
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,159
this screenshot from the forum you see

672
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,440
it's uh

673
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,080
pinefold old style

674
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,039
the

675
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,480
incident happened to through um

676
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,000
breaking into the admin panel so it's

677
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,240
not random it's probably just

678
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,600
uh again the

679
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,000
all admin panel probably is pretty old

680
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,440
as the game is

681
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,200
and some private data leaked or

682
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,880
potentially leaked the company had to

683
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,559
inform the users actually i wanted to

684
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,960
say that in business sector companies do

685
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,799
inform people about data breaches which

686
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,640
that is required or potentially in

687
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,279
databases that is required by gpr and

688
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,240
they really follow this um requirement

689
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,600
but the funny thing is then when they

690
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,840
inform this and this sms which you see

691
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,240
on the screen they made a an error in

692
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,520
this url shortener and they added a

693
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,520
extra char to the domain name so when

694
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,760
people actually clicked the link whoever

695
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,600
clicked maybe some wise people do not

696
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,919
click links in the sms but still they

697
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,480
actually landed on a fake

698
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,960
website which raised concerns

699
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,600
significantly because well

700
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,080
it looked actually as a second attack or

701
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,840
they attack itself itself instead of

702
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,159
just informing the about potential

703
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:27,760
breach

704
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,679
there was one case where it kind of

705
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,120
seemed like a supply chain and some

706
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,799
people already

707
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,960
pulled out the popcorn to watch it

708
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,000
growing

709
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,919
the company is a hungarian though there

710
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,760
are some but it supplies software for

711
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,919
banks including polish banks and one of

712
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:42,960
its uh

713
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,600
servers the test servers was hacked

714
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,120
and theoretically

715
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,600
the attacker could inject a malicious

716
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,159
code or version into the build in the

717
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,200
cicd

718
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,120
chain and then it could be propagated to

719
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,080
the banks using it but everything ended

720
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,960
up happily to users because it was just

721
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,880
a hack for the crypto mining so someone

722
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,039
tried to to mine coins

723
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,760
on this server and that that was all

724
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,919
the next case is not that happy i mean

725
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,120
here the

726
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,520
leak of personal information did happen

727
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,440
tauron is a supplier of

728
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,120
electricity one of the two biggest

729
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,960
players in the polish market

730
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,400
and the

731
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,600
private data and call records leaked

732
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,840
pretty a big number of them you see the

733
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,400
screenshot of a folder that had numerous

734
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,720
uh subfolders in it but this story is

735
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,039
interesting it is kind of a thriller you

736
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,279
see the end of the story or almost the

737
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,799
end right this picture of for the guy

738
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,720
being captured by police that's that's

739
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,080
how it ended

740
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,360
but the guy

741
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,159
actually looks like he's not that evil

742
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,760
he

743
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,240
according to his story he was telling it

744
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,480
later in the in the media

745
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,720
and that he got attacked by this server

746
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,640
it's funny to hear but yeah the servers

747
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,039
count his his ap probably the server was

748
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,559
hacked before because why should the

749
00:25:58,559 --> 00:25:59,840
servers come

750
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,880
and he had not been a kind of engineer

751
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,360
so he went on this server

752
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,559
saw the

753
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,159
folder without any

754
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,080
access protection so a lot of

755
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,000
information there and put it downloading

756
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,159
and went to a party he got back from the

757
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,720
party probably a bit drunk or not a bit

758
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,720
drunk saw that he actually downloaded

759
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,640
lots of private information of toronto

760
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,360
users he called taron and asked to close

761
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,840
the gap and they kind of didn't believe

762
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,080
him maybe he was not too firm

763
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,679
sounding not to from at this point of

764
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:30,559
time

765
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,120
he got angry with this

766
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,960
attitude and wrote the email with the

767
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,880
demanding some ransom

768
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,520
or he would publish the data then in the

769
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,440
morning when he woke up sober he

770
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,120
realized he did something wrong but

771
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,720
before he could do something with it

772
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,000
actually police know that he is his door

773
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,919
but actually he was let go because

774
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:54,320
probably it was for tauron too

775
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,240
problematic to sue him because then they

776
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,760
would have to reveal the details why

777
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,400
their server was uh keeping the

778
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,799
information without access protection

779
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,799
and actually they did reveal some

780
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,640
information it turned out that this was

781
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,320
not managed by them but by the third

782
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,640
party and the third party were two small

783
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,760
companies

784
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,520
and doing the call center services for

785
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,440
them it's an open question why did they

786
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,880
choose a big

787
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,960
national white player chose some small

788
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,679
companies for doing some services

789
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,080
but let's call it just a bad vendor

790
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,640
management practices not to think more

791
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,039
behind it and probably toronto will fix

792
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,200
this later on not to

793
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,360
face such incidents

794
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,640
and the last slide this couple of

795
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,640
incidents happened in the healthcare

796
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,399
industry obviously

797
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,159
recent couple of years the attention to

798
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,000
health care is increased into their

799
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,559
services and remote um

800
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,480
even remote medicine and of course the

801
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,799
remote downloading of results

802
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,520
so a lot of situations about

803
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,760
the test results or some diagnosis

804
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,240
leaked like in this case again

805
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,880
unprotected folder on the server and

806
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,880
actually even worse it was indexed by

807
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,960
google so we took some time for google

808
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,840
to clean up or not for google but for

809
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,799
them to realize and to to to uh

810
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,559
request the cleanup of

811
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,039
the medical data which were even

812
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,679
available on the on the internet uh

813
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,760
through google and the second example is

814
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,600
that the error that the system provided

815
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,000
was purpose it revealed some end points

816
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,399
and it uh unlikely it turned out that

817
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,720
the endpoints are without authentication

818
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,919
and they leaked

819
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,159
again medical results and actually

820
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,320
health care data of people

821
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,440
so

822
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,000
uh the conclusion is here that if the

823
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,640
industry experiences a boom in in a

824
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,360
demand it should also experience similar

825
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,840
or even

826
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,840
higher uh

827
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,279
increase of attention to security

828
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:46,399
otherwise

829
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:47,600
inevitably

830
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,480
the

831
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,200
incidents will start happening

832
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,080
okay and personal personal fraud

833
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,080
the most uh

834
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,760
even here it's not known but probably

835
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,840
the largest in terms of impact was the

836
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,399
oil x cam uh thousands of people

837
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,640
impacted and i've seen information that

838
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,960
more than one and a half million lot is

839
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,799
actually stolen

840
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,880
during this

841
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,640
attack and it is no it doesn't even

842
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,000
attack probably series of attacks

843
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,399
because it was a distributed network

844
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:17,600
behind it

845
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,399
not no single player it was single uh

846
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,080
point of automation there is a classic

847
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,000
scam group that actually provided

848
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,480
automation of bots and landing pages

849
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,919
that are mimicking the um shops in this

850
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,360
case oil leaks

851
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,840
uh and it can be rented so probably even

852
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,240
you could rent a boat for yourself and

853
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,960
try to fraud someone um

854
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,520
uh the logic of attack was very similar

855
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,000
always someone who showed interest into

856
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,480
your uh item that you are selling on the

857
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,720
leaks he said okay i'm buying and then

858
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,120
he's saying okay uh olix will send you a

859
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,880
link right now that you should use to

860
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,039
get your money because they message me

861
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,360
that they will do this to you and then a

862
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,960
person gets a link everything looks like

863
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,200
a leaks but in reality it starts asking

864
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:01,919
you

865
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,000
secret information not only credit card

866
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,159
number but also cbp i've seen cases of

867
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,880
been asked date of birth mother made a

868
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,360
name and so on i'm actually curious why

869
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,120
people do not um

870
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,799
see this red flags that it shouldn't be

871
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,559
happening right if you want to get money

872
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,880
you don't have to provide the data which

873
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,720
actually needs to be

874
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,200
available to spend money but a lot of

875
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,279
people were probably just impatient to

876
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,120
get their money they wanted to do

877
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,719
everything just to get the uh

878
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,120
the money for the good they they wanted

879
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,720
to sell

880
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,679
as i mentioned a real uh big scale of

881
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,520
fraud uh all the banks were uh alerting

882
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,279
that this is happening the release

883
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,360
itself was alert and it's happening but

884
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,480
probably

885
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,799
through during the half a year poland

886
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:53,279
was like shaked by this by this attack

887
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:55,760
uh there were smaller attacks one is uh

888
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,039
actually it's probably connected with

889
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,760
this ghostwriter so on the personal side

890
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,960
it looked like a

891
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,200
phishing for for your email accounts and

892
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,799
pretty straightforward but

893
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,799
also pretty efficient effective

894
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:08,720
uh something saying that the privacy

895
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,880
terms updated click now or otherwise you

896
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,480
will not be able to use your mail

897
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,760
account people clicked and yeah there

898
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,679
they were losing the economy it's not

899
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,640
only uh virtual poland which is

900
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,559
but i mentioned it specifically because

901
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,360
it's the largest let's say polish uh

902
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,039
developed mail provider something like

903
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:28,559
ukraine in ukraine and a lot of

904
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,159
politician accounts actually which were

905
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,240
hacked they were hacked through personal

906
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,519
mails mailboxes on this

907
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:35,850
uh

908
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:37,519
[Music]

909
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,600
mail service

910
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,519
and the last slide i decided to just

911
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,760
combine it with the visualization in one

912
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,240
slide but tell you in different stories

913
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,799
mostly they are about receiving some

914
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,399
information that requires you to act

915
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,320
soon otherwise you'll be in trouble for

916
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,600
example you have

917
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,519
like small amount of overdue but if you

918
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,600
don't close it then your electricity

919
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,159
will be cut off or your parcel will not

920
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:02,320
be delivered for you it seems like okay

921
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,200
i paid this even less than zloty quickly

922
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,480
and i get ready to get rid of the

923
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,440
problem typical of social engineering

924
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,640
methods and yeah of course then the link

925
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,480
is crafted uh more interesting more uh

926
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,960
cases when the you got calls and

927
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,039
actually calls for from the number that

928
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,200
that really kind of belong to the bank

929
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,279
so the number was spoofed and the person

930
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,880
who was calling you acted like a

931
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,200
security department specialist he was

932
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,279
getting your trust because he kind of

933
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,519
uh

934
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,840
made made it possible for you to avoid a

935
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,840
fake transaction but in the end his

936
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,360
conclusion was that you have a virus in

937
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,559
your device you have to install

938
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,399
something something like teamviewer

939
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:45,039
and through this uh then application you

940
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,840
actually your device was uh hacked the

941
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,840
control taken over and your

942
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,840
account used for the malicious purposes

943
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,519
i mean bank account

944
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:56,240
uh so that was pta

945
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,039
wide scale this infoline scam let's say

946
00:32:59,039 --> 00:32:59,919
so

947
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,279
and there was one interesting corner

948
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,039
case when there was a

949
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,360
black male in of entrepreneurs and why

950
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,640
it's known that it's entrepreneurs

951
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,960
because they are they are male boxes

952
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,279
which are in the company

953
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,200
registry

954
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,399
were used

955
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,640
and the message was like we have some

956
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,880
information or even some pictures of you

957
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,039
doing something not good with children

958
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,960
uh

959
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,000
well we mean of pedophilia kind of uh

960
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,880
um content and if you don't play answer

961
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,960
and some will publish it and i just

962
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,720
think normally people would ignore this

963
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,080
right because normally don't have

964
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,080
nothing to do with pedophilia but

965
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,840
if if this was happening probably there

966
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,519
was a coronary cases when

967
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,559
not numerous hopefully victims but uh

968
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,279
that are not clean in this context

969
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,159
they

970
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:49,279
prefer to pay rather than to be you know

971
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:50,799
compromised

972
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:53,600
and anyway interesting fact it's not

973
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,919
visible here but uh

974
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,080
there were cases where the such messages

975
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,279
sms

976
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,000
were

977
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,600
coming from non-polish numbers

978
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,600
ukrainians i've seen ukrainian numbers

979
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,159
uh baltic countries like uh from belarus

980
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:08,960
as well i just wonder if you have such a

981
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,719
sms from from a

982
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:11,679
no

983
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,440
number which is not your country why

984
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,040
would you click on something like this

985
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,639
but people clicked

986
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,079
and by the way what's interesting uh

987
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:20,239
from time to time such uh

988
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,280
uh

989
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,520
hacker groups it's probably too loud

990
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,440
work because usually it's a

991
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,760
small scale hacking for a particular

992
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,879
group of people they are called by

993
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:31,040
police so i would say probably once in a

994
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,960
month i see news that some group was

995
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,679
revealed that we're sending this uh sms

996
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,918
and a picture of you know a bet with a

997
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,280
lot of

998
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,079
mobile phone phones lying on the bed

999
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,599
connected with some

1000
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:45,520
with some cables

1001
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,918
okay so that's probably it in terms of

1002
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:50,000
overview of the incidents but i have a

1003
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,040
couple of more slides to

1004
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,480
fulfill the

1005
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,679
picture

1006
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,440
one is about what is state doing about

1007
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,640
it

1008
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,280
cyber police the cyber police exists for

1009
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,079
four years but this year after this tax

1010
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:06,160
on politician accounts

1011
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,680
the state announced that it will be

1012
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,320
reformed and will be significantly

1013
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,359
um

1014
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,359
powered by new hires so they say they

1015
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:16,400
will be hiring about 1500 people through

1016
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,119
the next couple of years uh promising to

1017
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,800
pay good salaries like up to four

1018
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,480
thousand dollars net which is good

1019
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,480
salary for polish market

1020
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,760
uh but

1021
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,359
the reality in the same i mean news are

1022
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,280
promising but reality at the same time

1023
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,800
in the very single moment that they

1024
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,320
announced that you see this

1025
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,880
job description ferta practice which

1026
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,880
says uh the salary

1027
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,280
which which is uh gross is less than a

1028
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,880
thousand dollars so

1029
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,160
absolutely not mention the reality it's

1030
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,839
not for cyber policies for some cyber

1031
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:46,000
department of one of the institutions

1032
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
but nonetheless the level of current

1033
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,440
payment it's

1034
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,680
not comparable with the market also

1035
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,240
there's this screenshot of the

1036
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,920
investigation results which were kind of

1037
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,599
masked i mean the sensitive information

1038
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,119
is must but

1039
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,359
when you download this pdf it's just

1040
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:02,960
additional layer you just remove it and

1041
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,960
you have all the sensitive data which

1042
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,920
actually

1043
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,079
was pretty

1044
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:09,119
unfavorable for the further

1045
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,119
investigation because it had sensitive

1046
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,839
contacts and lastly this news about the

1047
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,000
cyber police it got

1048
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,079
pushed for some fraud

1049
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:18,880
uh

1050
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,320
but people started getting mails and

1051
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,079
they were saying you are

1052
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,920
recruited you've been recruited to cyber

1053
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,400
force please click this link and fill

1054
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,119
you out your information so even the

1055
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,079
good news raised the bad uh you know

1056
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:34,400
emotions about it because of this

1057
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,560
potential fraud i mean fraud was real

1058
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,480
potential to you because a lot of people

1059
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,800
got this information

1060
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,880
uh and also i wanted in the end provide

1061
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,040
a couple of statistics because we've

1062
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,560
talked through the particular incidents

1063
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,200
but uh what's on the bigger scale the

1064
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,680
bigger scale these this i could find one

1065
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,760
is the checkpoint

1066
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,079
uh here it's interesting that uh of

1067
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,079
course it's not the attacks it's more of

1068
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,560
malware right malware can can or cannot

1069
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,560
cause an attack real attack but the

1070
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,920
interesting that the current countries

1071
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,920
of origin of the malware files you see

1072
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,400
that the most of it is united states

1073
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,160
and other countries but not russia in

1074
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,079
poland a lot of people due to

1075
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,079
as i mentioned the uh geopolitics

1076
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:16,320
preferences are takes attribute things

1077
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,040
to russia even not thinking about it

1078
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,960
of course this is territory of the

1079
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,040
servers from which the file comes not

1080
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,359
the actors behind it but still my my

1081
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,520
opinion that attribution to russia is a

1082
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,079
bit exaggerated of everything

1083
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,160
yeah what's happening in poland in terms

1084
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,839
of type of malware you see here the

1085
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:35,680
comparison to global

1086
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,839
trends you see that botnets for example

1087
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,079
and by the way uh check checkpoint

1088
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,839
doesn't have a separate category friends

1089
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:43,599
and ransom is sitting in botnet

1090
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:46,240
categories so it means that probably

1091
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,720
poland is more prone to ransom than on

1092
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,680
average the global market

1093
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,960
um

1094
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,040
and also statistics on crime

1095
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,119
and crime being revealed and the

1096
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,640
incidents on the left side the

1097
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,440
statistics from police number of

1098
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,560
prosecutions and successful prosecutions

1099
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,280
on top which which are cyber crimes on

1100
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,880
the bottom which are somehow related

1101
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,119
cyber crimes you see this increase in

1102
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,280
the recent couple of years uh

1103
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,720
unfortunately the

1104
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,599
level of them being revealed or

1105
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,520
investigated doesn't increase on the

1106
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,880
decline

1107
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,560
there's also a

1108
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,560
difficulty with

1109
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,400
starting the prosecution you know that

1110
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,000
for something to be a crime there should

1111
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,079
be a victim a motive the economic

1112
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:34,400
benefit of it and actually claim so

1113
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,720
usually someone has to to claim the

1114
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,240
uh the crime which not the case always

1115
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,000
for cyber crime because sometimes it's

1116
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,079
not possible to gather all those

1117
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:46,000
indications of cyber crime and also

1118
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,560
polish law if you do a significant cyber

1119
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,000
crime probably will get a couple of

1120
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,320
years if you do a small robbery you will

1121
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,119
get up to 10 years so again it's not yet

1122
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,359
balanced for for the new reality in

1123
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:00,960
terms of incidents there are three users

1124
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,680
under different lines of verticals of

1125
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,480
authorities in poland i have managed to

1126
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,440
find only uh thesis for two of them

1127
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,359
uh probably

1128
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:13,200
a third one has something similar and

1129
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,119
the trend is that the number of

1130
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,920
incidents um reported is significantly

1131
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,480
bigger in the recent years and the

1132
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,200
answer why is that significantly in the

1133
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,839
bottom chart because the incidents that

1134
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:26,640
are

1135
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,800
proven to be incidents are their numbers

1136
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,200
much lower than the uh claims so

1137
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,200
probably it's effective gdpr that

1138
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,280
companies now have to report the

1139
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,200
incidents and previously they didn't do

1140
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,000
it

1141
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,320
and only but but number of uh real

1142
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,640
incidents also significantly grows like

1143
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,000
twice uh in 2020 compared to 2019 and of

1144
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,320
course it's uh partially due to

1145
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,640
the pandemic types and remote work and

1146
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,800
on the right they are

1147
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,160
except from a kpmg investigation or

1148
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,440
survey i would say

1149
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,560
that's interesting that number of

1150
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,079
companies that claim they don't have any

1151
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,960
incidents getting lower so a lot more

1152
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,720
companies actually realize they had an

1153
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,440
incident and the the portion of the

1154
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,880
companies that had more than one

1155
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,960
incident goes as well so you see it's

1156
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,680
like

1157
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,319
four to nine or one to three incidents

1158
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:16,000
one two three actually doesn't grow with

1159
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,040
four to nine and 10 to 29 so numerous

1160
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,200
incidents the portion of companies that

1161
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,839
acknowledge this

1162
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:25,440
uh growth

1163
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,119
well from one side maybe it's a good

1164
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,440
thing maybe monitoring uh

1165
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,839
maturity just grew from the other side

1166
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:34,319
well of course it kind of disappoints

1167
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:38,240
that there are conditions for saturation

1168
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,960
and yeah probably uh there's a time for

1169
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,000
conclusion

1170
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,680
and when i was thinking about conclusion

1171
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,520
i thought i could do it in two different

1172
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,920
dimensions one since this try to compare

1173
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,680
poland with the global trends

1174
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,079
unfortunately i'm not a researcher so i

1175
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:52,880
don't

1176
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,800
probably am not too knowledgeable about

1177
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,520
all global trends uh in my personal

1178
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,160
opinion if we compare poland in these

1179
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,640
three layers at state layer although

1180
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,240
station is pretty you know

1181
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,400
understandable the maturity of state

1182
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,240
services in terms of security is not

1183
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,200
good but

1184
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,720
there was no real uh impact um

1185
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,720
through from attacks on the state level

1186
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,480
so no elections were impacted no

1187
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,400
critical infrastructure attacks

1188
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,880
probably poland is just not the main

1189
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,520
target in the global world at the moment

1190
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,440
probably you know attention is somewhere

1191
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,560
else

1192
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,480
a business sector to me it looks pretty

1193
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,880
average so struggling with ransom

1194
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,760
another type of attacks and data

1195
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,480
leakages and on personal layer to me it

1196
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,880
seems that poland is more prone to such

1197
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,520
frauds probably one reason that could be

1198
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,800
and i discussed with colleagues is that

1199
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,920
the

1200
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,280
level of

1201
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,920
consumer services is pretty good

1202
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,920
you can pay with different methods there

1203
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,920
are a lot of fintech startups there are

1204
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,079
a lot of online shopping and so on of

1205
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:59,040
course it's all useful but this uh

1206
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,319
variety of

1207
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,440
you know

1208
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,359
waste how to pay money it means also

1209
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:05,119
variety how to lose money or how to

1210
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,240
steal money

1211
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,040
uh so that may be one of the reasons why

1212
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,760
the uh level of personal level fraud is

1213
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,240
actually in my opinion bigger than in

1214
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,240
some other countries the second

1215
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,319
dimension of conclusion could be if you

1216
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,079
are are in this environment if you are

1217
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,240
in poland as an actor probably as a

1218
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,480
private individual or a company what

1219
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,560
this means to you and because poland is

1220
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,480
we just agreed is probably more or less

1221
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,560
the same as in the the global trend

1222
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,400
probably the conclusion is the same for

1223
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,920
for any other country

1224
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,079
uh my recommendation would be everything

1225
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,319
that is external to you wherever you put

1226
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:39,920
your data to and it's controlled

1227
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,960
externally just assume it's it's leaked

1228
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,880
right so don't uh

1229
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,040
play put hopes that it will be in secret

1230
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,960
and build your strategy from from from

1231
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,240
there so just understand that

1232
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,440
you have to

1233
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,079
somehow mitigate leakage of this data

1234
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:58,720
you provide your card number don't keep

1235
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,880
all your funds there you provide your

1236
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,040
peso you have to understand that it's

1237
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,280
all kind of known to

1238
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,760
sooner or later and so on and

1239
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,880
when would

1240
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,280
we talk about something that you control

1241
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,960
you have to learn how to protect your

1242
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,960
assets so this way of thinking that i'm

1243
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,520
too small to be attacked it doesn't work

1244
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,119
even if you will not be attacked by a

1245
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:22,079
ghostwriter i mean not targeted attack

1246
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:24,000
you will still probably catch malware or

1247
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,880
some automation attack automated attack

1248
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,520
so you have to learn how to swim or your

1249
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,000
sync so it's kind of the slide is trying

1250
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,040
to tell you

1251
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,280
sync or swim and

1252
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,640
whether you will swim it depends on you

1253
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,880
um

1254
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,800
i think that's all i wanted to tell you

1255
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,280
at least as part of presentation again

1256
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,680
my my contacts how you can reach me

1257
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,800
at linkedin or through email and i'm

1258
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,480
pretty open as i already mentioned if

1259
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,640
you have any need for information about

1260
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:58,079
poland feel free to reach out to me

1261
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,119
and yeah if i'm not disconnected and

1262
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:02,800
you're still with me

1263
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,400
then probably i'm ready for the q and

1264
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,960
a's if there's any i was not following

1265
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,640
the questions through the presentation

1266
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,760
so vlad

1267
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,079
i need your help here if there are any

1268
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:14,480
questions

1269
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,079
i see one question for sure

1270
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:19,359
let's

1271
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:22,839
switch to

1272
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,359
faces mode

1273
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:27,040
yeah

1274
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,839
cool so so thank you thank you for this

1275
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:31,280
presentation

1276
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,599
i was following through

1277
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:36,720
which is rare

1278
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,240
when you

1279
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,359
do a conference so uh it's all very

1280
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:43,440
interesting and i will join course who

1281
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,359
was asking in

1282
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:47,920
chat

1283
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:52,319
uh whether you are going to submit this

1284
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:55,119
to somewhere when you can present uh

1285
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:57,680
the same material in ukrainian because

1286
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,920
because finds this very interesting

1287
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,599
ukrainian speaking audience

1288
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,440
especially concerning government

1289
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,040
identification government tabs and the

1290
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:13,599
parallels drawn with the dia for sure

1291
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,319
uh so do you plan to

1292
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:17,440
scale

1293
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,760
to other languages in particular

1294
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,280
ukrainian

1295
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,440
well of course for me no issue to do

1296
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,760
this presentation in ukrainian or

1297
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,240
russian uh whatever is needed i don't

1298
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,839
have any particular plans to submit it

1299
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:31,440
for for for an event but of course if

1300
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,440
you have any idea where this could be

1301
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,960
useful i'm all uh uh up to it because

1302
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,319
the more useful

1303
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,319
i can get i would have already spent

1304
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:41,920
effort and i already prepared this

1305
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,760
presentation of course this will be

1306
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:44,960
better for

1307
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,760
we're good for everyone right

1308
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,920
i hope we'll have some suggestions at

1309
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,800
least we have a last cave already

1310
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,010
planned

1311
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:55,359
[Music]

1312
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:56,400
this fall

1313
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,680
yeah

1314
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,280
as usually

1315
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,599
quarterly health meet up

1316
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:02,880
so

1317
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:03,920
yeah

1318
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:08,800
do we have any other questions

1319
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,880
do you have any other questions i

1320
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,800
understand that first speech after lunch

1321
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,200
is usually a speech when everyone still

1322
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,520
is kind of napping

1323
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,200
so maybe

1324
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,200
not the right time there are two

1325
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,480
there are two kinds of talks you know

1326
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,720
ones that outline the topic

1327
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,520
in its complete entirety and there will

1328
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,800
be no questions and the one that

1329
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,440
provokes some thinking and maybe there

1330
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,440
are some

1331
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,960
intended gaps

1332
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:39,839
to

1333
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,800
lure audience into some dialogue and

1334
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,440
communication

1335
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,960
but as it was like a description of

1336
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,920
historic events and

1337
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,640
it wasn't biased at all you announced it

1338
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,240
in the beginning but basically it was

1339
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,200
quite factual and everything was

1340
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,960
quite factually correct

1341
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,520
and there is data behind all this so

1342
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,880
yeah

1343
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,319
uh

1344
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:08,640
i think there might be

1345
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,440
no questions at all but normally we have

1346
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,599
couple of minutes

1347
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:16,240
when people come up with questions after

1348
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,640
talks

1349
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:27,520
one question i wanted to put

1350
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:31,760
as a point for debates in a couple of

1351
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:32,960
hours

1352
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,359
but actually i can

1353
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:37,680
i can burn it

1354
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,400
for your q a so uh

1355
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,440
yeah because you touched the topic

1356
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,359
uh

1357
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:47,599
just a little bit of background so

1358
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:50,319
i am thinking currently

1359
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:53,839
a lot about uh the political situation

1360
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:56,000
the global trend of uh

1361
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,520
like liberal democracy and

1362
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,520
as you mentioned

1363
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,240
poland and uh many other countries

1364
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,680
actually

1365
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,800
not not only poland even in the eu

1366
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,760
are currently moving

1367
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:15,119
not moving but slightly leaning

1368
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:16,880
to the right and

1369
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,040
becoming less liberal democracies i

1370
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,800
would say so i wouldn't call them like

1371
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,800
not democratic or totalitarian countries

1372
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,240
but if you look at

1373
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,760
what's happening

1374
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,400
politically in romania hungary poland

1375
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,200
you cannot you cannot just help but

1376
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,680
notice yeah that there is some

1377
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,520
right leaning thinking

1378
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,920
yeah not like in the us

1379
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,160
during trump but still

1380
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,359
so uh you mentioned that

1381
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:47,200
and one of the

1382
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,680
ways liberal democracy can actually

1383
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,599
survive uh this trend is a mandatory

1384
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:55,359
election

1385
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:57,520
you know so this is brought up a lot

1386
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,839
like in the so-called intellectual dark

1387
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:01,440
web there are going

1388
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,400
uh extensive debates about whether we

1389
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,079
should or should not

1390
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:07,680
mandate

1391
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,280
uh

1392
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,680
participation in uh

1393
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:12,800
election

1394
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,440
yeah and you mentioned a mandatory

1395
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:18,800
participation in a census which

1396
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,640
is basic like operationally it's the

1397
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,800
same yeah just

1398
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,599
not expressing your will but you provide

1399
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:28,839
your factual data hopefully factual data

1400
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:30,480
and uh

1401
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,960
mandating anything like this for me it's

1402
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,559
basically the same

1403
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:37,359
yeah like in terms of execution

1404
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:38,079
so

1405
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:39,119
uh

1406
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:40,800
what do you think like

1407
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,040
maybe for the census it's an overkill

1408
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,079
but for a democratic process would the

1409
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:48,960
risk in your fair assessment yeah would

1410
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,760
the risk be worth it

1411
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,760
because for census i don't know i doubt

1412
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,960
it

1413
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,040
and from your presentation i guess you

1414
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,040
doubt it too but if

1415
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,680
higher matters are at stake like our

1416
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,280
democracy

1417
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:07,599
would it would it be enough uh to

1418
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:10,960
to accept the risk and go for it

1419
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,440
actually interesting uh

1420
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,520
interestingly enough a book they just uh

1421
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,920
finished reading recently

1422
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,240
uh the plot is about the country well

1423
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,640
that's actually a portuguese writer so

1424
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:25,119
it's kind of portugal but it's not named

1425
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:27,920
and the citizens of the capital they

1426
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,880
refused to vote so the elections failed

1427
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,480
and even the

1428
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,599
you know national uh emergency state was

1429
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:38,240
proclaimed because well there was this

1430
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,160
situation that the elections just cannot

1431
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,119
happen

1432
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:43,920
and the the government tried to you know

1433
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,160
somehow force people to do it

1434
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,520
um

1435
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,200
it didn't happen i mean in the book it

1436
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,359
failed so in reality probably this

1437
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:54,079
trying to force would also fail but it's

1438
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,680
my personal opinion likely i'm not a

1439
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,079
politician to decide on this uh if i

1440
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:00,079
would decide i'd rather go a different

1441
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:02,559
way and i limit i would do some

1442
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,559
discrimination

1443
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:06,319
about who can vote

1444
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:08,720
honestly speaking because this

1445
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,640
movement

1446
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,080
you live in poland for too long

1447
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,000
[Laughter]

1448
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,920
because then finally enough i have

1449
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:19,280
similar thoughts maybe it's it's too

1450
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,800
like right leading but yeah yeah i i

1451
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,480
actually i have no vote in right in

1452
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,319
poland so for me it's easier to to

1453
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:28,240
discuss the things because it has no

1454
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,880
consequences but anyway i would actually

1455
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,079
link the

1456
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:34,160
right to vote on to just citizenship but

1457
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,520
to some

1458
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,680
act to play an active role in this

1459
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,680
society for example tax play being a

1460
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,839
taxpayer so if you are retired and you

1461
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:44,079
don't pay taxes anymore you don't vote

1462
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:47,680
anymore and in this way probably

1463
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,359
the elections would be more

1464
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:51,359
forward-looking than the

1465
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:54,160
nostalgic looking

1466
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,640
yeah maybe but it's just one

1467
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,240
an idea which i'm pretty sure will never

1468
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,079
happen because the discrimination is

1469
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:01,839
just like uh

1470
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:03,599
yeah hopefully

1471
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:05,440
yeah like a nightmare for a politician

1472
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,839
because everyone will accuse any anyone

1473
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:10,160
with such idea and uh probably the

1474
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,000
career of politician will be over at

1475
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,359
this point even though

1476
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,079
times change though maybe some sometimes

1477
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:19,680
this idea will be progressive but i

1478
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:23,280
think that it would be more realistic to

1479
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,880
uh just define

1480
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,920
discriminate not the right to vote but

1481
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,359
uh but the issues that

1482
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:34,240
can be resolved through voting you know

1483
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,119
because obviously we cannot vote on uh

1484
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:39,119
tax policy

1485
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:41,599
there cannot be a direct vote

1486
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,640
on tax policy because it's it's silly

1487
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:45,440
okay

1488
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,680
people are not educated enough to

1489
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,839
to decide whether they will or will not

1490
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:52,079
pay certain taxes it should be decided

1491
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:54,880
uh somehow by experts and people just

1492
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,839
can decide what expert will decide what

1493
00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:00,480
experts will decide which ones i mean

1494
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,400
uh but

1495
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,520
yeah most probably we will move in that

1496
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,760
direction and there will be a lot of

1497
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,839
political experimentation in the coming

1498
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:11,119
years

1499
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:12,559
unfortunately with the such trend that

1500
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:14,319
we have we will quickly be in a

1501
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:16,400
situation where elections will not be

1502
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,079
held at all i mean some

1503
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:20,319
authoritarian approach to

1504
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:23,119
government because yeah we will fail to

1505
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:25,680
to solve this issue quick enough

1506
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,839
um but who knows maybe i'm too

1507
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:29,359
pessimistic

1508
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:31,839
no one no one knows uh but the time will

1509
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:33,119
tell this is

1510
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:35,839
this is what it always does uh the the

1511
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:37,920
the reason why i am so interested in

1512
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,599
this and i am

1513
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:42,720
inquiring your opinion because when you

1514
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,520
demand something from

1515
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,680
the population you basically need to

1516
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,760
provide means for that to happen right

1517
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,920
you cannot mandate

1518
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,520
election unless you

1519
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,200
[Music]

1520
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,520
you provide convenience

1521
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:58,240
uh

1522
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,800
if they have to

1523
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,119
stand up and go somewhere it's already

1524
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:05,280
inconvenient so that's why

1525
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,200
uh if it's mandatory it should be so

1526
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,680
easy that everyone can do it basically

1527
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:10,960
by

1528
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,880
applying touch id to some digital

1529
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,720
signature in the phone

1530
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,079
and

1531
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:18,559
many countries are looking at that right

1532
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:21,599
now because otherwise they will not just

1533
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:23,440
maybe mandatory voting will not be

1534
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,680
needed if it's so convenient and easy

1535
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,599
maybe the people will just vote because

1536
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:29,839
they can and they shouldn't do anything

1537
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:31,359
more than touch

1538
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:33,440
uh a button for that

1539
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,720
but who knows

1540
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,160
let's wait and see

1541
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:39,200
there is some cheering uh

1542
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,359
nasty says it's a very interesting talk

1543
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:44,000
thank you andrei and uh

1544
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,839
i think uh we have something in q a

1545
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:50,799
let's address that do you know if certs

1546
00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:52,400
cyber police

1547
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,040
from poland and ukraine are cooperating

1548
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,720
do they have something different in

1549
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,760
cyber crime types that they are

1550
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,640
investigating

1551
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,799
a good question i haven't seen any news

1552
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:07,119
about cooperation of cyber police i have

1553
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:09,200
seen some use of cooperation of usual

1554
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,280
police and even this was this case when

1555
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,400
the

1556
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,200
uh a former minister

1557
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,359
in poland who then was the head of i

1558
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:19,839
think he had fought

1559
00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:22,319
imprisoned but that was a regular crime

1560
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,240
for the cyber crime i haven't seen this

1561
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,240
cooperation and moreover i think the

1562
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,599
level of enforcement in cyber area is

1563
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:31,200
pretty different you've seen statistics

1564
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,960
about poland so thousands of crimes like

1565
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,040
uh really been investigated i don't

1566
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,200
think that in ukraine we have such level

1567
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,440
of law enforcement in cyber area maybe

1568
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,920
i'm wrong maybe time changed but the

1569
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,079
last time i've actually seen or was

1570
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:46,960
interested

1571
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,040
interested in this topic i think there

1572
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,799
were only a few cases

1573
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:52,880
ever reaching the courts

1574
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,640
in the cyber area

1575
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,240
so

1576
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,240
i'm not a lawyer but i have many friends

1577
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,359
who would

1578
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:02,759
agree with you

1579
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:06,000
uh okay peter is referring to some

1580
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,799
europol data

1581
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:11,119
yeah there is some partnership maybe but

1582
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:12,240
yeah it's

1583
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,559
yeah formal partnership for sure i think

1584
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:16,559
ukraine and poland have

1585
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:18,640
there are memorandums yeah claim

1586
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,799
partnerships in different areas but the

1587
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:22,319
question i think was rather about real

1588
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:25,359
cooperation so no no evidence in the

1589
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:28,559
news at least that it's happening

1590
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:30,960
not publicly

1591
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,880
i think i think if it's driven by

1592
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,839
someone uh as powerful as uh i don't

1593
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:37,280
know fbi

1594
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,040
uh there would be some global

1595
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,880
cooperation for instance if there is a

1596
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:41,839
network

1597
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:44,400
that is uh being synchronously arrested

1598
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,240
in both poland and ukraine there would

1599
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:49,200
be cooperation for sure but directly

1600
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,040
by the way with this go ghost writer

1601
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,720
there there was a cooperation in poland

1602
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,520
actually went for help to to nato

1603
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,040
uh

1604
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:00,240
about this attack and i know that also

1605
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,319
through influence on political

1606
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:04,720
channels the telegram channel which

1607
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,480
posted information from the worship

1608
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,480
email account actually was

1609
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,680
blocked

1610
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,200
although it pop up

1611
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,559
under different name and with the

1612
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:15,200
russian-speaking audience in in russia

1613
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,160
for sure

1614
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,000
yeah that's the other

1615
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,480
topic but i mean there's yeah when i see

1616
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,160
it there is cooperation but in this case

1617
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,920
poland went to the united states for

1618
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:27,040
help not too great

1619
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:30,319
yeah yeah sometimes it's it's easier but

1620
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:33,839
the threshold is high i agree so i think

1621
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:34,799
uh

1622
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:37,200
that's it for the q a thank you very

1623
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:40,559

through

1625
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:45,599
recent events in polish cyber scene uh

1626
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:48,640
both legal and illegal that was quite

1627

educating for me thank you very much and
