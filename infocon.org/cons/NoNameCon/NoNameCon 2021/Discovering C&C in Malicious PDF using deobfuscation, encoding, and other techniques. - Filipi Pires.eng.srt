1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,600
today we we're gonna talk about the

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,919
discovery in cnc it's a good topic by

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,000
the way i like this talk about the moral

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,639
analysis and here my contact on a two

5
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,639
year and uh

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,560
here my contacts too and uh social

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,199
medias i have here my web page and uh

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,279
okay we will show you during this

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,519
conversation my twitter youtube i have

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,439
here in my guitar some project i'm i've

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:26,720
been working

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,960
about that probably hunting mower and

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,359
stuff like that and uh if the people

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,120
would like to send them a message

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,000
it would be pleasure right and let me

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,320
introduce myself again i'm now i'm a

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,640
principal security engineer at talk desk

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,239
this is a portuguese company now

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,760
portuguese from brazil parties from

20
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,399
portugal it's different and

21
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,960
this company is responsible to sell a

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,199
product the contact center as a service

23
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,079
it's a

24
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,879
i'm new employee there and i'm security

25
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,120
research at senate segura it's perfect

26
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,280
pronunciation it's a brazilian company

27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,320
but they offering a pen solution it's a

28
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,400
privilege access management it's a

29
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,080
brazilian company but they appears in

30
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,920
many uh important report like a gardener

31
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,720
and uh you know foreign

32
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,439
it's a pretty cool solution but my job

33
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,759
here is to work with uh research right

34
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,960
and to see what happened with a new

35
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,000
threat

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,320
and the discovery and presenting

37
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,720
something related to our threats not

38
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,720
exactly related to solution

39
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,720
in my advocate of this awesome project

40
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,799
it's actually not a crime the name it's

41
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:35,840
pretty

42
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,079
obviously right because it's really not

43
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,560
a crime it's a mindset you have creative

44
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,560
mining it's how you can apply your

45
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,720
knowledgement in uh

46
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,040
you know in a technology and when you

47
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,280
see some applications when how you can

48
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,320
create these or how you can explore this

49
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,520
uh

50
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,920
of course but the thinking is the point

51
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,360
is it's a it's a lifestyle right and uh

52
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,680
for example if you if you are a lawyer

53
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,920
it's not a bad lawyer you know a

54
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,719
criminal lawyer or a a good lawyer

55
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,560
you know and uh this is the concept of

56
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,680
the hacking uh when you see something in

57
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,000
you using your creative mind and i'm

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,239
part of the staff staff a team of the

59
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,640
defcon group in sao paulo here and i'm

60
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,640
stroked of the hacker security by the

61
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,400
way we have here in courses in

62
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,879
portuguese and then structure of the

63
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,720
pentax magazine

64
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,239
one course that i am

65
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,640
teaching about the more analysis okay so

66
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,800
uh i would like to put every people in

67
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,720
the same page the simple definition

68
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,440
about what is threat uh

69
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,200
before to talk exactly about the

70
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,840
exploitation about the moral analysis

71
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,000
exploration actually and i would like to

72
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,680
explain more about what is athletic a

73
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,360
threat threat none of my definition it's

74
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,680
a defeat by this size all right so

75
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,000
straight it's a potential cause on an

76
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,640
incident and i mean it's related to

77
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,480
sovereign attacks and that intellectual

78
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,400
property or identity that or sabotage

79
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,640
all those things is related to a threat

80
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,800
if you think about the thread it's

81
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,239
usually it's related to the same

82
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,280
software right explored by something and

83
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,800
and of course you have a hardware

84
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,040
hacking or stuff like that but usually

85
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,200
it's related as some software so it this

86
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,280
is a thread not the flip definition is

87
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,000
definition by eizer okay and a simple

88
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,400
life cycle about the moral analysis so

89
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,959
what is exactly uh first of all we have

90
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,440
a simple right or artifact we don't know

91
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,519
if it's malicious not so we have a

92
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,840
identification step important and after

93
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,200
that you can choose what the best

94
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,120
strategy you apply the statistics and

95
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,280
dynamic analysis maybe you are asking

96
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,280
about the reversal engineer it's a part

97
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,360
of technique using in this

98
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,599
analysis or you can use in a statistical

99
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,879
analysis you can use a raster

100
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,040
engineering dynamic analysis of course

101
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,920
using tools to help you to see about the

102
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,400
information but the point is you need to

103
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,080
understand about those bases right

104
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,840
because you need to understand how the

105
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,879
important works in the memory how kind

106
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,480
of imports you have

107
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,760
called by some dlls and

108
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,080
many stuff like that right so but this

109
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,080
is the main point about the

110
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,560
what kind of strategy method you can

111
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,599
apply in your analysis okay and after

112
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,360
that you can create a report because you

113
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,079
need to present this to someone and your

114
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,000
company if you work about if you work

115
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,600
with a security

116
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,840
from my perspective importantly you

117
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,240
present some report to our your

118
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,320
coordinator or your manager and after

119
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,759
that you can improve your defense's

120
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,919
mechanism because if you if you do some

121
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,680
analysis in your job

122
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,840
you can improve your security defense

123
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,840
right because if you see what the the

124
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,280
path or

125
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,040
what exactly path the mower uh executing

126
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,479
your network you can improve your

127
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,199
defense mechanism or you can build some

128
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,960
uh thing with a good

129
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,560
beautiful name like the cyber threat

130
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,240
intelligence and you can you know

131
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,400
it's training in your environment this

132
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,560
uh cyber security resilience because the

133
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,960
threats are changing all the time right

134
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,800
so this is simple explanation what is

135
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,240
the statistical analysis is the first

136
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,400
step using number analysis because

137
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,240
describe the process of the program is

138
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,560
more deeply right so you can read about

139
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,320
the code you can understand about the

140
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,400
structure what kind of function it's

141
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,360
called by this program uh usually this

142
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,039
is the first step using the modern

143
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,479
studies or the research right because it

144
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,800
doesn't run at this time the demolition

145
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,160
you know it's the pain of course of the

146
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,039
program but usually it's more safe right

147
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,639
so this is a simple definition then

148
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,560
canals on the other hand using the

149
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,600
runtime

150
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,840
usually using some tools to help you

151
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,520
to it's a good something and you see the

152
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,680
report about that you know the report

153
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,360
you see the log but you need to

154
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,320
understand what this log are telling you

155
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,240
in the print right and because of this

156
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,840
you need to understand about those bases

157
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,680
okay or you can automate this process

158
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,039
using some the concept called said box

159
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,880
right sandbox is not a it's a simple

160
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,960
virtual machine uh

161
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,720
that you can use it to execute the mr

162
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,160
inside this controller environment and

163
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,319
to see the behavior of course it's not a

164
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,880
simple syn box because usually you need

165
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,800
to have some engines inside of the

166
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,039
sandbox to understand about the behavior

167
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,280
of this binary as a hidden inside of

168
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,520
this sandbox okay so this is a simple

169
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,720
definition um okay so now

170
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,639
before let's talk about the logical

171
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,080
structure about the pdf i would like to

172
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,720
share about something with you here in

173
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,720
my virtual machine so cross your thing

174
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,639
about the the lords of demo and let's

175
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,440
see what happened here okay so we have

176
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,840
here many uh mowers in my virtual

177
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,000
machine here to show you

178
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,880
so

179
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,800
first of all when the first remember

180
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,240
when you talk about the identification

181
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,520
is that the important step is um we need

182
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,680
to identify what is exactly this

183
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,479
artifact or this sample so first of all

184
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,360
we can use this file command to see what

185
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,199
is exactly the fire

186
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,120
right so let me check here for example

187
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,919
this invoice it's another a pdf okay we

188
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,599
have more than one mower here

189
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,560
is pizza mower in my case here i like to

190
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,440
work with them uh real modelers so let's

191
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,360
check here a sample

192
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,759
is a pe portable executable let me check

193
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,080
it here another it's a who is it's

194
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,319
another portable executable right but

195
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,520
the point is we need to see about those

196
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,280
bases that's my point here so what can

197
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,319
work exactly what is the correct

198
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,280
understanding about this file it's file

199
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,360
it's a tool that help you to identify

200
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,160
the five okay determiner the terminal

201
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,639
file type but the point is how exactly

202
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,800
work this tool and the point is here the

203
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,960
explanation how this

204
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,319
works here is this file have a what a

205
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,039
magic number what is stored in some

206
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,960
place what place is this information is

207
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,360
stored in particular place in here at

208
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,000
the beginning okay and of course when

209
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,560
you see in the unix platform as you can

210
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,599
see here in my my virtual machine is a

211
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,400
compilot right so you just set the file

212
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,599
command and you receive a return of the

213
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,319
this this command identifying based on

214
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,919
the magical number so all those files

215
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,599
has a machine number of course

216
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,759
measurement numbers can be manipulated

217
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,520
by the

218
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,400
the researcher the the the attacker it's

219
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,720
it's interesting so of course you need

220
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,879
to to trust in this comment but you need

221
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,639
to understand how this work is in the

222
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,879
background right so i have here for

223
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,000
example let me show you here i have here

224
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,360
yes i have here the file and mac

225
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,919
i think it's maggie maggie and magic

226
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,440
maggie okay i download here the database

227
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,839
of the file

228
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,040
sorry for that let me check here okay i

229
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,720
download here the

230
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,920
file command

231
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,200
the the database of the file how for you

232
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,160
unders

233
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,680
you need understand how this works in

234
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,760
the background of course this is all

235
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,160
those databases but not

236
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,839
pilot okay so if i uh read for example

237
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,120
whatever like javascript here

238
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,399
javascript

239
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,800
if i right here i can see

240
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,440
exactly how the file works in a database

241
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,360
so when you set the command of course

242
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,279
it's compiling in unix platform and

243
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,560
after that

244
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,880
the the file command the database has

245
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,480
some uh

246
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,680
rules that that that can use to identify

247
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,399
this file right so here as you can see

248
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,839
this is the information that you need to

249
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,519
have in the beginning of the file

250
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,680
remember when you read

251
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,560
uh when you read now about the file

252
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,360
command is a matching w it's storing the

253
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,360
in the beginning of the the file right

254
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,200
so if i copy here this information and

255
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,920
let me generate some file here

256
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,080
called malware.txt

257
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,200
and i will i just have this smile here

258
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,560
let me

259
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,760
okay let me put something here mower

260
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,000
and let me save here

261
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,680
and yes

262
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,600
okay

263
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,200
okay not have permission

264
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,079
okay no

265
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,360
[Music]

266
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,920
nano and malware talk text

267
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,160
it's proof it's okay

268
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,760
i will pass here

269
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,120
if not as this change from our

270
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,320
just to show how it's possible what

271
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,040
manipulate if i use here file

272
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,560
malware

273
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,079
text

274
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,239
it's another different it's on our

275
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,200
yeah malware

276
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,640
text

277
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,040
take a look this is a ascii if i read

278
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,040
this malware.txt

279
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,440
we have a mower okay this is our file

280
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,880
okay let me download it this is

281
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,680
it's another

282
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,399
pie

283
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,160
it's about just only text i have here

284
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,079
yes

285
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,480
okay just need to be confused so i have

286
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,079
here again

287
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,800
malware is a text okay it's um

288
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,959
we can read the correct

289
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,079
okay if i now if i manipulate the

290
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,480
beginning of the the match this magic

291
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,560
number started in the particular place

292
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,360
in the beginning as you can see

293
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,120
if i pass here

294
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,920
let me edit here i will save

295
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,760
and now take a look what happened if i

296
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,680
put file mower dot text

297
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,279
is not a ascii now is a node.js script

298
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,560
because i'm putting this in the

299
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,200
beginning of the file you know if i

300
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,399
manipulate again one more time and i put

301
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,279
here let me cut here and i will put this

302
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,720
uh

303
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,560
the book vote here three times and i use

304
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,680
save

305
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,760
so do you know what happened here

306
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,680
you can imagine so

307
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,519
what will happen now

308
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,880
take a look at this we have a fighting

309
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,920
script

310
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,480
because i'm manipulating so if you

311
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,920
understand about the python programming

312
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,720
language when you set this you can put

313
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,440
all those strings in the same uh

314
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,480
space right so i'm manipulating the file

315
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,440
here

316
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,040
and if i cut one more time and i put um

317
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,160
percent what percent pdf

318
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:28,959
like

319
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,839
whatever and i will save here

320
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,360
and take a look what happened now

321
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,519
but the extension is always the same

322
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,360
it's doctex take a look at this now i

323
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,839
have a pds so it's very important to

324
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,079
understand those bases so i you can see

325
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,279
how this works is this a file so that's

326
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,079
my point here so let's check another

327
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,560
interesting point here for example take

328
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,200
a look at this let me return here and uh

329
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,120
let me go to this folder and i have here

330
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,880
uh file who is yeah yeah so let me check

331
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,519
here strings dash a this should quiz

332
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,240
five less i will start in the beginning

333
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,399
okay so we just information about the

334
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,399
string it's not it's it's not a

335
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,760
completely no analysis it's not a

336
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,920
reverse engineer but it's a first step

337
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,920
the identification step right so you can

338
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,120
see here the uh session right so doctech

339
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,079
stock or data docs data and dot or ask

340
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:26,959
for

341
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,920
c so the session inside of the pe the

342
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,160
portal is executable okay so if you

343
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,680
check here we can

344
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,519
try and find many others information so

345
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,880
here you can see

346
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,639
uh some

347
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,440
functions called by what

348
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,839
by some dll so here we can send load

349
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,920
library and get process address usually

350
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,480
it's pretty cool inside of many mowers

351
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,120
okay and you can see here other

352
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,160
different so virtual a location in

353
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,680
memory space heap a lot so many

354
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,079
functions so here you can see the dlls

355
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,440
so

356
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,480
you can use

357
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,040
this uh information to help you but

358
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,199
let's see one important thing

359
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:08,959
interesting so as you can see here in

360
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,880
the beginning

361
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,240
we don't you you can't see the mz

362
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,560
signature here right so

363
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,950
for example if you using um

364
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:20,320
[Music]

365
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,160
let me check here x no x d n x x i think

366
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,839
use this

367
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,160
x d

368
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,920
next g next you know hd and uh

369
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,040
you know

370
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,360
uh any 32

371
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,320
and uh who is again and take a look this

372
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,399
in the beginning is mz

373
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,360
right

374
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,480
if i

375
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,800
check a different way here for example

376
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,279
and uh

377
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,040
so i have here more more bytes let me

378
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,079
check here more

379
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,079
let me put here okay

380
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,639
take a look at this uh we don't we can't

381
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,199
see here the mz

382
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,399
you can see the pe we just started when

383
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,480
you set the strings

384
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,000
uh

385
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,519
it started in this

386
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,519
moment if i check here take a look at

387
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,680
this uh the strings fighting less again

388
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,760
you see they started off they string

389
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,079
printed it started here in this moment

390
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,800
take a look at this

391
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,519
right so why my question why didn't

392
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,079
appears the mz

393
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,680
in the beginning because this is a

394
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,120
string right

395
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,680
so it's the simple question for a simple

396
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,480
answer right it's it's pretty simple if

397
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,519
you see here the strings is a tool that

398
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,600
can help you take a look what the

399
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,720
explanation here for each file given

400
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,160
strings printed the printable

401
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,160
characteristic sequences that are at

402
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,839
least four characters long

403
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,519
so you need to understand those bases

404
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,440
not only for fire for a string but you

405
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,720
need to understand about the structure

406
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,959
of the pde the pe the pdf the alpha and

407
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,720
so on and so on it's not just run on a

408
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,759
tool or run and then you know dynamic

409
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,759
analysis tool to help you it's pretty

410
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,759
important right but we didn't understand

411
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,320
how this work exactly because you need

412
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,639
to interpret this information or

413
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,040
understand the result of the log when

414
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,800
you set some command right so cool so

415
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,320
let's continue to talk about the

416
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,480
structure of the pdf in general we have

417
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,040
a four parts and a pdf the header it's

418
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,920
very common in all files the body then

419
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,240
cross reference table o x table and

420
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,639
trailer okay it's divided in four stack

421
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,880
four parts actually and we have a board

422
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,320
when you have a page images and whatever

423
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,040
and you have a um an x table or cross

424
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,440
reference table it's a it's specifically

425
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,320
part of the object it in the file for uh

426
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,720
access random from the

427
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,279
other object it's it's connected both of

428
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,839
them right and the tray is the same idea

429
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,360
it's location the certain object

430
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,639
ethernet

431
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,519
okay so this is the structure of the pdf

432
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,359
why i need understand because when you

433
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,839
set when you use some tools to help you

434
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,760
you can identificate

435
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,359
what is exactly or how is created or how

436
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,520
the attacker can use this in the pdf

437
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,720
okay so let's see now the demo about the

438
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,959
explanation we have here i think it's

439
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,919
more 20 minutes and i will explain these

440
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,880
uh analysis okay i have here the cv and

441
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,520
uh in the resume so let's suppose they

442
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,280
someone received this resume in the

443
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,960
company so first of all the

444
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,200
identification is steps okay i record

445
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,440
this to be more easily to explain you

446
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,600
okay first of all i would like i will

447
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,240
use the pdf id this tool provided from

448
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,880
dda steven right so

449
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,120
they created through as they put some

450
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,320
e-scan inside of the pdf and of course

451
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,320
when probably when dda stephen created

452
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,400
these tools probably they understand

453
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,960
about the structure of the pdf about the

454
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,160
how exactly is the cross reference table

455
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,200
the trailer and so on and so on and as

456
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,600
we can see here in this command we have

457
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,559
in this object 15 objects here okay we

458
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,280
have a two streams streaming what's that

459
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,679
mean streaming streaming usually is that

460
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,240
is the place when the many times the

461
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,480
attacker using to put some

462
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,919
thing malicious or maybe um

463
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,360
you know a job script or a selling url

464
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,400
or

465
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,280
many

466
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,360
things inside of this stream

467
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,480
of course

468
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,320
it's a it's a very interesting point

469
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,840
because when you instead about the

470
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,960
threads or security the people would you

471
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,919
like to

472
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,240
the young people actually like to study

473
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,600
about the uh or try to discover a new

474
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,919
exploit or zero days or you know but

475
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,679
we need to understand how the known

476
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,280
thread works

477
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,919
after i understand how the known thread

478
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,440
works i can

479
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,360
understand the techniques

480
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,080
i can't i can't understand

481
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,679
how is the

482
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,919
creative mind

483
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,400
used by the attacker in these attacks

484
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,160
and after that i can understand the

485
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,000
difference techniques and of course

486
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,960
after that i can develop in my

487
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,799
zero days excuse me it's not a zero-day

488
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,679
excuse okay but the point is we need to

489
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,919
understand about the known threats

490
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,919
for after that and understand how the

491
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,840
unknown threats works

492
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,679
it's from my perspective i don't know if

493
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,679
this is correct or not but just my

494
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,240
perspective you you if you have another

495
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,480
opinion it's no problem it's not it's

496
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,640
okay it's it's no words about that it's

497
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,200
we have a space for everyone and uh the

498
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,360
point is from a perspective we need to

499
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,000
understand about the known threads okay

500
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,360
so

501
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,039
when you understand the node threads you

502
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,280
can create the tools right if you have

503
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,440
if you have these good skills of the

504
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,039
programming language you can develop

505
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,160
that tools by the way i suggest you

506
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,480
okay so let's continue the analysis here

507
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,440
and

508
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,000
they have here some other

509
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,799
interesting informations here so this

510
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,400
command it's pretty cool because when

511
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,039
you execute a pdf id take a look this is

512
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,919
slashes here slash page is slash encrypt

513
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,679
slash javascript

514
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,240
slash aaa so here you can see

515
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,679
something inside of the pdf probably

516
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,960
when dda steven created this tool they

517
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,039
find some informations

518
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,600
related to open action so what does

519
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,360
what's that means of an action in this

520
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,799
case open access is basically is when

521
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,760
the user or the victim received the pdf

522
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,159
and executed download the action this

523
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,039
just only download the file inside the

524
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,080
their environment okay or or itself

525
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,400
download in the vitamin machine

526
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,880
the user don't need no need to click

527
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,440
again to execute the mower or execute

528
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,720
the pdf inside the the victor machine no

529
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,120
need is a good why because this open

530
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,480
action it's enough to execute itself the

531
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,520
fire just only download to the internet

532
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,039
okay so when you find the opening action

533
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,120
is that means that

534
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,960
when the file download the victor

535
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,080
machine

536
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,720
the user no need to click again okay so

537
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,039
that's the the point here so probably

538
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,039
when the tga stephen developed it i'm

539
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,640
supposed to okay

540
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,039
probably when the dds even create these

541
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,200
two probably they understand about this

542
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,080
behavior okay because probably they

543
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,320
analyze many times the many different

544
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,799
threads many different uh

545
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,840
different files and they probably is

546
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,919
understand about the known threads and

547
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,240
after that they create two

548
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,600
makes sense for me

549
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,960
and so when you have open action or a a

550
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,360
for example is that means that the user

551
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,559
don't need to click

552
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,200
you have not you but the malware has

553
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,240
action

554
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,280
automatically after the download okay so

555
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,600
that's the point here now cool so let's

556
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,360
continue to see so we have here five

557
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,080
javascript so it's totally suspicious we

558
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,000
have a five java script and you have an

559
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,960
open action in this file it's a pdf okay

560
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,880
i'm continuing to analyze after that i

561
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,039
execute the pdf parser it's another tool

562
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,280
from the gay steven uh

563
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,039
all those tools are inside of the

564
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,840
the unix platform as you can see so here

565
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,520
you some flags or comments or parameters

566
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,520
whatever name that you can set in your

567
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,120
analysis so i

568
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,120
set the javascript to see how many

569
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,000
javascript we have so as we can see here

570
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,400
in the object seven object

571
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,440
11

572
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,000
12 sorry and take a look at this

573
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,120
important

574
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,919
in the key that is something interesting

575
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,720
we have here in the beginning

576
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,520
take a look at this object one and type

577
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,280
catalog and referencing remember when i

578
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,919
talked about the cross reference table

579
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,280
and access a random and in the cross

580
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,880
reference table inside of the body so

581
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,039
as we can see here the object one

582
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,640
referring and object two three four six

583
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,080
seven ah six and seven but remember that

584
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,080
we have 15 object inside of this pdf

585
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,280
right and another interesting point here

586
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,760
is take a look at this we have an open

587
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,520
action remember that my explanation

588
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,840
about the open action so

589
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,559
the user just me just needs to click the

590
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,960
download the pdf and the pdf will

591
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,799
download in the environment

592
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,840
and the pdf is started automatically

593
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,400
something but we didn't know we don't

594
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,640
know at this moment

595
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,880
but as we can see here

596
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,080
we have that we have a javascript linked

597
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,840
linked with an open action i

598
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,880
mean after

599
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,400
the download

600
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,279
something happened automatically

601
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,240
with

602
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,520
a javascript

603
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,360
we can see here

604
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,159
but

605
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,320
the code is

606
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,880
not identical right we

607
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,440
it's we can see exactly the information

608
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,679
okay but

609
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,720
we need investigate more nice cool so

610
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,840
let's continue to do the analyze so we

611
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,960
we find we found the five javascript in

612
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,600
in the in this related to this string as

613
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,320
i i show you here so let's continue to

614
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,520
see so i'm set pdf parser and i would

615
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,720
like to see the ram data it's a

616
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,279
the completed data inside of the this

617
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,159
pdf okay so i will show you

618
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,400
here this command the important command

619
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,960
here to between find information the run

620
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,919
output for data and filters this is the

621
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,320
command that i am setting here okay to

622
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,400
see the the all run data inside of this

623
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,000
pdf to see more clear all those objects

624
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,360
so in this case i i just have only 15

625
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,480
objects

626
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,720
but sometimes we have a

627
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,919
60 objective it's many objects inside of

628
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,279
the pdf okay

629
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,279
so again you can see here

630
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:10,159
open action and javascript okay

631
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,480
and um

632
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,640
we can suppose is totally malicious

633
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,039
because it have an open action and have

634
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,200
and a javascript okay

635
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,679
and we have object 2 object 3 object 4

636
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,279
and again we have here one other

637
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,120
interesting point take a look at this

638
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,200
because remember we have an object one

639
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,960
at seven but we have a 15 okay and here

640
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,279
in object four take a look at this we

641
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,440
have another two difference or two news

642
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,480
reference and object eight in object

643
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,440
nine

644
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,640
so now

645
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,799
we can see more object

646
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,440
to investigate right because we don't

647
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,840
know exactly where is the place that we

648
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,880
find

649
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,520
the javascript and now we have a new

650
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,640
reference

651
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,039
right it's object 10

652
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,039
in in object 10 we have a javascript

653
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,279
here so maybe it's an object 10

654
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,200
let's see what happened inside object

655
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,159
10. object 9 is just a image

656
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,960
not important thing but we have another

657
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,760
object here object 11

658
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,120
it's more

659
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,440
close in object 10 we have the first

660
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,720
reference

661
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,640
another reference actually

662
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,760
object 12 and in this is the javascript

663
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,960
that we find

664
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,159
in here take a look in object

665
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,200
11 we have the first streaming remember

666
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,360
in the beginning we found

667
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,480
two streaming and take a look at this

668
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,720
in this object the left

669
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,840
is

670
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,480
it is more left the size inside of this

671
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,880
is streaming totally small

672
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,520
maybe we need to investigate because

673
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,919
we can put something

674
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,400
inside there object 12

675
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,480
reference object 13

676
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,720
and this object 13 take a look what i

677
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,039
found here another extreme

678
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,279
but here we have

679
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,919
the left

680
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,279
it's high it's bigger right and here we

681
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,080
have another important uh information to

682
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,080
tell you take a look at this we have a

683
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,640
big flat we have to have here flat

684
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,840
decode was that meaningfully

685
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,799
flat decode it means that i need to

686
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,399
decode something

687
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:21,840
it's it's cool

688
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,240
obviously but okay it's i need to decode

689
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,960
what i need to decode this streaming so

690
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,080
this is the

691
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,000
the action that i need to do i need to

692
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,240
decode this information inside of this

693
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,279
streaming

694
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,799
okay so probably this is the object more

695
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,600
suspicious for my perspective okay

696
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,640
because it's for makes sense for me

697
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,919
it's a big size and this is the okay

698
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,640
just that this i mean writing about that

699
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,559
this is the main object

700
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,200
and the wrote it wrong it's not mainly a

701
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,520
main object okay object 15 so just

702
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,919
not important information so now we need

703
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:00,640
to

704
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,000
read more about the object

705
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
15 this is the main object okay so if

706
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,360
you you're using now pdf tica it this is

707
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,640
another

708
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,640
platform that i use in this analysis

709
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,600
this two is not from dda steven right

710
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,159
okay so this is a pretty cool tool to

711
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,960
manipulate pdf and we have many

712
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,200
functions many flags to sat here like a

713
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,120
marriage pdf documents and whatever but

714
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,320
i would like i used this just only to

715
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,440
uncompress and hey compress in my case i

716
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,399
would like to uncompress because i found

717
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,640
many informations inside of this run

718
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,679
data

719
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,399
this i need to uncompress the all

720
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,880
informations inside of this pdf in main

721
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,840
in

722
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,640
mainly in your bj object 13.

723
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,520
so i sat here i i put the output because

724
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,360
i need to uh

725
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,960
copy all those information from this

726
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,480
dump.text

727
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,799
i execute the uncompressed comment and

728
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,480
now i have the

729
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,600
uncompressed data inside of this dump

730
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,399
okay and take a look at this i have

731
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,640
clear information inside of this

732
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,039
streaming this object 13.

733
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,880
and now we have the first technique used

734
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,559
by the attacker so here we have a

735
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,520
javascript also skated okay

736
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,840
okay for me now it makes sense because i

737
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,240
investigate more about that and i see

738
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,039
some other encodes inside of these

739
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:27,919
and

740
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,200
of course we don't have a time to

741
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,039
explain all those stuff but basically

742
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,159
it's a javascript obfuscated and if you

743
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,399
see here when i pass and i copy and

744
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,880
paste here this code in this file i

745
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,440
generate this file sample.txt

746
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,360
and you can see here the different

747
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,679
colors here so probably we can

748
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,159
see more about that and you see i see

749
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,760
here some evil parameters and i'm so i'm

750
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,919
thought when i made this investigation

751
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,760
if i'm talking about the javascript so

752
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,760
probably i need to print something in

753
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,760
the internet so if i were printing

754
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,360
something in the internet i can

755
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,799
manipulate these in html right and i

756
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,399
changed this paragraph by using this

757
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,520
evil parameter to write this information

758
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,159
in a browser okay so i set the document

759
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,840
right to write this in a web page to try

760
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,000
to suffocate this information because

761
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,840
the attacker using the javascript to

762
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,360
scale it so my age is if it was visual

763
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,679
for skate this information in a web

764
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,360
browser okay

765
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,559
using this evo parameter okay so i save

766
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:33,360
the file i change

767
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,240
this some parameters i create the sample

768
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,240
as you can see here i give the

769
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,679
permission to execute this

770
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,159
okay

771
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,960
now i can execute this in you know in

772
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,200
in in a browser right on in google

773
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,120
chrome or firefox i don't remember in

774
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,360
the firefox in this case

775
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,519
okay here when i execute this take a

776
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,519
look what happened

777
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,600
i received the print this information in

778
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,600
a web browser to take a look at this we

779
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,799
have now the pay load

780
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,279
in this case is a payload responsible

781
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:12,320
for what for executing the callback in

782
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,559
the vitamin machine to the attacker

783
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,039
right so inside of this javascript we

784
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,919
had what we have the payload responsible

785
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,440
to go back to them cnc so i now now i i

786
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,559
could

787
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,559
i could finish my investigation but i

788
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,200
continued to do i copped this all those

789
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,480
codes and i passed this in another file

790
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,480
because i see some standard in this code

791
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,120
and i generate another file called

792
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,399
payload

793
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,440
as we can see here right

794
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,440
and i see

795
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:50,480
i i saw actually the this standard um

796
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,519
number percent number percent

797
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:54,720
ladder

798
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,880
number percent the ladder i i saw this

799
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,080
is standard in this code so my date was

800
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,519
to cut this percent to understand about

801
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,840
as you can see here take a look at this

802
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,240
we have a number letters numbers slider

803
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,960
numbers but i had a percent here in this

804
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,600
case i used sad to cut this percent

805
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,640
because i would like to copy

806
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,399
this information here

807
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,240
this information here the attacker uses

808
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,799
another technique the encode

809
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:26,159
techniques based on an eu

810
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:30,240
a new to see you know a new

811
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,640
and

812
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,399
easy

813
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,880
use actually it's a old techniques but

814
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,399
basin on the now is you have 16

815
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:41,519
basically

816
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:44,320
now it's another uh it's evolution of

817
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,760
these techniques right so now utf-16 now

818
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:52,320
and this is e2c e a u 2

819
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,559
each is e u c u c i don't remember the

820
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,559
name correct now but it's the evolution

821
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:01,120
of this uh old techniques it was uh

822
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,640
now is uh

823
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,600
utf-16 okay and they're using these

824
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,279
techniques you see two

825
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,039
um

826
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,760
e you two seats

827
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,240
uh using unicode technique to encode

828
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,360
this uh information so now i change as

829
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,880
you can see the other um

830
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,640
environment because i would like to

831
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,880
explain the same exploration in the for

832
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,360
the perspective from the windows machine

833
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,240
so i copy here as you can see the same

834
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,360
code

835
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,720
and i you

836
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,559
cut this person take a look this

837
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,880
standard as i mentioned right so as you

838
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,120
can see here the ladder

839
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,399
percent number ladder percent and number

840
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:44,720
so i will use here another platforming

841
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,120
melissa mozilla sorry and uh and here we

842
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,440
can see the correct name

843
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,760
the old techniques as i mentioned

844
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,399
is here

845
00:33:55,399 --> 00:33:58,799
ucs to sorry ucs this is the correct

846
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,519
name it's old right so the correct name

847
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,600
now is utf-16 sorry for that okay and i

848
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,760
cut here as you can see

849
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,800
and i execute this access to file i

850
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,839
generate a binary as you can see here i

851
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:14,719
called

852
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,159
uh cnc i remember correct the name yes

853
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,599
and i generated this uh

854
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:25,280
ucs2 encode i generate ixa binary as you

855
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,639
can see

856
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:31,040
right and after that i use short to

857
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,440
search some http

858
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,679
access inside of this binary that i

859
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,399
generate now and as you can see here i

860
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,480
found the what the

861
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,960
cnc from the attacker so

862
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,280
now we have all those informations of

863
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,679
the attackers so we have a javascript

864
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,399
encoded uh obfuscated sorry and inside

865
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,239
of the javascript we had

866
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:55,280
a payload inside of this payload we have

867
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:00,640
an encoded technique but based on ucs2

868
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,079
and inside of this cs2 we have

869
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,000
they made a request to this cnc so if

870
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,599
you have here this is the cnc in estonia

871
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:14,400
by the way right as i show you here it's

872
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,839
based on estonia right

873
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,119
it's based on estonia yeah yes it's

874
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,720
based on estonia

875
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,560
okay and if you see here in uh virustoto

876
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,680
is this is uh

877
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,040
ip malicious using to explore victim

878
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,240
machines

879
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,359
okay

880
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,200
and here's some recommendations about

881
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,760
some books that i the people usually ask

882
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,880
me about their some recommendations so

883
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,800
we have here demo analysis mastering

884
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,920
from back

885
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,000

so

910
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,720
currently we still have none but

911
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,960
normally it takes people

912
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,359
a couple of minutes to

913
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:56,320
type them in if you are in zoom with us

914
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,800
and you want to ask your question out

915
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,000
loud remember that you have this option

916
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,160
you can do it you can raise your hand

917
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,480
and then

918
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,839
some we will get

919
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:09,599
send them a message

920
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,280
you seriously people have some shame

921
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,079
people can send me a message by social

922
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:15,680
media or worse

923
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,760
yeah thanks for being so such an open

924
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,160
person we will

925
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,119
publish this online and if anyone has

926
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,720
questions they will reach out certainly

927
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,359
but i am sure that we will have

928
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:32,000
questions right now

929
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,280
just uh yeah mind the gap between

930
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,920
what's going on in the real time and uh

931
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,240
what's going on on youtube because there

932
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,920
is always a delay of 20 to 30 seconds

933
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,119
yeah but

934
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,440
i was watching they do too but

935
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,599
not in english the problem is that i

936
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,520
don't understand i live in poland one

937
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,560
year but

938
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,960
it's totally different and yes the

939
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,240
latter it's different it's not that

940
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,160
different when you when you're polish

941
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,520
you know

942
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,640
because we can

943
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,599
speak

944
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:03,839
and they understand the accent mostly

945
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:06,480
yeah exactly exactly yeah i i have some

946
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,240
colleagues from the front from the kiavi

947
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,640
and at that time and the pronunciation

948
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,480
is some similar like a brazilian in

949
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,440
spanish

950
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,880
but the the

951
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,599
the ladders is totally different

952
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:18,720
yeah you know

953
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,599
we write differently of course

954
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,119
exactly

955
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,800
uh

956
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,160
okay

957
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,800
so it seems

958
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,119
there are no questions

959
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,440
okay i don't know this is i don't know

960
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,680
if i don't know if this is good or not

961
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,560
but

962
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,560
probably the people good or normally

963
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,320
it's good because it means that

964
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,000
everything is clear and everyone

965
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,599
followed it and uh yeah i think that it

966
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,119
should be a good sign but i have a

967
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:48,480
question

968
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,400
uh oh my goodness

969
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,640
no no this is very simple

970
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,640
being being such a um

971
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,680
being a guy such interested in finding

972
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,400
this kind of artifacts in documents do

973
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,720
you have some uh automation around

974
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,680
everything you get like via email or

975
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,440
download uh

976
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,480
from websites like i don't know i i'm i

977
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,040
was a web guy before becoming a manager

978
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,160
i was like

979
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,200
absec guys so i basically put all my

980
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,760
traffic through a setup of uh

981
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,880
http proxy zap and burp you know

982
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,040
just

983
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:28,119
so do you do yeah

984
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,720
similar

985
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,240
no no actually

986
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,359
in this in the moment no uh i didn't use

987
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,680
anything and uh when i for example when

988
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,240
i need to investigate something i open

989
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,040
my virtual machine and i use some tools

990
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,599
but probably um i'm

991
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,520
thinking in the future because now i'm

992
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,119
working with a singer segura it's a

993
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:51,040
brazilian company again i'm starting

994
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,440
this new research gene it's a volume

995
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,680
person for now but in the future we have

996
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,320
uh something like uh segura labs or

997
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,480
stuff like that but my idea is to create

998
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,560
some environment to

999
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,520
create this to receive some artifacts

1000
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,319
you know uh or create some flow like i

1001
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:09,200
have a

1002
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,359
like antivirus at

1003
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:14,800
uh you know antivirus.com to receive

1004
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,880
this some simple suspicious from the

1005
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,119
community and after that to pass from

1006
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,560
the

1007
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,200
past through this this uh like email

1008
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,560
after that some sandbox or you know or

1009
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,520
uninstall some honey pots to receive

1010
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,359
attacks to see the behavior to

1011
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:33,520
understand how this works and to see

1012
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,680
something is strange and then after that

1013
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,640
or to investigate more deeply right yeah

1014
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,760
but of course the pain of the

1015
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,319
infrastructure because when you use

1016
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:43,359
order

1017
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:46,160
yeah i was right twice so

1018
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,280
uh

1019
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,880

1020
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,119
everyone got everything but the only

1021
