i

18
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,360
let me check how many of you are here

19
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:56,179
[Music]

20
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,600
[Music]

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,199
so

22
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,840
these are the slides and this is the url

23
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,080
for you to

24
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,200
to load them on your computer and this

25
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,040
is going to be

26
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,280
a

27
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,200
hands-on workshop so

28
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,200
we're gonna spend

29
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,439
around an hour

30
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,520
with some introductions

31
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,200
and

32
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,520
then we gonna

33
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,240
probably take two hours or maybe three

34
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,240
to do some exercises

35
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,159
and

36
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,439
i was not

37
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,399
very sure that it would work because i

38
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,759
the the this workshop was tested

39
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,200
during defcon

40
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,920
which was

41
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,600
three weeks ago mostly almost a month

42
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,560
and

43
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,280
nothing really changed from

44
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,520
this

45
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,799
from the school perspective so

46
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,960
we're ready to go so

47
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,119
let me check

48
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,479
quickly

49
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,920
how many of you are here

50
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,200
15 i guess right so i don't know if you

51
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,440
can

52
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,640
tell me how many of you i mean we have

53
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,560
we have a discord

54
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,760
channel

55
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,040
i'm not sure if you all have it

56
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,150
but

57
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,400
[Music]

58
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,280
let me go here

59
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,519
yes in case of any support i will

60
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,360
redirect any question from this course

61
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,800
channel to you

62
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,920
or also we have possibility to

63
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,760
ask questions

64
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,480
during this webinar and and i'll be here

65
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,480
for you

66
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,959
okay i just wanted to know

67
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,239
how many of you had

68
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,040
an experience with bounty

69
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,519
hunting

70
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,839
any experience at all

71
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,879
so

72
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,200
i think we can

73
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,560
put plus

74
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,560
signs in the chat right now

75
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,840
yes okay so

76
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,680
one two three

77
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,080
so did you all get

78
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,760
the

79
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,440
the slides

80
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,640
will they work for you

81
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,080
so it's important for you to have the

82
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,080
slides because we're gonna

83
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,840
we need to

84
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,760
first

85
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,359
we need to check the

86
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,040
okay

87
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,720
yeah it's difficult

88
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,920
[Music]

89
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,200
so we need to set a lab first

90
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,599
so it's important for you to download

91
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,280
the vm and

92
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,799
the vm it's uh

93
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,080
i have too many tabs here

94
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,159
so the slides

95
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,400
there's a lot of instructions that you

96
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,239
need to

97
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,120
open

98
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,720
and

99
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,478
we need to wish

100
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,320
we need to be sure that you download

101
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,160
this vm

102
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,918
i see that many of you are already on

103
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,240
the file so it's good

104
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,720
so this is the most important step

105
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,280
for the workshop to work properly

106
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,240
and

107
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,919
you need to create an account

108
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,240
it's optional but it would be nice if

109
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,320
you have it integrity

110
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,120
this workshop is not sponsored

111
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,240
by any means by integrity and

112
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,800
i recommend you to create a digital

113
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,360
ocean account this is my referral code

114
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,160
you could use another code or not code

115
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,360
if you want

116
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,440
and that means that

117
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,919
if you log in with this with this url

118
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,680
you i will get some

119
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,919
some credit i don't know how much

120
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,840
but something

121
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,680
so let me know if you had problems

122
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,960
installing

123
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,320
or loading the vm so what you

124
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,320
what you i will do it from from the

125
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,800
beginning

126
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,880
so this is like the preparation step

127
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,360
[Music]

128
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,520
so what you need to do

129
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,360
it's once you downloaded the vm

130
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,800
it's uh

131
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,680
i'm gonna delete it

132
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,880
slow it

133
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,560
load it here i don't know if you follow

134
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,120
me if you have questions

135
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,600
just interrupt me because this part

136
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,360
it's uh

137
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,520
very important

138
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,520
for the rest of the workshop right

139
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,720
so

140
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,039
once you

141
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,320
downloaded

142
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,639
the vm

143
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,319
so i'm gonna remove it so i'm gonna

144
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,360
already ignore it again

145
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,280
if i'm going too fast or if you know

146
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,199
these steps i don't know what your

147
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,160
expertise is so

148
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,639
i'm gonna one of the things that i

149
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,880
that happens on in defcon i don't know

150
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,400
how many of you have ever

151
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,600
been to defcon before but

152
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,880
when we

153
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,880
me and my friend we better workshop

154
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,199
we need to prepare for every

155
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,440
any type of

156
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,400
any level of expertise

157
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,400
so that makes it more difficult because

158
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,680
we need to

159
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,680
also

160
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,880
be

161
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,520
assisting people or

162
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,840
giving them instructions on how to do

163
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,759
things that for some people might be

164
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,000
very simple

165
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,840
and for some people

166
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,440
it's difficult so one of the things that

167
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,560
we

168
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,160
discover that it works better

169
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,880
is that instead of using dvm

170
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,720
we will just

171
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,759
log in

172
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,520
into the vm using

173
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,520
ssh ssh right

174
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,440
so

175
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,680
let me know if you have

176
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,639
any problems with this step

177
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,039
and after this step week i can go

178
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,520
yeah so the delete of the slides so

179
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,520
after this step i can go directly to the

180
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,318
presentation

181
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,199
i had many things that i was doing last

182
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,360
night

183
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,199
checking

184
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,599
here

185
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,840
let me clean up a little bit

186
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,960
so you'd have the lab

187
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,919
slides

188
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,080
okay

189
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,319
we are already here on this side so

190
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,400
let me you know if you have any problems

191
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,878
with the

192
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,980
with them

193
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:02,309
[Music]

194
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,599
with the vm

195
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,280
okay yes that's important so then

196
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,720
just to be sure

197
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,520
the user i think it's

198
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,759
bug

199
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,679
and the password is hunter

200
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,320
yeah so i'm loading the vm here

201
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,200
so

202
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,320
how many of you do you know

203
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,320
nuclei

204
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,980
[Music]

205
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,240
okay

206
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,399
not a lot of people know nuclei and what

207
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,959
about axiom

208
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,080
so you're

209
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,839
only only

210
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,560
one person

211
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,399
okay so a lot of things to learn and

212
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,279
let's

213
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,320
let's

214
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,760
let's go straight so

215
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,120
did you all

216
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,800
manage to

217
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,560
so book

218
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,040
enter

219
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,200
okay

220
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,200
so i'm looking and

221
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,080
what i need to do here

222
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,600
is that i will

223
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,950
connect to the vm

224
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,959
[Music]

225
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,440
using ssh so we'll use bug

226
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,040
at

227
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,440
and the ap address that i get from your

228
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,600
config

229
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,880
if you don't

230
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,839
know what i'm doing ask me

231
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,640
so here so now it's easier because i'm

232
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,640
what

233
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,640
okay

234
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,480
so once you have

235
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,360
once you log into the vm using ssh and

236
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,600
the reason why we did it this way

237
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,880
because

238
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,079
the vm

239
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,160
the vmware player and also

240
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,680
um

241
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,279
virtualbox has a lot of problems with

242
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,640
different screens and different

243
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,680
configurations so

244
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,319
so

245
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,160
so

246
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,760
are you all

247
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,600
are you all done with this part

248
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,200
we can go back later if you

249
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,240
if you haven't done it yet

250
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,519
let me go back to the slides

251
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,680
so i'm going to go on presentation so

252
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,839
we're going to stop for a while that

253
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,800
part so let me introduce myself and my

254
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,680
name is philip

255
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,399
it's a french name in a spanish-speaking

256
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,760
country so

257
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,399
i have to spell it pretty much all the

258
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,000
time

259
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,480
and i studied computer science in

260
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,120
university which is the oldest biggest

261
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,760
university in my country

262
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,399
and i started in

263
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,040
i started in cyber security

264
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,680
in a weird way i started doing a

265
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,240
doing a talk in def con and sky talks if

266
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,680
you don't know

267
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,959
about def con there's a suf conference

268
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,050
it's like a

269
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,160
[Music]

270
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,480
it's actually a village that is called

271
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,480
skytalks where you could

272
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,639
where you can give a talk without being

273
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,480
recorded and

274
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,200
with some safety measures

275
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,519
and so i

276
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,399
i started i started doing a talk and

277
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,440
you're going to talk about

278
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,560
a public leak that i did like 2016

279
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,160
and after that

280
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,800
i started to really work into security

281
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,680
field and and next year i

282
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,079
did another workshop and it was it was

283
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,959
about wi-fi hiking

284
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,079
and i did it in china and in the us two

285
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,800
years ago before pandemic

286
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,279
and right now i work as a body hunter

287
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,920
probably 90 of the time

288
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,839
but it's getting difficult it's

289
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,000
difficult it's not getting very

290
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,880
difficult to have a proper

291
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,680
steady income and

292
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,700
i've been doing it for a year and

293
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,680
[Applause]

294
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,480
some

295
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,959
months i'm lucky some other months that

296
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,680
i'm getting bounties and

297
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,680
some websites are not

298
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,000
fair in my opinion we actually was

299
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,519
discussing

300
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,760
this with a guy that got banned out of

301
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,760
hacker one

302
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,040
they

303
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,600
some programs they just like

304
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,720
make up

305
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,519
things not to give you a bag about it

306
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,959
but

307
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,120
like they will say

308
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,639
um

309
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,399
things like the bag it's not

310
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,720
it's not working properly when it is and

311
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,040
or they will ask you to test things that

312
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,639
you cannot test because of the bug

313
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:53,760
itself

314
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,360
so i have some more examples that i

315
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,360
don't want to focus with that in that

316
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,880
part too much

317
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,160
so

318
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,240
so what are we going to do in this

319
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,240
workshop

320
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,760
um i have

321
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,920
five exercises plus one

322
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,360
probably

323
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,519
the the last one we are going to be able

324
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,120
to do it

325
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,120
and

326
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,040
at the beginning i i

327
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,600
thought that would be too long but

328
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,680
during the last workshop

329
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,160
and most of the people managed to finish

330
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,120
it

331
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,639
so

332
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,639
the first part is that we're gonna use a

333
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,680
tool called bb rf

334
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,959
which means

335
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,760
book bounty

336
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,199
bounty framework blue quality reagan

337
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,440
framework yeah

338
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,199
so it's used to

339
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,959
store your information of your programs

340
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,160
of your

341
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,240
targets right

342
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,440
and

343
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,240
so

344
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,760
in the second exercise we're going to

345
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,639
use some recon and recon actually means

346
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:57,760
like

347
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,079
knowing information about your your

348
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,040
target or your program

349
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,160
this could be

350
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,639
something like how many domains a

351
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,079
program has

352
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,638
how many

353
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,920
urls or

354
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,160
actually what i use is

355
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,199
basically domains and urls

356
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,000
and with urls you can start attacking

357
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,519
them with

358
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,760
automate automated

359
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,680
tools like nuclear

360
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,680
so the second exercise is gonna be the

361
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,560
use of recon and b3f

362
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,480
and the third

363
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,639
exercise gonna be

364
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,800
using nuclei

365
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,839
to scan for some vulnerabilities and

366
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,519
then i will explain you a bit more about

367
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,000
nuclear

368
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,560
and then we are going to show you our

369
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,480
i'm going to show you how to hunt for

370
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,880
cbs uh

371
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,800
cvs uh seriously actually got some

372
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,480
bounties

373
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,480
in integrity

374
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,560
like a month ago

375
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,680
and i will also show you how to

376
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,959
well this is the easy part and probably

377
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,120
you're not gonna find it that

378
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,759
interesting but it's how do i

379
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,519
send reports or how do i store

380
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,880
my reports because at some point they

381
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,000
they

382
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,800
at some point you have many type of

383
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,519
reports and also a

384
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,440
big amount of reports

385
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,839
for example i've sent

386
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,519
in hacker one i've sent 260

387
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,759
bucks

388
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,160
but another platform open book bounty

389
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,759
i've sent

390
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,199
i sent already two thousand five hundred

391
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,120
don't feel like that

392
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,880
and i will explain you

393
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,160
why so many

394
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,800
so the last part is

395
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,120
the last part it's about installing and

396
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,720
using axial and these tools nuclei and

397
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,079
axiom are

398
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,279
pretty new

399
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,120
and be using

400
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,199
nuclei for a year and axiom for six

401
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,559
months

402
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,480
they are pretty cool and i will show you

403
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,199
why why it's pretty cool so with axiom

404
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,280
what you could do is that you could

405
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,439
you can distribute

406
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,679
any command or

407
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,039
any tool

408
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,160
in

409
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,199
several machines several droplets or

410
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,880
vms whatever you want to call them

411
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,520
and that's very useful when you have

412
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,080
uh well this is what this part was for

413
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,000
def con

414
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,480
we were we we have we had a

415
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,440
little token 3d printed

416
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,799
so

417
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,640
i won't apply here

418
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,240
so

419
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,160
one of the things that people really

420
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,480
ask about or that

421
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,039
a lot of people look for information is

422
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,960
how to start because you know like many

423
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,080
of you

424
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,799
probably you want to get into

425
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,320
deeper

426
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,120
in terms or in terms of book bounty or

427
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,320
deeper in

428
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,450
in technical

429
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:08,799
[Music]

430
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,960
tasks for knowledge

431
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,200
and one of the things that you usually

432
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,360
struggle is where where can i start what

433
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,480
can i do first what should i do first

434
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,160
where can i read the

435
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,320
information books or information

436
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,600
relevant

437
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,840
to this topic and many people make the

438
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,679
mistake that they want to read

439
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,280
first they want to read

440
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,120
all the books that they can find and

441
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,720
then after

442
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,120
a while they will just like get into

443
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,320
integrity or hacking one or book crowd

444
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,280
but

445
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,440
and it happened to me that

446
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,720
i had

447
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,240
i had

448
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,160
i knew some people that were doing body

449
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,000
hunting and and

450
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,600
i was always like

451
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,320
well someday or next week or next month

452
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,000
i'm gonna try it but i didn't know how

453
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,160
to approach it so it took me a while so

454
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,360
what i did

455
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,760
is that i started looking for youtube

456
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,679
videos uh i think after defcon

457
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,600
they've gone yeah after the last

458
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,760
deathcon last year

459
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,840
because a lot of they they uploaded a

460
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,160
lot of videos many of the things that

461
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,760
were usually

462
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,679
only live they were recorded so it was

463
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,559
cool in that in that sense

464
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,400
and one of the things that i studied was

465
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,280
a json headaches with one of them jason

466
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,039
had it it's a

467
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,480
well-known

468
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,880
pokemon e hunter

469
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,480
i think right now it's not really

470
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,240
rainbow bounty but

471
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,039
it's

472
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,240
it's always there creating content so

473
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,240
when one of the videos he

474
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,240
in that video if you watch it

475
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,880
he would he would use

476
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,799
he will tell you a lot of tools how to

477
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,480
do recon how to how to discover

478
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,600
more assets of your targets because

479
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,360
the more assets you got

480
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,480
the more

481
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,799
chances you have finding them but right

482
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,000
you

483
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,559
if you have all the assets all the urls

484
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,080
all the domains

485
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,240
you have more chances of finding a bag

486
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,600
in one of those

487
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,679
in one of those assets

488
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:10,640
so

489
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,760
it took me

490
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,240
a lot of time it took me

491
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,880
the probably days to try all the apps

492
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,400
that i mentioned and i realized that

493
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,520
some of them

494
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,159
were really bad or really old or they

495
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,320
were difficult to install difficult to

496
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,600
use

497
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,280
some of the some of them would have will

498
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,000
never even install

499
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,280
so

500
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,799
so i was trying nuclei i didn't know

501
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,760
much about it i'm just trying it

502
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,840
and a friend of mine sent me a security

503
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,360
file in a security tech dot txt file

504
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,679
it's a

505
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:46,880
kind of a

506
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,960
standard that

507
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,039
a guy didn't remember the name

508
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,120
it

509
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,799
developed that

510
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,280
a website you have this file

511
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,080
and in this file they should

512
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,760
they should include emails that people

513
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,919
that want to report about can send an

514
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,760
email can send an email or or they could

515
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,080
they could define if they have a program

516
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,159
if they have bounties if they are going

517
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,280
to pay

518
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,120
people that

519
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,840
find bugs or not right so

520
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,200
some friend of mine sent me this

521
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,280
security file of a chilean company that

522
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,000
said that they had a bounty program and

523
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,960
they

524
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,280
and i looked and i searched a little bit

525
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,760
and they were in hacker one before so i

526
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,720
thought

527
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,480
i'm never gonna find anybody on this

528
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,000
side they're already

529
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,440
they already stayed sometime in heart

530
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,559
care one so what up chances so my idea

531
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,080
was to test

532
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,520
a nuclear

533
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,400
so

534
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,440
i

535
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,760
was scanning i was using the scanner

536
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,799
which is basically you gave it the urls

537
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:51,679
and

538
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,360
some results started to appear

539
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,240
and

540
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,520
so

541
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,640
it was

542
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,280
by accident because i didn't want to

543
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,480
i wasn't

544
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,640
really looking for these bugs in this

545
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,919
company

546
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:06,720
and

547
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,120
one one of the first the first result

548
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,400
that i got is that they had uh

549
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,559
open

550
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:15,919
sorry they had a

551
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,720
google bucket that was open

552
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,679
that i could list the files right

553
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,200
and

554
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,000
after that i took over the google bucket

555
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,039
and i had the google bucket had

556
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,200
all the information of all all the

557
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,120
clients so it was like

558
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,360
22 000

559
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,880
um

560
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,039
id cards

561
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,720
they scan

562
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,799
by both sides

563
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,799
and a lot of financial information from

564
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,039
clients so it's pretty bad

565
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,039
so they

566
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,280
they

567
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,919
they pay me for that bag around five

568
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,280
thousand dollars

569
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,840
which i couldn't believe it for

570
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,320
imagine i couldn't believe it for around

571
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,360
a week

572
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,039
and one of the things that i was worried

573
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,280
about is they they were gonna pay it or

574
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,200
not because a lot of companies that in

575
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,480
chile and in

576
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,080
in many countries

577
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,960
they don't know what bug bounty bounty

578
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,320
hunting is so they even if you hack them

579
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,600
or not hack them but if you find a bag

580
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,960
that is critical or that is really bad

581
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,840
they

582
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,360
won't give you anything they would just

583
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,080
say

584
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,840
tell you thank you

585
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,679
for your service

586
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:30,480
and

587
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,000
so i actually found three bucks and

588
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,480
the mo the biggest the bigger one there

589
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,919
was a p1 p1 i don't know if you know but

590
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,120
let me explain

591
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,039
there are

592
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,840
basically five levels of

593
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,600
severity on bugs

594
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,000
the the scale goes from p5 to p1

595
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,120
p5

596
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,679
it's something that doesn't have an

597
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,480
impact at all it might be informative or

598
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,200
let's say for example

599
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,919
the apache apache version

600
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,480
is displayed on the headers of the

601
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,720
server right that's something that

602
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,480
people might think some people might

603
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,880
think well it's a bit if i in the

604
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,520
version and i found a cve i can hack

605
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,440
your site well that's great but some

606
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,200
company they will say it's a pretty low

607
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,520
impact severity so they will they will

608
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,480
mark it as p5 so p5 usually they don't

609
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,200
pay a lot anything

610
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,400
and

611
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,640
from the to the top of that that scale

612
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,480
is p1 so

613
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,080
in this company found a p1 a p2 and a p3

614
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,880
so

615
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,240
one was 500 and the other one was 50

616
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,480
dollars so the sec the

617
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,400
p the other the second bag was uh

618
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,159
domain takeover

619
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,760
if you know if you don't know what i've

620
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,679
seen domain takeover it's

621
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:56,799
basically

622
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,960
you create a subdomain

623
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,520
let's say in the case of my my domain

624
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,520
infosec.co you create a subdomain let's

625
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,559
say no name no name con

626
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,840
and you point it to a github

627
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,080
repo or

628
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,360
usually a s3 bucket or a google bucket

629
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,000
and then you remove the bucket or

630
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,720
the

631
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,919
github account but you forgot to clean

632
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,760
the dns record

633
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,720
and

634
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,120
now it's pointing to an account that

635
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,240
doesn't stick so the attacker in my case

636
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:32,960
me

637
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,080
i created a github account and so now i

638
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,279
had the

639
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,320
the domain was mine

640
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,679
so that's that was 500 so imagine my

641
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,520
imagine how i felt at the time i was

642
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,279
like this is something

643
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,720
this is this is my thing this is

644
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,799
something that i probably should do it

645
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,880
imagine if i in one day i got 5 500

646
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,440
imagine if i do this for

647
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,039
longer well the thing is that

648
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,080
by far is the highest

649
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,919
bounty that i ever got

650
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,520
and

651
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,240
yeah so i decided to so yeah this is the

652
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,159
the website i i

653
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,000
i had to sign a

654
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,640
nda and all disclosure agreement so

655
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,279
i cannot tell you what side it is

656
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,799
but they included me on though on their

657
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,320
on their

658
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,440
hall of fame

659
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,120
and if you see there it was like one day

660
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,720
after the other because i like it

661
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,320
totally i didn't know what i was doing i

662
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,840
was just getting these results from this

663
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,679
tool and i would just test them and i'll

664
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,960
google evernote google and i will search

665
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,640
online how to

666
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,720
exploit them you know because you find

667
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,480
sometimes you find a bug

668
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,600
but you need to exploit it

669
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,919
to do something with it yeah for example

670
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,480
on google and subdomain takeovers some

671
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,880
people find that so the mine is

672
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,279
vulnerable but it's not possible to take

673
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,200
it over right

674
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,960
and let me show you something let me

675
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,480
show you something really quick really

676
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,520
quick

677
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,480
i actually did a subdomain takeover

678
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,080
yesterday

679
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,200
and

680
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,530
let me remember

681
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:15,840
[Music]

682
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,520
what it was

683
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,840
here somebody sent it to me

684
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,000
so

685
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,640
really quick

686
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,799
don't read don't read that one

687
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,440
so if you see this domain

688
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,679
it doesn't have anything but if

689
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,760
it's because some companies ask you not

690
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,600
to modify anything not just show

691
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,720
anything

692
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,919
so if you see here it says delete which

693
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,480
is my nickname so domain takeover so

694
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,240
this subdomain is controlled by me so

695
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,200
i could i could uh

696
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,480
i could

697
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,760
create a website with a fake

698
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,679
with a fake company name and and you

699
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,960
know people will log into it and

700
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,559
yeah so this is

701
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:08,960
an example that i actually did yesterday

702
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,399
and

703
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:13,520
i hope they will pay me

704
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,440
so like i was saying everything started

705
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,279
by accident i wasn't planning into

706
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,279
getting into bounty

707
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,440
so

708
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,440
why should this is like a street

709
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,279
credential so why should

710
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,440
you believe me

711
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,720
so in

712
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,799
what i've learned is that quantity

713
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,960
doesn't it's not important the amount of

714
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,960
bugs that you find what is important is

715
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,840
is

716
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,159
what you learn from those bugs so

717
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:41,919
there's a website that is called open

718
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,240
book bounding let me show it to you it

719
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,360
was

720
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,760
just an idiot yesterday and it's a site

721
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,399
that you can report

722
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:53,039
to any site like you can report whatever

723
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,200
you find

724
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,840
the thing is that

725
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,919
it's it's pretty bad the website a lot

726
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,640
of people started a lot of book monitors

727
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,799
a lot of bounty hunters started using

728
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,679
this site like before

729
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,840
hacker one was popular or

730
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,919
mainstream so the thing is that you need

731
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,080
to report

732
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,520
quantities

733
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,760
more than quality

734
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,279
so

735
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,919
even though i reported two thousand more

736
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,880
than two thousand

737
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,000
and more than 2 000

738
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,440
um

739
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,559
bugs if you see here in my statistics

740
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,679
so in one month i reported

741
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,720
1400 more than 1400

742
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,640
and actually some of them were if you

743
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,880
see here vip reports means that the

744
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,080
websites that have a lot of traffic

745
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,640
and so far i haven't got anything at all

746
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,799
not even a thank you from

747
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,159
the website that they they patched their

748
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:57,600
their issues

749
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,600
so the bad thing about

750
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,480
it's it's this website is pretty weird

751
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,279
because you can only report like

752
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,960
five types

753
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,640
five type of bugs and and

754
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,919
and yeah so it's quantity over quality

755
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,480
and i wouldn't recommend you to use it

756
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,799
it's interesting that you can read

757
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,640
like other

758
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,880
like you can read

759
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,039
like this disclosed

760
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,360
box so you can learn but only five types

761
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,679
of bugs

762
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:30,880
okay so

763
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,320
yes i was just mentioning that

764
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,679
so to be honest i lost count of

765
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,080
how many bucks that i found because like

766
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,760
i told you

767
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,600
some bugs will be

768
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,039
paid in one platform like integrity and

769
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,720
the same bug

770
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,640
for another company they will not give

771
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,200
you anything so that what i was saying

772
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,360
a lot of people are getting angry with

773
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,800
hacker one because they

774
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,159
[Music]

775
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:01,840
they

776
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,480
make it really hard for you to

777
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,360
have

778
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,480
proper bugs like like accepted bugs

779
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,600
and so in my example i i report some

780
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,440
type of bugs

781
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,559
in integrity and i get they get accepted

782
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,679
or they get paid and not a lot of money

783
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,840
but 300 euros

784
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,480
500 euros and the same bags in other

785
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,399
sites like book crowd or hacking one

786
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,039
they just get rejected

787
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,039
which is very strange right because the

788
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:33,039
bugs are bad and

789
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,039
so

790
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,320
like we're saying that 95 of my bugs are

791
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,240
coming from nuclei

792
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,960
but i

793
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,279
i will show you later why why it's not

794
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,000
that simple so i i've been in

795
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,399
i mean already in a lot of hall of fames

796
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,559
which is a

797
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:56,080
demonstration of you working for free

798
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,000
especially companies like t-mobile and

799
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,200
phillips that

800
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,880
they have a lot of money phillips is one

801
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,279
of the biggest companies in the world

802
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:06,720
and i discovered two bugs one bag was

803
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,960
pretty bad they had

804
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,120
in many many hospitals they had

805
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,120
installed um

806
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,640
imaging system uh what's called a pax

807
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,600
with default passwords and and i

808
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,760
actually

809
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,080
took cover

810
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,960
around pretty i had access to around a

811
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,399
million

812
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:29,760
exams

813
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,760
so because this was on the on the press

814
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,640
in chile because because i

815
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,519
i could access

816
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,399
exams from politicians

817
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,720
relatives of the president the

818
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,919
party

819
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,080
party leaders

820
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,360
and

821
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,200
and philip just

822
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,039
tell me told me thank you we're gonna

823
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:53,360
add you to the hall of fame and from now

824
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,960
on you're gonna be

825
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,279
really important and you're gonna have

826
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,600
the best jobs because where you are you

827
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,840
know in our hall of fame

828
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,120
so

829
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,200
that's a lesson that i learned all the

830
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,360
things are

831
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,600
important only if you like a beginner if

832
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,000
you like first month

833
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,760
i don't think anyone is going to hire

834
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,760
you just because you're in your or

835
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,080
you're in a hall of fame but companies

836
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,080
will make you believe that this is very

837
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,159
important and this

838
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,799
this is like a game changer it's gonna

839
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,480
change your life and

840
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,320
to be honest it's

841
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,640
just um

842
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,440
it's just a proof that you work for free

843
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,600
at some point in your life

844
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,640
so i have many hall of fames that i

845
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,760
don't keep track of and

846
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,519
so the what why do they have hall of

847
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,159
fame it's just a way of paying you right

848
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:47,440
they don't give you money they don't

849
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,039
give you

850
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,880
anything else they just

851
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,960
put you in a website let me show you one

852
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,320
let me show you this one i don't know if

853
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,159
i'm still here because i asked them to

854
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,440
remove me

855
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,000
because they were asking me to remove

856
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,960
content or

857
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,679
i'm still there

858
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,360
they were asking me to remove content

859
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,719
they were telling me that i was this

860
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:12,000
partner that i needed to you know like

861
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,280
work with them but for free

862
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,199
yeah it's funny it's funny it's not that

863
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,839
funny when you need money

864
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:23,040
but so let's continue so

865
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,199
this is probably

866
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,399
the

867
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,960
most important lessons lesson that i

868
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,560
that i think i learned that i can give

869
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,800
it to you is that finding bugs is easy

870
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,599
like

871
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,520
and on internet

872
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,879
you could literally find thousands of

873
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:41,918
bugs

874
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:43,119
in one day

875
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,199
you could use showdown you could use

876
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,520
google docking you could use

877
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,679
many tools but i

878
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,320
guarantee you that you're gonna find

879
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,399
hundreds of bugs

880
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:56,480
especially from government institutions

881
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,720
i haven't checked ukrainian ukrainian

882
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,240
governments but you know ukraine is

883
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,040
famous but because of this hack of the

884
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,800
electrical grid

885
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,440
so governments usually are the weakest

886
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,680
points because they don't have people

887
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,599
they don't have budgets

888
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:14,839
or they just don't care about security

889
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:17,040
so the

890
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,079
the difficult part is to get paid the

891
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,079
difficult part is to get

892
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,359
something

893
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:24,560
out of

894
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,440
the box right so

895
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,400
um

896
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,839
in my case i

897
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,200
i wouldn't

898
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,920
if i if i divide

899
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,359
all my

900
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:39,680
bounties all my income all the income

901
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,320
that i've done in one year

902
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,520
my it will be a salary that it would be

903
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,560
the fifth

904
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,520
or probably a sixth part of what a

905
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,680
salary here in chile

906
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,079
it's for somebody that study what they

907
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,079
study or that the experience that they

908
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:58,400
have so it's uh it's

909
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,480
not enough to

910
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,680
like having it as a full-time job

911
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,200
a lot of people that do it as a

912
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,960
full-time job they they've been doing it

913
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,440
for five

914
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,440
yeah i would say three to five seven

915
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,800
years

916
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,160
and and in chile the top

917
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,200
the top hunters they had

918
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,440
much more experience than me i have i

919
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,280
only doing for a year

920
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,200
and like i said i've been doing i've

921
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,640
been working in cyber security for

922
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,800
three years so

923
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,240
not

924
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,598
so not a lot of time

925
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:36,960
so

926
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,160
in chile

927
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,760
thanks is the main currency they will

928
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,680
pay you with thanks even though like i

929
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,400
told you before even even big companies

930
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,800
do not know what bubanti

931
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,720
monty hunting is so

932
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,079
they will

933
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:53,359
like not understand that you want to get

934
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:55,200
paid for something that

935
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,480
in a program will be a lot of money so

936
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,680
i've hacked

937
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,760
many companies and

938
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,680
and the only thing that i have that i

939
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,280
get is that they will

940
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,320
they will

941
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,560
make you believe that they can hire you

942
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,320
as a as a company because i have a

943
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,040
company right i own a company

944
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,040
so they will make you believe that at

945
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,119
some point they're gonna hire you for

946
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,320
services

947
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,000
so they will like keep telling you that

948
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,520
you're about to be

949
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,280
done you're about to be hired you're

950
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,119
about to be the contractors being

951
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,760
prepared so that happened to me probably

952
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,359
if at some point if you're alive you're

953
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,280
facing this situation

954
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,119
if they don't hire you or they don't pay

955
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,079
you like in the first week it's not

956
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,200
going to happen so that's less on there

957
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,599
i don't waste my time anymore so let me

958
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:44,720
show you

959
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,280
probably you're looking you're interest

960
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,839
interested

961
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:52,240
about real bugs right so

962
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,200
let me show you this bug

963
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,760
and probably you could load it on your

964
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,359
computers because

965
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:00,880
here

966
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:05,200
it doesn't look very well

967
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,200
so okay so if you look at my screen let

968
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,359
me increase the resolution a bit

969
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,520
so

970
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,760
so okay let's let's start from the

971
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,400
beginning so on the on the left side

972
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,880
it's a website it's a chilean company

973
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,200
it's like it's like i don't have a

974
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,280
reference from ukraine but

975
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,320
it's like

976
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,240
like ups or fedex in the us

977
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,560
they will they will

978
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,240
they do transportation and okay so yeah

979
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,800
and on the right side here on the right

980
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,560
side it's burp

981
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,160
i don't know if you know burp but it

982
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,320
burp is one of the most

983
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,880
is probably the most used tool

984
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,280
regarding cyber security or pen testing

985
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,119
or blue body handling

986
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,240
so

987
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,480
on the left side what i

988
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,599
what i'm looking for here it's a

989
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,000
an id number here on the dub

990
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,320
i'm looking for a id number of a company

991
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,839
a big company in chile's retail

992
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,920
companies called falavela

993
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,440
because i wanted to test something that

994
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,680
i found that it was really strange of

995
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,240
this website and in this website

996
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,280
i'm a client so because i have a company

997
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,480
i have

998
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,720
i own a company i have an account of

999
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,960
this website

1000
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,800
so something that was really weird is

1001
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,079
that when i when i when i include the id

1002
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,079
number of my company

1003
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,400
the usernames will appear in this combo

1004
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,680
box here

1005
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,320
right so let's go let me show you so

1006
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,839
we'll use the id number like it's uh

1007
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:39,599
every company and every person have an

1008
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:40,720
id number

1009
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,640
in chile so

1010
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,560
once i click that you will see on the

1011
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,560
right side that a request was made

1012
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,440
so but basically with barb what you do

1013
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,280
is that you can intercept

1014
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,119
the request and responses from the

1015
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:56,480
website

1016
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,880
get requests and post requests in this

1017
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,800
case was a post request

1018
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,520
so if you see it here

1019
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,480
so i

1020
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,280
use a client number

1021
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,680
and the response

1022
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,960
strangely

1023
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,599
show me 27 username

1024
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:16,240
usernames which is really strange right

1025
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,400
you you should be asked for a username

1026
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,440
like every

1027
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,640
99 of the websites do that right so from

1028
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,119
there i clicked on

1029
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:28,480
recover password

1030
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,520
and

1031
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,720
once you

1032
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,480
receive the response of the recovery

1033
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,040
password if you see here on the right

1034
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,599
side i already had what what the

1035
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,040
response was

1036
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,960
was the user

1037
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,640
name full name

1038
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,760
id number and password

1039
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,280
so

1040
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,599
so just like that i i now have the

1041
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,960
password of the one of the users of this

1042
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,520
company which which is a it's a one it's

1043
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,240
a big company it's like present in five

1044
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,640
or six countries in south america

1045
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,920
so i just could log in

1046
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,040
just like that i'm gonna fast forward it

1047
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,640
a little bit i mean i'm gonna increase

1048
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,440
the speed of the video because from here

1049
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,440
it gets really slow and it was because

1050
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,560
of the i don't know if it was the

1051
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,359
website or it was the burp

1052
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:19,839
but what it will do it just looking as

1053
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:21,839
the user and

1054
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:25,040
since this portal is b2b business

1055
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,079
business

1056
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:27,680
you can buy

1057
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,240
and pay later yeah all right so

1058
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,160
i one of the things that you start

1059
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,599
learning is that you need to prove

1060
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,359
impact you need to prove

1061
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,520
what's the worst thing that i could do

1062
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,800
with this bug

1063
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,040
so i decided to buy boxes you know they

1064
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,839
have boxes because of they

1065
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:45,520
they

1066
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,839
do a lot of shipping so a company will

1067
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:51,359
buy boxes to cheap products so

1068
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,920
so i did it i wanted to buy boxes for i

1069
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,280
don't remember the

1070
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,079
amount but probably was like

1071
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,240
twenty thousand dollars

1072
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,599
yeah twenty thousand dollars so i could

1073
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,599
actually i'm gonna fall forward a bit

1074
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:07,280
because in this part it was really slow

1075
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,040
i don't know what

1076
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,440
so yeah seventeen million it's a pretty

1077
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,240
much like thirty thousand dollars

1078
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,880
so i could i could i didn't go to the

1079
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,800
end i was just about to finish it but i

1080
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,480
didn't because otherwise you might get

1081
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,520
in trouble

1082
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,720
legally so yeah so

1083
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,960
a lot of people get really impressed of

1084
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,280
how easy it was to find a bag so one of

1085
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,000
the lessons that i that i

1086
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,440
learned one of the things that i learned

1087
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,839
from this bag is that you should check

1088
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:38,240
for everything everywhere it doesn't

1089
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,079
matter if the company is small or this

1090
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:43,200
big or how they have

1091
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,359
they said when i reported it they said

1092
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:46,720
they had a

1093
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,920
uh read red teaming for i don't know how

1094
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,280
long that

1095
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,280
they didn't know they couldn't imagine

1096
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,520
what happened they were so strange but

1097
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,040
in my experience

1098
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,119
is not that strange a lot of companies

1099
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:00,160
had

1100
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,359
a comp uh have another companies that do

1101
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:05,760
pen testing but they don't do

1102
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,440
book bounty hunting and when you do pen

1103
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,720
testing

1104
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,280
the company doesn't have an incentive

1105
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,680
to get every bag you know to test

1106
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,960
everything

1107
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,760
and when you are from the book bound

1108
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,119
book bounty

1109
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,920
hunting perspective you want to get

1110
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,280
everything it doesn't matter if it's

1111
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,680
small it's big if you come find three

1112
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,000
that are small and one that is medium

1113
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,680
and one is big this is great and you're

1114
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,680
gonna keep looking after you

1115
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,440
you won't find anything

1116
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,280
when you're doing pen testing some

1117
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,520
companies will find happen to me doing a

1118
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,119
pen test

1119
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:42,640
i found a really bad bag like a p1 and

1120
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,200
after that it just slowly slowed the

1121
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,760
rhythm you know like you already proved

1122
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,119
big impact

1123
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,200
why are you gonna spend more time and

1124
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,040
you don't have a lot of time

1125
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,400
why are you gonna spend more time

1126
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,560
finding bugs that are not as critical

1127
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,240
right

1128
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,599
so let me so uh after that bug i

1129
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:04,079
reported it and for over a year

1130
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:05,520
they

1131
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,800
told me that

1132
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,480
i will be hired as a contractor or as a

1133
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,520
company

1134
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,400
and

1135
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,200
and if you and if you think about it the

1136
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,599
bug was really about actually it's on my

1137
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:19,359
medium i had a medium

1138
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:22,880
that i will post the thing so i i posted

1139
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,960
it they never pay me anything they

1140
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,119
didn't do anything

1141
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:29,760
just like uh made me believe that i will

1142
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,280
get something so let me show you another

1143
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,119
one

1144
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,240
so if i you have any questions please

1145
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,920
ask them

1146
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:38,720
so

1147
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,000
this is

1148
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,800
this is a phillips this is a phillips

1149
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,560
software

1150
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,000
i don't know if you can see it let me

1151
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,520
increase the

1152
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,960
resolution

1153
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,960
to have a more clear image so the rest

1154
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,640
on the right side

1155
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,560
is actually the version of care stream

1156
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,520
health

1157
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:56,319
and

1158
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:59,280
care stream was bought by phillips like

1159
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,720
two years ago i don't remember how long

1160
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:07,118
so so yeah so what i did is that

1161
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,040
data is default passwords that you can

1162
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,079
easily find and then you got

1163
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:17,520
access admin access to

1164
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,560
thousands

1165
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,079
of exams

1166
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:23,200
and actually there are

1167
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,920
x-rays or

1168
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,720
another kind of images

1169
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,560
so

1170
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,920
those bugs they were very easy to find

1171
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,160
they were critical

1172
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,720
but i never get paid anything

1173
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,079
out of them

1174
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:41,920
well actually this company

1175
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,280
it's not it's not fair to say

1176
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,079
they they actually give me this thank

1177
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,560
you letter oh wait they did something

1178
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,319
they actually sent me

1179
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:56,000
like i don't remember when but like

1180
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,560
like february of this year

1181
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,920
they sent me this letter to thank me

1182
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,119
for

1183
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:06,319
worrying about security of their company

1184
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:08,560
and what i did is that

1185
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,680
i actually had access to over 80 80 000

1186
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,440
exams

1187
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,560
and

1188
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,800
after

1189
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,200
nothing had really happened they

1190
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,560
this company and another one had the

1191
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,119
same problem the companies are clinics

1192
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:24,720
so i did a

1193
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:25,920
um

1194
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,760
research

1195
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,800
like uh i licked this data

1196
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,640
not really leaked but i

1197
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:33,760
conducted

1198
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,560
some journalists because i i thought

1199
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,040
that people should know that their exams

1200
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,000
were

1201
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:40,800
like

1202
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,280
vulnerable they were exposed

1203
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,440
one of the companies took

1204
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,480
took over three weeks to fix it

1205
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,520
but yeah

1206
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,520
um

1207
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,920
so it's difficult to get

1208
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,400
to get money so so very interesting but

1209
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,560
a lot of people are asking

1210
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,119
how can i become a millionaire and fast

1211
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:04,880
how can i like

1212
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:08,400
what can i do that will lead me to be on

1213
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,280
top

1214
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,520
of the hunters or

1215
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,480
how can i get cash fast

1216
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,720
so first we need to understand

1217
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,280
and i hate definitions

1218
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,119
but i all but

1219
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:22,079
it's

1220
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:24,000
ironic because i hate definitions but at

1221
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,920
the same time i always put them because

1222
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,760
i hate them and i hate them because

1223
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,040
they're

1224
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,000
they're different in the computer field

1225
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,520
and in the technological field

1226
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,000
definitions usually

1227
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,520
mutate they they have a meaning in some

1228
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,400
point

1229
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,960
and after some point they changed

1230
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,000
so

1231
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,480
if you think about the word bug we use

1232
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,440
bug

1233
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,240
when we actually are security bugs

1234
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,400
and security bugs

1235
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,400
are bad because they introduce security

1236
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,079
vulnerabilities

1237
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:00,319
and vulnerabilities are weaknesses

1238
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:02,559
that can be exploited by the threat

1239
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:05,440
actor or

1240
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,119
but by a thread after these are the

1241
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:09,040
definitions but

1242
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,880
even though

1243
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,599
you sometimes find valid bugs

1244
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,240
companies will tell you that they're not

1245
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,559
valid banks they're like

1246
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:22,000
they're so this is why i i use the

1247
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,920
definitions because at some point when

1248
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,440
you start working

1249
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,640
on the field

1250
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,640
you end up

1251
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,839
changing your meaning of values so

1252
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:33,680
at some point when you're like doing

1253
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,000
robotic hunting you start work thinking

1254
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:36,880
about

1255
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,520
bugs with impact right

1256
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,599
box that will

1257
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:43,680
give you something and

1258
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,920
some some companies even

1259
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,640
they give you points for p2 p3 p4 and p5

1260
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,079
bucks and they will pay you for a p1

1261
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:57,359
so you you say why why i mean why the

1262
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:59,920
p21 p1 what's the difference why are you

1263
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,319
paying and at some point some companies

1264
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:05,520
they just like arbitrated they do an

1265
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,000
arbitrary assumption that

1266
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,319
they manage their risk

1267
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,720
you know like okay if i have

1268
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,359
this kind of bad i have enough insurance

1269
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:16,960
so i have enough

1270
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,280
measures that nothing else will happen

1271
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,440
so

1272
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,680
when we talk about banks we're talking

1273
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,359
about security packs right because

1274
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:27,440
they're different type of

1275
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,520
bugs

1276
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,440
so

1277
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,520
what is really book bounty hunting

1278
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,400
and bubba tiante needs can be described

1279
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,599
as finding bugs in internet like i was

1280
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:42,559
doing with open book bounty i was fine i

1281
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:44,640
was trying to find bugs everywhere

1282
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,400
why

1283
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,160
because you learned that that way you

1284
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,920
learn you learn

1285
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,559
what kind of bikes to find how do they

1286
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:53,839
work

1287
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:55,040
why

1288
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:58,640
do they do why why they exist and how to

1289
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,720
exploit them right but then you start

1290
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,480
realizing that there are private

1291
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,680
programs

1292
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:07,359
that might have that might pay you

1293
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:10,160
and you will also find public programs

1294
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,559
so what's the difference the difference

1295
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:15,520
is that public programs they

1296
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,240
they of course have more people

1297
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,319
looking at them like

1298
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,000
and if you

1299
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,559
if again in private programs sometimes

1300
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:27,680
you need to get an invitation

1301
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,920
or sometimes they have a secret email

1302
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,400
that you need to send them like

1303
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,319
a security at company.com

1304
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:37,599
and they will

1305
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:39,040
tell you

1306
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,960
the detail of the program so a program

1307
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,280
is basically what a definition of a

1308
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,400
company

1309
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,200
regarding their bubonic the bounty

1310
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,240
program

1311
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,880
they will say

1312
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,119
the scope there was i'm going to talk

1313
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:56,240
about scope later so

1314
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:58,400
and

1315
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,720
and there are also bug pony book bounty

1316
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,760
hunting sites there are basically

1317
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,680
the open bounty like i told you before

1318
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:09,280
hacker one which is not recommended for

1319
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,800
people getting into the field because

1320
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,720
they're really hard it took me it took

1321
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,480
me

1322
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,319
six months

1323
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:17,520
to get

1324
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,880
my first bug accepted in happy one was

1325
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,960
in february this year

1326
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,880
it took me

1327
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,040
five to six months

1328
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,480
to

1329
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,440
get up an accepted vibe in hacker one

1330
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,839
book crowd is the middle ground but now

1331
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:35,520
they're like

1332
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,760
they're not giving so

1333
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:38,960
a lot of programs that will give you

1334
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,480
points

1335
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,520
and

1336
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:44,079
the more points you have

1337
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:46,640
the more private invitations you get for

1338
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,440
not like like to private secret

1339
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,520
programs right but bruce crowd changed

1340
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,400
that

1341
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,319
they don't give you points anymore so i

1342
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:57,200
i stopped i stopped hunting for problems

1343
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,319
with points only

1344
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:02,559
and integrity is the one that we're

1345
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:05,839
gonna use today and

1346
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:07,359
it's

1347
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:10,800
the best in my opinion is the

1348
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,119
they really

1349
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:15,520
do not

1350
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,040
[ __ ] you

1351
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,480
sorry for the word but

1352
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,880
they do not they just pay you right away

1353
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:21,920
they

1354
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,079
if they fight if you find a bag the bag

1355
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:26,640
is the bag that's it you get the points

1356
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,480
or you get paid and

1357
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,000
no

1358
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,880
no more drama and in book crowd and

1359
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,319
hacker one

1360
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:37,119
man i've just i found so many bugs they

1361
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:38,559
which is like

1362
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:40,960
no because of this no because of that

1363
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,040
now i accepted because

1364
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,119
whatever reason we actually i was

1365
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:47,119
talking with a guy yesterday because he

1366
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:49,280
saw in hacker one

1367
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,960
because he discovered that many

1368
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,400
companies were

1369
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,640
rejecting their bugs

1370
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,720
but they were fixing them and they were

1371
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,280
using the information he provided

1372
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,720
to

1373
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:03,839
to like the the

1374
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:05,760
developing process

1375
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,880
so this guy discovered that opera

1376
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,720
opera and

1377
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,160
verizon

1378
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:15,280
had been like rejecting their bugs but

1379
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,520
they were using them to fix the the

1380
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,520
tools or the software

1381
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,839
which is pretty bad

1382
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:24,160
so he got banned but we were just

1383
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,240
kissing we were talking about it last

1384
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,200
night when i was checking preparing this

1385
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,920
workshop and i actually discovered that

1386
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,200
i had like

1387
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,000
25 or 30 but there were

1388
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,720
proper bags that were just discarded by

1389
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,079
i don't know like

1390
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:42,640
not available or informational

1391
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,160
and yeah so

1392
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,559
probably at some point i'm gonna

1393
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:49,119
put them on if i publish them i might

1394
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:51,280
get banned

1395
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,680
so another sites are smaller that you

1396
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:56,240
might have better luck one is called

1397
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,000
just we hack

1398
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,240
and the other ones are i don't remember

1399
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,800
the names but if you google them

1400
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,920
so i will suggest you like starting from

1401
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,920
integrity

1402
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,040
and

1403
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:11,839
so one of the other this

1404
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:12,640
the

1405
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,520
weird things that i discovered is that

1406
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,119
sometimes

1407
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:19,520
you will google

1408
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,839
for a book bounty for a program on a

1409
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:23,119
company

1410
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:25,359
and they will have a report email like

1411
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:28,079
report at company.com

1412
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:29,839
and automatically you will get an

1413
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:32,880
invitation to hacker one of book crowd

1414
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:33,760
and

1415
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,319
it was like but but why it's not public

1416
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:37,200
i mean

1417
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:40,160
i just need to send an email

1418
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,920
uh so yeah

1419
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,319
i was talking about public and

1420
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:46,240
it's a slide i'm talking about private

1421
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,160
so like i told you before

1422
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:51,040
in in in hacker one in brook crowd one

1423
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,680
in nativity as well they wanna

1424
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,440
have hackers with more experience

1425
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,200
because hackers with life experience

1426
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,839
will report things that are not

1427
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:02,640
worthy they will report

1428
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:06,720
i don't know the output of and map

1429
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:07,839
with the

1430
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:10,160
ports right which is one of the worst

1431
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,760
things that you could do

1432
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:12,720
and

1433
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:13,920
yeah so

1434
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,520
so i

1435
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:19,680
i don't know how better is to have

1436
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,559
private in my case the way that i work

1437
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:24,960
because in hacker one i have like 100

1438
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,640
120

1439
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,640
and some of them are just like pretty

1440
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:31,119
small programs like they have two assets

1441
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:32,319
they have

1442
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:35,040
one domain there are two domains or they

1443
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,280
have a lot of rules they have you have

1444
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,520
to connect with a vpn and with some

1445
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:42,000
credentials and it's complicated you

1446
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:42,960
know i

1447
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,040
i do more spray

1448
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:47,280
and pray i just like hit

1449
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,640
thousands of of uh urls

1450
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:51,440
and

1451
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,160
and

1452
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,559
a lot of people say oh but that doesn't

1453
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:57,440
work i've been doing it for nine months

1454
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,559
and so far i've never run the scan

1455
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:02,559
without finding a valid bug that i could

1456
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,960
report

1457
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:06,079
and

1458
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:07,040
this is

1459
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,119
also an important part

1460
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:12,400
what you could find what is easier

1461
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,079
to find

1462
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,359
bugs

1463
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:18,079
are programs that are self-hosted that

1464
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:21,200
for example they have your like like

1465
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,040
facebook they have their own program

1466
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,400
they have their own

1467
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,400
thing google as well they don't use

1468
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,400
hacker one or book crowd

1469
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,079
and but the smaller companies do the

1470
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:31,680
same and

1471
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,040
it's better

1472
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:36,400
for uh from the hunter's perspective

1473
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,960
because they have less rules you know in

1474
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,880
in some programs

1475
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,520
on hacker one they will have

1476
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,960
let me show you let me show you better

1477
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,960
let me show you better what i mean by

1478
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,960
that

1479
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,480
so for example

1480
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,280
i hope i'm not showing you anything

1481
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,280
right but

1482
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,000
it's a bit slow so

1483
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,839
what i think of what i'm talking about

1484
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:04,400
is that for example this program

1485
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,240
key bank

1486
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:07,440
they will have

1487
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,559
a set of

1488
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:09,839
rules

1489
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:13,760
so they will have for example

1490
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,040
they will have

1491
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,760
bugs vulnerabilities

1492
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,079
that you cannot report

1493
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:21,839
that they don't care about they don't

1494
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:24,559
care that you could use

1495
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:25,359
a

1496
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:27,440
username harvesting or information

1497
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,599
disclosure through errors

1498
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:31,599
or

1499
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:34,960
even self-access some companies

1500
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,000
would even

1501
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,400
include here things that are like pretty

1502
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,480
bad like is crosstalk scripting or

1503
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:43,599
or

1504
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:46,400
open relax or things like that so the

1505
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,680
good thing about

1506
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:50,240
self-hosted programs

1507
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:52,799
is that

1508
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,040
they don't have rules

1509
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,119
they don't have

1510
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:00,319
they don't have rules and in that sense

1511
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:02,480
it's easier to report you have more

1512
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,000
chances of

1513
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,240
feeling a valid report

1514
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,079
and

1515
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:10,960
finally a lot of programs do have do not

1516
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,000
have a

1517
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,440
ba pro

1518
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,440
sorry a lot of companies do not have a

1519
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:16,720
program

1520
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:19,040
but they will they will agree that it's

1521
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:22,640
bad and they will give you things like

1522
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:25,680
amazon gift cards or

1523
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:26,720
swag

1524
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,079
or

1525
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:29,680
i've gotten

1526
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:32,559
i've gotten paid i've got bounties from

1527
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:34,640
companies that don't don't have a

1528
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:37,520
program that but you just reach to them

1529
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,200
you know you send that an email i found

1530
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,839
this bug what you think about it

1531
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:44,000
and yeah if you're lucky you're gonna

1532
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,160
get paid

1533
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,799
so what do programs usually

1534
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:50,880
define they will define

1535
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,839
what's in scope they will say how many

1536
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:55,359
domains or

1537
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:58,559
sub domains they want you to

1538
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:01,119
attacked but

1539
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:06,799
but some sites some companies will say

1540
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:08,559
we will check

1541
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:11,760
for things that are out of school and

1542
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,880
in my case i've been paid

1543
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,480
several bucks that they were out of

1544
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:19,200
scope but they were bad enough

1545
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,520
to be fixed

1546
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:24,880
so sometimes you need to read the small

1547
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,720
that you need to read the descriptions

1548
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:29,040
of the programs what you can do and it

1549
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,319
takes time

1550
00:59:30,319 --> 00:59:33,839
it takes a lot of time to do it actually

1551
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:36,799
so the progress will define what kind of

1552
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:40,240
things they will give to you swag points

1553
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,720
services pay you

1554
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,559
so american airlines for example they

1555
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:47,760
will give you miles

1556
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,920
and

1557
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,599
sometimes it's funny because sometimes

1558
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:53,599
you know they will sit put things out of

1559
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:54,960
scope that

1560
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,559
if you scan them you will know why

1561
00:59:56,559 --> 01:00:00,319
they're stopping like full of bags or

1562
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:02,960
they don't work properly

1563
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:05,119
so

1564
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:07,119
the important part

1565
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:08,079
the

1566
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:09,440
most important

1567
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,319
part of

1568
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:12,880
this world i will say it's

1569
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,200
people will fight nor fight but they

1570
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,559
will

1571
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:18,799
people will say that automatic scanning

1572
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:20,880
it's better people will say that man on

1573
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,520
hunting is better

1574
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,359
but i will tell you that

1575
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:27,440
you can mix both of them you can

1576
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,040
actually

1577
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:31,040
start doing something manual and then

1578
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,440
automatic and with nuclei that's very

1579
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:37,599
simple and i will show you why or how

1580
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:39,359
if you use automatic scanners with the

1581
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:41,520
default configuration probably you won't

1582
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:42,640
fight you're gonna get a lot of

1583
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,559
duplicates right high chance of

1584
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:46,000
duplicates

1585
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,319
so duplicate it is when somebody

1586
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:50,799
reported somebody reports a bug

1587
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:52,480
and then somebody else report the same

1588
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:56,160
bug your remark as duplicated in some

1589
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:59,760
sites you will get points anyway

1590
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,079
and well if you use an automatic scanner

1591
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:04,400
you need to be fast you need to like

1592
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,760
scan a lot and report fast and so you do

1593
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:11,839
that automating your steps

1594
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,040
in

1595
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:16,160
in manual hunting well a lot of people

1596
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,359
do

1597
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:18,240
use

1598
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:21,280
burp as a like manual testing so you

1599
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:22,400
could

1600
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:26,079
and embark you can use a lot of

1601
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:27,920
extensions to

1602
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,359
improve your

1603
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:31,440
chances of finding a bug

1604
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,760
and mana hunting is like a like what i

1605
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:36,160
showed you before on these videos

1606
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:38,079
it's like well let's test

1607
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:40,240
functionalities let's do it let's check

1608
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:41,680
what happens

1609
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:44,720
and in these cases manual hunting takes

1610
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:46,480
longer it's more

1611
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,880
tiring but you get the chances of

1612
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:52,480
getting duplicated right

1613
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:53,520
so i don't know if you have any

1614
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:54,640
questions

1615
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:57,760
so far i don't know if you're there

1616
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:00,079
if you're alive

1617
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:01,280
let me

1618
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:02,640
yeah

1619
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,880
anton said something we should connect

1620
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:07,760
the vmb ssh yes you should connect yeah

1621
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,640
i will show you later

1622
01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:14,400
i think yeah it's it's because of the

1623
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,319
yeah the interface the graphic interface

1624
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:17,839
makes a lot of problems with different

1625
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:19,680
configurations

1626
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:22,319
so with comebacks i don't know

1627
01:02:22,319 --> 01:02:25,520
what she's referring to

1628
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:29,038
nova porsche what is that

1629
01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:32,400
they are are they changed the default

1630
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,319
accounts what what accounts what are we

1631
01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:36,160
talking about

1632
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,039
ah

1633
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:38,799
the ones from the

1634
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:41,200
clinics

1635
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,039
or which ones i don't know what you're

1636
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:46,520
asking me about

1637
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,200
okay

1638
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,720
yes

1639
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:51,680
uh

1640
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:52,720
probably

1641
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:54,799
yeah probably i mean

1642
01:02:54,799 --> 01:02:57,680
the the thing is that since this is a

1643
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:59,359
system that is

1644
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:02,319
used in many hospitals in the world i

1645
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:04,160
found

1646
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,640
20 or 25

1647
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,640
and they were using

1648
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,960
different mixed of default passwords but

1649
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,680
they already i already reported them so

1650
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:16,640
if the company doesn't make anything

1651
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,400
what can i do

1652
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,000
it's not easy one of the things that i

1653
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,480
learned is not easy to report

1654
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:25,599
some companies will not have an email

1655
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:28,000
or they will not reply an email i just

1656
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:28,960
hacked

1657
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:31,599
recently a big company called liberty

1658
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:33,440
moodle

1659
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:35,359
liberty mutual

1660
01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:38,160
and so far i haven't

1661
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:41,119
found a way to send the reports

1662
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:42,960
and it's one of the biggest companies in

1663
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,880
the us

1664
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:47,119
and

1665
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:49,200
and yeah it's reporting is difficult

1666
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,200
it's stressful it's tiring because

1667
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:52,640
sometimes you

1668
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:55,280
are not going to get anything in return

1669
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,200
you might get into trouble like like in

1670
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,039
my case

1671
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:02,079
i am officially banned of working in the

1672
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:03,520
government

1673
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:06,079
it's been two times that i'm actually

1674
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:09,039
yesterday i was about to start

1675
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:11,520
being a consultant on

1676
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,760
ministry of transportation because of

1677
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,839
the they're building the new license

1678
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:17,920
card it's digital

1679
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,000
and i had interviews with them for three

1680
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,119
months

1681
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:22,799
and i worked with them for a while they

1682
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:25,520
were sure that i was gonna get hired

1683
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:27,599
i talked to the manager to the manager

1684
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:29,680
of the manager they were very happy to

1685
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:32,000
help me you know because of people

1686
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,760
i told them about death coming they're

1687
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:36,160
just like wow that's amazing when you

1688
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:38,240
went to china

1689
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:39,359
and

1690
01:04:39,359 --> 01:04:41,839
the final moment the final day they told

1691
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:43,599
me that from

1692
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:46,000
some government part they

1693
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,839
they rejected my hiring it's the second

1694
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:49,839
time that happens so that's one of the

1695
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:52,240
risks that

1696
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:54,160
people in some countries they don't

1697
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:56,000
understand that you do things because

1698
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,160
you want things to get improved

1699
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:00,160
they and in some countries they don't

1700
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:02,319
understand cyber security

1701
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:04,400
so they they will they will

1702
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,760
they will

1703
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:06,559
think

1704
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:09,760
that hackers are criminals they will

1705
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:12,319
think that if you hack aside or you

1706
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:14,319
prove that you could you could hack it

1707
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:16,960
you're as criminal as somebody that

1708
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:18,160
installed a run somewhere in the

1709
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:19,440
hospital they don't they don't

1710
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:21,359
understand the differences

1711
01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:23,920
they don't understand ethical hacking

1712
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,119
so

1713
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:27,520
in my case what i showed you before that

1714
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:28,319
i

1715
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:30,079
that i leaked something to the press it

1716
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:33,440
was before because during one year

1717
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,280
they didn't fix

1718
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:39,760
a problem with the network that allowed

1719
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,240
anyone inside a network a huge network

1720
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:45,280
like a national wide network with 150

1721
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,280
000 devices anyone inside this network

1722
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,839
could could find

1723
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:52,319
patient records of millions of people

1724
01:05:52,319 --> 01:05:55,039
actually i found four million documents

1725
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:56,559
i would scan the network and i found

1726
01:05:56,559 --> 01:05:58,640
this can you over in a year nobody pay

1727
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,799
attention nobody did anything just just

1728
01:06:00,799 --> 01:06:03,440
just laugh at me you know like

1729
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:04,880
some one of the

1730
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:07,440
strangest things is that

1731
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:08,720
sometimes

1732
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:11,520
people do not understand the bugs

1733
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:13,359
even in hacker one or book crowd they

1734
01:06:13,359 --> 01:06:14,480
don't

1735
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,240
they don't really understand knowing not

1736
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:18,400
everybody but happened to me a few cases

1737
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:19,440
that they

1738
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:22,000
didn't understand what i was doing

1739
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,160
but in companies even if big companies

1740
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:26,799
in chile or in the us or other countries

1741
01:06:26,799 --> 01:06:28,799
they don't really understand the bug

1742
01:06:28,799 --> 01:06:30,240
because they don't know what could

1743
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:31,200
happen

1744
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:32,720
so

1745
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:35,200
the challenge is the challenge for

1746
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,440
us for or for

1747
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:40,559
you as a researcher or a hunter or a

1748
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:42,079
hacker

1749
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:45,599
is to show them to educate them how why

1750
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:47,680
that bag is bad

1751
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:48,960
even though

1752
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,960
even though you can show them some

1753
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,880
companies or some people

1754
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:55,200
wouldn't understand it and until they

1755
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,520
get really hacked by

1756
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:58,720
another

1757
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:00,640
like a thread actor

1758
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:03,200
until they lose information have you

1759
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,039
it's like it's like very similar to what

1760
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:06,799
happened with people that you tell them

1761
01:07:06,799 --> 01:07:08,880
back up your computer back up your data

1762
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:11,039
back up your cell phone back up your

1763
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:13,520
stuff you might lost them you might get

1764
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:16,240
stolen make it you might get damaged

1765
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,640
whatever but they don't do anything

1766
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:20,799
until it happens and when it happens

1767
01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:22,079
it's too late

1768
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:25,520
and even some companies will repeat it

1769
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,119
there are many histories about companies

1770
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:29,280
that got hacked many times like equity

1771
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,799
equifax or

1772
01:07:30,799 --> 01:07:32,480
i don't remember now but

1773
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:34,400
but the many cases the company got

1774
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,400
hacked many times

1775
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,400
so

1776
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,960
let me some tips fast so

1777
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:42,720
what i've learned is that you actually

1778
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:45,039
have some processes that you need to

1779
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:47,599
have in place for your

1780
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:50,799
for your bounty hunting

1781
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:52,480
process uh

1782
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:54,799
so the first step is the reckon pad like

1783
01:07:54,799 --> 01:07:56,400
i told you you need to

1784
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,799
gather information about your target

1785
01:07:58,799 --> 01:08:01,440
so one of the simplest things to do is

1786
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:04,280
to find subdomains let's say

1787
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:06,960
att.com you need to find

1788
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:08,799
some domains of that company let me show

1789
01:08:08,799 --> 01:08:12,480
you how it looks like let me use my data

1790
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:14,640
i will show you here mandate so if i

1791
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,319
wanna

1792
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:19,839
check domains from atm t

1793
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:22,799
i will just do that

1794
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,640
oh it's a little big

1795
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:28,719
so i'm running bref

1796
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:31,439
and i'm asking

1797
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:33,679
i'm asking it to show me

1798
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:36,319
all of the domains of

1799
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:37,759
this program

1800
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:40,399
so now i'm using

1801
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:43,439
a command to count them

1802
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:45,759
and this is just a debugger from the

1803
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:47,679
tool i will show you later so

1804
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:49,679
i have

1805
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:52,080
136

1806
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:53,759
000

1807
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:55,359
domains so

1808
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:58,000
yeah just to show you better

1809
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,759
we will do that part in detail later

1810
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:03,600
so don't worry if you didn't understand

1811
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:04,799
what i did

1812
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:06,640
so the things that you need are domains

1813
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:09,040
to domains and urls

1814
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:11,040
and ap addresses that you can scan them

1815
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:13,359
you can find variabilities

1816
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:14,880
the easiest

1817
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:17,920
way to use them are

1818
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,759
one and then with that information you

1819
01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:21,920
can use automatic tools there are

1820
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:24,158
many many many many tools

1821
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:25,679
that do

1822
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:27,600
one of the promises that there's so many

1823
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:29,679
tools that some tools

1824
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:31,600
are good some tools are really good some

1825
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:34,479
tools are really bad some tools

1826
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:36,960
do the same things as other tools or

1827
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:39,920
some tools will have many tools included

1828
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,359
inside them

1829
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:42,640
so

1830
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:44,560
what i will tell you is that the tools

1831
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,238
that i use

1832
01:09:46,238 --> 01:09:48,000
i really love it

1833
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,238
and i will tell you why

1834
01:09:50,238 --> 01:09:52,000
so the other part the other thing that

1835
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,480
you do want to manage manual hunting is

1836
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:57,600
that you usually will use web browser

1837
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:59,840
and burp and you will start using the

1838
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:03,360
website and bob barb will tell you what

1839
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,520
bug is probably found

1840
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:07,440
so my favorite tools and the things the

1841
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:09,679
tools are going to use today

1842
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:13,600
so b3f it's used to storing programs

1843
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:14,719
basically

1844
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:17,199
and nuclei is a vulnerability scanner

1845
01:10:17,199 --> 01:10:20,159
that is great because

1846
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:21,600
you could

1847
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,679
create your own templates or you

1848
01:10:23,679 --> 01:10:25,040
couldn't modify

1849
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:27,120
somebody else's templates

1850
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:30,320
and it's community supported so a lot of

1851
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:33,199
people contribute actually

1852
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:34,080
um

1853
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:37,040
top 13 actually got invited yesterday to

1854
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:38,239
be part of

1855
01:10:38,239 --> 01:10:40,400
that community as i don't know really

1856
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:41,920
well what it is but

1857
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:44,239
it's something like being part of the

1858
01:10:44,239 --> 01:10:46,960
supporters of the tool and nuclei is

1859
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:50,080
part of a bigger project that is called

1860
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:52,640
project discovery

1861
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:55,199
and so far i really love this tool i've

1862
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:57,440
been using it for a year it's it's

1863
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:59,040
changed it has changed a lot it has

1864
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:00,400
improved a lot

1865
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,239
and every

1866
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:04,320
week there are

1867
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:07,280
there there are new templates

1868
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:08,719
or

1869
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:10,320
templates are basically

1870
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:12,640
things i mean the basically

1871
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,800
uh descriptions of a bag

1872
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:17,280
or ways to find a bag

1873
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:19,280
that are

1874
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:22,480
like updated or increased

1875
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:25,280
rapidly like sometimes some weeks you

1876
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:27,280
have 200

1877
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:29,760
and i will oh i can give you i could

1878
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,880
give you a more insight later

1879
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:35,040
i recently found

1880
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:38,640
several p ones several critical box

1881
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,480
just with a template that i

1882
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:43,280
that i modified in nuclear

1883
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:45,360
and alfox i don't use it anymore that

1884
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:47,120
much is to find

1885
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:49,120
cross-site scriptings

1886
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:49,920
and

1887
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:52,239
then the one that really changed my game

1888
01:11:52,239 --> 01:11:55,520
is axiom because you could

1889
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,600
distribute your scans

1890
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:01,520
on on several machines right

1891
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:03,440
and book suite pro i'm not gonna talk

1892
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:04,320
about

1893
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:07,600
books pro it's very easy to learn

1894
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:10,880
you could find many tutorials on youtube

1895
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:12,480
you could find

1896
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:15,120
many books and

1897
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:16,880
and ways to use it

1898
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,880
but you wouldn't find a lot of things

1899
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:22,000
about using axiom or nuclei

1900
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:26,320
and okay so a lot of people ask me why

1901
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:28,719
what skills do i need to be able bounty

1902
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:31,040
hunter or to work in security

1903
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:33,040
and in my opinion

1904
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,210
um

1905
01:12:34,210 --> 01:12:35,280
[Music]

1906
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,440
knowing about linux

1907
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:40,480
commands or linux linux in general it's

1908
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:42,080
something that

1909
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:44,239
in my case helped me a lot because i

1910
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:46,159
could develop a developing bash

1911
01:12:46,159 --> 01:12:47,360
scripting

1912
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:50,080
and i could and i could create a

1913
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:52,960
software a program to

1914
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:55,520
discover about or to automate tasks very

1915
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:56,640
easily

1916
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:58,719
in my case but

1917
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:01,840
saying having said that the top one blue

1918
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:04,560
bounty hunter that is called

1919
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:07,679
his nickname is today's new he

1920
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:12,080
is a windows user he uses windows server

1921
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:14,400
to the scanning process and he develops

1922
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:18,080
using resolve basic i guess which is

1923
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:20,239
amazing for me to feel like

1924
01:13:20,239 --> 01:13:22,800
most of the tools now are

1925
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:24,719
done are most of the tools that you're

1926
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:26,560
going to find on github

1927
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:31,440
are made within bash bash scripting or

1928
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:33,440
bash shell or

1929
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:35,520
whatever you want to call it python and

1930
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:37,679
go

1931
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:39,920
so if you know one of these three

1932
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:41,040
languages

1933
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:43,120
i don't know go i haven't programmed

1934
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:45,120
well once you program in many languages

1935
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:47,520
the other learning language is not that

1936
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:48,640
difficult

1937
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:49,360
but

1938
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:50,080
i

1939
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:52,480
don't usually work with go i

1940
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:54,960
do bash and python i got i have some

1941
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:57,360
tools on my repo

1942
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,440
so you need a lot of patience

1943
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:01,440
to move on to hunting because sometimes

1944
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:03,600
you want to find anything and sometimes

1945
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:04,960
you will

1946
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:07,840
only get rejected or

1947
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:09,920
not accepted and you need to be

1948
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:11,199
persistent

1949
01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:14,320
persistent you need to have persistence

1950
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:16,400
because

1951
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:19,679
that's a huge learning curve you need to

1952
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:22,480
learn a lot of things that

1953
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:24,800
are not available and available in the

1954
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,480
books that you probably even if you

1955
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:28,640
study computer science

1956
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,480
degree and master's degree in cyber

1957
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:32,800
security the technical part it's

1958
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:34,880
completely different it's

1959
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:37,120
it evolves

1960
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:40,560
very very rapidly for example even in in

1961
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:41,920
hacker one

1962
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:43,760
years ago you could report very

1963
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:46,000
different bugs from now you could report

1964
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,400
like very simple stuff and and now they

1965
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,719
just get back

1966
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:52,640
not accepted right away so you need to

1967
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:55,760
have some persistence and if these

1968
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:57,840
you see this as a as a

1969
01:14:57,840 --> 01:14:58,880
passion

1970
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:01,040
in my case it's a it's a passion because

1971
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:02,960
i can do it for

1972
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:05,199
18 hours straight

1973
01:15:05,199 --> 01:15:07,120
and it will help you out if you have all

1974
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:08,719
these skills

1975
01:15:08,719 --> 01:15:10,480
they're not really all of them skills

1976
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:12,560
but

1977
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:15,040
you will at some point

1978
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:17,840
be successful at some point might be

1979
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:20,640
two years might be six months maybe if

1980
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:22,320
you're a genius

1981
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:24,640
i have i actually work with a friend uh

1982
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:25,920
with a guy

1983
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:29,360
from colombia he's 19 years old

1984
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:31,199
and he already hacked

1985
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:34,080
got two bounties and a tnt

1986
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:37,360
and probably in one year he's gonna be

1987
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:39,360
a super hacker right

1988
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:41,040
and you need time

1989
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:44,159
the things that i have is time because

1990
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:46,719
uh since i have a company i have uh

1991
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:49,120
i have a client so i don't need to work

1992
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:51,520
i don't need to work every day

1993
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:54,719
so that helped me a lot having time

1994
01:15:54,719 --> 01:15:55,600
and

1995
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:58,400
now that we

1996
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:02,480
cover that part let me go to

1997
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:06,080
the if you have any questions okay no

1998
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:08,400
questions

1999
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,520
so

2000
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:10,400
this

2001
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:13,199
part let me close some things

2002
01:16:13,199 --> 01:16:16,239
to make things open

2003
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:19,520
okay so twitter are gone

2004
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:20,880
so okay

2005
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:23,199
um

2006
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:24,960
let me

2007
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:27,040
tell you something

2008
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:28,239
i thought

2009
01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:31,199
bbf was easy to explain

2010
01:16:31,199 --> 01:16:32,640
but

2011
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:34,960
during the deathcore workshop

2012
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:37,360
a lot of people struggle with it they

2013
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:39,600
couldn't really understand

2014
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,920
why or how to use it

2015
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:43,360
and let me tell you that it's not

2016
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:45,280
difficult

2017
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:48,400
it might be strange to use but

2018
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:51,040
have some patience

2019
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:54,400
is a tool that helped me or

2020
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:56,080
if you're a

2021
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:58,400
hunter it will help you to

2022
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:00,159
store your information

2023
01:17:00,159 --> 01:17:03,440
in a sustainable way why do i mean

2024
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:04,159
why

2025
01:17:04,159 --> 01:17:06,239
do i say sustainable way

2026
01:17:06,239 --> 01:17:07,199
because

2027
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:09,199
if you don't use something to store your

2028
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:11,840
data in a sustainable way

2029
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:14,719
what will happen is that you will have

2030
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:16,800
something like this

2031
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:19,520
you will have

2032
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:21,520
you will ended up having

2033
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:24,159
files of

2034
01:17:24,159 --> 01:17:27,600
let me go to the other machine better

2035
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,679
this will give you an example of how my

2036
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:31,600
life was before

2037
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:35,040
so will you ended up having urls of urls

2038
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:38,640
of urls of urls and stored in files

2039
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:40,960
and stored in different names and

2040
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,400
folders

2041
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:45,920
and and at some point you lost track of

2042
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:49,280
that for example look at that

2043
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:53,199
you ended up mixing things you ended up

2044
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:54,960
having

2045
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,719
from different sites

2046
01:17:56,719 --> 01:17:58,640
so you get the idea right

2047
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,480
you ended up storing things in different

2048
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:03,599
servers you don't

2049
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:08,080
so what bpf does is that it allows you

2050
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:08,800
to

2051
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:11,199
store data using a

2052
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:14,560
couchdb database which is a documental

2053
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:17,280
database is not a relational database

2054
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:19,679
so even if you have many many many

2055
01:18:19,679 --> 01:18:22,320
documents in my case i have our i think

2056
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:24,960
around 12 million documents

2057
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:27,920
documents are domains urls and other

2058
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:30,239
things

2059
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:33,520
one of the coolest things about it

2060
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:35,360
is that you can define

2061
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:38,000
the in-scope and the out scope and when

2062
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,760
you add the domains it will

2063
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:42,080
automatically filter out the things that

2064
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:43,760
are not scope

2065
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:45,360
which is something very useful when you

2066
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:48,560
have an automated process

2067
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:50,560
yeah add two domains and url according

2068
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:52,320
to scopes

2069
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,560
and one of the other cool things is that

2070
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,719
you can pipe them to do a lot of things

2071
01:18:56,719 --> 01:18:57,840
for example

2072
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:59,440
like i told you before

2073
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:01,920
you could do

2074
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:04,080
and in this case i just counting them i

2075
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:05,679
don't know if you see my screen properly

2076
01:19:05,679 --> 01:19:08,800
if the size is good but once you

2077
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:12,000
have bbf you can do automated things

2078
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,840
for example well i will show you later

2079
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:16,800
that part i'm getting ahead of myself

2080
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:20,480
so let's go to the lab now this is we're

2081
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,159
starting the love

2082
01:19:22,159 --> 01:19:27,199
we only spend one one and a half hours

2083
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:29,360
let me get rid of

2084
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:32,159
some things

2085
01:19:32,239 --> 01:19:33,070
from here

2086
01:19:33,070 --> 01:19:36,148
[Music]

2087
01:19:38,850 --> 01:19:41,949
[Music]

2088
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:51,400
also because i wanted

2089
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:53,920
okay so

2090
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:56,880
i wanna know if you all have the lab

2091
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:57,840
working

2092
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:59,280
so

2093
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:02,480
we're gonna spend some time

2094
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:05,440
fixing that if you don't have it and you

2095
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:08,559
don't have it working

2096
01:20:09,199 --> 01:20:11,600
properly

2097
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,440
so at this point

2098
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:15,360
all of you

2099
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,840
should have

2100
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:20,639
to this field

2101
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,638
that

2102
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:27,920
what you

2103
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:31,120
should see is

2104
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:33,120
something like

2105
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:34,800
if you run this command you're gonna

2106
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:37,520
feel already loaded ah one of the things

2107
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:39,760
that we should do

2108
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:42,760
is

2109
01:20:48,639 --> 01:20:51,120
and

2110
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:52,800
let me

2111
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:55,760
check okay

2112
01:20:55,840 --> 01:21:00,639
i just want to get rid of the debug mode

2113
01:21:00,639 --> 01:21:04,639
just don't remember the command okay

2114
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:09,600
debug mode and

2115
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:12,560
use false

2116
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:16,960
otherwise we're gonna see okay so

2117
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:21,280
i don't know if you are following me

2118
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:24,639
so at this point of the workshop i will

2119
01:21:24,639 --> 01:21:25,920
if

2120
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:27,440
each of you

2121
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:28,719
to tell me

2122
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:30,400
that you are

2123
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:33,040
with the vm working

2124
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:35,600
and then you have access

2125
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:39,840
to your vm using ssh

2126
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:44,559
i don't know if you can hear me

2127
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:46,960
but

2128
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:52,400
say something if you come here

2129
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:56,920

2131
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,080
are you there

2132
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:06,159

2133
01:22:06,159 --> 01:22:09,040
okay so yeah so

2134
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:11,040

2137
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:16,719
okay so

2138
01:22:16,719 --> 01:22:19,199
if you don't have

2139
01:22:19,199 --> 01:22:23,679
the vm working or you couldn't connect

2140
01:22:23,679 --> 01:22:24,719
to it

2141
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:27,120
now is the time to

2142
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:28,639
ask me

2143
01:22:28,639 --> 01:22:30,400
how to do it

2144
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,480
otherwise you're gonna miss all the

2145
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:36,678
exercise that we're gonna do

2146
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:41,440
okay so

2147
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:45,519
let me go to the lab

2148
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:51,480
okay so

2149
01:22:53,410 --> 01:22:56,960
[Music]

2150
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:59,199
okay

2151
01:22:59,199 --> 01:23:00,080
so

2152
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:02,239
one of the things that i i will show you

2153
01:23:02,239 --> 01:23:03,120
now

2154
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:04,000
let me

2155
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,480
probably use

2156
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:09,280
two screens

2157
01:23:09,370 --> 01:23:14,159
[Music]

2158
01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:15,520
there

2159
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:19,280
and here i will use the

2160
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:20,719
right so

2161
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:22,800
the first exercise

2162
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:25,199
is just

2163
01:23:25,199 --> 01:23:28,719
it's just adding a program to bprf

2164
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:30,000
and

2165
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,560
let me show you how to do it

2166
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:33,280
so

2167
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:35,679
let's say i created my account on

2168
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:37,520
integrity and

2169
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:40,400
i wanna follow

2170
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:42,800
philips instructions

2171
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:45,520
how to store your data and so then i

2172
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:48,560
will go to this website where i can see

2173
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:49,520
the

2174
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:51,199
program that is called

2175
01:23:51,199 --> 01:23:53,600
inter gamma

2176
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:56,000
so every exercise is based on the

2177
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,880
previous one so

2178
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:01,120
so yeah you should pay attention so

2179
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:03,280
this is a program description they will

2180
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:05,360
tell you here

2181
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:07,920
they will describe here how much are

2182
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:10,639
they paying for every type of bug

2183
01:24:10,639 --> 01:24:12,639
the tears so

2184
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:14,320
so we need to

2185
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:18,159
the things that we need to focus on

2186
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:20,400
so that the exercise says

2187
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:23,040
instructions add the program using the

2188
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:24,639
tax url

2189
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:26,480
site and reward

2190
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:28,840
so you might wonder

2191
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:31,920
why should i use attack or how do i use

2192
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:33,040
a time

2193
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:35,440
and i will explain it here right away

2194
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:38,400
so the basical the basic command to

2195
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:41,759
other program it's uh

2196
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:44,480
it's uh

2197
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:48,159
go to the exercise

2198
01:24:56,639 --> 01:24:57,600
okay

2199
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,920
just have a little confusion because in

2200
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:01,760
my case

2201
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:04,159
i use a script

2202
01:25:04,159 --> 01:25:05,920
that does everything

2203
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:08,320
for me

2204
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:13,280
but on the exercise so we have this

2205
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:16,000
this script that will do

2206
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,159
all the steps simplified but i will i

2207
01:25:18,159 --> 01:25:20,000
will

2208
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:23,600
show you the other way so and they

2209
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:25,280
there is this

2210
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:27,840
url here

2211
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,080
where you have the answers to all the

2212
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:32,560
exercises

2213
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:33,520
so

2214
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:35,920
this is the part that people had more

2215
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:37,360
difficult

2216
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:38,480
more difficult

2217
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:40,320
found more difficulty more more

2218
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:42,560
difficult yes

2219
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:43,280
so

2220
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:46,000
in order to create a program we just use

2221
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,639
this command uh let me

2222
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:51,520
remove that part there

2223
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:54,520
so

2224
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:59,199
so in order to create a program we just

2225
01:25:59,679 --> 01:26:02,719
we just copy that command

2226
01:26:02,719 --> 01:26:05,719
wait

2227
01:26:06,490 --> 01:26:09,719
[Music]

2228
01:26:10,239 --> 01:26:13,120
okay i just created uh

2229
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:18,559
bbf program crawl program so let me

2230
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:20,960
work

2231
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:21,760
so

2232
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:23,840
if i want to create a program called

2233
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:26,560
intergamma

2234
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:28,639
i just

2235
01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:32,639
set the name intergamma

2236
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:36,480
oh right

2237
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:37,679
so yeah

2238
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:39,280
wait

2239
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:40,639
yeah that's the reason

2240
01:26:40,639 --> 01:26:42,719
so

2241
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:45,440
i'm going to create let me

2242
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:46,719
increase the size i don't know if you

2243
01:26:46,719 --> 01:26:50,120
can see it properly

2244
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:54,239
okay yeah

2245
01:26:54,239 --> 01:26:56,960
so i will create the program called

2246
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:59,440
intel command and i will use attack and

2247
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:02,000
why why do i need a tag

2248
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,360
because one of the things i need to

2249
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:05,280
store

2250
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:09,120
is the url of the program why

2251
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:11,760
because if i want to report a bag

2252
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:14,080
i will need to get to this page to this

2253
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:16,840
side again and if you had

2254
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:20,159
hundreds of or in my case i have

2255
01:27:20,159 --> 01:27:22,800
almost a thousand programs

2256
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:25,600
you cannot keep track of all of them you

2257
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:27,280
will ended up

2258
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:28,800
wasting time

2259
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:31,120
figuring out from which program your

2260
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:34,480
domain or the url that you found about

2261
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:36,239
it comes from

2262
01:27:36,239 --> 01:27:39,120
so i will store the url

2263
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:42,239
and then i will add which site is from

2264
01:27:42,239 --> 01:27:45,440
in this case probably site is confusing

2265
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:48,080
i before i use platform but i

2266
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:49,840
use site

2267
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:52,480
and then what type of reward

2268
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:55,040
they have because that way you could

2269
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:56,960
then you could look for programs that

2270
01:27:56,960 --> 01:28:00,719
paid and only focus on those programs

2271
01:28:00,719 --> 01:28:03,040
so in this case i created the program

2272
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:04,960
called intergamma

2273
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:07,280
so if i want to show the details of

2274
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:09,199
these programs i just do

2275
01:28:09,199 --> 01:28:12,000
bpf show and it will show me the

2276
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,520
intergamma and then

2277
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:16,000
just use this command

2278
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:19,120
and it will show me um

2279
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:20,880
the type i mean

2280
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:24,639
if the scope in scope is empty

2281
01:28:24,639 --> 01:28:28,080
but during the tags i have the url so i

2282
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:29,600
can easily

2283
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:31,040
go back to

2284
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:32,880
what it was before

2285
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:33,679
and

2286
01:28:33,679 --> 01:28:36,480
the site is reworked and and you

2287
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:38,400
one of the cool things about bibref is

2288
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:39,760
that you could

2289
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:43,600
you could search for programs

2290
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:44,639
that

2291
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:45,600
have

2292
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:47,920
a value on their tax for example in this

2293
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:49,440
case let's say

2294
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:52,480
where reward is money

2295
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:54,719
like a query right

2296
01:28:54,719 --> 01:28:56,960
so it will display

2297
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:58,880
didn't show the other one because he

2298
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:01,040
doesn't have any scope

2299
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:04,639
so i will need to use

2300
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:06,320
show

2301
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:07,600
empty

2302
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:09,440
this is something that you shouldn't pay

2303
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:11,280
attention to

2304
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:13,440
but then you have all the all the all

2305
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:15,520
the programs

2306
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:17,600
so it's pretty cool that you can that

2307
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:18,650
you could

2308
01:29:18,650 --> 01:29:19,840
[Music]

2309
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:22,320
only find for example

2310
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:24,480
um

2311
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,239
progress that are

2312
01:29:26,239 --> 01:29:28,159
on site's

2313
01:29:28,159 --> 01:29:30,799
integrity

2314
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:33,440
and if i do parker one because i will

2315
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:36,159
have a few problems but

2316
01:29:36,159 --> 01:29:38,960
if i if i run if i run the same example

2317
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:42,639
on my vbrf from my official brief

2318
01:29:42,639 --> 01:29:44,719
you will see what happens you will see

2319
01:29:44,719 --> 01:29:47,040
what happens here

2320
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:49,679
for example in here

2321
01:29:49,679 --> 01:29:52,159
i will just find here little perfect

2322
01:29:52,159 --> 01:29:54,480
side

2323
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:57,519
if i

2324
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:00,880
if i run it here

2325
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:02,159
hacker

2326
01:30:02,159 --> 01:30:04,480
one

2327
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:08,159
which side is

2328
01:30:08,159 --> 01:30:10,960
wait doesn't work ah because i use

2329
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:13,600
h1 no hacker one so then

2330
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:15,560
then you see you have

2331
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:18,080
466 programs

2332
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:22,519
and if i count integrity

2333
01:30:24,159 --> 01:30:26,799
integrity

2334
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:31,040
100 programs and if i just count the

2335
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:33,520
ones that are paying where

2336
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:34,960
reward

2337
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:38,159
reward is money

2338
01:30:38,159 --> 01:30:39,679
600.

2339
01:30:39,679 --> 01:30:43,440
so that's why it's useful and in my case

2340
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:44,880
i will

2341
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:46,840
use a lot

2342
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:50,080
the i use some scripts to simplify some

2343
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:52,560
things but it's basically this part

2344
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:56,400
so let's go to the to the left to the

2345
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:58,400
so

2346
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:01,120
so i already show you how to create the

2347
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:04,080
program and now we need to

2348
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:07,040
add the in scope and adding the scope is

2349
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:09,280
not difficult

2350
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:11,440
we just need to

2351
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:14,400
use bvrf

2352
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:17,120
in scope add

2353
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:19,679
and then we gotta we can we can include

2354
01:31:19,679 --> 01:31:22,719
all the definitions

2355
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:24,880
from the program i don't know if you

2356
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:26,480
follow me

2357
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:28,960
if you have any questions just

2358
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:30,320
right on the chat they will check the

2359
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:32,560
chat

2360
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:35,520
okay so

2361
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:38,840
okay

2362
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:46,719
it's just that sometimes i have too many

2363
01:31:46,719 --> 01:31:50,480
too many tabs opens for weeks

2364
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:52,719
and then if i close them i forget about

2365
01:31:52,719 --> 01:31:54,400
them forever

2366
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:56,800
so let's check out this program so one

2367
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,800
of the things that is

2368
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:00,639
a lot of work it's

2369
01:32:00,639 --> 01:32:02,320
getting the information from the program

2370
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:03,199
so

2371
01:32:03,199 --> 01:32:07,440
you will get this is one of the in scope

2372
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:09,440
right

2373
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:11,920
and in this case it says that our scope

2374
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:13,120
is start

2375
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:15,520
is this domain but we need to use we

2376
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:18,400
need to add it later

2377
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:19,679
and

2378
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:21,840
we will also add

2379
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:23,440
that

2380
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:24,480
by the

2381
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:26,560
domain

2382
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:29,440
also this domain

2383
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:33,840
so there's no way to do it automatically

2384
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:35,600
the one of the problems with the

2385
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:38,239
programs in different sites

2386
01:32:38,239 --> 01:32:40,800
is they will have different ways of

2387
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:41,920
writing

2388
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:43,360
for example

2389
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:46,000
check check in this case they're using

2390
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,960
uh slash

2391
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:51,760
which is redundant redundant because

2392
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:54,800
it's already implied that everything

2393
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:57,840
under your domain

2394
01:32:57,840 --> 01:32:59,199
will be included

2395
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:00,400
so

2396
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:01,360
that

2397
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:03,920
should domain also

2398
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:07,040
and some people made the made a mistake

2399
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:10,960
on the yeah so this also

2400
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:13,199
some people didn't go to the end

2401
01:33:13,199 --> 01:33:15,280
of this program when we did the workshop

2402
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:17,120
at that point so

2403
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:18,719
some of the exercise didn't work because

2404
01:33:18,719 --> 01:33:22,159
they didn't feel everything

2405
01:33:22,159 --> 01:33:25,120
so yes

2406
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:28,320
and

2407
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:30,639
it's not this one that's just a side

2408
01:33:30,639 --> 01:33:33,520
it's just a domain

2409
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:34,480
but

2410
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:36,320
so two separately

2411
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:38,400
you see this is difficult because they

2412
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:39,840
they

2413
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:41,840
they included an and

2414
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:43,040
and

2415
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:45,600
i cannot see but it's because my

2416
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,679
experience is smaller but

2417
01:33:47,679 --> 01:33:48,880
let's

2418
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:51,679
let's skip that for now

2419
01:33:51,679 --> 01:33:53,600
so if you if you notice

2420
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:55,440
i added

2421
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:56,880
um

2422
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:59,920
soup domains with wild cards and a

2423
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:02,480
domain itself without wild cards and

2424
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:06,080
either any they all work perfectly with

2425
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:08,560
so we'll add the scope

2426
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:10,719
let's check if it's added if it was

2427
01:34:10,719 --> 01:34:12,480
added

2428
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:13,280
so

2429
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:15,920
let's show enter gamma again and as you

2430
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:17,679
see now here

2431
01:34:17,679 --> 01:34:19,440
we got the scope

2432
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:21,440
so

2433
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:23,679
the other step that we need to do is to

2434
01:34:23,679 --> 01:34:26,080
add the out scope so

2435
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:27,760
the domains that we

2436
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:29,679
that we

2437
01:34:29,679 --> 01:34:31,520
that we wouldn't want

2438
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:33,840
urls to be stored so if you if you see

2439
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:35,760
here in my screen

2440
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:37,840
they have described

2441
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:40,159
the outscope so we will just

2442
01:34:40,159 --> 01:34:42,239
do the same

2443
01:34:42,239 --> 01:34:43,040
just

2444
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:46,000
using odd scope add

2445
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,520
and we will

2446
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:49,520
this process is

2447
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:50,960
it took me

2448
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:54,080
to fill all

2449
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:56,480
the programs let me show you all my

2450
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:58,639
programs on a pretty

2451
01:34:58,639 --> 01:35:01,280
interface that is also from bbf i didn't

2452
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:03,199
develop this this is included it's a

2453
01:35:03,199 --> 01:35:04,880
client it's a web plan i don't use it

2454
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:06,960
that much

2455
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:10,880
but if you see i have 921 programs

2456
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:12,320
and imagine

2457
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:15,119
how long did it take me to fill them all

2458
01:35:15,119 --> 01:35:18,000
it took me actually like nine months

2459
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,719
at some point i deleted accidentally the

2460
01:35:20,719 --> 01:35:23,760
database i didn't have backups

2461
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:27,600
so it took me one more month

2462
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:31,440
so i will add the out scope

2463
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:34,080
one by one

2464
01:35:38,239 --> 01:35:40,960
and last one this is the last one

2465
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:43,840
okay

2466
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:47,040
so let's check okay now we have the out

2467
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:49,360
scope we have the in scope everything

2468
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:50,960
looks

2469
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:52,400
looks good

2470
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:53,440
so

2471
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:56,239
let's go back to the lab

2472
01:35:56,239 --> 01:35:58,080
and

2473
01:35:58,080 --> 01:36:00,880
we need to list the in school and

2474
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:03,199
listing this scope is we already did it

2475
01:36:03,199 --> 01:36:05,440
with this command that is also another

2476
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:07,600
way

2477
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:09,440
and that's the one

2478
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:12,080
the ref is called in

2479
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:13,840
some i use

2480
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:15,920
a lot of these commands but

2481
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:18,239
on scripts that automate things that i

2482
01:36:18,239 --> 01:36:20,159
will show you later

2483
01:36:20,159 --> 01:36:21,760
and finally

2484
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:26,320
the task is to show the scope out so

2485
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:28,400
following the same logic

2486
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:31,199
we just bbf scope out

2487
01:36:31,199 --> 01:36:33,840
so we have the scope

2488
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:37,280
the description of the scope out

2489
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:38,480
so

2490
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:40,959
um

2491
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:45,440
we already this is this was the first

2492
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:48,000
exercise

2493
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:53,360
and if you notice on the lab

2494
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:54,320
i

2495
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:56,639
on my repo

2496
01:36:56,639 --> 01:36:59,119
i have

2497
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:02,159
i have a script i have many scripts but

2498
01:37:02,159 --> 01:37:04,239
the one that i want to show you

2499
01:37:04,239 --> 01:37:06,639
is that in my case

2500
01:37:06,639 --> 01:37:09,840
i automated the process of adding of

2501
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:12,480
adding a program

2502
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:14,800
and i will use add programs

2503
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:16,719
beside

2504
01:37:16,719 --> 01:37:20,000
me because i work with another person so

2505
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:23,360
we need to know who will add it what

2506
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:26,239
and he will ask me for the program say

2507
01:37:26,239 --> 01:37:28,080
testing

2508
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:30,880
what kind of reward and i will say money

2509
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:32,400
is default

2510
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:36,320
the url that's destined.com

2511
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:38,880
program right

2512
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:41,199
and it will i will use reckon but it

2513
01:37:41,199 --> 01:37:42,800
means that if i

2514
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:44,800
if i could

2515
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:46,719
spend more time doing recon on that

2516
01:37:46,719 --> 01:37:47,679
program

2517
01:37:47,679 --> 01:37:49,360
usually when they have a lot of wild

2518
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:53,199
cards and this case is quite false

2519
01:37:53,199 --> 01:37:55,520
does it have an android app no

2520
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:56,560
now

2521
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:58,159
source code because the programs i have

2522
01:37:58,159 --> 01:38:00,719
source code that you need to

2523
01:38:00,719 --> 01:38:04,000
so in scope let's say

2524
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,719
let's say i will use

2525
01:38:06,719 --> 01:38:08,639
testing

2526
01:38:08,639 --> 01:38:11,199
testing

2527
01:38:14,239 --> 01:38:16,480
or let's use

2528
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:18,400
example.com

2529
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:20,239
right

2530
01:38:20,239 --> 01:38:21,760
so i will not use

2531
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:23,840
i will not include any old school

2532
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:25,760
but what it does

2533
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:26,880
is uh

2534
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:30,000
the tool the script automatically

2535
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,639
finds for sub domains

2536
01:38:32,639 --> 01:38:35,360
and urls so it's going to take a while

2537
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:37,520
probably we can i can go by later to

2538
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:41,119
check it it's on my github repo

2539
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:42,960
and there are the instructions of things

2540
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:46,560
solid but you need to

2541
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:47,280
well

2542
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:49,840
you can study if you want later

2543
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:52,159
so let's go back to

2544
01:38:52,159 --> 01:38:54,320
the so this this was the exercise number

2545
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:57,280
one which is just a preparation for

2546
01:38:57,280 --> 01:38:59,440
the next

2547
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:02,239
the next exercises so if you have any

2548
01:39:02,239 --> 01:39:03,840
questions

2549
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:06,000
please let me know

2550
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,560
i will give you

2551
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:12,119
i will give you

2552
01:39:12,390 --> 01:39:16,270
[Music]

2553
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:21,840
let me give you

2554
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:24,480
three minutes

2555
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:26,400
can i get some water

2556
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:28,559
and

2557
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:31,440
i will give you three minutes for you to

2558
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:34,000
test it and to see if it's working

2559
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,960
properly if you have this

2560
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:40,159
and i'll be back in three minutes

2561
01:39:40,159 --> 01:39:41,760
hello

2562
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:43,840
yes that problem

2563
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:45,679
it's uh

2564
01:39:45,679 --> 01:39:47,360
it happens when you

2565
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:50,159
had when you add a

2566
01:39:50,159 --> 01:39:51,199
character

2567
01:39:51,199 --> 01:39:55,320
that it's um

2568
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:58,719
it happens it's a bug that has very f

2569
01:39:58,719 --> 01:40:01,360
that happens when you add and spay a

2570
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:03,440
space between the

2571
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:04,320
the

2572
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:06,719
if you can you hear me right

2573
01:40:06,719 --> 01:40:09,920
if when you have a space between the

2574
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:10,800
the

2575
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:12,960
definitions

2576
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:16,960
so i suggest you to do it to

2577
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:18,560
first

2578
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:21,679
if you want to get rid of the debug mode

2579
01:40:21,679 --> 01:40:24,719
just do the bug mode

2580
01:40:24,719 --> 01:40:27,040
false

2581
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:29,600
this is a script that i

2582
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:30,560
that i

2583
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:33,600
built because it was so annoying

2584
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:36,400
needed you needed to change

2585
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:37,119
the

2586
01:40:37,119 --> 01:40:38,639
you needed to change

2587
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:41,040
this file

2588
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:42,320
every time

2589
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:43,679
if you see here

2590
01:40:43,679 --> 01:40:46,639
it says debug false

2591
01:40:46,639 --> 01:40:49,199
so i did a

2592
01:40:49,199 --> 01:40:53,040
so the owner of this tool it's not very

2593
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:55,519
hard to say

2594
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:58,480
it doesn't

2595
01:40:58,480 --> 01:41:00,719
allow a lot of people to contribute

2596
01:41:00,719 --> 01:41:01,760
so

2597
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:04,480
i started developing

2598
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:09,040
my own scripts on top of pvf

2599
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:11,520
so could you

2600
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:14,320
could you solve it

2601
01:41:16,719 --> 01:41:19,719
ana

2602
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:25,360
so i would say

2603
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:28,320
yeah that's one of the bugs of these

2604
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:30,560
tools

2605
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:33,360
and

2606
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:37,360
just as a warning i might be

2607
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:39,199
i'm in in

2608
01:41:39,199 --> 01:41:41,679
quarantine because i traveled to the us

2609
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:45,199
and in chile we have a pretty strict

2610
01:41:45,199 --> 01:41:48,400
period of 10 days that i have to be

2611
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:52,719
in my place without being anywhere else

2612
01:41:52,719 --> 01:41:55,280
so at some point they might knock at my

2613
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:57,840
door and i might leave

2614
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:00,719
for a couple of minutes the this

2615
01:42:00,719 --> 01:42:01,920
zoom meeting

2616
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:04,159
it's just gonna take me two minutes they

2617
01:42:04,159 --> 01:42:06,560
asked me for my id and they asked me for

2618
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:09,040
the symptoms

2619
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:13,199
and server error conflict okay

2620
01:42:13,199 --> 01:42:15,520
server ah because you already have a

2621
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:17,760
program called that way

2622
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:18,719
so

2623
01:42:18,719 --> 01:42:20,080
if you

2624
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:23,920
if you wanna do it again just remove it

2625
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:26,080
so before you have a ram

2626
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:29,840
and enter gamma in this case

2627
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,719
well you understand me then

2628
01:42:36,719 --> 01:42:37,679
they have

2629
01:42:37,679 --> 01:42:39,280
they have come

2630
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:43,600
every day to check for my id

2631
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:44,960
and

2632
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:46,880
if i have symptoms

2633
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:50,400
i don't know what time they come so

2634
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:53,760
until sunday sunday

2635
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:55,520
we will be free

2636
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:57,280
because we don't have delta

2637
01:42:57,280 --> 01:43:00,639
we don't have the delta variant here yet

2638
01:43:00,639 --> 01:43:01,600
so

2639
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:05,040
it's pretty hard to

2640
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:06,560
to to travel

2641
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:10,080
in my case i was lucky because i

2642
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:11,040
i live

2643
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:13,840
nearby or a few hours from the airport

2644
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:14,800
so

2645
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:16,320
other people might need to stay in a

2646
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:17,600
hotel

2647
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:21,119
paying 200 per day

2648
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:24,480
yeah so

2649
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:26,239
going to the us was

2650
01:43:26,239 --> 01:43:27,840
really strange

2651
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:30,560
defcon worked pretty well it was like 10

2652
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:32,000
000 people

2653
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:35,679
and only a few cases were reported

2654
01:43:35,679 --> 01:43:38,239
but it was pretty strict you need to use

2655
01:43:38,239 --> 01:43:40,639
your mask i don't know how it is in

2656
01:43:40,639 --> 01:43:41,840
ukraine

2657
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:45,040
but in chile it's like nobody

2658
01:43:45,040 --> 01:43:48,159
goes out without a mask anywhere

2659
01:43:48,159 --> 01:43:50,719
not from the beginning of the pandemic

2660
01:43:50,719 --> 01:43:53,280
it's still conflict error okay so show

2661
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:54,880
me the output again

2662
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:56,400
show me the your command show me the

2663
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:59,960
commander you're running

2664
01:44:12,719 --> 01:44:14,560
okay

2665
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:17,649
[Music]

2666
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:20,560
okay it's because you're

2667
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:21,679
you're

2668
01:44:21,679 --> 01:44:24,000
um

2669
01:44:25,119 --> 01:44:27,119
it's because you're creating the

2670
01:44:27,119 --> 01:44:28,800
the

2671
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:30,639
program called program

2672
01:44:30,639 --> 01:44:32,080
and probably

2673
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:33,520
in

2674
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:36,320
oh well let me show you

2675
01:44:37,199 --> 01:44:38,639
you already have the program called

2676
01:44:38,639 --> 01:44:41,760
program so you need to change

2677
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:44,400
the word program for instagram

2678
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:46,400
so what happens in your case is that you

2679
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:48,400
already have the programs

2680
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:50,719
so if you if you do this

2681
01:44:50,719 --> 01:44:51,840
show

2682
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:53,280
empty

2683
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:55,760
there are some parameters

2684
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:57,520
that i don't like about this tool but

2685
01:44:57,520 --> 01:45:02,239
it's the only tool that does this so

2686
01:45:02,239 --> 01:45:03,520
it doesn't matter

2687
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:05,440
doesn't this so it's okay

2688
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:08,559
you work it out okay

2689
01:45:08,719 --> 01:45:10,480
yeah so if you want to list all your

2690
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:13,360
programs you need to use

2691
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:15,520
like big ref

2692
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:17,199
slash slash

2693
01:45:17,199 --> 01:45:18,000
show

2694
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
empty scope

2695
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:20,800
right

2696
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:23,440
so in your case if you

2697
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:24,400
wanted

2698
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:27,760
you were trying to add create a new

2699
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:31,520
program with the same name so as you see

2700
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:35,520
the tool is the error message is not

2701
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:36,960
very dis

2702
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:38,480
it's not very detailed because it will

2703
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:39,679
tell you

2704
01:45:39,679 --> 01:45:41,600
program intergamma already

2705
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:45,199
already on the database right

2706
01:45:45,199 --> 01:45:46,880
so yeah um

2707
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:49,119
anybody else

2708
01:45:49,119 --> 01:45:52,480
show programs okay program okay

2709
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:55,840
so you need to create a program called

2710
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:57,600
intercom because we're gonna use it

2711
01:45:57,600 --> 01:45:59,920
later so it should be called intro gamma

2712
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:03,440
that way it's gonna be easier

2713
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:04,520
for us to

2714
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:05,760
[Music]

2715
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:07,760
accomplish their workshop

2716
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:10,239
so this is this was the difficult the

2717
01:46:10,239 --> 01:46:12,800
most difficult part probably

2718
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:15,679
at the beginning of the workshop and

2719
01:46:15,679 --> 01:46:18,320
a lot of people left

2720
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:20,159
not a lot but

2721
01:46:20,159 --> 01:46:22,480
some people left because they it was too

2722
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:24,719
difficult i think we i've been using

2723
01:46:24,719 --> 01:46:26,560
this tool for a year

2724
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:29,280
so in my case a lot of things seem easy

2725
01:46:29,280 --> 01:46:30,880
but or not

2726
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:32,639
but it's

2727
01:46:32,639 --> 01:46:35,040
the only tool that does this that type

2728
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:37,520
of stuff and

2729
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:40,880
let me show you for example what what i

2730
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:42,960
did on my

2731
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:45,440
so let me display the

2732
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:46,239
okay

2733
01:46:46,239 --> 01:46:48,400
so for example if i want to look for

2734
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:51,599
this domain

2735
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:52,960
wait

2736
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:55,119
show intergamer let's say i want to look

2737
01:46:55,119 --> 01:46:56,880
for this

2738
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:59,600
domain on my entire repo on my entire

2739
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:01,360
database

2740
01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:03,119
so i have

2741
01:47:03,119 --> 01:47:06,519
i have a

2742
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:10,400
i have a

2743
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:14,320
let me i don't want to remove that

2744
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:17,199
let's see my terminal so

2745
01:47:17,199 --> 01:47:19,600
let's going back to what i did before

2746
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:22,320
just before i show you the other part

2747
01:47:22,320 --> 01:47:25,440
with this script uh it runs

2748
01:47:25,440 --> 01:47:28,800
subfinder and so if i he found

2749
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:30,880
several subdomains

2750
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:33,119
and he actually found

2751
01:47:33,119 --> 01:47:36,639
several urls so if i cancel this script

2752
01:47:36,639 --> 01:47:39,520
and now i

2753
01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:41,520
i do

2754
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:43,600
have show in the program that i created

2755
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:45,840
that is testing

2756
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:47,679
it will display

2757
01:47:47,679 --> 01:47:52,880
and it will display the in scope

2758
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:54,800
but it wouldn't

2759
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:55,760
so

2760
01:47:55,760 --> 01:47:59,600
yeah so we'll show the urls

2761
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:01,600
and i will show the domains so it's very

2762
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:03,360
easy very fast

2763
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:06,400
so what i was going to show you before

2764
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:09,679
it was um

2765
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:11,679
ah if i wanna

2766
01:48:11,679 --> 01:48:12,880
search for

2767
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:14,080
that domain

2768
01:48:14,080 --> 01:48:16,800
i have another script that does this

2769
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:19,520
easier that is find program

2770
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:20,400
and

2771
01:48:20,400 --> 01:48:21,760
find program

2772
01:48:21,760 --> 01:48:24,000
and

2773
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:27,119
the problems with the

2774
01:48:27,119 --> 01:48:29,040
clipboard

2775
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:32,239
find program and then the domain and it

2776
01:48:32,239 --> 01:48:33,600
will show me

2777
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:36,400
the site the name

2778
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:38,320
this money and the url and then go

2779
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:40,800
directly to there

2780
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:43,360
to the url

2781
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:45,440
okay so

2782
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:47,679
let me go back to

2783
01:48:47,679 --> 01:48:50,320
the chat

2784
01:48:54,480 --> 01:48:56,159
oh yeah see yes

2785
01:48:56,159 --> 01:48:59,440
yes there there are some worst errors

2786
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:02,000
that do not have any description

2787
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:06,400
for example when you remove a program

2788
01:49:08,239 --> 01:49:11,760
and then on my chain when you

2789
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:14,239
when you remove a program it doesn't say

2790
01:49:14,239 --> 01:49:16,639
that it was removed

2791
01:49:16,639 --> 01:49:20,400
so for example if i do that

2792
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:25,760
if i do that it wouldn't say anything

2793
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:27,520
even though the program doesn't exist

2794
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:29,360
you know

2795
01:49:29,360 --> 01:49:32,159
so it's annoying but

2796
01:49:32,159 --> 01:49:33,760
but it's the best tool that that's

2797
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:37,360
available and i still use it despite all

2798
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:40,480
that things that

2799
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:43,199
are annoying and

2800
01:49:43,199 --> 01:49:45,360
if you ask me why what's the biggest

2801
01:49:45,360 --> 01:49:46,400
advantage

2802
01:49:46,400 --> 01:49:48,639
is that i could run

2803
01:49:48,639 --> 01:49:50,400
scans

2804
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:52,800
on all my urls

2805
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:53,840
in

2806
01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:55,280
one command

2807
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:56,560
i could

2808
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:58,880
and i will show you that later so

2809
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:01,840
i want to know if we if you are already

2810
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:04,159
with this

2811
01:50:04,159 --> 01:50:05,599
with this exercise i don't know if you

2812
01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:07,679
are following me

2813
01:50:07,679 --> 01:50:11,840
i would like more feedback

2814
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:15,920
it's difficult to do a workshop online

2815
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:17,040
because i

2816
01:50:17,040 --> 01:50:18,480
cannot see

2817
01:50:18,480 --> 01:50:20,960
your screens

2818
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:22,560
a lot of people when they're confusing

2819
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:24,880
on the last workshops i will just get to

2820
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:26,560
the screens and i will see right away

2821
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:27,920
they were doing what they were supposed

2822
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:31,280
to do or that we just lost

2823
01:50:31,360 --> 01:50:36,400
so i added here uh proposer success

2824
01:50:36,400 --> 01:50:38,880
just for you to understand a bit more

2825
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:40,880
the text

2826
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:42,639
and i have actually

2827
01:50:42,639 --> 01:50:45,040
if you want to install it

2828
01:50:45,040 --> 01:50:46,639
i mean

2829
01:50:46,639 --> 01:50:47,360
i

2830
01:50:47,360 --> 01:50:48,400
look

2831
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:50,639
this tool was probably the hardest to

2832
01:50:50,639 --> 01:50:51,760
install

2833
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:53,520
in my life probably

2834
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:55,679
it took me because some tools are very

2835
01:50:55,679 --> 01:50:58,960
immature are very new

2836
01:50:58,960 --> 01:51:00,239
and

2837
01:51:00,239 --> 01:51:01,119
those

2838
01:51:01,119 --> 01:51:03,840
some hackers or some computer

2839
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:05,119
people

2840
01:51:05,119 --> 01:51:08,480
do not like to document things so

2841
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:10,639
it took me actually two days to install

2842
01:51:10,639 --> 01:51:11,840
it

2843
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:14,400
i had facing many errors all type of

2844
01:51:14,400 --> 01:51:16,480
errors so you can imagine

2845
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:18,239
actually it's difficult to install

2846
01:51:18,239 --> 01:51:21,119
couchdb with with ssl

2847
01:51:21,119 --> 01:51:22,000
install

2848
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:23,360
install

2849
01:51:23,360 --> 01:51:25,119
i couldn't find documentation i couldn't

2850
01:51:25,119 --> 01:51:27,199
find and and i wrote

2851
01:51:27,199 --> 01:51:28,719
an article

2852
01:51:28,719 --> 01:51:30,239
that will

2853
01:51:30,239 --> 01:51:32,080
give you a step-by-step process how to

2854
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:33,679
do it

2855
01:51:33,679 --> 01:51:36,800
and it's not difficult but the

2856
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:40,000
their words were really annoying

2857
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:44,080
and yeah so i because i installed my own

2858
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:46,480
couch tv but i wanted to use ssl right

2859
01:51:46,480 --> 01:51:47,840
because the information that i'm

2860
01:51:47,840 --> 01:51:49,360
gathering

2861
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:51,119
if i use

2862
01:51:51,119 --> 01:51:52,880
only http

2863
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:55,199
you might get intercepted somewhere at

2864
01:51:55,199 --> 01:51:56,639
some point

2865
01:51:56,639 --> 01:51:57,440
and

2866
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:58,880
that data

2867
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:01,679
at the end it's worth money because it's

2868
01:52:01,679 --> 01:52:04,480
months of work

2869
01:52:05,440 --> 01:52:09,599
and some programs some have rules about

2870
01:52:09,599 --> 01:52:11,599
not disclosing

2871
01:52:11,599 --> 01:52:14,560
their domains

2872
01:52:15,280 --> 01:52:18,000
so it maybe you might buy me from one of

2873
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:21,440
those programs or from the sites

2874
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:25,599
okay so i'm gonna check

2875
01:52:25,599 --> 01:52:28,639
how you are doing

2876
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:30,880
well the

2877
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:32,719
the last

2878
01:52:32,719 --> 01:52:35,520
bbf is not that buggy now

2879
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:37,440
because it's been

2880
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:40,719
a year of development it will be

2881
01:52:40,719 --> 01:52:42,719
much better if

2882
01:52:42,719 --> 01:52:47,040
the owner allowed more participation

2883
01:52:47,040 --> 01:52:47,840
but

2884
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:51,360
if you if you it doesn't have any

2885
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:52,719
like

2886
01:52:52,719 --> 01:52:54,960
i actually opened several

2887
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:57,199
like i was really annoying i was opening

2888
01:52:57,199 --> 01:52:59,440
issues all the time by the way it's my

2889
01:52:59,440 --> 01:53:02,000
experience

2890
01:53:05,920 --> 01:53:08,239
i was actually opening issues all the

2891
01:53:08,239 --> 01:53:09,920
time

2892
01:53:09,920 --> 01:53:11,440
and i think

2893
01:53:11,440 --> 01:53:13,919
most of my

2894
01:53:14,080 --> 01:53:17,840
yeah you're 27 and he stopped working on

2895
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:19,440
the two

2896
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:21,199
and i stopped

2897
01:53:21,199 --> 01:53:23,520
i'm still actually

2898
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:27,679
feeling issues because he doesn't it's

2899
01:53:27,679 --> 01:53:28,880
not

2900
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:30,880
he's only one developer you know it's

2901
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:32,560
it's not possible

2902
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:37,599
and if you compare with the nuclear

2903
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:43,520
if you compare with nuclei nuclei has

2904
01:53:43,599 --> 01:53:45,679
i don't know how many developers

2905
01:53:45,679 --> 01:53:49,119
like 43 contributors

2906
01:53:49,119 --> 01:53:50,239
they

2907
01:53:50,239 --> 01:53:51,360
they do

2908
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:52,560
they do

2909
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:55,560
uh

2910
01:53:57,280 --> 01:53:59,199
constantly

2911
01:53:59,199 --> 01:54:03,360
they have a thousand sixteen hundred

2912
01:54:03,360 --> 01:54:04,880
commits

2913
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:05,840
and

2914
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:09,840
they are like pretty much every day

2915
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:12,800
and yes so it's a

2916
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:13,840
different

2917
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:15,440
quite different

2918
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:16,960
a lot of forks

2919
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:20,719
from 5000 stars

2920
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:23,199
yeah so but but so far i haven't found

2921
01:54:23,199 --> 01:54:25,599
anything anything similar

2922
01:54:25,599 --> 01:54:28,400
and i'm very lazy

2923
01:54:28,400 --> 01:54:29,920
developing my own it will take it

2924
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:32,159
actually took him a year and a half to

2925
01:54:32,159 --> 01:54:34,080
develop it there's some interviews of

2926
01:54:34,080 --> 01:54:37,360
anaki he's a nice guy honokie

2927
01:54:37,360 --> 01:54:39,440
it's actually one of the top

2928
01:54:39,440 --> 01:54:41,760
four monty hunters

2929
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:42,560
and

2930
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:43,520
he

2931
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:46,880
yeah he took a lot of time to

2932
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:48,159
it's one of the

2933
01:54:48,159 --> 01:54:51,760
one of the most useful tools in my case

2934
01:54:51,760 --> 01:54:55,360
so are you ready for next next one

2935

2953
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:41,920
new and small and

2954
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:45,280
simple i try to do

2955
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:48,400
actually this

2956
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:49,840
this uh

2957
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:51,760
this repo has

2958
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:53,280
just gained a lot of

2959
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:54,639
attention lately because i have

2960
01:55:54,639 --> 01:55:56,320
templates

2961
01:55:56,320 --> 01:55:58,560
for all the bugs that i have reported

2962
01:55:58,560 --> 01:56:02,320
like a 150 like you find the bag but you

2963
01:56:02,320 --> 01:56:04,560
need to report it how do you do it here

2964
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:06,639
you have the template you just

2965
01:56:06,639 --> 01:56:09,280
feel the values and that's it

2966
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:12,159
i try to i tried to update regularly

2967
01:56:12,159 --> 01:56:15,520
like 52 already but i tried to

2968
01:56:15,520 --> 01:56:17,599
do it like one every day because they're

2969
01:56:17,599 --> 01:56:19,040
too many

2970
01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:21,440
and i have a well

2971
01:56:21,440 --> 01:56:25,840
i have a apa claim that i could do

2972
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:26,960
automate it

2973
01:56:26,960 --> 01:56:28,880
i can automate the reports send the

2974
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:30,400
reports

2975
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:32,239
just click on the command line and hook

2976
01:56:32,239 --> 01:56:35,840
your one the api is really bad

2977
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:37,920
it took me a long time not a long time

2978
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:42,199
but it took me a lot of effort

2979
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:43,760
they don't have

2980
01:56:43,760 --> 01:56:45,840
you know this is passion if you haven't

2981
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:47,679
ever

2982
01:56:47,679 --> 01:56:50,080
scripting the special scripting

2983
01:56:50,080 --> 01:56:51,199
okay so

2984
01:56:51,199 --> 01:56:52,800
let's move on let's move on to the

2985
01:56:52,800 --> 01:56:53,840
second

2986
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:55,280
exercise but

2987
01:56:55,280 --> 01:56:59,119
i don't know if you all are on board

2988
01:56:59,119 --> 01:57:02,239
most of you left the slides or if you're

2989
01:57:02,239 --> 01:57:04,400
still alive

2990
01:57:04,400 --> 01:57:07,679
still paying attention or just anna

2991
01:57:07,679 --> 01:57:12,800
let's go to the exercise number two

2992
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:14,000
and

2993
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,880
let me access cycle that's that's

2994
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:19,040
exercise number two so exercise number

2995
01:57:19,040 --> 01:57:20,400
two

2996
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:23,199
it's a bit more difficult but

2997
01:57:23,199 --> 01:57:26,560
uh it's about record it's about

2998
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:28,080
using

2999
01:57:28,080 --> 01:57:29,199
two tools

3000
01:57:29,199 --> 01:57:30,320
one is

3001
01:57:30,320 --> 01:57:32,639
soft finder an asset finder

3002
01:57:32,639 --> 01:57:35,840
they do the same they will give you sub

3003
01:57:35,840 --> 01:57:39,040
domains of a domain for example

3004
01:57:39,040 --> 01:57:40,800
subfinder

3005
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:42,719
and i don't know any website from

3006
01:57:42,719 --> 01:57:44,960
ukraine but let's say

3007
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:46,239
i

3008
01:57:46,239 --> 01:57:47,360
won

3009
01:57:47,360 --> 01:57:50,239
a newspaper from chile

3010
01:57:50,239 --> 01:57:54,239
it's with id so it will it will

3011
01:57:54,239 --> 01:57:58,400
it will output all these of the mains

3012
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:00,480
using different different tools there

3013
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:02,560
you saw finder is not

3014
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:05,920
and the most important if you read here

3015
01:58:05,920 --> 01:58:08,480
the amount of results using subfinder

3016
01:58:08,480 --> 01:58:10,320
depends on the amount of application you

3017
01:58:10,320 --> 01:58:12,880
configure it

3018
01:58:13,119 --> 01:58:15,360
yeah so you have you need to take some

3019
01:58:15,360 --> 01:58:17,199
time

3020
01:58:17,199 --> 01:58:19,040
to

3021
01:58:19,040 --> 01:58:21,119
use because oh let me show you what it

3022
01:58:21,119 --> 01:58:23,280
is

3023
01:58:24,159 --> 01:58:27,040
so finder

3024
01:58:33,119 --> 01:58:34,639
so in my case

3025
01:58:34,639 --> 01:58:38,560
in my case i have

3026
01:58:42,560 --> 01:58:44,400
in my case

3027
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:45,760
i have

3028
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:47,520
wait

3029
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:48,210
just some

3030
01:58:48,210 --> 01:58:50,960
[Music]

3031
01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:53,119
yeah i think star wars

3032
01:58:53,119 --> 01:58:55,839
no i don't know

3033
01:58:58,320 --> 01:59:00,400
i'm looking for the config file it's in

3034
01:59:00,400 --> 01:59:02,239
finder

3035
01:59:02,239 --> 01:59:03,760
no

3036
01:59:03,760 --> 01:59:06,560
i can remember

3037
01:59:12,800 --> 01:59:14,320
well i don't remember i don't remember

3038
01:59:14,320 --> 01:59:15,119
but

3039
01:59:15,119 --> 01:59:17,280
there's a config file where you add all

3040
01:59:17,280 --> 01:59:19,360
the apis

3041
01:59:19,360 --> 01:59:22,799
and it's a long list

3042
01:59:23,360 --> 01:59:26,639
and you need to create accounts

3043
01:59:26,639 --> 01:59:28,080
for

3044
01:59:28,080 --> 01:59:31,280
but let me show you

3045
01:59:35,599 --> 01:59:36,639
so

3046
01:59:36,639 --> 01:59:39,199
you need to

3047
01:59:39,199 --> 01:59:42,080
configure it

3048
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:45,800
to

3049
01:59:46,380 --> 01:59:49,479
[Music]

3050
01:59:56,880 --> 02:00:01,440
so this tool uses

3051
02:00:01,440 --> 02:00:04,080
i okay yeah

3052
02:00:04,080 --> 02:00:06,400
the following services

3053
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:09,599
you need to find you need to get an ap

3054
02:00:09,599 --> 02:00:13,599
key from all this services so the more

3055
02:00:13,599 --> 02:00:16,480
services you have the more

3056
02:00:16,480 --> 02:00:19,040
the more results you will get so i've

3057
02:00:19,040 --> 02:00:20,880
tested it

3058
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:23,199
and sometimes it's 50 so is is the

3059
02:00:23,199 --> 02:00:25,360
config file

3060
02:00:25,360 --> 02:00:28,480
okay it's uh

3061
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:41,040
yeah so that's the file

3062
02:00:41,040 --> 02:00:44,159
those are my keys don't see them

3063
02:00:44,159 --> 02:00:48,000
but they have many many many sources so

3064
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:48,800
some

3065
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:50,080
and you need to

3066
02:00:50,080 --> 02:00:52,320
configure your resolvers but the main

3067
02:00:52,320 --> 02:00:55,360
idea is that you will

3068
02:00:55,360 --> 02:00:58,239
get as you see on my screen you will you

3069
02:00:58,239 --> 02:00:59,599
will get

3070
02:00:59,599 --> 02:01:01,920
a lot of sub domains

3071
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:05,040
and if you run this for every domain on

3072
02:01:05,040 --> 02:01:06,719
your

3073
02:01:06,719 --> 02:01:08,639
on your database you will ended up

3074
02:01:08,639 --> 02:01:11,599
having a lot of data that you can use

3075
02:01:11,599 --> 02:01:12,800
for testing

3076
02:01:12,800 --> 02:01:13,920
for

3077
02:01:13,920 --> 02:01:16,159
scanning vulnerabilities which is what i

3078
02:01:16,159 --> 02:01:18,320
do

3079
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:20,560
i do it

3080
02:01:20,560 --> 02:01:22,560
with my with axiom i will show you later

3081
02:01:22,560 --> 02:01:26,239
so the exercise number two is to

3082
02:01:26,239 --> 02:01:28,719
use a finder to find domains and add

3083
02:01:28,719 --> 02:01:30,960
them to be very because the problem that

3084
02:01:30,960 --> 02:01:33,599
we have now

3085
02:01:33,840 --> 02:01:37,840
what is our problem is that

3086
02:01:38,639 --> 02:01:42,239
our problem is that we don't have any

3087
02:01:42,239 --> 02:01:45,199
we don't have anywhere else

3088
02:01:45,199 --> 02:01:48,080
so if we if we want to show

3089
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:51,840
our domains if we're gonna show

3090
02:01:52,239 --> 02:01:54,080
domains

3091
02:01:54,080 --> 02:01:56,480
for our program we don't have any

3092
02:01:56,480 --> 02:01:59,840
so what do we do what do we do now so

3093
02:01:59,840 --> 02:02:02,800
let me show you how to do it easy

3094
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:05,750
in the easy way so

3095
02:02:05,750 --> 02:02:08,719
[Music]

3096
02:02:08,719 --> 02:02:10,719
let me go to the answer sheet this is

3097
02:02:10,719 --> 02:02:12,800
already the comments there

3098
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:14,000
so

3099
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:15,679
with this command

3100
02:02:15,679 --> 02:02:16,840
you will

3101
02:02:16,840 --> 02:02:20,159
get oh sorry

3102
02:02:20,159 --> 02:02:22,480
you always have is the same to me when

3103
02:02:22,480 --> 02:02:25,199
i'm doing a file

3104
02:02:25,199 --> 02:02:26,000
so

3105
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:27,760
if i run this command

3106
02:02:27,760 --> 02:02:30,719
i will get this scope in

3107
02:02:30,719 --> 02:02:33,719
or

3108
02:02:38,480 --> 02:02:40,159
the scoping

3109
02:02:40,159 --> 02:02:41,199
of

3110
02:02:41,199 --> 02:02:44,759
what happened with

3111
02:02:48,080 --> 02:02:52,159
okay so let's open with the wheel card

3112
02:02:53,040 --> 02:02:55,920
wield card

3113
02:02:56,320 --> 02:02:59,320
scope

3114
02:03:10,239 --> 02:03:13,199
okay it's without

3115
02:03:13,199 --> 02:03:16,560
let me eat it right away

3116
02:03:16,560 --> 02:03:20,480
squeeze our this to slash

3117
02:03:22,239 --> 02:03:24,799
okay so

3118
02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:26,880
okay

3119
02:03:26,880 --> 02:03:30,719
so when i run this command if you if you

3120
02:03:30,719 --> 02:03:33,360
notice i get

3121
02:03:33,360 --> 02:03:36,880
some of the subdomains with the with

3122
02:03:36,880 --> 02:03:39,520
this symbol right

3123
02:03:39,520 --> 02:03:41,199
and that symbol wouldn't work with

3124
02:03:41,199 --> 02:03:43,040
subfinder

3125
02:03:43,040 --> 02:03:45,199
it will actually we can you can see it

3126
02:03:45,199 --> 02:03:46,880
and if you know

3127
02:03:46,880 --> 02:03:48,960
you all know piping you know what piping

3128
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:51,199
does

3129
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:54,000
piping is when you

3130
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:57,199
send the result from one command

3131
02:03:57,199 --> 02:03:59,199
to the input of another

3132
02:03:59,199 --> 02:04:00,960
the output

3133
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:03,360
of one command to the input of another

3134
02:04:03,360 --> 02:04:06,239
so in this case

3135
02:04:06,960 --> 02:04:08,480
i'm sending

3136
02:04:08,480 --> 02:04:10,800
the output of this command to the input

3137
02:04:10,800 --> 02:04:13,960
of subfiber

3138
02:04:29,040 --> 02:04:31,040
i don't know why it's taking

3139
02:04:31,040 --> 02:04:33,599
how long

3140
02:04:35,520 --> 02:04:40,719
maybe the vm is not totally

3141
02:04:41,040 --> 02:04:43,599
just good

3142
02:04:45,930 --> 02:04:49,049
[Music]

3143
02:04:50,800 --> 02:04:53,040
yeah it's couch i don't know it's not

3144
02:04:53,040 --> 02:04:55,119
that bad

3145
02:04:55,119 --> 02:04:57,360
yeah

3146
02:04:58,079 --> 02:04:59,760
if you run it on

3147
02:04:59,760 --> 02:05:04,480
probably would recommend you to increase

3148
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:08,239
the size of your vm

3149
02:05:08,800 --> 02:05:12,960
i think i might need more memory

3150
02:05:13,599 --> 02:05:16,480
and definitely more cpus

3151
02:05:16,480 --> 02:05:18,880
let me restart it otherwise it's going

3152
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:21,840
to take forever

3153
02:05:22,320 --> 02:05:23,360
let me

3154
02:05:23,360 --> 02:05:28,400
restart it and i'll need more processors

3155
02:05:29,199 --> 02:05:32,759
and i need more

3156
02:05:47,440 --> 02:05:50,159
turn it off

3157
02:05:52,079 --> 02:05:54,400
this

3158
02:05:54,960 --> 02:05:58,960
suspended it but i wanted to kill it

3159
02:05:58,960 --> 02:06:00,800
so i will

3160
02:06:00,800 --> 02:06:03,800
configure

3161
02:06:11,440 --> 02:06:14,759
once again

3162
02:06:21,199 --> 02:06:22,159
okay

3163
02:06:22,159 --> 02:06:25,719
so yes

3164
02:06:25,930 --> 02:06:29,049
[Music]

3165
02:06:31,440 --> 02:06:33,760
it doesn't allow me to change it

3166
02:06:33,760 --> 02:06:37,199
this is running set

3167
02:06:37,199 --> 02:06:39,360
but

3168
02:06:42,840 --> 02:06:46,239
why okay

3169
02:06:46,560 --> 02:06:49,199
and then

3170
02:06:49,679 --> 02:06:52,639
we're off guests

3171
02:06:53,199 --> 02:06:56,440
shut down

3172
02:07:01,360 --> 02:07:04,839
this one second

3173
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:51,840
okay

3174
02:07:51,840 --> 02:07:54,840
so

3175
02:08:15,440 --> 02:08:16,960
much faster now

3176
02:08:16,960 --> 02:08:20,159
be very if it's a bit

3177
02:08:20,840 --> 02:08:27,159
cpu intensive when you add a lot of data

3178
02:08:41,440 --> 02:08:43,280
there

3179
02:08:43,280 --> 02:08:46,880
so i'm going to click into it

3180
02:08:46,880 --> 02:08:50,360
just repeat

3181
02:09:17,280 --> 02:09:20,320
okay i'm back

3182
02:09:20,320 --> 02:09:24,320
let's see if it works better now

3183
02:09:28,159 --> 02:09:31,040
four times more cities so

3184
02:09:31,040 --> 02:09:35,440
if i run this command like i said before

3185
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:44,800
it will remove the symbol

3186
02:09:44,800 --> 02:09:45,920
right

3187
02:09:45,920 --> 02:09:48,079
and if i then

3188
02:09:48,079 --> 02:09:51,440
write some finder

3189
02:09:52,639 --> 02:09:54,400
you will get

3190
02:09:54,400 --> 02:09:58,960
the sub domains of every domain

3191
02:09:58,960 --> 02:10:02,239
yeah it's way faster now

3192
02:10:09,280 --> 02:10:10,800
so just give it

3193
02:10:10,800 --> 02:10:14,119
some time

3194
02:11:13,440 --> 02:11:16,560
okay now you get the idea so what i what

3195
02:11:16,560 --> 02:11:18,719
i need to do

3196
02:11:18,719 --> 02:11:23,280
is when you add this command at the end

3197
02:11:23,280 --> 02:11:25,840
you will

3198
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:29,520
you will add

3199
02:11:29,520 --> 02:11:32,960
every subdomain

3200
02:11:32,960 --> 02:11:34,639
to your bvf

3201
02:11:34,639 --> 02:11:39,840
so every every output that we got here

3202
02:11:40,079 --> 02:11:41,679
will be stored

3203
02:11:41,679 --> 02:11:44,000
in our program

3204
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,400
so just give it a little

3205
02:11:46,400 --> 02:11:49,199
a little time

3206
02:11:50,079 --> 02:11:51,760
i will check here if you have any

3207
02:11:51,760 --> 02:11:54,239
questions

3208
02:11:54,960 --> 02:11:56,560
um

3209
02:11:56,560 --> 02:11:59,040
yeah so it's better than some at least

3210
02:11:59,040 --> 02:12:00,639
some lister

3211
02:12:00,639 --> 02:12:01,760
and

3212
02:12:01,760 --> 02:12:04,239
that scope didn't work out which which

3213
02:12:04,239 --> 02:12:07,360
command didn't work out

3214
02:12:07,360 --> 02:12:07,840
can you

3215
02:12:07,840 --> 02:12:09,520
[Music]

3216
02:12:09,520 --> 02:12:12,800
you why what happened

3217
02:12:13,599 --> 02:12:16,960
what's your output show me your output

3218
02:12:16,960 --> 02:12:17,679
so

3219
02:12:17,679 --> 02:12:19,119
i don't know if it's better than

3220
02:12:19,119 --> 02:12:21,599
sublister

3221
02:12:21,599 --> 02:12:23,280
uh i don't know i don't know which one

3222
02:12:23,280 --> 02:12:25,440
are you talking about it's this one soft

3223
02:12:25,440 --> 02:12:27,599
lister

3224
02:12:27,599 --> 02:12:29,360
there some there are many tools that

3225
02:12:29,360 --> 02:12:32,840
they have like they do similar

3226
02:12:32,840 --> 02:12:36,480
things and when you want to compare them

3227
02:12:36,480 --> 02:12:38,639
pretty much uses the same

3228
02:12:38,639 --> 02:12:41,119
sources

3229
02:12:41,280 --> 02:12:44,239
and probably you could use both probably

3230
02:12:44,239 --> 02:12:46,239
you could use more than one

3231
02:12:46,239 --> 02:12:48,560
but at some point you start realizing

3232
02:12:48,560 --> 02:12:51,679
that they use the same sources

3233
02:12:51,679 --> 02:12:53,599
for example if you read here it says

3234
02:12:53,599 --> 02:12:57,199
google yahoo bing bada will ask

3235
02:12:57,199 --> 02:12:58,960
nothing about this total for crowd

3236
02:12:58,960 --> 02:13:01,280
unions buster reverse dns probably i

3237
02:13:01,280 --> 02:13:02,880
could include it

3238
02:13:02,880 --> 02:13:05,920
one of the good things about b3f

3239
02:13:05,920 --> 02:13:07,119
is that

3240
02:13:07,119 --> 02:13:09,360
including another tool

3241
02:13:09,360 --> 02:13:12,639
to get more subdomains it's simple

3242
02:13:12,639 --> 02:13:17,440
it's just adding one line of code

3243
02:13:17,440 --> 02:13:18,960
to my script

3244
02:13:18,960 --> 02:13:21,440
and yeah this tools looks

3245
02:13:21,440 --> 02:13:23,440
pretty nice well

3246
02:13:23,440 --> 02:13:25,040
the last release was

3247
02:13:25,040 --> 02:13:27,599
like a year ago so

3248
02:13:27,599 --> 02:13:30,960
yeah probably it's not

3249
02:13:30,960 --> 02:13:33,440
yeah it's not updated

3250
02:13:33,440 --> 02:13:35,119
i wouldn't use it probably that's what i

3251
02:13:35,119 --> 02:13:37,360
know i don't use it

3252
02:13:37,360 --> 02:13:38,560
you know that

3253
02:13:38,560 --> 02:13:39,840
they don't have

3254
02:13:39,840 --> 02:13:41,840
too many

3255
02:13:41,840 --> 02:13:42,960
too many

3256
02:13:42,960 --> 02:13:45,920
issues opened

3257
02:13:46,400 --> 02:13:48,320
last

3258
02:13:48,320 --> 02:13:49,360
last check

3259
02:13:49,360 --> 02:13:54,000
last comment was more than a year ago so

3260
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,159
no

3261
02:13:56,400 --> 02:14:00,000
and most of the tools are

3262
02:14:03,199 --> 02:14:05,040
something that happens a lot is that

3263
02:14:05,040 --> 02:14:08,159
some tools get abandoned and

3264
02:14:08,159 --> 02:14:10,638
in this

3265
02:14:10,840 --> 02:14:14,800
case the release was

3266
02:14:14,800 --> 02:14:16,400
a few months ago

3267
02:14:16,400 --> 02:14:19,360
about six months ago

3268
02:14:19,360 --> 02:14:21,840
four months ago

3269
02:14:21,840 --> 02:14:25,360
and if you see they have a lot of

3270
02:14:25,360 --> 02:14:26,960
closed

3271
02:14:26,960 --> 02:14:29,679
versus open

3272
02:14:30,400 --> 02:14:31,760
and

3273
02:14:31,760 --> 02:14:34,639
some other knockbacks are are enhanced

3274
02:14:34,639 --> 02:14:36,800
enhancements and enhancements

3275
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:39,760
enhancement

3276
02:14:39,760 --> 02:14:42,639
so yeah i will just more to find her and

3277
02:14:42,639 --> 02:14:44,639
search finder is from project discovery

3278
02:14:44,639 --> 02:14:45,920
so

3279
02:14:45,920 --> 02:14:47,199
like

3280
02:14:47,199 --> 02:14:48,560
project discovery they have a lot of

3281
02:14:48,560 --> 02:14:52,079
people working on that like paid

3282
02:14:52,079 --> 02:14:52,800
so

3283
02:14:52,800 --> 02:14:55,440
it's just completely different so all of

3284
02:14:55,440 --> 02:14:56,960
the tools project discovery are pretty

3285
02:14:56,960 --> 02:14:58,560
cool are pretty amazing

3286
02:14:58,560 --> 02:15:01,199
nuclei so nuclei has nuclei and the

3287
02:15:01,199 --> 02:15:03,840
templates so the templates

3288
02:15:03,840 --> 02:15:05,760
this is this is the client or the

3289
02:15:05,760 --> 02:15:08,960
software and this is our the templates

3290
02:15:08,960 --> 02:15:09,840
that

3291
02:15:09,840 --> 02:15:12,239
would

3292
02:15:12,320 --> 02:15:13,920
um

3293
02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:16,639
that you how to explain so this software

3294
02:15:16,639 --> 02:15:18,639
uses the templates

3295
02:15:18,639 --> 02:15:20,239
and they're separated because they got

3296
02:15:20,239 --> 02:15:21,760
too big

3297
02:15:21,760 --> 02:15:23,440
the templates are

3298
02:15:23,440 --> 02:15:26,239
i don't remember how much but

3299
02:15:26,239 --> 02:15:28,320
almost 2 000

3300
02:15:28,320 --> 02:15:29,760
some of them are

3301
02:15:29,760 --> 02:15:32,159
critical cvs and i will show you i will

3302
02:15:32,159 --> 02:15:34,880
tell you later however that i found

3303
02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:37,280
some cps and actually this this other

3304
02:15:37,280 --> 02:15:38,800
tool

3305
02:15:38,800 --> 02:15:40,639
look i use three

3306
02:15:40,639 --> 02:15:42,880
from

3307
02:15:43,040 --> 02:15:44,320
from

3308
02:15:44,320 --> 02:15:45,670
these projects

3309
02:15:45,670 --> 02:15:46,800
[Music]

3310
02:15:46,800 --> 02:15:49,119
but this one

3311
02:15:49,119 --> 02:15:51,599
i use nuclei nuclear templates of course

3312
02:15:51,599 --> 02:15:54,480
i use some finder httpx is

3313
02:15:54,480 --> 02:15:55,679
to obtain

3314
02:15:55,679 --> 02:15:57,760
http valid

3315
02:15:57,760 --> 02:16:00,639
it's to prove to prove to

3316
02:16:00,639 --> 02:16:02,800
prove

3317
02:16:02,800 --> 02:16:05,679
the domains to see which which one of

3318
02:16:05,679 --> 02:16:07,199
the domains has

3319
02:16:07,199 --> 02:16:10,239
http server

3320
02:16:10,800 --> 02:16:14,159
and the dnsx is to

3321
02:16:14,159 --> 02:16:16,480
actually see which

3322
02:16:16,480 --> 02:16:20,239
domain is resolving to an ap so that way

3323
02:16:20,239 --> 02:16:21,760
you can clean

3324
02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:24,880
the domains that are dead or

3325
02:16:24,880 --> 02:16:28,320
yeah they don't resolve to anything

3326
02:16:28,320 --> 02:16:29,679
well actually we're actually going to

3327
02:16:29,679 --> 02:16:31,760
use them all these tools in this

3328
02:16:31,760 --> 02:16:33,439
workshop

3329
02:16:33,439 --> 02:16:35,679
probably i should use novel at some

3330
02:16:35,679 --> 02:16:37,920
point because i don't do

3331
02:16:37,920 --> 02:16:39,920
and here you can see

3332
02:16:39,920 --> 02:16:43,200
the health status of uh tool

3333
02:16:43,200 --> 02:16:44,959
you see it

3334
02:16:44,959 --> 02:16:47,599
this tool is pretty cool this tool it's

3335
02:16:47,599 --> 02:16:49,920
uh um

3336
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:53,679
uh a tool to replace the verb

3337
02:16:53,679 --> 02:16:56,478
collaborator collaborative client uh the

3338
02:16:56,478 --> 02:16:57,920
whole world collaborator with that

3339
02:16:57,920 --> 02:16:59,359
basically

3340
02:16:59,359 --> 02:17:01,679
you could detect

3341
02:17:01,679 --> 02:17:05,599
requests sent to an url

3342
02:17:05,599 --> 02:17:07,840
and yeah if you see the other program

3343
02:17:07,840 --> 02:17:09,760
don't look out look at the look at the

3344
02:17:09,760 --> 02:17:11,359
development

3345
02:17:11,359 --> 02:17:14,718
of this tool it's pretty it's pretty

3346
02:17:14,718 --> 02:17:15,840
strong

3347
02:17:15,840 --> 02:17:19,120
so finder probably street finder

3348
02:17:19,120 --> 02:17:21,359
it's uh something that you cannot like

3349
02:17:21,359 --> 02:17:23,599
change much because it's

3350
02:17:23,599 --> 02:17:26,799
at the end it's using

3351
02:17:26,840 --> 02:17:30,478
another apis or software notify is

3352
02:17:30,478 --> 02:17:32,240
really cool

3353
02:17:32,240 --> 02:17:33,599
yeah i probably should include it in the

3354
02:17:33,599 --> 02:17:36,718
next one in the next version

3355
02:17:36,718 --> 02:17:37,950
so yes um

3356
02:17:37,950 --> 02:17:39,200
[Music]

3357
02:17:39,200 --> 02:17:42,638
he finished on my end okay let me let me

3358
02:17:42,638 --> 02:17:45,040
see your bug

3359
02:17:45,040 --> 02:17:47,439
anna

3360
02:17:48,160 --> 02:17:49,519
okay

3361
02:17:49,519 --> 02:17:53,040
add scott add scope didn't work

3362
02:17:53,040 --> 02:17:56,760
there is no output

3363
02:17:57,040 --> 02:18:00,000
okay so

3364
02:18:01,359 --> 02:18:03,070
so wait which one are you

3365
02:18:03,070 --> 02:18:06,308
[Music]

3366
02:18:06,879 --> 02:18:08,398
okay

3367
02:18:08,398 --> 02:18:10,478
it's because you need to

3368
02:18:10,478 --> 02:18:12,799
run it let me

3369
02:18:12,799 --> 02:18:14,879
increase the size of my screen a little

3370
02:18:14,879 --> 02:18:16,318
bit

3371
02:18:16,318 --> 02:18:19,840
so in your case your command will be

3372
02:18:19,840 --> 02:18:22,398
like this

3373
02:18:23,760 --> 02:18:24,799
okay

3374
02:18:24,799 --> 02:18:27,599
you said that you used that right in

3375
02:18:27,599 --> 02:18:29,679
their gamma.cl

3376
02:18:29,679 --> 02:18:32,000
and what happened

3377
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,799
what was there there is no okay i'm

3378
02:18:34,799 --> 02:18:37,359
seeing it now

3379
02:18:37,359 --> 02:18:39,760
okay yeah that's normal

3380
02:18:39,760 --> 02:18:42,318
run it this way

3381
02:18:42,318 --> 02:18:44,718
run it this way run it

3382
02:18:44,718 --> 02:18:47,040
scope in

3383
02:18:47,040 --> 02:18:48,638
into gamma

3384
02:18:48,638 --> 02:18:50,478
because you're you're just adding the

3385
02:18:50,478 --> 02:18:52,080
scope

3386
02:18:52,080 --> 02:18:55,040
we haven't had domains yet right so

3387
02:18:55,040 --> 02:18:57,679
you're you're adding the definitions

3388
02:18:57,679 --> 02:18:58,959
the scope

3389
02:18:58,959 --> 02:19:01,599
is just a definition of what should be

3390
02:19:01,599 --> 02:19:02,799
included

3391
02:19:02,799 --> 02:19:04,879
and what should be ignored on your

3392
02:19:04,879 --> 02:19:07,599
program which is one of the most

3393
02:19:07,599 --> 02:19:10,318
in my opinion is the

3394
02:19:10,318 --> 02:19:11,840
greatest

3395
02:19:11,840 --> 02:19:13,920
feature of this tool

3396
02:19:13,920 --> 02:19:16,080
is that once you defines the outcome any

3397
02:19:16,080 --> 02:19:19,359
scope you forget about the program

3398
02:19:19,359 --> 02:19:21,519
and then you got okay so you already

3399
02:19:21,519 --> 02:19:22,478
have

3400
02:19:22,478 --> 02:19:24,799
your that's correct you already have the

3401
02:19:24,799 --> 02:19:26,080
scope

3402
02:19:26,080 --> 02:19:26,879
so

3403
02:19:26,879 --> 02:19:29,040
it's it's okay you should go you should

3404
02:19:29,040 --> 02:19:31,040
continue to the next step

3405
02:19:31,040 --> 02:19:34,638
which is adding domains

3406
02:19:34,638 --> 02:19:35,599
to

3407
02:19:35,599 --> 02:19:37,040
your

3408
02:19:37,040 --> 02:19:39,439
bvf to your program

3409
02:19:39,439 --> 02:19:42,000
so you could try to add

3410
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,318
the ordering scope

3411
02:19:44,318 --> 02:19:46,840
and the other and the

3412
02:19:46,840 --> 02:19:49,760
outscope right

3413
02:19:49,760 --> 02:19:51,760
and

3414
02:19:51,760 --> 02:19:53,680
but but it's okay when you what you have

3415
02:19:53,680 --> 02:19:55,040
there it's uh

3416
02:19:55,040 --> 02:19:57,200
it's okay it's uh what should be what

3417
02:19:57,200 --> 02:19:59,200
should be

3418
02:19:59,200 --> 02:20:00,080
yep

3419
02:20:00,080 --> 02:20:02,720
what should be

3420
02:20:02,720 --> 02:20:05,040
so if you guys

3421
02:20:05,040 --> 02:20:05,920

3422
02:20:05,920 --> 02:20:09,680
have questions after the workshop and

3423
02:20:09,680 --> 02:20:12,720

with many researchers

3426
02:20:16,479 --> 02:20:18,000
that

3427
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:21,520
asked me for advice or

3428

3429
02:20:22,720 --> 02:20:25,760
especially guys from india

3430
02:20:25,760 --> 02:20:27,040
they're

3431
02:20:27,040 --> 02:20:28,640
pretty

3432
02:20:28,640 --> 02:20:31,840
pretty nice and polite people

3433
02:20:31,840 --> 02:20:32,720
and

3434
02:20:32,720 --> 02:20:35,760
i help people because i i have struggled

3435
02:20:35,760 --> 02:20:36,800
and

3436
02:20:36,800 --> 02:20:39,680
and in my in my country i don't work

3437
02:20:39,680 --> 02:20:41,200
with anyone from

3438
02:20:41,200 --> 02:20:43,760
from here because

3439
02:20:43,760 --> 02:20:45,920
people are too

3440
02:20:45,920 --> 02:20:49,200
people working in security field or in

3441
02:20:49,200 --> 02:20:50,640
bounty hunting

3442
02:20:50,640 --> 02:20:52,880
there are two

3443
02:20:52,880 --> 02:20:55,520
how can i say it they don't share

3444
02:20:55,520 --> 02:20:57,280
they wouldn't

3445
02:20:57,280 --> 02:20:58,880
they wouldn't give you

3446
02:20:58,880 --> 02:21:02,880
advice or tips or what software to use

3447
02:21:02,880 --> 02:21:04,479
because they're worried that

3448
02:21:04,479 --> 02:21:07,039
you might

3449
02:21:07,439 --> 02:21:09,920
take them

3450
02:21:09,920 --> 02:21:12,640
check some bounties from them you know

3451
02:21:12,640 --> 02:21:14,800
like they're worried about

3452
02:21:14,800 --> 02:21:18,800
if more people get into the field less

3453
02:21:18,800 --> 02:21:23,120
less work they will have which is not uh

3454
02:21:23,120 --> 02:21:24,960
something that i share i actually do the

3455
02:21:24,960 --> 02:21:27,839
opposite

3456
02:21:28,160 --> 02:21:29,120
and

3457
02:21:29,120 --> 02:21:31,359
and

3458
02:21:32,240 --> 02:21:33,680
i remember one

3459
02:21:33,680 --> 02:21:35,760
i'm not gonna say names but

3460
02:21:35,760 --> 02:21:36,800
the top

3461
02:21:36,800 --> 02:21:38,319
one in chile

3462
02:21:38,319 --> 02:21:41,439
i met him like three years ago

3463
02:21:41,439 --> 02:21:43,359
and he was telling me now i'm doing

3464
02:21:43,359 --> 02:21:46,160
probably hunting and earning some money

3465
02:21:46,160 --> 02:21:48,560
blah blah it's pretty cool

3466
02:21:48,560 --> 02:21:50,960
and i said well i i would like to do it

3467
02:21:50,960 --> 02:21:52,640
as well but i don't know where to start

3468
02:21:52,640 --> 02:21:55,680
and he was saying oh just i'll give my

3469
02:21:55,680 --> 02:21:59,200
contact information telegram probably

3470
02:21:59,200 --> 02:22:00,960
two years later

3471
02:22:00,960 --> 02:22:02,160
he hasn't

3472
02:22:02,160 --> 02:22:04,319
sent me a link or

3473
02:22:04,319 --> 02:22:06,479
anything that would help me

3474
02:22:06,479 --> 02:22:09,200
and after i started doing bubanti for

3475
02:22:09,200 --> 02:22:11,040
real for serious

3476
02:22:11,040 --> 02:22:14,880
i reach again kimi and other people

3477
02:22:14,880 --> 02:22:16,560
and it was the same you know like i

3478
02:22:16,560 --> 02:22:18,640
would tell them well you know

3479
02:22:18,640 --> 02:22:20,960
i'm doing good i've discovered some bugs

3480
02:22:20,960 --> 02:22:23,680
i've got some bounties

3481
02:22:23,680 --> 02:22:25,920
and nothing on return

3482
02:22:25,920 --> 02:22:27,120
and

3483
02:22:27,120 --> 02:22:29,600
that's that happens in some cultures

3484
02:22:29,600 --> 02:22:32,560
that their communities are very small in

3485
02:22:32,560 --> 02:22:34,000
in chile

3486
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:37,359
the cyber security community i mean

3487
02:22:37,359 --> 02:22:40,479
top four bounty hunters i think we are

3488
02:22:40,479 --> 02:22:42,240
10

3489
02:22:42,240 --> 02:22:44,880
on hacker one that have more than one

3490
02:22:44,880 --> 02:22:47,359
reputation point probably probably a bit

3491
02:22:47,359 --> 02:22:50,160
more 15 something like that so when the

3492
02:22:50,160 --> 02:22:52,640
communities are too small people and

3493
02:22:52,640 --> 02:22:54,960
people and the culture of obviously our

3494
02:22:54,960 --> 02:22:57,200
culture is

3495
02:22:57,200 --> 02:22:59,439
we are like that we don't we don't

3496
02:22:59,439 --> 02:23:01,840
cooperate that much we're pretty a

3497
02:23:01,840 --> 02:23:04,800
pretty individualistic culture

3498
02:23:04,800 --> 02:23:07,200
and yes indian guys are

3499
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:10,640
very friendly very respectful and i

3500
02:23:10,640 --> 02:23:12,560
actually

3501
02:23:12,560 --> 02:23:14,960
share i mean actually

3502
02:23:14,960 --> 02:23:16,160
um

3503
02:23:16,160 --> 02:23:18,479
for sometimes they cannot

3504
02:23:18,479 --> 02:23:19,680
they don't have for example what

3505
02:23:19,680 --> 02:23:21,520
happened yesterday last night like i was

3506
02:23:21,520 --> 02:23:23,040
actually working late

3507
02:23:23,040 --> 02:23:24,960
one guy told me that he had a they saw

3508
02:23:24,960 --> 02:23:26,640
the might take over that i showed you it

3509
02:23:26,640 --> 02:23:28,800
was somebody that couldn't

3510
02:23:28,800 --> 02:23:31,760
take it over because he needed to pay

3511
02:23:31,760 --> 02:23:34,319
fifty dollars and in india

3512
02:23:34,319 --> 02:23:36,479
fifty dollars is a lot more than what it

3513
02:23:36,479 --> 02:23:37,920
is here

3514
02:23:37,920 --> 02:23:39,600
so he said i don't have any money can

3515
02:23:39,600 --> 02:23:41,200
you do it for me and i did it for him

3516
02:23:41,200 --> 02:23:42,960
and said well we can split

3517
02:23:42,960 --> 02:23:44,960
the bounty

3518
02:23:44,960 --> 02:23:46,880
fair and

3519
02:23:46,880 --> 02:23:47,840
yeah

3520
02:23:47,840 --> 02:23:50,399
it's uh

3521
02:23:50,399 --> 02:23:51,439
so

3522
02:23:51,439 --> 02:23:54,319
so anna tell me if you

3523
02:23:54,319 --> 02:23:55,439
if you run

3524
02:23:55,439 --> 02:23:57,359
if you can run the last

3525
02:23:57,359 --> 02:23:58,960
command that i'm shooting on my screen

3526
02:23:58,960 --> 02:24:03,679
so what i'm doing here is that

3527
02:24:04,160 --> 02:24:07,520
what i'm doing here is that i i am

3528
02:24:07,520 --> 02:24:10,160
retrieving the scope in

3529
02:24:10,160 --> 02:24:12,880
i'm calling so finder to find to

3530
02:24:12,880 --> 02:24:14,880
retrieve the subdomains

3531
02:24:14,880 --> 02:24:17,760
and then i will add all the soft domains

3532
02:24:17,760 --> 02:24:20,240
in in this important part this slash

3533
02:24:20,240 --> 02:24:22,479
here

3534
02:24:22,800 --> 02:24:24,479
because you if you don't put this lash

3535
02:24:24,479 --> 02:24:26,880
here it wouldn't work this lash symbol

3536
02:24:26,880 --> 02:24:29,840
it's a symbol to to indicate the

3537
02:24:29,840 --> 02:24:33,439
input coming from the pipe

3538
02:24:33,439 --> 02:24:36,560
and the s is uh just a tag that is

3539
02:24:36,560 --> 02:24:38,800
source but i don't i put it all the time

3540
02:24:38,800 --> 02:24:40,720
but i never use it

3541
02:24:40,720 --> 02:24:43,760
but that domain

3542
02:24:43,760 --> 02:24:46,640
will have a tag

3543
02:24:46,640 --> 02:24:49,120
that will be sub finder just in i wanted

3544
02:24:49,120 --> 02:24:50,240
to

3545
02:24:50,240 --> 02:24:51,840
i wanted to

3546
02:24:51,840 --> 02:24:54,479
mark the domains that were added by

3547
02:24:54,479 --> 02:24:55,680
different tools

3548
02:24:55,680 --> 02:24:57,439
so at some point of

3549
02:24:57,439 --> 02:24:58,800
probably

3550
02:24:58,800 --> 02:25:01,359
at some point of my life i will

3551
02:25:01,359 --> 02:25:03,600
you know have many tools adding domains

3552
02:25:03,600 --> 02:25:05,359
and i will say let's say

3553
02:25:05,359 --> 02:25:07,280
let's see how many

3554
02:25:07,280 --> 02:25:10,560
like different or unique domains were

3555
02:25:10,560 --> 02:25:12,800
retrieved by which tool

3556
02:25:12,800 --> 02:25:16,000
so the show new will show you of course

3557
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:17,680
like the work says

3558
02:25:17,680 --> 02:25:20,160
we'll show you the new added

3559
02:25:20,160 --> 02:25:21,760
it wouldn't show you than the ones that

3560
02:25:21,760 --> 02:25:23,600
are duplicated

3561
02:25:23,600 --> 02:25:24,479
so

3562
02:25:24,479 --> 02:25:27,359
let's now i just gonna keep it running

3563
02:25:27,359 --> 02:25:30,960
it will take less than a minute

3564
02:25:32,560 --> 02:25:34,880
yeah so you have the good output

3565
02:25:34,880 --> 02:25:37,920
it's working for you

3566
02:25:38,319 --> 02:25:40,640
congratulations

3567
02:25:40,640 --> 02:25:42,960
you added so it's important to add

3568
02:25:42,960 --> 02:25:45,200
the domains because on the next exercise

3569
02:25:45,200 --> 02:25:46,479
we need

3570
02:25:46,479 --> 02:25:49,920
we need those domains to

3571
02:25:49,920 --> 02:25:53,840
for the exercise to work

3572
02:26:00,399 --> 02:26:03,760
so let's wait for the

3573
02:26:04,240 --> 02:26:07,840
let's wait for the command to finish

3574
02:26:43,520 --> 02:26:46,240
so i don't know why it's taking

3575
02:26:46,240 --> 02:26:47,439
so long

3576
02:26:47,439 --> 02:26:48,720
during my

3577
02:26:48,720 --> 02:26:50,800
during my tests

3578
02:26:50,800 --> 02:26:52,720
you didn't tell them but probably it's

3579
02:26:52,720 --> 02:26:55,680
gonna be just a minute

3580
02:26:55,680 --> 02:26:59,160
so in the meantime

3581
02:27:01,480 --> 02:27:09,000
[Music]

3582
02:27:09,680 --> 02:27:11,840
and

3583
02:27:12,080 --> 02:27:15,880
i don't need trailer

3584
02:27:16,650 --> 02:27:24,160
[Music]

3585
02:27:24,160 --> 02:27:27,920
what else i have here

3586
02:27:28,080 --> 02:27:31,040
too many

3587
02:27:31,040 --> 02:27:34,160
okay so in the slides we already did

3588
02:27:34,160 --> 02:27:36,720
exercise one

3589
02:27:36,720 --> 02:27:39,120
we're going

3590
02:27:39,120 --> 02:27:41,920
in exercise two

3591
02:27:41,920 --> 02:27:46,240
which is basically use it to finder

3592
02:27:46,240 --> 02:27:47,600
and

3593
02:27:47,600 --> 02:27:51,680
my computer is about to explode

3594
02:27:51,680 --> 02:27:54,720
probably assume that i'm using zoom on

3595
02:27:54,720 --> 02:27:56,479
linux

3596
02:27:56,479 --> 02:27:59,840
and actually last time

3597
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,479
happened the same

3598
02:28:02,479 --> 02:28:05,199
last time in

3599
02:28:05,760 --> 02:28:09,160
this conference

3600
02:28:12,880 --> 02:28:16,080
that's firefox

3601
02:28:17,439 --> 02:28:20,080
okay so

3602
02:28:20,240 --> 02:28:23,199
so we finished

3603
02:28:23,280 --> 02:28:27,200
let me see what happened

3604
02:28:27,200 --> 02:28:31,040
let me see the domains

3605
02:28:34,479 --> 02:28:38,080
so we have many domains

3606
02:28:38,800 --> 02:28:40,479
it didn't show new probably because i

3607
02:28:40,479 --> 02:28:42,640
run it before

3608
02:28:42,640 --> 02:28:45,760
so here i have my domains right

3609
02:28:45,760 --> 02:28:46,720
and

3610
02:28:46,720 --> 02:28:48,960
we we can do the same

3611
02:28:48,960 --> 02:28:51,199
for

3612
02:28:51,280 --> 02:28:54,990
we can do exactly the same doing

3613
02:28:54,990 --> 02:28:57,520
[Music]

3614
02:28:57,520 --> 02:29:01,200
doing a set finder

3615
02:29:01,680 --> 02:29:04,240
which is

3616
02:29:06,640 --> 02:29:09,680
yeah so in the in the guy i added uh the

3617
02:29:09,680 --> 02:29:11,439
tool that i mentioned before

3618
02:29:11,439 --> 02:29:13,200
that it's

3619
02:29:13,200 --> 02:29:17,520
dns exec dns x that will filter

3620
02:29:17,520 --> 02:29:20,160
the subdomains that are not responding

3621
02:29:20,160 --> 02:29:21,520
to an ap

3622
02:29:21,520 --> 02:29:25,120
so that way we will simplify

3623
02:29:25,120 --> 02:29:25,920
or

3624
02:29:25,920 --> 02:29:30,000
speed up a bit the process

3625
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,640
and so now that we have our domains one

3626
02:29:32,640 --> 02:29:36,240
of the exercises is to count

3627
02:29:36,240 --> 02:29:37,680
to count

3628
02:29:37,680 --> 02:29:39,760
to count

3629
02:29:39,760 --> 02:29:41,600
how many domains we have

3630
02:29:41,600 --> 02:29:43,200
so this is one of one of the

3631
02:29:43,200 --> 02:29:45,120
considerations that i need to mention

3632
02:29:45,120 --> 02:29:48,240
when i run it this way

3633
02:29:48,240 --> 02:29:50,560
it will retrieve the active

3634
02:29:50,560 --> 02:29:52,319
program

3635
02:29:52,319 --> 02:29:56,240
but if i include the p it will retrieve

3636
02:29:56,240 --> 02:29:57,760
the data

3637
02:29:57,760 --> 02:29:59,840
from the program that i'm calling that

3638
02:29:59,840 --> 02:30:02,000
i'm using as a parameter

3639
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,160
and

3640
02:30:04,160 --> 02:30:07,280
i suggest you to you always use with a

3641
02:30:07,280 --> 02:30:08,479
parameter

3642
02:30:08,479 --> 02:30:09,840
because sometimes you don't know which

3643
02:30:09,840 --> 02:30:13,200
one is active and which one is active

3644
02:30:13,200 --> 02:30:16,000
is actually described or defined in this

3645
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:17,680
file

3646
02:30:17,680 --> 02:30:20,640
and if you see here

3647
02:30:21,120 --> 02:30:21,620
um

3648
02:30:21,620 --> 02:30:22,960
[Music]

3649
02:30:22,960 --> 02:30:24,640
here sets

3650
02:30:24,640 --> 02:30:26,640
program

3651
02:30:26,640 --> 02:30:29,040
enter comma that's also confusing on the

3652
02:30:29,040 --> 02:30:30,160
tool but

3653
02:30:30,160 --> 02:30:34,319
i don't use it so i don't care so your

3654
02:30:34,319 --> 02:30:37,920
couch deviates it's

3655
02:30:38,399 --> 02:30:41,200
deployed locally

3656
02:30:41,200 --> 02:30:42,160
so

3657
02:30:42,160 --> 02:30:43,280
let's

3658
02:30:43,280 --> 02:30:47,359
um okay so

3659
02:30:47,359 --> 02:30:48,960
we missed

3660
02:30:48,960 --> 02:30:51,840
we missed one part

3661
02:30:51,840 --> 02:30:55,920
that is adding the urls right

3662
02:30:56,560 --> 02:30:58,720
so

3663
02:30:59,520 --> 02:31:02,640
to other urls

3664
02:31:03,120 --> 02:31:07,600
we need to do pretty much the same

3665
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,960
but in this case

3666
02:31:10,960 --> 02:31:12,319
we

3667
02:31:12,319 --> 02:31:14,080
will do

3668
02:31:14,080 --> 02:31:17,280
bvf domains

3669
02:31:17,600 --> 02:31:19,439
and

3670
02:31:19,439 --> 02:31:22,880
from domains

3671
02:31:23,520 --> 02:31:25,390
we will

3672
02:31:25,390 --> 02:31:27,200
[Music]

3673
02:31:27,200 --> 02:31:28,960
clean the ones that i do not reply do

3674
02:31:28,960 --> 02:31:33,720
not respond and use httpx

3675
02:31:34,479 --> 02:31:38,880
and with the silent plug yes i guess

3676
02:31:38,880 --> 02:31:41,359
and then i will

3677
02:31:41,359 --> 02:31:43,439
use here url

3678
02:31:43,439 --> 02:31:44,960
add

3679
02:31:44,960 --> 02:31:47,200
and here as a flag source i will use

3680
02:31:47,200 --> 02:31:49,359
httpx

3681
02:31:49,359 --> 02:31:52,800
so let's run in let's run it far by part

3682
02:31:52,800 --> 02:31:56,560
so if we

3683
02:31:56,560 --> 02:31:59,120
okay doesn't work

3684
02:31:59,120 --> 02:32:01,920
so these are my domains let's run dns

3685
02:32:01,920 --> 02:32:03,359
sex

3686
02:32:03,359 --> 02:32:06,479
with 200 threads

3687
02:32:07,520 --> 02:32:09,840
so yeah we can do this exercise count

3688
02:32:09,840 --> 02:32:12,080
them

3689
02:32:12,240 --> 02:32:15,199
so there are

3690
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:19,120
300

3691
02:32:19,120 --> 02:32:22,240
and 33 and see what happens when we

3692
02:32:22,240 --> 02:32:25,840
filter them with the nsx

3693
02:32:25,840 --> 02:32:26,800
so

3694
02:32:26,800 --> 02:32:30,160
we ended up having half

3695
02:32:30,160 --> 02:32:32,000
half of the domains we just cleaned them

3696
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,160
up

3697
02:32:34,640 --> 02:32:36,560
which is pretty fast it's pretty cool

3698
02:32:36,560 --> 02:32:40,319
because that way when we go to httpx

3699
02:32:40,319 --> 02:32:42,479
we already we have less

3700
02:32:42,479 --> 02:32:44,880
less results to

3701
02:32:44,880 --> 02:32:46,319
to analyze

3702
02:32:46,319 --> 02:32:48,399
so what

3703
02:32:48,399 --> 02:32:50,240
if you understand the piping what it's

3704
02:32:50,240 --> 02:32:51,600
doing it's like

3705
02:32:51,600 --> 02:32:54,160
retrieving the domains and then asking

3706
02:32:54,160 --> 02:32:56,800
didn't ask which domains do not resolve

3707
02:32:56,800 --> 02:32:59,600
so the ones that i need to get rid of

3708
02:32:59,600 --> 02:33:02,000
and then the ones that are valid i will

3709
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,800
send it to httpx

3710
02:33:04,800 --> 02:33:07,359
let's see what happened here

3711
02:33:07,359 --> 02:33:09,840
okay so we have it

3712
02:33:09,840 --> 02:33:12,960
okay yes because so you're silent

3713
02:33:12,960 --> 02:33:15,439
shouldn't be silent

3714
02:33:15,439 --> 02:33:18,600
i guess

3715
02:33:22,850 --> 02:33:25,969

[Music]

3717
02:33:40,640 --> 02:33:44,000
it's probably because of the silent

3718
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:47,720
yes gtx

3719
02:34:09,520 --> 02:34:11,359
one of the cool things about the tools

3720
02:34:11,359 --> 02:34:13,359
is that things are the same developer

3721
02:34:13,359 --> 02:34:15,359
they have the same

3722
02:34:15,359 --> 02:34:18,319
well just like

3723
02:34:18,960 --> 02:34:23,119
they have the same pretty much the same

3724
02:34:23,910 --> 02:34:26,240

thread

3726
02:34:29,600 --> 02:34:31,680
there

3727
02:34:31,680 --> 02:34:33,760
they have pretty much the same yeah one

3728
02:34:33,760 --> 02:34:36,000
words better

3729
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,080
so yeah now i have the urls

3730
02:34:38,080 --> 02:34:41,040
that are responding

3731
02:34:41,040 --> 02:34:42,880
so i'm just going to cancel it well let

3732
02:34:42,880 --> 02:34:44,880
me finish it

3733
02:34:44,880 --> 02:34:46,399
um

3734
02:34:46,399 --> 02:34:48,240
i don't know why it didn't work

3735
02:34:48,240 --> 02:34:49,680
beginning probably is because of the

3736
02:34:49,680 --> 02:34:51,439
silent

3737
02:34:51,439 --> 02:34:52,399
flag

3738
02:34:52,399 --> 02:34:54,319
it shouldn't be

3739
02:34:54,319 --> 02:34:56,560
oh yeah that's the thing that silent

3740
02:34:56,560 --> 02:34:59,840
will only output the file and not

3741
02:34:59,840 --> 02:35:02,160
to the

3742
02:35:02,160 --> 02:35:04,479
to the standard output

3743
02:35:04,479 --> 02:35:08,800
it's actually working now that's hard

3744
02:35:11,520 --> 02:35:16,319
so silent will get rid of this banner

3745
02:35:18,880 --> 02:35:22,560
they will only output the

3746
02:35:23,520 --> 02:35:27,120
the urls so in this case we'll get a one

3747
02:35:27,120 --> 02:35:29,439
it doesn't make any sense so i'm just

3748
02:35:29,439 --> 02:35:33,280
gonna go back to what it worked

3749
02:35:35,200 --> 02:35:38,000
i don't know why that's happening

3750
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:39,760
probably something related to the silent

3751
02:35:39,760 --> 02:35:40,800
flag

3752
02:35:40,800 --> 02:35:43,760
so uh what i'm gonna do now is that i

3753
02:35:43,760 --> 02:35:46,479
need to add those urls

3754
02:35:46,479 --> 02:35:50,000
so just like what i did with the domains

3755
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,479
i will

3756
02:35:52,640 --> 02:35:55,840
get that output

3757
02:35:57,359 --> 02:36:00,000
and i will

3758
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:01,200
add it

3759
02:36:01,200 --> 02:36:02,880
to my program

3760
02:36:02,880 --> 02:36:07,560
and i will use to set the tag httpx

3761
02:36:08,080 --> 02:36:10,319
and

3762
02:36:10,319 --> 02:36:14,319
wait run run key

3763
02:36:17,520 --> 02:36:19,040
okay

3764
02:36:19,040 --> 02:36:23,080
so let's run it

3765
02:36:34,720 --> 02:36:37,920
so now as you can see we have

3766
02:36:37,920 --> 02:36:40,640
added the urls

3767
02:36:40,640 --> 02:36:42,560
and we can check them

3768
02:36:42,560 --> 02:36:44,720
like this counting them

3769
02:36:44,720 --> 02:36:46,720
we have

3770
02:36:46,720 --> 02:36:49,960
we have

3771
02:37:00,479 --> 02:37:03,120
because my computer is some skin in my

3772
02:37:03,120 --> 02:37:05,840
machine

3773
02:37:09,920 --> 02:37:13,920
so 33 73

3774
02:37:13,920 --> 02:37:15,520
and

3775
02:37:15,520 --> 02:37:19,840
so the exercise number two was about

3776
02:37:19,840 --> 02:37:22,000
first question about what was

3777
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:23,840
usually subfinder

3778
02:37:23,840 --> 02:37:27,840
using asset finder which is the same

3779
02:37:27,840 --> 02:37:29,520
is the same as

3780
02:37:29,520 --> 02:37:32,520
subfinder

3781
02:37:32,560 --> 02:37:36,080
just to add domains

3782
02:37:38,720 --> 02:37:41,520
so we can we can just skip that part and

3783
02:37:41,520 --> 02:37:45,800
on the answer chip i'm gonna

3784
02:37:46,160 --> 02:37:48,880
include it

3785
02:37:49,920 --> 02:37:52,160
so

3786
02:37:52,800 --> 02:37:55,760
so i added here at the urls

3787
02:37:55,760 --> 02:37:58,800
for you to remember

3788
02:37:59,040 --> 02:38:01,280
and yes

3789
02:38:01,280 --> 02:38:02,479
we

3790
02:38:02,479 --> 02:38:04,960
need to add asset finder

3791
02:38:04,960 --> 02:38:07,520
an asset finder is

3792
02:38:07,520 --> 02:38:10,000
the same

3793
02:38:10,160 --> 02:38:12,720
the same just you need you need asset

3794
02:38:12,720 --> 02:38:15,720
finder

3795
02:38:18,160 --> 02:38:20,640
set finder i think it's with a minus d i

3796
02:38:20,640 --> 02:38:23,280
know it's already working there

3797
02:38:23,280 --> 02:38:25,439
so yeah we're gonna run asset finder

3798
02:38:25,439 --> 02:38:26,840
just like

3799
02:38:26,840 --> 02:38:30,000
that and we're gonna see

3800
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:31,840
we're gonna use here

3801
02:38:31,840 --> 02:38:34,080
just

3802
02:38:34,160 --> 02:38:37,359
a set finder

3803
02:38:37,760 --> 02:38:40,080
and maybe something one

3804
02:38:40,080 --> 02:38:42,399
yes

3805
02:38:42,399 --> 02:38:45,439
we're gonna see if we get new domains

3806
02:38:45,439 --> 02:38:48,240
if we got any new domain

3807
02:38:48,240 --> 02:38:50,479
so

3808
02:38:52,240 --> 02:38:54,399
i'm going to copy it and put it on the

3809
02:38:54,399 --> 02:38:57,720
answer sheet

3810
02:39:00,479 --> 02:39:02,640
using acid

3811
02:39:02,640 --> 02:39:05,119
finder

3812
02:39:08,960 --> 02:39:11,760
yeah as you can see we got we have new

3813
02:39:11,760 --> 02:39:14,240
we got new new domains so that's why i

3814
02:39:14,240 --> 02:39:15,920
use them both

3815
02:39:15,920 --> 02:39:19,040
because of some i have different results

3816
02:39:19,040 --> 02:39:23,120
so now we do the same to add

3817
02:39:23,359 --> 02:39:25,280
from the domains that we have

3818
02:39:25,280 --> 02:39:26,960
we need to repeat the process of adding

3819
02:39:26,960 --> 02:39:28,720
the urls right because we have new

3820
02:39:28,720 --> 02:39:30,240
domains now

3821
02:39:30,240 --> 02:39:35,640
let's see if we have any new urls

3822
02:39:45,200 --> 02:39:47,520
it's going to take a while

3823
02:39:47,520 --> 02:39:49,680
okay so we have new you know urls which

3824
02:39:49,680 --> 02:39:50,880
is cool

3825
02:39:50,880 --> 02:39:53,359
because we we we

3826
02:39:53,359 --> 02:39:56,160
expanded our store in scope just by

3827
02:39:56,160 --> 02:39:58,479
running asset finder

3828
02:39:58,479 --> 02:39:59,520
so

3829
02:39:59,520 --> 02:40:03,520
we had how many euros before

3830
02:40:04,290 --> 02:40:05,359
[Music]

3831
02:40:05,359 --> 02:40:07,200
73

3832
02:40:07,200 --> 02:40:09,760
and now we have 174

3833
02:40:09,760 --> 02:40:10,720
which is

3834
02:40:10,720 --> 02:40:12,399
cool

3835
02:40:12,399 --> 02:40:14,720
and

3836
02:40:14,720 --> 02:40:18,240
just that's it let me check

3837
02:40:18,240 --> 02:40:21,600
what else uh okay so one of the

3838
02:40:21,600 --> 02:40:23,840
one of the other tools that you could

3839
02:40:23,840 --> 02:40:25,040
use

3840
02:40:25,040 --> 02:40:29,600
as alternative to httpx it's uh

3841
02:40:29,600 --> 02:40:30,399
it's

3842
02:40:30,399 --> 02:40:32,720
http pro http

3843
02:40:32,720 --> 02:40:36,160
but i don't use it anymore because

3844
02:40:36,160 --> 02:40:39,760
it's it's not maintained it's uh

3845
02:40:39,760 --> 02:40:42,240
abandoned pretty much

3846
02:40:42,240 --> 02:40:45,600
by the developer and

3847
02:40:45,600 --> 02:40:47,279
let's see if it works but they do the

3848
02:40:47,279 --> 02:40:50,000
same they do the same thing

3849
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:50,960
they

3850
02:40:50,960 --> 02:40:54,080
prove yeah so

3851
02:40:54,080 --> 02:40:56,479
if you run it that way and

3852
02:40:56,479 --> 02:41:00,560
we here put http proof

3853
02:41:01,760 --> 02:41:03,120
we will see

3854
02:41:03,120 --> 02:41:07,120
how many domains i mean how many urls

3855
02:41:07,120 --> 02:41:08,960
does it find

3856
02:41:08,960 --> 02:41:12,000
if you find any new domain name any in

3857
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,319
your urls

3858
02:41:14,319 --> 02:41:17,600
from the domains that we have

3859
02:41:17,600 --> 02:41:20,720
so let's wait for

3860
02:41:20,720 --> 02:41:23,840
a couple seconds

3861
02:41:26,399 --> 02:41:30,000
so yeah let me add it

3862
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:31,120
to

3863
02:41:31,120 --> 02:41:33,920
then search it

3864
02:41:34,800 --> 02:41:36,240
so

3865
02:41:36,240 --> 02:41:37,840
this is

3866
02:41:37,840 --> 02:41:40,080
okay

3867
02:41:40,880 --> 02:41:42,960
so this is

3868
02:41:42,960 --> 02:41:44,960
so finder

3869
02:41:44,960 --> 02:41:46,000
wait

3870
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:49,200
no httpx

3871
02:41:49,680 --> 02:41:54,080
and this one is http pro

3872
02:41:54,319 --> 02:41:58,319
if you see he added more

3873
02:41:58,319 --> 02:42:02,319
and now we have 191 which is

3874
02:42:02,319 --> 02:42:06,080
probably is he is adding http instead of

3875
02:42:06,080 --> 02:42:08,240
http x

3876
02:42:08,240 --> 02:42:09,680
so that's something that we need to

3877
02:42:09,680 --> 02:42:11,840
check at some point but for purpose of

3878
02:42:11,840 --> 02:42:15,359
the workshop it's fine

3879
02:42:15,840 --> 02:42:19,760
okay so exercise one it's

3880
02:42:19,760 --> 02:42:22,000
done exercise two

3881
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:23,359
also done

3882
02:42:23,359 --> 02:42:24,720
count the number at the end you know how

3883
02:42:24,720 --> 02:42:28,350
to do that proposed exercise

3884
02:42:28,350 --> 02:42:30,479
[Music]

3885
02:42:30,479 --> 02:42:32,720
okay

3886
02:42:33,200 --> 02:42:35,920
yeah this one's cool this this thing's

3887
02:42:35,920 --> 02:42:37,200
cool

3888
02:42:37,200 --> 02:42:40,640
you could use notify

3889
02:42:40,640 --> 02:42:43,920
i need to configure it yeah

3890
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:45,439
well one of the things that you could do

3891
02:42:45,439 --> 02:42:48,960
on vbrf it's uh

3892
02:42:48,960 --> 02:42:51,600
listen for changes and

3893
02:42:51,600 --> 02:42:54,720
rule run things out of

3894
02:42:54,720 --> 02:42:56,960
changes on the new or on the urls of the

3895
02:42:56,960 --> 02:43:01,039
domains i don't use that function

3896
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:03,040
but

3897
02:43:03,040 --> 02:43:05,600
also in the last part here you can see

3898
02:43:05,600 --> 02:43:07,520
that

3899
02:43:07,520 --> 02:43:09,840
the

3900
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:13,279
i have two functions that will do all

3901
02:43:13,279 --> 02:43:15,279
this process

3902
02:43:15,279 --> 02:43:16,399
that you

3903
02:43:16,399 --> 02:43:17,840
that you just watch

3904
02:43:17,840 --> 02:43:19,120
manually

3905
02:43:19,120 --> 02:43:20,840
and it does it

3906
02:43:20,840 --> 02:43:24,240
automatically you just need to run

3907
02:43:24,240 --> 02:43:25,600
actually they have programs that

3908
02:43:25,600 --> 02:43:27,840
everything that i show you but

3909
02:43:27,840 --> 02:43:29,040
if you want to do it manually it's

3910
02:43:29,040 --> 02:43:31,200
better

3911
02:43:31,200 --> 02:43:33,520
okay so now we're going to go

3912
02:43:33,520 --> 02:43:36,319
if you have any doubts

3913
02:43:36,319 --> 02:43:39,519
i'm gonna check the questions

3914
02:43:43,200 --> 02:43:47,960
so anna left i think

3915
02:43:54,960 --> 02:43:55,920
okay

3916
02:43:55,920 --> 02:43:57,600
so next

3917
02:43:57,600 --> 02:43:58,479
next

3918
02:43:58,479 --> 02:44:02,160
exercise it's uh

3919
02:44:03,200 --> 02:44:07,600
next exercise where is it

3920
02:44:10,560 --> 02:44:14,319
let me get rid of these steps

3921
02:44:14,319 --> 02:44:16,479
and i'm not helping me okay so next

3922
02:44:16,479 --> 02:44:18,560
exercise it's uh

3923
02:44:18,560 --> 02:44:20,160
piping urls

3924
02:44:20,160 --> 02:44:23,520
into nuclei and improvement templates

3925
02:44:23,520 --> 02:44:25,760
so

3926
02:44:25,820 --> 02:44:28,930
[Music]

3927
02:44:30,960 --> 02:44:33,279
one of the things that

3928
02:44:33,279 --> 02:44:34,640
you can do

3929
02:44:34,640 --> 02:44:36,319
very easily with

3930
02:44:36,319 --> 02:44:37,680
pvf

3931
02:44:37,680 --> 02:44:39,520
is that you can retrieve the urls of

3932
02:44:39,520 --> 02:44:42,160
your programs or all programs you can do

3933
02:44:42,160 --> 02:44:44,399
that

3934
02:44:44,479 --> 02:44:49,279
so let's let's pipe it to nuclei

3935
02:44:49,279 --> 02:44:52,319
which again it's a vulnerability scanner

3936
02:44:52,319 --> 02:44:54,560
that uses templates

3937
02:44:54,560 --> 02:44:58,240
and we are going to

3938
02:44:58,560 --> 02:45:00,800
send it to

3939
02:45:00,800 --> 02:45:04,000
this template that

3940
02:45:04,399 --> 02:45:08,800
it will detect php admin panels

3941
02:45:08,800 --> 02:45:10,160
this is actually

3942
02:45:10,160 --> 02:45:12,479
i got several bounties

3943
02:45:12,479 --> 02:45:15,760
i got like four

3944
02:45:15,760 --> 02:45:20,080
four bounties of 150 euros i guess

3945
02:45:20,080 --> 02:45:22,399
looking for vulnerable

3946
02:45:22,399 --> 02:45:25,440
php my admin

3947
02:45:25,440 --> 02:45:26,960
[Music]

3948
02:45:26,960 --> 02:45:29,439
instances

3949
02:45:29,439 --> 02:45:32,080
so in this exercise we need to pipe so

3950
02:45:32,080 --> 02:45:34,319
it says run nuclear template

3951
02:45:34,319 --> 02:45:36,720
against all urls so we're retrieving all

3952
02:45:36,720 --> 02:45:38,479
the urls

3953
02:45:38,479 --> 02:45:42,640
and we are piping it to nuclei

3954
02:45:42,640 --> 02:45:45,920
so just wait for a bit

3955
02:45:45,920 --> 02:45:47,680
now one way to

3956
02:45:47,680 --> 02:45:49,760
improve the speed

3957
02:45:49,760 --> 02:45:52,240
is using rate limit

3958
02:45:52,240 --> 02:45:54,720
400 and

3959
02:45:54,720 --> 02:45:58,240
yes the only one template

3960
02:45:58,560 --> 02:46:02,560
ah let me show you on another

3961
02:46:02,560 --> 02:46:07,359
stats and stats will show you

3962
02:46:07,520 --> 02:46:11,200
the stats of the process

3963
02:46:11,200 --> 02:46:13,600
every five seconds seconds so if you see

3964
02:46:13,600 --> 02:46:14,399
here

3965
02:46:14,399 --> 02:46:17,520
he's running one template against 394

3966
02:46:17,520 --> 02:46:18,960
costs

3967
02:46:18,960 --> 02:46:21,680
it's weighing 62 requests per second

3968
02:46:21,680 --> 02:46:24,720
which is pretty decent

3969
02:46:24,720 --> 02:46:27,200
and it's currently 20

3970
02:46:27,200 --> 02:46:29,680
26

3971
02:46:30,160 --> 02:46:31,279
so

3972
02:46:31,279 --> 02:46:33,600
yes just gonna take

3973
02:46:33,600 --> 02:46:34,560
a bit

3974
02:46:34,560 --> 02:46:37,560
more

3975
02:46:50,399 --> 02:46:52,240
so this is this exercise is more

3976
02:46:52,240 --> 02:46:54,399
difficult it's more it's much more

3977
02:46:54,399 --> 02:46:56,319
difficult to understand

3978
02:46:56,319 --> 02:47:00,000
because it's uh related or regarding

3979
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:03,120
the template itself

3980
02:47:03,120 --> 02:47:05,359
so i will show you the templates i will

3981
02:47:05,359 --> 02:47:07,840
show you one template but

3982
02:47:07,840 --> 02:47:11,120
i'm running i'm doing this this

3983
02:47:11,120 --> 02:47:12,880
part

3984
02:47:12,880 --> 02:47:14,160
because i wanted to show you that i

3985
02:47:14,160 --> 02:47:16,800
won't get any results and

3986
02:47:16,800 --> 02:47:20,640
what can i do to get results

3987
02:47:20,640 --> 02:47:23,520
so just let's just finish it

3988
02:47:23,520 --> 02:47:25,600
otherwise you might

3989
02:47:25,600 --> 02:47:29,160
think that i'm lying

3990
02:47:35,920 --> 02:47:39,120
so i got one result

3991
02:47:42,319 --> 02:47:45,760
i said that i wouldn't get any of it

3992
02:47:46,080 --> 02:47:50,720
but i think he was let me check this

3993
02:47:56,640 --> 02:48:00,319
yeah it was with intergamer only

3994
02:48:00,560 --> 02:48:03,040
so let's leave it just like they

3995
02:48:03,040 --> 02:48:03,840
just

3996
02:48:03,840 --> 02:48:06,560
select the guide

3997
02:48:07,279 --> 02:48:11,439
will take much less time

3998
02:48:11,600 --> 02:48:13,040
and you will see

3999
02:48:13,040 --> 02:48:16,160
right away

4000
02:48:16,160 --> 02:48:17,920
is

4001
02:48:17,920 --> 02:48:21,439
this did i just i needed

4002
02:48:21,439 --> 02:48:24,399
or was it here

4003
02:48:28,960 --> 02:48:30,560
yeah

4004
02:48:30,560 --> 02:48:32,240
so

4005
02:48:32,240 --> 02:48:36,680
we're running it against intergamma

4006
02:48:59,600 --> 02:49:02,000
yeah in the answer sheet i think i will

4007
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:05,920
need to include the following

4008
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:09,359
so the problem is

4009
02:49:10,720 --> 02:49:12,960
we need

4010
02:49:12,960 --> 02:49:16,278
to find

4011
02:49:26,399 --> 02:49:28,960
so this is something that i actually

4012
02:49:28,960 --> 02:49:31,120
discover

4013
02:49:31,120 --> 02:49:32,720
by chance

4014
02:49:32,720 --> 02:49:34,080
is that

4015
02:49:34,080 --> 02:49:36,240
some instances

4016
02:49:36,240 --> 02:49:38,160
will i don't i don't remember how i

4017
02:49:38,160 --> 02:49:40,399
figure it out but

4018
02:49:40,399 --> 02:49:43,359
i discovered that some instances will

4019
02:49:43,359 --> 02:49:44,720
have

4020
02:49:44,720 --> 02:49:46,000
this screen

4021
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:46,880
right

4022
02:49:46,880 --> 02:49:48,160
they will have

4023
02:49:48,160 --> 02:49:49,520
http

4024
02:49:49,520 --> 02:49:51,520
authentication

4025
02:49:51,520 --> 02:49:53,359
and in that case

4026
02:49:53,359 --> 02:49:54,640
the

4027
02:49:54,640 --> 02:49:56,960
template wouldn't find it

4028
02:49:56,960 --> 02:50:00,399
and i will tell you why

4029
02:50:00,880 --> 02:50:02,800
and just let it finish just kind of

4030
02:50:02,800 --> 02:50:04,560
finishing

4031
02:50:04,560 --> 02:50:08,278
probably 18 seconds

4032
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:33,479
91 percent

4033
02:50:48,560 --> 02:50:51,600
just wanted to finish it

4034
02:50:51,600 --> 02:50:55,040
sometimes it doesn't finish though

4035
02:50:55,040 --> 02:50:58,240
we just can cancel it

4036
02:50:58,240 --> 02:51:00,000
just keep it

4037
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:01,040
there

4038
02:51:01,040 --> 02:51:02,840
okay

4039
02:51:02,840 --> 02:51:06,319
so uh

4040
02:51:08,880 --> 02:51:10,160
so

4041
02:51:10,160 --> 02:51:13,279
let me show you the template

4042
02:51:13,920 --> 02:51:16,840
they haven't update the template

4043
02:51:16,840 --> 02:51:20,560
yet with the proposal and date and i

4044
02:51:20,560 --> 02:51:23,439
always have trouble with

4045
02:51:23,439 --> 02:51:25,600
this

4046
02:51:25,600 --> 02:51:27,920
with

4047
02:51:29,200 --> 02:51:33,080
it's not answering

4048
02:51:38,800 --> 02:51:42,880
my vm just got stuck

4049
02:51:45,520 --> 02:51:46,720
so if i

4050
02:51:46,720 --> 02:51:48,860
if i can show it to you

4051
02:51:48,860 --> 02:51:51,969
[Music]

4052
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:55,200
i don't know what happened to the game

4053
02:51:55,200 --> 02:51:57,840
together

4054
02:51:58,640 --> 02:52:01,119
doesn't

4055
02:52:05,120 --> 02:52:08,120
hmm

4056
02:52:15,680 --> 02:52:17,840
there

4057
02:52:17,840 --> 02:52:20,319
took control of my terminal so

4058
02:52:20,319 --> 02:52:23,040
let me show you the template

4059
02:52:23,040 --> 02:52:26,640
so the template it's here

4060
02:52:26,640 --> 02:52:30,399
spokes panel hp my admin

4061
02:52:30,399 --> 02:52:31,920
so why

4062
02:52:31,920 --> 02:52:33,840
let me explain you the templates in

4063
02:52:33,840 --> 02:52:36,800
general so a template will have an id

4064
02:52:36,800 --> 02:52:38,240
that should be

4065
02:52:38,240 --> 02:52:40,960
the same as the file name

4066
02:52:40,960 --> 02:52:44,080
and info about the

4067
02:52:44,080 --> 02:52:46,800
the name of the template the alter

4068
02:52:46,800 --> 02:52:48,160
disability

4069
02:52:48,160 --> 02:52:49,600
in this case is simple because you're

4070
02:52:49,600 --> 02:52:52,160
just looking for phpmyadmin instances

4071
02:52:52,160 --> 02:52:54,240
that it doesn't it doesn't it's not a

4072
02:52:54,240 --> 02:52:55,680
bug

4073
02:52:55,680 --> 02:52:58,319
and then you have tags that might you be

4074
02:52:58,319 --> 02:52:59,840
used to called

4075
02:52:59,840 --> 02:53:02,240
group of templates right

4076
02:53:02,240 --> 02:53:03,840
so what it does is

4077
02:53:03,840 --> 02:53:06,560
it runs a get request

4078
02:53:06,560 --> 02:53:08,479
with different paths so

4079
02:53:08,479 --> 02:53:09,439
as

4080
02:53:09,439 --> 02:53:11,520
the url as input

4081
02:53:11,520 --> 02:53:15,120
he will add a slash ph3 my admin slash

4082
02:53:15,120 --> 02:53:17,439
and it will run all these different

4083
02:53:17,439 --> 02:53:18,640
requests

4084
02:53:18,640 --> 02:53:20,800
and it will try to and the matchers will

4085
02:53:20,800 --> 02:53:22,960
try to find

4086
02:53:22,960 --> 02:53:24,960
uh

4087
02:53:24,960 --> 02:53:28,399
words inside the body in this case

4088
02:53:28,399 --> 02:53:30,319
the body of the request

4089
02:53:30,319 --> 02:53:32,479
of the response sorry

4090
02:53:32,479 --> 02:53:34,000
and

4091
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:36,080
this probably is something that i've

4092
02:53:36,080 --> 02:53:38,800
included i don't remember

4093
02:53:38,800 --> 02:53:41,200
but the structure it will it will

4094
02:53:41,200 --> 02:53:44,720
retrieve the version of the php my my

4095
02:53:44,720 --> 02:53:46,160
admin instance

4096
02:53:46,160 --> 02:53:48,720
retrieved from this from the body from

4097
02:53:48,720 --> 02:53:50,399
the body of the

4098
02:53:50,399 --> 02:53:53,200
of the response so

4099
02:53:53,200 --> 02:53:54,800
we already know

4100
02:53:54,800 --> 02:53:57,120
we already know that

4101
02:53:57,120 --> 02:53:58,640
this case

4102
02:53:58,640 --> 02:54:01,120
wasn't found

4103
02:54:01,120 --> 02:54:02,800
probably because it's

4104
02:54:02,800 --> 02:54:05,279
it's uh

4105
02:54:05,279 --> 02:54:07,920
it says access denied but if you check

4106
02:54:07,920 --> 02:54:10,160
here the title let me

4107
02:54:10,160 --> 02:54:12,240
let me run it for you

4108
02:54:12,240 --> 02:54:14,000
so if you do a curl

4109
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:14,720
uh

4110
02:54:14,720 --> 02:54:16,560
request

4111
02:54:16,560 --> 02:54:17,359
to

4112
02:54:17,359 --> 02:54:20,359
this

4113
02:54:20,399 --> 02:54:22,880
instance

4114
02:54:23,600 --> 02:54:27,279
oh probably it's too complicated

4115
02:54:29,359 --> 02:54:34,000
but if you check here there is no title

4116
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:36,080
and the template

4117
02:54:36,080 --> 02:54:39,680
let me cut the template

4118
02:54:40,160 --> 02:54:42,240
what the template is doing is just

4119
02:54:42,240 --> 02:54:43,600
looking for

4120
02:54:43,600 --> 02:54:44,560
the

4121
02:54:44,560 --> 02:54:47,279
html title tag

4122
02:54:47,279 --> 02:54:49,279
and phpmyadmin so it's looking for

4123
02:54:49,279 --> 02:54:50,560
instances

4124
02:54:50,560 --> 02:54:54,160
that had that has the title phpmyadmin

4125
02:54:54,160 --> 02:54:55,200
which is

4126
02:54:55,200 --> 02:54:57,600
a pretty weak

4127
02:54:57,600 --> 02:54:59,200
matcher

4128
02:54:59,200 --> 02:55:00,319
and i will

4129
02:55:00,319 --> 02:55:02,479
tell you why

4130
02:55:02,479 --> 02:55:04,560
usually

4131
02:55:04,560 --> 02:55:06,880
owners of the

4132
02:55:06,880 --> 02:55:07,680
of

4133
02:55:07,680 --> 02:55:09,520
these programs they will try to hide

4134
02:55:09,520 --> 02:55:11,279
versions of things that they know that

4135
02:55:11,279 --> 02:55:12,640
are vulnerable

4136
02:55:12,640 --> 02:55:15,439
not to be that easy to be detected or to

4137
02:55:15,439 --> 02:55:18,800
be called out as a vulnerable version

4138
02:55:18,800 --> 02:55:19,520
so

4139
02:55:19,520 --> 02:55:20,399
what i

4140
02:55:20,399 --> 02:55:23,680
what i did what i discovered is that

4141
02:55:23,680 --> 02:55:25,200
you need to check for something more

4142
02:55:25,200 --> 02:55:27,520
general

4143
02:55:27,520 --> 02:55:30,560
not just a title so

4144
02:55:30,560 --> 02:55:32,399
one of the cool things about the

4145
02:55:32,399 --> 02:55:34,800
template this is the built on yaml that

4146
02:55:34,800 --> 02:55:36,399
it might be

4147
02:55:36,399 --> 02:55:39,120
it might be a bit difficult at first but

4148
02:55:39,120 --> 02:55:41,600
once you practice a bit

4149
02:55:41,600 --> 02:55:43,600
so what i found is that

4150
02:55:43,600 --> 02:55:47,359
this instance for example if i tell you

4151
02:55:47,359 --> 02:55:49,680
find a way to find this instance

4152
02:55:49,680 --> 02:55:52,800
if you check the source code

4153
02:55:52,800 --> 02:55:54,080
one of the things that they cannot

4154
02:55:54,080 --> 02:55:56,240
remove

4155
02:55:56,240 --> 02:55:57,279
are

4156
02:55:57,279 --> 02:55:58,720
the

4157
02:55:58,720 --> 02:56:00,240
ids

4158
02:56:00,240 --> 02:56:02,880
the id tags

4159
02:56:02,880 --> 02:56:07,599
of the the source code so

4160
02:56:08,319 --> 02:56:10,000
let me get it

4161
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:10,840
so for

4162
02:56:10,840 --> 02:56:13,120
example if you look i already know this

4163
02:56:13,120 --> 02:56:15,840
because i i look for it but i i found it

4164
02:56:15,840 --> 02:56:16,800
but

4165
02:56:16,800 --> 02:56:19,040
some parts of the

4166
02:56:19,040 --> 02:56:20,800
of the

4167
02:56:20,800 --> 02:56:21,840
code

4168
02:56:21,840 --> 02:56:23,520
will have this

4169
02:56:23,520 --> 02:56:25,040
tag

4170
02:56:25,040 --> 02:56:26,399
that is

4171
02:56:26,399 --> 02:56:27,359
uh

4172
02:56:27,359 --> 02:56:30,479
in one case it's a path of a team

4173
02:56:30,479 --> 02:56:34,000
but somewhere somewhere here

4174
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:35,439
it's a

4175
02:56:35,439 --> 02:56:38,240
um what is it

4176
02:56:38,560 --> 02:56:41,560
dude

4177
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:52,479
[Music]

4178
02:56:52,479 --> 02:56:54,160
okay so there are many things that we

4179
02:56:54,160 --> 02:56:56,240
could look for

4180
02:56:56,240 --> 02:56:59,439
that are particular of this

4181
02:56:59,439 --> 02:57:01,439
instance that

4182
02:57:01,439 --> 02:57:02,960
is not

4183
02:57:02,960 --> 02:57:04,800
depending on the title

4184
02:57:04,800 --> 02:57:06,080
so one of the things that i discovered

4185
02:57:06,080 --> 02:57:09,279
that many instances have is this name

4186
02:57:09,279 --> 02:57:11,680
or this path

4187
02:57:11,680 --> 02:57:13,439
i thought it was an id but i was

4188
02:57:13,439 --> 02:57:16,560
mistaken it's not an element id it's a

4189
02:57:16,560 --> 02:57:17,359
path

4190
02:57:17,359 --> 02:57:19,760
so i just include that

4191
02:57:19,760 --> 02:57:22,760
here

4192
02:57:22,880 --> 02:57:25,119
and

4193
02:57:25,359 --> 02:57:27,120
we're gonna

4194
02:57:27,120 --> 02:57:28,319
add here

4195
02:57:28,319 --> 02:57:30,560
mature

4196
02:57:30,560 --> 02:57:32,800
condition

4197
02:57:32,800 --> 02:57:34,479
or so we want

4198
02:57:34,479 --> 02:57:37,840
one of the other

4199
02:57:38,399 --> 02:57:39,279
and

4200
02:57:39,279 --> 02:57:41,120
yeah so let's condition not mature

4201
02:57:41,120 --> 02:57:43,920
condition first condition

4202
02:57:43,920 --> 02:57:47,760
you need to check for the indentation

4203
02:57:47,760 --> 02:57:49,520
so let's run it again

4204
02:57:49,520 --> 02:57:54,160
le but this time we're going to run it

4205
02:57:54,560 --> 02:57:55,760
with the

4206
02:57:55,760 --> 02:57:57,439
more

4207
02:57:57,439 --> 02:58:01,760
with more with railing higher

4208
02:58:01,760 --> 02:58:05,840
i just want to go faster

4209
02:58:06,000 --> 02:58:08,240
oh wait maybe something

4210
02:58:08,240 --> 02:58:10,720
ah that's probably why i had it

4211
02:58:10,720 --> 02:58:11,840
yeah so

4212
02:58:11,840 --> 02:58:15,120
nano yeah there

4213
02:58:15,120 --> 02:58:17,680
so let's see what happens now let's see

4214
02:58:17,680 --> 02:58:20,319
what happens

4215
02:58:22,080 --> 02:58:25,479
with our results

4216
02:58:32,080 --> 02:58:35,120
couldn't find template so this is a

4217
02:58:35,120 --> 02:58:36,720
problem

4218
02:58:36,720 --> 02:58:39,040
that they should fix

4219
02:58:39,040 --> 02:58:40,720
at some point

4220
02:58:40,720 --> 02:58:43,040
it's not that it's not there it's just

4221
02:58:43,040 --> 02:58:45,200
that it's incorrect

4222
02:58:45,200 --> 02:58:48,479
so one way to know it it's what oh wait

4223
02:58:48,479 --> 02:58:49,520
so where

4224
02:58:49,520 --> 02:58:50,090
is it

4225
02:58:50,090 --> 02:58:51,359
[Music]

4226
02:58:51,359 --> 02:58:53,120
oh wait so they're

4227
02:58:53,120 --> 02:58:54,800
like i told you they're checking that

4228
02:58:54,800 --> 02:58:56,479
i'm here so

4229
02:58:56,479 --> 02:58:57,600
give me

4230
02:58:57,600 --> 02:59:00,840
five minutes

4231
03:01:04,000 --> 03:01:07,000
hello

4232
03:01:50,080 --> 03:01:53,319
thank you

4233
03:02:17,040 --> 03:02:18,000
okay

4234
03:02:18,000 --> 03:02:20,479
i'm back

4235
03:02:20,880 --> 03:02:22,479
so

4236
03:02:22,479 --> 03:02:24,000
where were we

4237
03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:26,560
we were doing this template that didn't

4238
03:02:26,560 --> 03:02:28,880
work

4239
03:02:38,000 --> 03:02:41,219
[Music]

4240
03:02:42,479 --> 03:02:45,359
the same way

4241
03:02:45,359 --> 03:02:47,840
no way

4242
03:02:51,120 --> 03:02:54,399
this is weird

4243
03:02:56,560 --> 03:02:59,840
the templates there

4244
03:03:13,279 --> 03:03:16,319
oh yeah okay so

4245
03:03:16,720 --> 03:03:20,160
we use the rivers mode

4246
03:03:22,800 --> 03:03:23,680
okay

4247
03:03:23,680 --> 03:03:27,319
so if you see here

4248
03:03:27,359 --> 03:03:29,200
if you see

4249
03:03:29,200 --> 03:03:31,840
but you probably which version i'm using

4250
03:03:31,840 --> 03:03:33,439
ah it's just because i'm using the old

4251
03:03:33,439 --> 03:03:36,080
version of nuclei

4252
03:03:36,080 --> 03:03:39,800
yes so

4253
03:03:40,240 --> 03:03:43,680
that was fixed that was fixed

4254
03:03:43,680 --> 03:03:46,560
but if you see here there their problem

4255
03:03:46,560 --> 03:03:49,680
is in line 29

4256
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:51,600
so

4257
03:03:51,600 --> 03:03:52,960
if i do

4258
03:03:52,960 --> 03:03:55,520
like that

4259
03:03:55,520 --> 03:03:59,040
line 29 says that i cannot start with

4260
03:03:59,040 --> 03:04:01,200
the probably

4261
03:04:01,200 --> 03:04:03,560
probably the problem is condition

4262
03:04:03,560 --> 03:04:08,080
[Music]

4263
03:04:08,080 --> 03:04:10,720
ah yes because yeah

4264
03:04:10,720 --> 03:04:12,960
because of the tabs you cannot add tabs

4265
03:04:12,960 --> 03:04:14,479
you need to be spaces you need to

4266
03:04:14,479 --> 03:04:16,399
configure your

4267
03:04:16,399 --> 03:04:19,680
well that's also true

4268
03:04:19,680 --> 03:04:22,680
so

4269
03:04:22,880 --> 03:04:25,759
it actually

4270
03:04:26,240 --> 03:04:28,560
here

4271
03:04:29,439 --> 03:04:32,160
you need to add spaces you can configure

4272
03:04:32,160 --> 03:04:35,439
that on your nano config

4273
03:04:35,439 --> 03:04:38,800
but yeah that's that works which is

4274
03:04:38,800 --> 03:04:40,880
those problems are

4275
03:04:40,880 --> 03:04:42,720
pretty common to happen but the new

4276
03:04:42,720 --> 03:04:44,479
version of nuclei

4277
03:04:44,479 --> 03:04:47,680
it's showing better outputs better

4278
03:04:47,680 --> 03:04:50,720
better error messages

4279
03:04:50,720 --> 03:04:51,600
so

4280
03:04:51,600 --> 03:04:55,960
that won't be a problem for you

4281
03:05:04,080 --> 03:05:04,810
now it's running

4282
03:05:04,810 --> 03:05:06,479
[Music]

4283
03:05:06,479 --> 03:05:09,039
they run

4284
03:05:12,960 --> 03:05:13,840
so now

4285
03:05:13,840 --> 03:05:18,560
if you check of the result you found one

4286
03:05:18,560 --> 03:05:20,240
and

4287
03:05:20,240 --> 03:05:22,479
since guys i don't know

4288
03:05:22,479 --> 03:05:26,080
if you're following me live

4289
03:05:26,080 --> 03:05:28,240
i will

4290
03:05:28,240 --> 03:05:31,640
some errors

4291
03:05:34,000 --> 03:05:37,520
somewhere in your output

4292
03:05:37,760 --> 03:05:40,160
missed

4293
03:05:40,240 --> 03:05:42,479
pfix lever

4294
03:05:42,479 --> 03:05:45,800
probably yes

4295
03:05:51,279 --> 03:05:54,000
okay so

4296
03:05:54,800 --> 03:05:57,040
let me show you

4297
03:05:57,040 --> 03:05:59,840
if you see i have discovered many new

4298
03:05:59,840 --> 03:06:01,520
instances

4299
03:06:01,520 --> 03:06:03,920
of phpmyadmin

4300
03:06:03,920 --> 03:06:04,880
and

4301
03:06:04,880 --> 03:06:06,800
now we have a problem now we have this

4302
03:06:06,800 --> 03:06:08,800
problem we don't know

4303
03:06:08,800 --> 03:06:11,840
we don't know what version it is but

4304
03:06:11,840 --> 03:06:13,120
there is a trick

4305
03:06:13,120 --> 03:06:14,960
another trick

4306
03:06:14,960 --> 03:06:16,319
that i discover

4307
03:06:16,319 --> 03:06:18,960
is that

4308
03:06:19,359 --> 03:06:23,120
you can actually see the dock

4309
03:06:23,120 --> 03:06:28,200
the documentation of the instance

4310
03:06:28,319 --> 03:06:30,640
okay

4311
03:06:36,080 --> 03:06:38,000
well

4312
03:06:38,000 --> 03:06:39,680
i don't see it in the source code but i

4313
03:06:39,680 --> 03:06:43,640
know it is like this

4314
03:06:44,800 --> 03:06:45,920
every

4315
03:06:45,920 --> 03:06:49,359
ht every ap hp in admin depending on the

4316
03:06:49,359 --> 03:06:50,479
version some versions have

4317
03:06:50,479 --> 03:06:52,160
documentations here

4318
03:06:52,160 --> 03:06:54,080
you can see the version here

4319
03:06:54,080 --> 03:06:55,520
on top

4320
03:06:55,520 --> 03:06:58,319
and this version is vulnerable to

4321
03:06:58,319 --> 03:07:01,120
to several cvs they actually i reported

4322
03:07:01,120 --> 03:07:02,240
them

4323
03:07:02,240 --> 03:07:03,520
so let's say

4324
03:07:03,520 --> 03:07:06,399
let's imagine that i want to report

4325
03:07:06,399 --> 03:07:09,040
this one this

4326
03:07:09,040 --> 03:07:09,760
actually url

4327
03:07:09,760 --> 03:07:11,359
a lot of new

4328
03:07:11,359 --> 03:07:13,040
things

4329
03:07:13,040 --> 03:07:14,160
probably one of those might be

4330
03:07:14,160 --> 03:07:16,640
reportable

4331
03:07:16,640 --> 03:07:20,880
so i go to my i go to my server

4332
03:07:20,880 --> 03:07:24,880
where's my server let me remove this one

4333
03:07:24,880 --> 03:07:28,319
no i don't have a service

4334
03:07:28,479 --> 03:07:30,640
so

4335
03:07:32,000 --> 03:07:35,600
and i go to find program and i give it

4336
03:07:35,600 --> 03:07:37,200
the url

4337
03:07:37,200 --> 03:07:39,279
and he will give me right away the

4338
03:07:39,279 --> 03:07:42,080
the year of the program

4339
03:07:42,080 --> 03:07:44,319
and i think i've reported it before

4340
03:07:44,319 --> 03:07:46,240
let's check

4341
03:07:46,240 --> 03:07:48,160
one of the cool things about integrity

4342
03:07:48,160 --> 03:07:51,359
is that you can check easily

4343
03:07:51,359 --> 03:07:52,399
well the

4344
03:07:52,399 --> 03:07:54,560
the website is pretty slow

4345
03:07:54,560 --> 03:07:56,160
compared to the other one

4346
03:07:56,160 --> 03:07:57,680
but you can see

4347
03:07:57,680 --> 03:08:00,479
my submissions

4348
03:08:00,479 --> 03:08:06,119
and as you can see here it was accepted

4349
03:08:06,640 --> 03:08:07,760
and

4350
03:08:07,760 --> 03:08:10,319
i actually got paid didn't get paid no

4351
03:08:10,319 --> 03:08:12,319
this one didn't pay

4352
03:08:12,319 --> 03:08:15,600
but it was a medium

4353
03:08:15,920 --> 03:08:18,800
and which one i reported

4354
03:08:18,800 --> 03:08:20,800
i reported this domain which is actually

4355
03:08:20,800 --> 03:08:22,880
the one that we are looking no that's

4356
03:08:22,880 --> 03:08:26,319
not the same that we're looking for

4357
03:08:26,319 --> 03:08:27,920
but you see you probably found another

4358
03:08:27,920 --> 03:08:30,240
one a little report

4359
03:08:30,240 --> 03:08:31,920
let me check the version so the same

4360
03:08:31,920 --> 03:08:32,880
trick

4361
03:08:32,880 --> 03:08:34,800
html

4362
03:08:34,800 --> 03:08:36,720
to see the version

4363
03:08:36,720 --> 03:08:38,640
and it's five one one which is not

4364
03:08:38,640 --> 03:08:40,399
vulnerable

4365
03:08:40,399 --> 03:08:41,520
to

4366
03:08:41,520 --> 03:08:43,840
the cv that i

4367
03:08:43,840 --> 03:08:46,000
that i reported here

4368
03:08:46,000 --> 03:08:48,800
that is called

4369
03:08:48,800 --> 03:08:51,920
and this is the report let me

4370
03:08:51,920 --> 03:08:54,640
make it bigger

4371
03:08:54,960 --> 03:08:57,919
this is the report

4372
03:08:59,200 --> 03:09:00,240
it's uh

4373
03:09:00,240 --> 03:09:03,640
that's the cbd

4374
03:09:04,399 --> 03:09:06,880
yeah so

4375
03:09:07,840 --> 03:09:10,479
we actually found many more instances

4376
03:09:10,479 --> 03:09:14,000
many more instances here

4377
03:09:14,560 --> 03:09:17,200
but probably they are the same ipads

4378
03:09:17,200 --> 03:09:19,760
just with a different

4379
03:09:19,760 --> 03:09:22,880
just with a different

4380
03:09:23,520 --> 03:09:26,080
domain name

4381
03:09:28,960 --> 03:09:31,120
and you can check the watching suction

4382
03:09:31,120 --> 03:09:33,840
is different

4383
03:09:36,319 --> 03:09:39,680
so also hidden

4384
03:09:42,720 --> 03:09:43,840
file

4385
03:09:43,840 --> 03:09:45,040
same one

4386
03:09:45,040 --> 03:09:48,239
so okay so the the objective of the this

4387
03:09:48,239 --> 03:09:50,880
exercise number three

4388
03:09:50,880 --> 03:09:52,000
was to

4389
03:09:52,000 --> 03:09:55,840
actually do what i did they modify

4390
03:09:55,840 --> 03:09:56,840
the

4391
03:09:56,840 --> 03:09:59,840
debug sorry modify the template

4392
03:09:59,840 --> 03:10:01,680
so

4393
03:10:01,680 --> 03:10:03,439
what i've have more

4394
03:10:03,439 --> 03:10:05,120
most

4395
03:10:05,120 --> 03:10:07,920
more successful my most successful

4396
03:10:07,920 --> 03:10:10,479
attempts to find bugs

4397
03:10:10,479 --> 03:10:11,359
and

4398
03:10:11,359 --> 03:10:12,880
are

4399
03:10:12,880 --> 03:10:14,399
pretty much

4400
03:10:14,399 --> 03:10:16,399
correlated i will say

4401
03:10:16,399 --> 03:10:17,279
80

4402
03:10:17,279 --> 03:10:19,439
to modifying templates

4403
03:10:19,439 --> 03:10:22,000
some templates will for example let me

4404
03:10:22,000 --> 03:10:24,960
show you what what i mean by that

4405
03:10:24,960 --> 03:10:27,920
in this case you have possible

4406
03:10:27,920 --> 03:10:29,439
installation path

4407
03:10:29,439 --> 03:10:31,200
paths right

4408
03:10:31,200 --> 03:10:33,040
in this case the one that worked with

4409
03:10:33,040 --> 03:10:34,160
this one

4410
03:10:34,160 --> 03:10:35,920
but you could add as many as you want

4411
03:10:35,920 --> 03:10:38,319
but it's gonna take longer but because

4412
03:10:38,319 --> 03:10:40,399
for every url

4413
03:10:40,399 --> 03:10:44,000
you're multiplying by

4414
03:10:44,960 --> 03:10:47,439
one two three four five six seven eight

4415
03:10:47,439 --> 03:10:50,560
nine ten eleven twelve by twelve so if

4416
03:10:50,560 --> 03:10:51,439
you

4417
03:10:51,439 --> 03:10:55,359
if you every every path that you add you

4418
03:10:55,359 --> 03:10:57,520
multiply by the amount of urls that you

4419
03:10:57,520 --> 03:10:59,760
have so if you have too many if you had

4420
03:10:59,760 --> 03:11:02,880
a million urls

4421
03:11:03,279 --> 03:11:05,840
every path you have you include will add

4422
03:11:05,840 --> 03:11:07,680
a million requests

4423
03:11:07,680 --> 03:11:08,800
so

4424
03:11:08,800 --> 03:11:10,880
it's something to consider but if you

4425
03:11:10,880 --> 03:11:13,120
have enough resources or you have enough

4426
03:11:13,120 --> 03:11:14,800
servers

4427
03:11:14,800 --> 03:11:16,080
that you can

4428
03:11:16,080 --> 03:11:18,479
distribute this load it might be worth

4429
03:11:18,479 --> 03:11:19,920
it

4430
03:11:19,920 --> 03:11:22,239
and yeah so exercise number three is

4431
03:11:22,239 --> 03:11:23,279
done

4432
03:11:23,279 --> 03:11:25,359
let's check the answer key so the answer

4433
03:11:25,359 --> 03:11:27,120
cheat the problem is that we need to

4434
03:11:27,120 --> 03:11:29,760
find more ability instances

4435
03:11:29,760 --> 03:11:31,279
the

4436
03:11:31,279 --> 03:11:32,640
the matching

4437
03:11:32,640 --> 03:11:34,399
of

4438
03:11:34,399 --> 03:11:35,120
the

4439
03:11:35,120 --> 03:11:36,720
title

4440
03:11:36,720 --> 03:11:37,680
is

4441
03:11:37,680 --> 03:11:38,640
too

4442
03:11:38,640 --> 03:11:40,239
it's uh

4443
03:11:40,239 --> 03:11:43,520
it's too weak

4444
03:11:44,000 --> 03:11:46,080
because the title

4445
03:11:46,080 --> 03:11:46,880
can

4446
03:11:46,880 --> 03:11:49,040
be easily

4447
03:11:49,040 --> 03:11:51,840
modified

4448
03:11:53,040 --> 03:11:55,279
and

4449
03:11:55,920 --> 03:11:57,359
so yeah

4450
03:11:57,359 --> 03:12:00,160
i hope you you understood

4451
03:12:00,160 --> 03:12:02,840
basically deciding more

4452
03:12:02,840 --> 03:12:04,800
rules and

4453
03:12:04,800 --> 03:12:06,720
in my experience it's

4454
03:12:06,720 --> 03:12:09,680
what actually discover many

4455
03:12:09,680 --> 03:12:11,200
p ones

4456
03:12:11,200 --> 03:12:12,960
and because i

4457
03:12:12,960 --> 03:12:16,640
let me show it to you what i did

4458
03:12:17,040 --> 03:12:19,520
so they

4459
03:12:19,520 --> 03:12:22,239
what's the number

4460
03:12:22,239 --> 03:12:23,120
in

4461
03:12:23,120 --> 03:12:26,080
great lands

4462
03:12:26,319 --> 03:12:29,640
three out

4463
03:12:32,080 --> 03:12:35,600
yeah this is the one i think

4464
03:12:35,600 --> 03:12:38,080
let's check

4465
03:12:39,120 --> 03:12:42,520
not the one

4466
03:12:44,870 --> 03:12:53,160
[Music]

4467
03:12:56,810 --> 03:13:00,239
[Music]

4468
03:13:00,239 --> 03:13:02,640
this one

4469
03:13:02,640 --> 03:13:03,680
yep

4470
03:13:03,680 --> 03:13:05,279
this one

4471
03:13:05,279 --> 03:13:08,319
so if you look at my screen

4472
03:13:08,479 --> 03:13:09,920
the

4473
03:13:09,920 --> 03:13:13,200
the path that is using

4474
03:13:13,200 --> 03:13:16,479
it's a it's a

4475
03:13:16,479 --> 03:13:19,359
it's a path that

4476
03:13:19,359 --> 03:13:20,640
takes

4477
03:13:20,640 --> 03:13:22,800
the assumption that the

4478
03:13:22,800 --> 03:13:25,439
instance which is a

4479
03:13:25,439 --> 03:13:28,239
forge rock open a.m it's installed on

4480
03:13:28,239 --> 03:13:29,840
this path

4481
03:13:29,840 --> 03:13:31,040
right

4482
03:13:31,040 --> 03:13:33,040
but doing some google docking which is

4483
03:13:33,040 --> 03:13:35,040
basically

4484
03:13:35,040 --> 03:13:35,840
uh

4485
03:13:35,840 --> 03:13:38,960
finding another instances and

4486
03:13:38,960 --> 03:13:42,160
find it and looking on google the same

4487
03:13:42,160 --> 03:13:44,800
words for example i remember that i was

4488
03:13:44,800 --> 03:13:46,800
looking for

4489
03:13:46,800 --> 03:13:49,759
like this word

4490
03:13:50,319 --> 03:13:54,160
so it would be something like in text

4491
03:13:55,040 --> 03:13:57,439
and then i will

4492
03:13:57,439 --> 03:13:59,520
remove

4493
03:13:59,520 --> 03:14:01,600
the ones that are the ones that i don't

4494
03:14:01,600 --> 03:14:04,080
care those are the

4495
03:14:04,080 --> 03:14:06,000
like uh

4496
03:14:06,000 --> 03:14:07,600
the

4497
03:14:07,600 --> 03:14:10,800
the owner i mean the company but

4498
03:14:10,800 --> 03:14:13,279
so he ended up going to see sites like

4499
03:14:13,279 --> 03:14:15,680
this one

4500
03:14:16,880 --> 03:14:17,680
and

4501
03:14:17,680 --> 03:14:19,200
now you

4502
03:14:19,200 --> 03:14:20,800
didn't find one

4503
03:14:20,800 --> 03:14:23,439
wasn't the one that he was looking for

4504
03:14:23,439 --> 03:14:24,560
but

4505
03:14:24,560 --> 03:14:27,600
what i mean is that

4506
03:14:27,600 --> 03:14:28,640
you

4507
03:14:28,640 --> 03:14:30,160
could

4508
03:14:30,160 --> 03:14:32,479
find other instances

4509
03:14:32,479 --> 03:14:34,640
just doing google docking this is not

4510
03:14:34,640 --> 03:14:37,600
the case also but

4511
03:14:37,600 --> 03:14:38,960
is my

4512
03:14:38,960 --> 03:14:41,278
my

4513
03:14:44,239 --> 03:14:48,319
let's see this one

4514
03:14:48,479 --> 03:14:49,760
well what i'm trying to do is trying to

4515
03:14:49,760 --> 03:14:51,760
find instances

4516
03:14:51,760 --> 03:14:54,080
that might give me

4517
03:14:54,080 --> 03:14:56,160
other indicators

4518
03:14:56,160 --> 03:14:57,680
of

4519
03:14:57,680 --> 03:15:00,720
what to look for right

4520
03:15:00,720 --> 03:15:02,960
so far i haven't found anyone because

4521
03:15:02,960 --> 03:15:05,439
any instance because i'm not doing it

4522
03:15:05,439 --> 03:15:07,520
correctly

4523
03:15:07,520 --> 03:15:09,840
and because i don't remember but i can

4524
03:15:09,840 --> 03:15:13,920
tell you right away which ones

4525
03:15:13,920 --> 03:15:17,200
where so i have

4526
03:15:18,000 --> 03:15:20,800
and i will grab

4527
03:15:20,800 --> 03:15:23,680
i will wrap um

4528
03:15:23,680 --> 03:15:26,720
let's unbox this and play

4529
03:15:26,720 --> 03:15:28,160
three

4530
03:15:28,160 --> 03:15:30,319
four six four

4531
03:15:30,319 --> 03:15:34,840
so i will grab 21

4532
03:15:43,840 --> 03:15:46,840
um

4533
03:15:53,040 --> 03:15:54,640
well doesn't matter

4534
03:15:54,640 --> 03:15:57,840
the point is that i did that

4535
03:15:57,840 --> 03:15:59,359
job

4536
03:15:59,359 --> 03:16:00,720
of

4537
03:16:00,720 --> 03:16:04,720
looking for instances and i

4538
03:16:04,720 --> 03:16:08,720
and i created a new template

4539
03:16:08,720 --> 03:16:12,960
that it's uh open am detector

4540
03:16:12,960 --> 03:16:15,210
open again opening

4541
03:16:15,210 --> 03:16:18,560
[Music]

4542
03:16:23,680 --> 03:16:26,640
actually you see i created it

4543
03:16:26,640 --> 03:16:29,520
so what it did is that it took

4544
03:16:29,520 --> 03:16:33,120
i took the time to find another

4545
03:16:33,120 --> 03:16:34,160
another

4546
03:16:34,160 --> 03:16:35,279
path

4547
03:16:35,279 --> 03:16:36,160
path

4548
03:16:36,160 --> 03:16:37,600
that

4549
03:16:37,600 --> 03:16:38,479
this

4550
03:16:38,479 --> 03:16:40,640
software was installed

4551
03:16:40,640 --> 03:16:43,120
so many of many of this software

4552
03:16:43,120 --> 03:16:45,680
had ssso open am

4553
03:16:45,680 --> 03:16:48,000
but it wouldn't work directly like the

4554
03:16:48,000 --> 03:16:48,960
other one

4555
03:16:48,960 --> 03:16:52,239
so this template before was

4556
03:16:52,239 --> 03:16:54,160
marked as a detector

4557
03:16:54,160 --> 03:16:57,120
which is actually just an executor of

4558
03:16:57,120 --> 03:16:59,439
the of the payload

4559
03:16:59,439 --> 03:17:01,439
right actually did the payload manually

4560
03:17:01,439 --> 03:17:04,399
because it didn't work most cases

4561
03:17:04,399 --> 03:17:06,560
so with this

4562
03:17:06,560 --> 03:17:09,920
what i did is i included all these paths

4563
03:17:09,920 --> 03:17:10,880
and

4564
03:17:10,880 --> 03:17:12,640
running this template

4565
03:17:12,640 --> 03:17:14,800
and using these conditions because they

4566
03:17:14,800 --> 03:17:16,560
were very different versions they were

4567
03:17:16,560 --> 03:17:17,840
like

4568
03:17:17,840 --> 03:17:20,000
they they were sold at some point and

4569
03:17:20,000 --> 03:17:23,040
they changed a lot of things

4570
03:17:23,040 --> 03:17:24,880
so i found

4571
03:17:24,880 --> 03:17:28,880
probably 12 and i found a pe one on a

4572
03:17:28,880 --> 03:17:30,720
bank

4573
03:17:30,720 --> 03:17:34,560
and a cinnamon actually

4574
03:17:34,640 --> 03:17:39,120
but on my harder one i actually discover

4575
03:17:39,120 --> 03:17:41,040
several

4576
03:17:41,040 --> 03:17:42,080
several

4577
03:17:42,080 --> 03:17:44,160
p1's

4578
03:17:44,160 --> 03:17:46,720
related to

4579
03:17:46,720 --> 03:17:47,439
the

4580
03:17:47,439 --> 03:17:49,439
department of

4581
03:17:49,439 --> 03:17:52,160
defense of the us

4582
03:17:52,160 --> 03:17:54,960
because they were

4583
03:17:54,960 --> 03:17:57,120
which

4584
03:17:57,120 --> 03:18:00,000
resolved

4585
03:18:03,200 --> 03:18:07,640
where is it new one

4586
03:18:09,680 --> 03:18:12,319
so as you see if you see here

4587
03:18:12,319 --> 03:18:14,560
it's

4588
03:18:14,560 --> 03:18:16,399
it's on another path

4589
03:18:16,399 --> 03:18:19,278
wait what is it

4590
03:18:20,239 --> 03:18:22,319
i probably shouldn't be showing you that

4591
03:18:22,319 --> 03:18:24,640
but the thing is that uh modifying the

4592
03:18:24,640 --> 03:18:27,119
template

4593
03:18:27,359 --> 03:18:28,880
led me to find

4594
03:18:28,880 --> 03:18:31,279
several

4595
03:18:31,279 --> 03:18:33,200
critical bugs

4596
03:18:33,200 --> 03:18:36,880
just by including and then i upload it

4597
03:18:36,880 --> 03:18:39,680
to when i once i

4598
03:18:39,680 --> 03:18:41,439
use it enough

4599
03:18:41,439 --> 03:18:43,680
or i couldn't find more instances

4600
03:18:43,680 --> 03:18:45,760
i'm loaded to look like

4601
03:18:45,760 --> 03:18:48,560
and that way other people will be able

4602
03:18:48,560 --> 03:18:51,760
to use it and that will be my

4603
03:18:51,760 --> 03:18:53,600
contribution

4604
03:18:53,600 --> 03:18:54,960
to the

4605
03:18:54,960 --> 03:18:58,560
community which is important right

4606
03:18:58,560 --> 03:18:59,760
so

4607
03:18:59,760 --> 03:19:01,760
we have

4608
03:19:01,760 --> 03:19:03,040
26

4609
03:19:03,040 --> 03:19:05,840
more minutes

4610
03:19:08,399 --> 03:19:11,359
okay yes so

4611
03:19:11,359 --> 03:19:13,279
i'm just gonna explain you

4612
03:19:13,279 --> 03:19:16,000
the number

4613
03:19:16,000 --> 03:19:18,560
four

4614
03:19:18,560 --> 03:19:21,439
which is pretty much the same

4615
03:19:21,439 --> 03:19:22,960
as

4616
03:19:22,960 --> 03:19:25,120
before and it gives you the instruction

4617
03:19:25,120 --> 03:19:26,720
that you need to test it with the run

4618
03:19:26,720 --> 03:19:28,800
start program

4619
03:19:28,800 --> 03:19:33,359
which is already loaded on your wreath

4620
03:19:33,359 --> 03:19:35,920
so you need to create the idea well it's

4621
03:19:35,920 --> 03:19:38,800
actually it's already been created

4622
03:19:38,800 --> 03:19:40,479
it's already been uploaded but at the

4623
03:19:40,479 --> 03:19:42,399
time that i prepared this workshop it

4624
03:19:42,399 --> 03:19:43,920
wasn't

4625
03:19:43,920 --> 03:19:46,960
so the idea is that

4626
03:19:46,960 --> 03:19:49,439
the step before what we need is that we

4627
03:19:49,439 --> 03:19:52,000
want we might we manually

4628
03:19:52,000 --> 03:19:55,840
look for a builder of vulnerable version

4629
03:19:55,840 --> 03:19:59,040
of phpmyadmin

4630
03:19:59,040 --> 03:20:02,000
but we can do that with the template we

4631
03:20:02,000 --> 03:20:05,760
can do that with the template and

4632
03:20:05,920 --> 03:20:11,680
we actually the way i solve it is that

4633
03:20:11,680 --> 03:20:15,840
i actually uploaded this template

4634
03:20:15,920 --> 03:20:17,920
i think

4635
03:20:17,920 --> 03:20:20,160
yes

4636
03:20:22,239 --> 03:20:25,040
so what it did is that what i did is

4637
03:20:25,040 --> 03:20:28,880
that i would

4638
03:20:28,880 --> 03:20:29,920
reject

4639
03:20:29,920 --> 03:20:32,800
do some rejects

4640
03:20:33,120 --> 03:20:34,800
for the version

4641
03:20:34,800 --> 03:20:37,920
but the important part is that

4642
03:20:37,920 --> 03:20:39,200
do you remember the ones that were

4643
03:20:39,200 --> 03:20:41,600
hidden

4644
03:20:41,680 --> 03:20:44,080
the ones that were hidden where

4645
03:20:44,080 --> 03:20:46,960
they they respond and let me show it to

4646
03:20:46,960 --> 03:20:48,399
you

4647
03:20:48,399 --> 03:20:52,278
for you to believe me

4648
03:20:53,420 --> 03:20:56,479
[Music]

4649
03:20:56,479 --> 03:20:59,840
okay the ones that were hidden

4650
03:20:59,840 --> 03:21:01,920
or protected

4651
03:21:01,920 --> 03:21:06,359
if you do a call request

4652
03:21:10,960 --> 03:21:12,319
you will get

4653
03:21:12,319 --> 03:21:15,359
and if you do a pull request only of the

4654
03:21:15,359 --> 03:21:17,760
header

4655
03:21:18,160 --> 03:21:19,439
you will get

4656
03:21:19,439 --> 03:21:20,960
uh

4657
03:21:20,960 --> 03:21:24,720
401 which is unauthorized

4658
03:21:24,720 --> 03:21:27,359
so in this case the template

4659
03:21:27,359 --> 03:21:28,640
it's

4660
03:21:28,640 --> 03:21:30,160
also looking for

4661
03:21:30,160 --> 03:21:32,640
for that

4662
03:21:32,880 --> 03:21:36,119
for that

4663
03:21:38,399 --> 03:21:40,720
for the response code

4664
03:21:40,720 --> 03:21:41,680
and

4665
03:21:41,680 --> 03:21:43,920
we're looking for the different versions

4666
03:21:43,920 --> 03:21:47,840
so these rejects will will will match

4667
03:21:47,840 --> 03:21:50,640
every version starting in one two three

4668
03:21:50,640 --> 03:21:54,560
or four but with the second value being

4669
03:21:54,560 --> 03:21:56,640
from zero to eight

4670
03:21:56,640 --> 03:22:01,120
and this this is one of this is the the

4671
03:22:01,120 --> 03:22:03,920
latest version that one won't be much on

4672
03:22:03,920 --> 03:22:07,520
this ratchet matching and if you run it

4673
03:22:07,520 --> 03:22:08,720
if we

4674
03:22:08,720 --> 03:22:10,479
i don't think it's going to work this

4675
03:22:10,479 --> 03:22:12,640
time because i think they updated it but

4676
03:22:12,640 --> 03:22:16,000
let me let me go for it

4677
03:22:19,279 --> 03:22:21,760
so this is the answer sheet so

4678
03:22:21,760 --> 03:22:25,200
on the left guide

4679
03:22:25,200 --> 03:22:27,920
what you need to do is you need to run

4680
03:22:27,920 --> 03:22:30,080
it

4681
03:22:30,880 --> 03:22:33,279
this way

4682
03:22:33,279 --> 03:22:34,960
you need to run it

4683
03:22:34,960 --> 03:22:38,800
you need to run it this way

4684
03:22:38,960 --> 03:22:41,439
so that way we will have ash

4685
03:22:41,439 --> 03:22:44,720
lower or shorter

4686
03:22:44,720 --> 03:22:46,080
and

4687
03:22:46,080 --> 03:22:49,520
less results and

4688
03:22:49,520 --> 03:22:50,399
and

4689
03:22:50,399 --> 03:22:51,840
now we

4690
03:22:51,840 --> 03:22:55,760
might need to open this

4691
03:22:55,760 --> 03:22:57,040
file

4692
03:22:57,040 --> 03:22:59,040
and download it

4693
03:22:59,040 --> 03:23:02,800
so we got to raw

4694
03:23:02,800 --> 03:23:05,840
and now we

4695
03:23:08,560 --> 03:23:12,960
so now we move this file to

4696
03:23:12,960 --> 03:23:15,278
test

4697
03:23:27,439 --> 03:23:28,880
and

4698
03:23:28,880 --> 03:23:32,239
now we do nuclear validates just to see

4699
03:23:32,239 --> 03:23:33,680
if it's

4700
03:23:33,680 --> 03:23:36,160
correct

4701
03:23:38,960 --> 03:23:43,600
yes and now we can run it against

4702
03:23:43,600 --> 03:23:45,840
the

4703
03:23:48,399 --> 03:23:49,920
against

4704
03:23:49,920 --> 03:23:51,920
the

4705
03:23:51,920 --> 03:23:55,359
urls from the program

4706
03:23:55,359 --> 03:23:58,720
so let me get it here

4707
03:23:58,720 --> 03:24:02,080
because included space

4708
03:24:02,080 --> 03:24:03,840
and then

4709
03:24:03,840 --> 03:24:07,520
we come to nuclear ions t

4710
03:24:07,520 --> 03:24:09,359
cpe

4711
03:24:09,359 --> 03:24:11,680
let's see what happens

4712
03:24:11,680 --> 03:24:14,479
again it says no templar found probably

4713
03:24:14,479 --> 03:24:17,439
because it's not correct

4714
03:24:17,439 --> 03:24:20,479
something wrong with it

4715
03:24:20,800 --> 03:24:23,120
start

4716
03:24:23,120 --> 03:24:26,120
but

4717
03:24:27,510 --> 03:24:29,439
[Music]

4718
03:24:29,439 --> 03:24:31,680
the thing is that you get

4719
03:24:31,680 --> 03:24:33,840
got

4720
03:24:33,840 --> 03:24:35,680
modified by

4721
03:24:35,680 --> 03:24:38,239
the kit

4722
03:24:38,640 --> 03:24:41,640
format

4723
03:24:45,439 --> 03:24:47,760
yeah you see

4724
03:24:47,760 --> 03:24:50,640
you see now we found

4725
03:24:50,640 --> 03:24:51,840
several

4726
03:24:51,840 --> 03:24:54,160
instances that are vulnerable i already

4727
03:24:54,160 --> 03:24:56,000
reported it

4728
03:24:56,000 --> 03:24:58,160
near months ago but they haven't fixed

4729
03:24:58,160 --> 03:24:59,680
it

4730
03:24:59,680 --> 03:25:01,920
i don't know why they like duplicate it

4731
03:25:01,920 --> 03:25:04,000
i guess

4732
03:25:04,000 --> 03:25:07,279
so i found yeah cell phone

4733
03:25:07,279 --> 03:25:09,040
you want a lot two instances but let's

4734
03:25:09,040 --> 03:25:11,600
see what happens if i run it with

4735
03:25:11,600 --> 03:25:14,080
all the urls oh wait but i did a grip

4736
03:25:14,080 --> 03:25:16,319
there

4737
03:25:16,399 --> 03:25:17,359
so

4738
03:25:17,359 --> 03:25:19,680
yeah

4739
03:25:19,840 --> 03:25:22,840
so

4740
03:25:27,680 --> 03:25:30,640
so in the meantime i will i will show

4741
03:25:30,640 --> 03:25:31,920
you

4742
03:25:31,920 --> 03:25:34,960
so this is the exercise number five it's

4743
03:25:34,960 --> 03:25:37,600
pretty simple you have a template

4744
03:25:37,600 --> 03:25:39,920
and you can use it to report like i told

4745
03:25:39,920 --> 03:25:41,680
you before i have a

4746
03:25:41,680 --> 03:25:43,840
github with many templates in case you

4747
03:25:43,840 --> 03:25:46,640
find another box to report

4748
03:25:46,640 --> 03:25:47,680
and

4749
03:25:47,680 --> 03:25:51,040
now that we've finished that we can go

4750
03:25:51,040 --> 03:25:53,520
to the exercise yeah here we have the

4751
03:25:53,520 --> 03:25:54,880
detail

4752
03:25:54,880 --> 03:25:56,640
the same way that i use

4753
03:25:56,640 --> 03:25:59,200
to store what that i used where i still

4754
03:25:59,200 --> 03:26:00,960
use it

4755
03:26:00,960 --> 03:26:04,080
it's it's a stuck at it which is pretty

4756
03:26:04,080 --> 03:26:05,439
cool because you can create your

4757
03:26:05,439 --> 03:26:06,960
templates

4758
03:26:06,960 --> 03:26:07,840
on

4759
03:26:07,840 --> 03:26:09,920
macdonald so you just copy and paste all

4760
03:26:09,920 --> 03:26:12,239
the sites

4761
03:26:12,239 --> 03:26:13,680
all the sites

4762
03:26:13,680 --> 03:26:15,600
you smart down to

4763
03:26:15,600 --> 03:26:17,840
two reports but the good thing about

4764
03:26:17,840 --> 03:26:19,840
this is that i i think i paid i don't

4765
03:26:19,840 --> 03:26:22,479
know how much not a lot

4766
03:26:22,479 --> 03:26:25,200
finally and i and i could export in pdf

4767
03:26:25,200 --> 03:26:28,239
or in other formats and pdf mostly

4768
03:26:28,239 --> 03:26:29,680
so it's very useful when i need to

4769
03:26:29,680 --> 03:26:32,399
report like a a company that doesn't

4770
03:26:32,399 --> 03:26:33,840
have a program

4771
03:26:33,840 --> 03:26:35,200
so i just send that an email with the

4772
03:26:35,200 --> 03:26:37,680
pdf and the pdf looks pretty nice you

4773
03:26:37,680 --> 03:26:38,640
see

4774
03:26:38,640 --> 03:26:39,359
so

4775
03:26:39,359 --> 03:26:42,319
when i create a report i don't need to

4776
03:26:42,319 --> 03:26:44,439
think much i just replace the

4777
03:26:44,439 --> 03:26:47,359
urls and i check that everything works

4778
03:26:47,359 --> 03:26:49,439
you could do this automatically like i

4779
03:26:49,439 --> 03:26:50,640
told you

4780
03:26:50,640 --> 03:26:51,680
i have

4781
03:26:51,680 --> 03:26:54,000
i have

4782
03:26:54,800 --> 03:26:57,600
i have a script that uses that creates

4783
03:26:57,600 --> 03:26:59,600
the template

4784
03:26:59,600 --> 03:27:01,520
that retrieves the template

4785
03:27:01,520 --> 03:27:04,560
and fills with the values and report it

4786
03:27:04,560 --> 03:27:07,279
to a hot one

4787
03:27:07,279 --> 03:27:09,040
and

4788
03:27:09,040 --> 03:27:11,920
eventually i'm gonna

4789
03:27:11,920 --> 03:27:15,439
improve it to use templates as a yaml

4790
03:27:15,439 --> 03:27:17,600
yaml for them

4791
03:27:17,600 --> 03:27:20,960
that would be easier for me to include

4792
03:27:20,960 --> 03:27:22,000
them

4793
03:27:22,000 --> 03:27:23,840
to glue more because let me let me show

4794
03:27:23,840 --> 03:27:28,120
you how difficult it is

4795
03:27:29,520 --> 03:27:33,120
on my source code over there

4796
03:27:33,520 --> 03:27:37,520
which i quickly create

4797
03:27:37,520 --> 03:27:40,560
the repositories

4798
03:27:40,960 --> 03:27:46,640
so if i go to my to the apa client

4799
03:27:46,720 --> 03:27:50,080
if you see creator reports

4800
03:27:50,080 --> 03:27:53,039
this is the template

4801
03:27:53,520 --> 03:27:54,840
it's difficult

4802
03:27:54,840 --> 03:27:58,880
to read because he doesn't support

4803
03:27:58,880 --> 03:28:00,160
new lines

4804
03:28:00,160 --> 03:28:02,399
it took me a while to figure out how to

4805
03:28:02,399 --> 03:28:03,520
do it

4806
03:28:03,520 --> 03:28:05,040
you need to get the weakness from the

4807
03:28:05,040 --> 03:28:07,840
site which is pretty silly

4808
03:28:07,840 --> 03:28:10,319
so imagine the housing how much simpler

4809
03:28:10,319 --> 03:28:12,239
it would be if i had a yemel template

4810
03:28:12,239 --> 03:28:14,080
that i just can call

4811
03:28:14,080 --> 03:28:15,680
like nuclei

4812
03:28:15,680 --> 03:28:18,399
and it doesn't look that bad though

4813
03:28:18,399 --> 03:28:20,000
it could be the worst

4814
03:28:20,000 --> 03:28:22,560
doesn't have any eyes but only supports

4815
03:28:22,560 --> 03:28:24,560
i only support uh

4816
03:28:24,560 --> 03:28:27,359
four different bugs

4817
03:28:27,359 --> 03:28:30,560
and yeah i hope so at some point people

4818
03:28:30,560 --> 03:28:32,239
because i'm using it

4819
03:28:32,239 --> 03:28:34,560
sometimes to report like

4820
03:28:34,560 --> 03:28:35,920
many many bugs

4821
03:28:35,920 --> 03:28:38,960
of the same type so i just modified

4822
03:28:38,960 --> 03:28:42,239
the values the url and and the owner the

4823
03:28:42,239 --> 03:28:44,640
company not the problem

4824
03:28:44,640 --> 03:28:47,040
okay so yeah so you that's what i use

4825
03:28:47,040 --> 03:28:49,200
for templates

4826
03:28:49,200 --> 03:28:52,200
and

4827
03:28:52,640 --> 03:28:54,560
yeah so propose exercise try to get a

4828
03:28:54,560 --> 03:28:56,399
bond

4829
03:28:56,399 --> 03:28:58,960
so the last exercise or the last part

4830
03:28:58,960 --> 03:29:00,640
we're gonna see is one of the tools that

4831
03:29:00,640 --> 03:29:04,560
i like the most it's called axiom

4832
03:29:04,560 --> 03:29:09,039
and the installation just closed it

4833
03:29:09,200 --> 03:29:10,800
the installation

4834
03:29:10,800 --> 03:29:12,640
process is not simple

4835
03:29:12,640 --> 03:29:14,560
it's

4836
03:29:14,560 --> 03:29:15,520
prone

4837
03:29:15,520 --> 03:29:18,880
to many errors depending on your system

4838
03:29:18,880 --> 03:29:21,760
some people on the latest workshop will

4839
03:29:21,760 --> 03:29:24,640
install it right away

4840
03:29:24,640 --> 03:29:28,399
and i need to change this link

4841
03:29:28,720 --> 03:29:34,199
to change that link for the other one

4842
03:29:34,319 --> 03:29:36,800
one

4843
03:29:37,600 --> 03:29:39,760
two two two

4844
03:29:39,760 --> 03:29:41,840
two okay

4845
03:29:41,840 --> 03:29:44,560
so if you use this link you will get a

4846
03:29:44,560 --> 03:29:46,800
hundred dollars free credit that you can

4847
03:29:46,800 --> 03:29:50,319
use to test your machine

4848
03:29:50,319 --> 03:29:52,479
the installation process

4849
03:29:52,479 --> 03:29:53,920
it's

4850
03:29:53,920 --> 03:29:56,080
like i said

4851
03:29:56,080 --> 03:29:58,319
it's prone to errors depending on your

4852
03:29:58,319 --> 03:30:00,560
configuration if you do it if you manage

4853
03:30:00,560 --> 03:30:02,800
to install it properly

4854
03:30:02,800 --> 03:30:05,120
you need to create a fleet and a fleet

4855
03:30:05,120 --> 03:30:06,640
is basically

4856
03:30:06,640 --> 03:30:07,520
a

4857
03:30:07,520 --> 03:30:09,359
group of 10

4858
03:30:09,359 --> 03:30:12,880
droplets or instances or vms whatever

4859
03:30:12,880 --> 03:30:15,120
you want to call them

4860
03:30:15,120 --> 03:30:17,279
so um

4861
03:30:17,279 --> 03:30:20,000
in this case i will run it i will run it

4862
03:30:20,000 --> 03:30:20,880
on

4863
03:30:20,880 --> 03:30:21,760
my

4864
03:30:21,760 --> 03:30:24,479
on my configuration on my machine on my

4865
03:30:24,479 --> 03:30:26,880
proper

4866
03:30:28,399 --> 03:30:32,319
server or so let me

4867
03:30:32,319 --> 03:30:35,359
so look at this look at this

4868
03:30:35,359 --> 03:30:37,680
look at this command

4869
03:30:37,680 --> 03:30:40,720
let me see if it's running something

4870
03:30:40,720 --> 03:30:43,720
um

4871
03:30:44,560 --> 03:30:46,239
oh yeah i was running something last

4872
03:30:46,239 --> 03:30:48,800
night forgot about it it's time out time

4873
03:30:48,800 --> 03:30:51,120
all the time

4874
03:30:51,120 --> 03:30:53,439
just let me kill it

4875
03:30:53,439 --> 03:30:54,319
okay

4876
03:30:54,319 --> 03:30:55,840
so in my case

4877
03:30:55,840 --> 03:30:58,399
i have 30 instances

4878
03:30:58,399 --> 03:31:00,000
you could have more

4879
03:31:00,000 --> 03:31:01,040
if you

4880
03:31:01,040 --> 03:31:02,560
have

4881
03:31:02,560 --> 03:31:04,640
if they authorize it to you in digital

4882
03:31:04,640 --> 03:31:08,000
television it's easier i have line node

4883
03:31:08,000 --> 03:31:10,800
i have more restrictions

4884
03:31:10,800 --> 03:31:13,279
but and this is not what i wanted to do

4885
03:31:13,279 --> 03:31:15,439
i wanted to okay

4886
03:31:15,439 --> 03:31:17,840
so i can if i want to list how many

4887
03:31:17,840 --> 03:31:20,479
instances i have how many

4888
03:31:20,479 --> 03:31:24,800
you know as you can see i have 30 30

4889
03:31:25,279 --> 03:31:28,640
different uh droplets or

4890
03:31:28,640 --> 03:31:29,920
line notes or

4891
03:31:29,920 --> 03:31:31,120
vms

4892
03:31:31,120 --> 03:31:33,680
and every every droplet have a different

4893
03:31:33,680 --> 03:31:36,640
ip which is good that way you get

4894
03:31:36,640 --> 03:31:40,720
better results if they block your ap or

4895
03:31:40,720 --> 03:31:43,520
or they regulate with you you got

4896
03:31:43,520 --> 03:31:44,800
another 30.

4897
03:31:44,800 --> 03:31:48,239
so i'm gonna run i'm gonna run it

4898
03:31:48,239 --> 03:31:50,319
what i wanted to run but i'm gonna i'm

4899
03:31:50,319 --> 03:31:52,840
going to

4900
03:31:52,840 --> 03:31:54,970
limit to

4901
03:31:54,970 --> 03:31:57,520
[Music]

4902
03:31:57,520 --> 03:32:00,000
the weight

4903
03:32:00,399 --> 03:32:02,160
head

4904
03:32:02,160 --> 03:32:05,200
minus ten thousand

4905
03:32:05,200 --> 03:32:07,279
so i'm going to run every template

4906
03:32:07,279 --> 03:32:09,359
against all my urls but only the first

4907
03:32:09,359 --> 03:32:12,399
ten thousand euros

4908
03:32:14,960 --> 03:32:17,279
so it's gonna take a while

4909
03:32:17,279 --> 03:32:19,840
probably

4910
03:32:19,920 --> 03:32:22,000
not as much only 10 thousand anywhere

4911
03:32:22,000 --> 03:32:23,520
else not that much

4912
03:32:23,520 --> 03:32:25,600
i usually run it

4913
03:32:25,600 --> 03:32:30,160
against all my urls which are like

4914
03:32:30,160 --> 03:32:33,680
this time 800 000

4915
03:32:33,680 --> 03:32:36,640
i have many programs that are disabled

4916
03:32:36,640 --> 03:32:40,160
so if i run it against all of them

4917
03:32:40,160 --> 03:32:42,720
it would be

4918
03:32:44,239 --> 03:32:46,560
it would be around

4919
03:32:46,560 --> 03:32:49,279
1.7 million

4920
03:32:49,279 --> 03:32:52,239
but uh

4921
03:32:52,399 --> 03:32:54,800
it's not

4922
03:32:54,800 --> 03:32:57,680
it's taking a while okay let's let me

4923
03:32:57,680 --> 03:33:00,479
check the server

4924
03:33:02,479 --> 03:33:05,439
to serve some problems or what no it's

4925
03:33:05,439 --> 03:33:07,200
pretty

4926
03:33:07,200 --> 03:33:09,279
it's pretty good

4927
03:33:09,279 --> 03:33:12,640
just very well because probably

4928
03:33:12,640 --> 03:33:16,160
won't affect the number that much

4929
03:33:16,479 --> 03:33:19,840
the head enough for the head

4930
03:33:20,239 --> 03:33:23,120
because it's just going to

4931
03:33:23,120 --> 03:33:25,200
wait for the first command to finish and

4932
03:33:25,200 --> 03:33:28,960
then cut the first 10 000

4933
03:33:29,040 --> 03:33:32,720
and i wanted a way to

4934
03:33:32,720 --> 03:33:34,399
i don't know why it's taking so long

4935
03:33:34,399 --> 03:33:37,439
probably when you run it on your own you

4936
03:33:37,439 --> 03:33:38,880
don't

4937
03:33:38,880 --> 03:33:41,120
you're not expecting it to run fast but

4938
03:33:41,120 --> 03:33:44,399
since i have two guys here

4939
03:33:44,399 --> 03:33:46,880
so as you can see is running

4940
03:33:46,880 --> 03:33:47,760
and

4941
03:33:47,760 --> 03:33:49,680
it's getting a lot of results that are

4942
03:33:49,680 --> 03:33:51,040
info

4943
03:33:51,040 --> 03:33:54,160
a lot of templates are resolving

4944
03:33:54,160 --> 03:33:55,439
and

4945
03:33:55,439 --> 03:33:57,600
sometimes you get sometimes you get

4946
03:33:57,600 --> 03:34:02,000
proper bugs just just have the

4947
03:34:02,000 --> 03:34:04,080
the side of the box so

4948
03:34:04,080 --> 03:34:06,160
if you check the data what it does what

4949
03:34:06,160 --> 03:34:08,160
it's called about axiom

4950
03:34:08,160 --> 03:34:10,640
is that it will it will

4951
03:34:10,640 --> 03:34:13,600
split the input

4952
03:34:13,600 --> 03:34:14,560
between

4953
03:34:14,560 --> 03:34:16,960
30 30 files

4954
03:34:16,960 --> 03:34:20,160
and it will send every file to a

4955
03:34:20,160 --> 03:34:22,720
vm and run nutrient on it

4956
03:34:22,720 --> 03:34:24,960
so you see here i'm getting these

4957
03:34:24,960 --> 03:34:26,399
screens because i'm

4958
03:34:26,399 --> 03:34:28,399
getting the output of 30

4959
03:34:28,399 --> 03:34:31,359
30 nuclear instances

4960
03:34:31,359 --> 03:34:34,080
and imagine how fast it is

4961
03:34:34,080 --> 03:34:37,520
30 30 times faster what well

4962
03:34:37,520 --> 03:34:39,439
some sometimes are

4963
03:34:39,439 --> 03:34:41,680
much faster than your local machine

4964
03:34:41,680 --> 03:34:43,120
because of the

4965
03:34:43,120 --> 03:34:46,239
internet latins the latency or

4966
03:34:46,239 --> 03:34:49,359
other parameters that are

4967
03:34:49,359 --> 03:34:52,160
different from the your machine compared

4968
03:34:52,160 --> 03:34:54,319
to ibm

4969
03:34:54,319 --> 03:34:55,359
so

4970
03:34:55,359 --> 03:34:58,560
yeah so uh what i look for

4971
03:34:58,560 --> 03:35:00,880
what i will do

4972
03:35:00,880 --> 03:35:03,200
sometimes there are false positives or

4973
03:35:03,200 --> 03:35:04,960
things that are not

4974
03:35:04,960 --> 03:35:06,880
are not vulnerable anymore for example

4975
03:35:06,880 --> 03:35:10,000
this take over some domain took over

4976
03:35:10,000 --> 03:35:11,920
some domain to cover

4977
03:35:11,920 --> 03:35:14,399
but believe me that

4978
03:35:14,399 --> 03:35:15,760
i've run this

4979
03:35:15,760 --> 03:35:17,680
scan and i've found

4980
03:35:17,680 --> 03:35:18,800
several

4981
03:35:18,800 --> 03:35:20,479
things that are broader and i've

4982
03:35:20,479 --> 03:35:22,319
reported them so

4983
03:35:22,319 --> 03:35:23,520
that's why i'm telling you that i

4984
03:35:23,520 --> 03:35:24,560
haven't

4985
03:35:24,560 --> 03:35:27,040
really get into manual process because

4986
03:35:27,040 --> 03:35:29,040
every time that i run this

4987
03:35:29,040 --> 03:35:32,239
and every time the and then the longer

4988
03:35:32,239 --> 03:35:34,479
the longer it pass i mean

4989
03:35:34,479 --> 03:35:36,399
the more time i'm i'm doing blue body

4990
03:35:36,399 --> 03:35:38,640
hunter more programs i have so every

4991
03:35:38,640 --> 03:35:41,040
time that i run

4992
03:35:41,040 --> 03:35:43,680
this command i will at the time that i

4993
03:35:43,680 --> 03:35:46,319
run nuclei there are more templates

4994
03:35:46,319 --> 03:35:48,720
then i will modify templates and i will

4995
03:35:48,720 --> 03:35:50,800
get more results and then i will

4996
03:35:50,800 --> 03:35:52,800
the bad thing is that sometimes i get a

4997
03:35:52,800 --> 03:35:54,239
lot of

4998
03:35:54,239 --> 03:35:57,120
bugs from programs that are not paid

4999
03:35:57,120 --> 03:35:59,439
so i will increase my

5000
03:35:59,439 --> 03:36:01,600
reputation on hunger one but i wouldn't

5001
03:36:01,600 --> 03:36:02,800
get

5002
03:36:02,800 --> 03:36:05,040
bounties i wouldn't got

5003
03:36:05,040 --> 03:36:08,560
well i've been i've been having like 300

5004
03:36:08,560 --> 03:36:10,960
400 dollars per month on average in the

5005
03:36:10,960 --> 03:36:13,279
last six months i think

5006
03:36:13,279 --> 03:36:16,239
but if i get a p1 that i'm waiting for

5007
03:36:16,239 --> 03:36:18,720
that might be a game changer

5008
03:36:18,720 --> 03:36:19,680
maybe

5009
03:36:19,680 --> 03:36:22,640
closer to be a book bounty hunter

5010
03:36:22,640 --> 03:36:25,199
billionaire

5011
03:36:25,359 --> 03:36:26,800
um

5012
03:36:26,800 --> 03:36:28,800
yeah there's a lot of that a lot of guys

5013
03:36:28,800 --> 03:36:29,760
are

5014
03:36:29,760 --> 03:36:31,840
posting on twitter

5015
03:36:31,840 --> 03:36:34,880
the new lamborghini they bought or

5016
03:36:34,880 --> 03:36:36,239
how much money are they getting they're

5017
03:36:36,239 --> 03:36:37,439
probably

5018
03:36:37,439 --> 03:36:38,880
probably

5019
03:36:38,880 --> 03:36:40,960
half of them are low or less they're

5020
03:36:40,960 --> 03:36:42,399
really actually getting that amount of

5021
03:36:42,399 --> 03:36:43,680
money

5022
03:36:43,680 --> 03:36:46,239
it's difficult though it's uh

5023
03:36:46,239 --> 03:36:48,640
if you see it's only one percent and

5024
03:36:48,640 --> 03:36:50,000
[Music]

5025
03:36:50,000 --> 03:36:52,720
um running it against

5026
03:36:52,720 --> 03:36:55,039
you know

5027
03:36:55,600 --> 03:37:00,160
multiplied by 30 10 000 10 000 hosts

5028
03:37:00,160 --> 03:37:02,640
and it's gonna take it's gonna take

5029
03:37:02,640 --> 03:37:05,120
it's gonna take a while

5030
03:37:05,120 --> 03:37:07,920
and what i usually do is that i

5031
03:37:07,920 --> 03:37:09,760
exclude

5032
03:37:09,760 --> 03:37:12,080
templates that i know that they don't

5033
03:37:12,080 --> 03:37:14,000
give a lot of information for example

5034
03:37:14,000 --> 03:37:15,359
this one

5035
03:37:15,359 --> 03:37:17,439
if you see this one the only thing that

5036
03:37:17,439 --> 03:37:18,399
it will

5037
03:37:18,399 --> 03:37:20,640
so when you have a template that gives a

5038
03:37:20,640 --> 03:37:23,200
lot of output like for example here okay

5039
03:37:23,200 --> 03:37:25,040
you have 67

5040
03:37:25,040 --> 03:37:26,319
you know that is something that it's

5041
03:37:26,319 --> 03:37:28,880
gonna it's not gonna be worth

5042
03:37:28,880 --> 03:37:31,120
to report because they

5043
03:37:31,120 --> 03:37:32,479
just

5044
03:37:32,479 --> 03:37:35,520
they don't care especially

5045
03:37:35,520 --> 03:37:38,640
so at some point from somewhere

5046
03:37:38,640 --> 03:37:41,439
the script the template retrieve uh

5047
03:37:41,439 --> 03:37:44,399
locality which is which is cool i

5048
03:37:44,399 --> 03:37:48,080
haven't checked that template lately so

5049
03:37:48,080 --> 03:37:50,080
i might need to check it out the code

5050
03:37:50,080 --> 03:37:52,640
the code ah and let me yeah that's

5051
03:37:52,640 --> 03:37:54,880
that's a good example of something that

5052
03:37:54,880 --> 03:37:57,599
i want to show you

5053
03:37:57,680 --> 03:37:59,920
so one of the things that i

5054
03:37:59,920 --> 03:38:00,960
um

5055
03:38:00,960 --> 03:38:02,640
let's say this this case for example

5056
03:38:02,640 --> 03:38:05,760
which is a pretty simple one

5057
03:38:05,760 --> 03:38:08,080
and if you see if you didn't see what

5058
03:38:08,080 --> 03:38:09,359
happened i just

5059
03:38:09,359 --> 03:38:10,640
i was running

5060
03:38:10,640 --> 03:38:12,800
axiom on a screen

5061
03:38:12,800 --> 03:38:16,479
so screen is a way to run processes

5062
03:38:16,479 --> 03:38:19,040
inside the server or not inside but on a

5063
03:38:19,040 --> 03:38:20,239
different

5064
03:38:20,239 --> 03:38:21,840
let's say

5065
03:38:21,840 --> 03:38:24,720
on on a kind of terminal that is running

5066
03:38:24,720 --> 03:38:26,479
on the server

5067
03:38:26,479 --> 03:38:27,920
um

5068
03:38:27,920 --> 03:38:29,760
i'm sorry if my explanation is not good

5069
03:38:29,760 --> 03:38:30,880
enough but

5070
03:38:30,880 --> 03:38:34,239
it's it keeps running on the server

5071
03:38:34,239 --> 03:38:35,600
and then you can go back during the

5072
03:38:35,600 --> 03:38:37,120
screen r

5073
03:38:37,120 --> 03:38:38,960
and it's like you never

5074
03:38:38,960 --> 03:38:41,199
you never left send you

5075
03:38:41,199 --> 03:38:43,520
so what i did is that

5076
03:38:43,520 --> 03:38:45,520
i had i had this

5077
03:38:45,520 --> 03:38:47,760
this

5078
03:38:48,000 --> 03:38:50,000
this url then

5079
03:38:50,000 --> 03:38:51,920
forgot the

5080
03:38:51,920 --> 03:38:55,840
forgot the actual name of the

5081
03:38:56,720 --> 03:38:59,760
really complicated things to move around

5082
03:38:59,760 --> 03:39:01,359
so let me go back

5083
03:39:01,359 --> 03:39:03,680
to

5084
03:39:03,680 --> 03:39:04,960
the

5085
03:39:04,960 --> 03:39:08,399
assault itself

5086
03:39:08,399 --> 03:39:11,519
but something like

5087
03:39:11,680 --> 03:39:15,680
something with ip addresses

5088
03:39:18,080 --> 03:39:20,479
you can find it

5089
03:39:20,479 --> 03:39:23,840
what is it

5090
03:39:25,439 --> 03:39:28,439
um

5091
03:39:31,630 --> 03:39:35,750
[Music]

5092
03:39:41,680 --> 03:39:44,800
[Music]

5093
03:39:44,800 --> 03:39:48,840
so this is the name of the

5094
03:39:48,840 --> 03:39:51,760
template and this is like just gonna

5095
03:39:51,760 --> 03:39:53,359
copy it because i have

5096
03:39:53,359 --> 03:39:55,760
everything stored on my

5097
03:39:55,760 --> 03:39:57,520
extension

5098
03:39:57,520 --> 03:39:59,439
clipboard extension

5099
03:39:59,439 --> 03:40:02,160
so i created a simple

5100
03:40:02,160 --> 03:40:04,880
script or a function that is

5101
03:40:04,880 --> 03:40:06,319
built on

5102
03:40:06,319 --> 03:40:07,920
bash

5103
03:40:07,920 --> 03:40:09,600
that it will

5104
03:40:09,600 --> 03:40:11,680
uh because i'm always doing the same

5105
03:40:11,680 --> 03:40:13,439
steps you know like

5106
03:40:13,439 --> 03:40:16,239
i need to test if it's a fall positive

5107
03:40:16,239 --> 03:40:19,439
so i will give it the name of the

5108
03:40:19,439 --> 03:40:21,680
template the idea of the plate and then

5109
03:40:21,680 --> 03:40:23,199
oh

5110
03:40:23,199 --> 03:40:26,800
i missed it and i will give it the

5111
03:40:26,800 --> 03:40:30,720
url which is something i lost

5112
03:40:30,720 --> 03:40:33,439
go back again

5113
03:40:33,439 --> 03:40:34,640
so

5114
03:40:34,640 --> 03:40:35,439
let me

5115
03:40:35,439 --> 03:40:38,160
get this one

5116
03:40:38,160 --> 03:40:41,520
and now i store it on the keyboard

5117
03:40:41,520 --> 03:40:44,160
so that there so

5118
03:40:44,160 --> 03:40:46,239
so i want to check it manually right

5119
03:40:46,239 --> 03:40:47,600
what i'm trying to do is check it

5120
03:40:47,600 --> 03:40:51,600
manually what happens what is it about

5121
03:40:51,840 --> 03:40:55,040
so if you see here it's uh

5122
03:40:55,040 --> 03:40:57,680
i'm running on the debug mode device

5123
03:40:57,680 --> 03:40:58,880
mode

5124
03:40:58,880 --> 03:41:01,680
so what's happening is that

5125
03:41:01,680 --> 03:41:05,040
the template it's doing a request

5126
03:41:05,040 --> 03:41:07,439
that it's

5127
03:41:07,439 --> 03:41:09,359
getting a

5128
03:41:09,359 --> 03:41:11,600
response

5129
03:41:11,600 --> 03:41:13,600
from it's like a redirection to this

5130
03:41:13,600 --> 03:41:16,239
location which is my which might be

5131
03:41:16,239 --> 03:41:18,960
which is right for sure uh redirection

5132
03:41:18,960 --> 03:41:21,920
to a local address to a locality

5133
03:41:21,920 --> 03:41:24,640
so if you check the template

5134
03:41:24,640 --> 03:41:27,199
and i also have another

5135
03:41:27,199 --> 03:41:30,399
function to do it easily easily

5136
03:41:30,399 --> 03:41:32,000
is that i just

5137
03:41:32,000 --> 03:41:34,080
use locate cut and the name of the

5138
03:41:34,080 --> 03:41:36,640
template and since the name is unique

5139
03:41:36,640 --> 03:41:38,160
and it's the same as the id of the

5140
03:41:38,160 --> 03:41:41,439
template it will locate it and cut it

5141
03:41:41,439 --> 03:41:43,920
for me so now i can read the code

5142
03:41:43,920 --> 03:41:45,840
i can read the source code and i will

5143
03:41:45,840 --> 03:41:47,359
see what it's doing

5144
03:41:47,359 --> 03:41:48,720
is doing a great request i don't know

5145
03:41:48,720 --> 03:41:50,239
what that means the plus i don't know

5146
03:41:50,239 --> 03:41:52,720
what plus means

5147
03:41:52,720 --> 03:41:54,560
so he's doing

5148
03:41:54,560 --> 03:41:57,680
uh matcher was actually doing a just

5149
03:41:57,680 --> 03:41:59,439
just a simple get

5150
03:41:59,439 --> 03:42:00,720
request

5151
03:42:00,720 --> 03:42:04,239
with the user agent accepting everything

5152
03:42:04,239 --> 03:42:06,399
and yes he's trying to look for that so

5153
03:42:06,399 --> 03:42:08,239
it's uh then you can find more

5154
03:42:08,239 --> 03:42:10,640
information here

5155
03:42:10,640 --> 03:42:13,439
about the bug not not all the templates

5156
03:42:13,439 --> 03:42:15,120
have

5157
03:42:15,120 --> 03:42:16,720
a lot of information so sometimes you

5158
03:42:16,720 --> 03:42:18,319
will spend a lot of time looking for

5159
03:42:18,319 --> 03:42:20,880
what they are

5160
03:42:21,040 --> 03:42:24,880
but then you need to prove impact many

5161
03:42:24,880 --> 03:42:28,319
many programs wouldn't care much about a

5162
03:42:28,319 --> 03:42:31,760
local ap being revealed revealed

5163
03:42:31,760 --> 03:42:34,000
because it doesn't have such a big

5164
03:42:34,000 --> 03:42:34,960
impact

5165
03:42:34,960 --> 03:42:36,880
some programs will take

5166
03:42:36,880 --> 03:42:39,839
we'll check them

5167
03:42:40,000 --> 03:42:42,239
and

5168
03:42:49,279 --> 03:42:53,319
let me read the chats

5169
03:43:00,880 --> 03:43:02,479
what's not updated

5170
03:43:02,479 --> 03:43:06,319
i'm editing i'm editing it in

5171
03:43:06,319 --> 03:43:08,080
life

5172
03:43:08,080 --> 03:43:10,479
pray for you who's praying for me for me

5173
03:43:10,479 --> 03:43:12,560
that doesn't mean

5174
03:43:12,560 --> 03:43:15,120
what that is mean

5175
03:43:15,120 --> 03:43:18,720
i don't i don't understand ukrainian

5176
03:43:18,720 --> 03:43:21,439
non-russian

5177
03:43:21,439 --> 03:43:24,160
supportable

5178
03:43:25,120 --> 03:43:26,640
yeah i will

5179
03:43:26,640 --> 03:43:28,000
check that later

5180
03:43:28,000 --> 03:43:30,399
now you have any questions because i'm

5181
03:43:30,399 --> 03:43:32,080
about to

5182
03:43:32,080 --> 03:43:34,160
finish

5183
03:43:34,160 --> 03:43:36,000
we have everything

5184
03:43:36,000 --> 03:43:38,399
we cover

5185
03:43:38,399 --> 03:43:40,560
axiom action

5186
03:43:40,560 --> 03:43:41,680
it's

5187
03:43:41,680 --> 03:43:44,720
great so my favorite tools

5188
03:43:44,720 --> 03:43:46,960
i not only run

5189
03:43:46,960 --> 03:43:50,720
my scans i run all the tools as well

5190
03:43:50,720 --> 03:43:52,960
for example since i have too many

5191
03:43:52,960 --> 03:43:54,640
so many

5192
03:43:54,640 --> 03:43:56,560
urls i need to clean them i need to

5193
03:43:56,560 --> 03:43:58,000
clean the ones that are not working

5194
03:43:58,000 --> 03:43:58,960
anymore

5195
03:43:58,960 --> 03:44:01,359
so i'll use let me show you better it's

5196
03:44:01,359 --> 03:44:04,560
better to show than to say

5197
03:44:04,560 --> 03:44:07,920
so i will run httpx do you remember the

5198
03:44:07,920 --> 03:44:09,760
one that i run before

5199
03:44:09,760 --> 03:44:12,560
but against

5200
03:44:12,560 --> 03:44:14,840
using

5201
03:44:14,840 --> 03:44:17,600
using all these

5202
03:44:17,600 --> 03:44:21,120
domains that are

5203
03:44:21,920 --> 03:44:24,080
four million

5204
03:44:24,080 --> 03:44:27,920
around four million so i will run httpx

5205
03:44:27,920 --> 03:44:29,760
against these four million domains but

5206
03:44:29,760 --> 03:44:32,640
looking for different ports

5207
03:44:32,640 --> 03:44:36,800
and using 120 flips and he might take

5208
03:44:36,800 --> 03:44:39,439
using the 30 30 30 machines it might

5209
03:44:39,439 --> 03:44:40,720
take

5210
03:44:40,720 --> 03:44:42,840
a day or so which

5211
03:44:42,840 --> 03:44:46,399
is it's a lot but

5212
03:44:46,399 --> 03:44:48,800
without axiom it will be

5213
03:44:48,800 --> 03:44:51,520
much much much much much longer

5214
03:44:51,520 --> 03:44:54,080
30 times longer on average

5215
03:44:54,080 --> 03:44:55,600
so

5216
03:44:55,600 --> 03:44:57,920
i would like to know if you have any

5217
03:44:57,920 --> 03:44:59,520
questions

5218
03:44:59,520 --> 03:45:02,399
who's praying for me

5219
03:45:03,600 --> 03:45:05,279
so yes um

5220
03:45:05,279 --> 03:45:08,560
let me go to the slides to see if i have

5221
03:45:08,560 --> 03:45:10,960
something else i guess i do i do have

5222
03:45:10,960 --> 03:45:12,960
something else

5223
03:45:12,960 --> 03:45:16,080
because i remember that i so for the

5224
03:45:16,080 --> 03:45:18,880
nuclei that you have the

5225
03:45:18,880 --> 03:45:20,800
they're

5226
03:45:20,800 --> 03:45:23,520
running nuclei

5227
03:45:23,520 --> 03:45:25,199
templates

5228
03:45:25,199 --> 03:45:26,880
to develop difficult to test the

5229
03:45:26,880 --> 03:45:28,479
documentation is good not good it's

5230
03:45:28,479 --> 03:45:30,239
getting better yes it's getting better

5231
03:45:30,239 --> 03:45:33,680
by the day mostly

5232
03:45:33,680 --> 03:45:34,800
and

5233
03:45:34,800 --> 03:45:36,640
yeah we already said that

5234
03:45:36,640 --> 03:45:38,000
let's wait too

5235
03:45:38,000 --> 03:45:41,040
yeah actually some templates that i have

5236
03:45:41,040 --> 03:45:44,720
i think i have 13 or 14 templates

5237
03:45:44,720 --> 03:45:48,560
exercise for exercise action

5238
03:45:48,560 --> 03:45:51,760
yes we did that we did that

5239
03:45:51,760 --> 03:45:55,800
this is not correct

5240
03:45:56,239 --> 03:45:58,800
probably well

5241
03:45:58,800 --> 03:46:01,600
that's it if you wanna

5242
03:46:01,600 --> 03:46:04,399
the feedback is not available because

5243
03:46:04,399 --> 03:46:07,279
it's password protected

5244
03:46:07,279 --> 03:46:09,439
no it's not represented anymore so if

5245
03:46:09,439 --> 03:46:11,040
you wanna

5246
03:46:11,040 --> 03:46:13,279
if you wanna send your feedback

5247
03:46:13,279 --> 03:46:17,840
um be happy to get it

5248
03:46:18,160 --> 03:46:21,520
if it's flat or if it's good

5249
03:46:21,520 --> 03:46:22,800
um

5250
03:46:22,800 --> 03:46:24,880
well consider that it's difficult to do

5251
03:46:24,880 --> 03:46:26,080
a workshop

5252
03:46:26,080 --> 03:46:28,560
online

5253
03:46:28,800 --> 03:46:33,198
so here you got the feedback url

5254
03:46:33,279 --> 03:46:34,319
and

5255
03:46:34,319 --> 03:46:35,600
yes

5256
03:46:35,600 --> 03:46:36,960
that's it

5257
03:46:36,960 --> 03:46:39,760
great thank you for

5258
03:46:39,760 --> 03:46:42,000
this opportunity to give this workshop

5259
03:46:42,000 --> 03:46:44,479
for the second second time in a row i

5260
03:46:44,479 --> 03:46:46,000
hope

5261
03:46:46,000 --> 03:46:48,960
next year i can go to ukraine

5262
03:46:48,960 --> 03:46:53,080
okay guys have a good day
