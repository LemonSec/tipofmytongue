1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,960
hi there uh my name is eva galperin i am

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,040
the director of cyber security at the

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,120
electronic frontier foundation

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,759
and i am going to talk to you a little

5
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:14,960
bit about

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,840
the work that eff does the work that i

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,119
have done

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,680
about privacy and security all over the

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,640
world and how you can do a little bit of

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,320
that work yourself

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,760
so uh

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,880
usually i would be joining you in

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,160
in kiev but we are now in year two of

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,040
the plague so i am doing

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,920
this keynote from the comfort of my own

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,160
home not even the eff office

17
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,520
i have put on a festive gown um but

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,440
because we're doing this this talk from

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,960
inside of my house i am also wearing

20
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,320
fuzzy slippers

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,520
uh so normally what i would do when uh

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,640
when i start a keynote is uh look out

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,840
over the audience and ask everybody uh

24
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,520
how many people here

25
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,680
know what eff is so right now i'm just

26
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,920
going to pretend that i have asked you

27
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,600
how many people here know what eff is

28
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,960
and that some of you raised your hands

29
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,400
and some of you knew and some of you did

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,960
not know i and then i usually look

31
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,040
relieved and i go ah good i don't have

32
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,439
to do a long explanation and then i i

33
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,520
launch into sort of a medium-sized

34
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,799
explanation of what eff is and what we

35
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:23,680
do

36
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,640
so the electronic frontier foundation is

37
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,600
a digital civil liberties organization

38
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,479
uh we make sure that when you go online

39
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,840
your rights come with you and in order

40
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,840
to do this we have

41
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,680
teams of lawyers uh activists all over

42
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,920
the world and technologists and we sort

43
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,840
of combine to follow the to form a

44
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,960
voltron doing all kinds of interesting

45
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,640
work in order to uh in order to help to

46
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,280
maintain people's civil liberties

47
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,479
i have worked at eff uh

48
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,520
for 14 years now since uh since 2007

49
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,640
and

50
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,439
as a result i have had the opportunity

51
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,878
to work at eff through a lot of really

52
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,440
interesting times and in a bunch of

53
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,680
really interesting positions

54
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,920
for example when i started at eff

55
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,520
we were in the middle of our lawsuit

56
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,879
against a t for their part in

57
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:27,680
the

58
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,800
u.s

59
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,720
government's warrantless wiretapping

60
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,000
program

61
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,280
where they were installing secret rooms

62
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,360
in uh in telcos and simply copying over

63
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,840
all of the all of the data that was

64
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,959
going through there and using it to spy

65
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,720
on um

66
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,640
on americans and also people all over

67
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,840
the world and the only reason that

68
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,720
people

69
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,040
in the us were particularly bent out of

70
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,840
shape about spying on americans is that

71
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,360
the nsa is specifically forbidden from

72
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,599
spying on the communications of

73
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,879
americans

74
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,879
the nsa argued that they were not spying

75
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,400
on the communications they were merely

76
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,760
copying the communications for possible

77
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,519
spying later

78
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,640
and that court case lasted for many

79
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,959
years and

80
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,159
it was actually the reason why snowden

81
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,800
uh first uh published the the first of

82
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,519
his revelations uh from inside of the

83
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,040
nsa and the very first thing that

84
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,599
snowden published was a uh was an order

85
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,360
from the nsa to verizon which gave rise

86
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,120
to eff's uh case against uh directly

87
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,879
against the government

88
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,360
and that was ongoing for many years one

89
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,120
of the things that you learn about

90
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,720
impact litigation

91
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,040
that thing where you have lawyers who

92
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,799
file cases that they think are going to

93
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,720
really make a difference

94
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,799
to the law for everybody impacting not

95
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,400
just the people who are the plaintiffs

96
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,720
or the defendants in the case

97
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,000
but all kinds of other people uh is that

98
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,799
the wheels of justice move very very

99
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,519
slowly uh there was a copyright case

100
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,840
that that eff refers to as the dancing

101
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,920
baby case um because it involved a baby

102
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,399
dancing on youtube to pro i think

103
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,959
something like 14 seconds of prince's

104
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,759
let's go crazy and that copyright case

105
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,199
with universal

106
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,240
lasted so long that i think that baby

107
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,919
was approaching middle school by the

108
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,759
time it settled

109
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,120
so uh we have we have these sort of

110
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,680
three different kinds of people we have

111
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,759
we have lawyers who do who do impact

112
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,960
litigation uh and we have activists we

113
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,919
have

114
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,080
activists all over the world because

115
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,199
sometimes the answer to a

116
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,199
digital civil liberties problem is that

117
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,440
people have to get out in the streets

118
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,800
or people have to sign a petition

119
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,600
or

120
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,400
people

121
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,560
need to make their voices heard about a

122
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,960
particular issue that's that's why we

123
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,000
have activists um again one of the sort

124
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,880
of early things that eff did uh that you

125
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,440
might be aware of was that we uh once

126
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,960
rented a

127
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,479
durable from greenpeace and flew it over

128
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,720
the nsa's

129
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,880
secret

130
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,680
data center in in utah just to let them

131
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,479
know what it felt like to be spied on

132
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,720
so we do all kinds of things like that

133
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,320
and finally uh we have technologists we

134
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,039
have we have teams of hackers and our

135
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,639
technologists work on two kinds of

136
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,840
things

137
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,360
the first is uh that we work on a series

138
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,280
of software projects so we have people

139
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,479
who work on uh some things that you may

140
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,320
have heard of uh such as uh certbot so

141
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,160
if you've ever got a free ssl

142
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,759
certificate you're welcome uh we also

143
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,280
built a

144
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,720
web extension called https everywhere

145
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,360
back before the web was largely uh was

146
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,199
largely encrypted that made sure that if

147
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,160
you were going to a website and

148
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,880
it supported https that you would go to

149
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,479
the https version of the site by default

150
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,639
we have

151
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,160
other tools

152
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,880
including a tool to let you see whether

153
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,000
or not you are

154
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,039
your your identity is being used uh by

155
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,560
by google and linked to other identities

156
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,919
uh on on uh flock which is uh sort of

157
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,520
their new way of grouping people

158
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,639
together

159
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,560
which is super creepy

160
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,520
and then finally we have the the little

161
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,479
corner

162
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,000
of the eff that i work in

163
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,479
i work in eff's threat lab and threat

164
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,680
lab is made up entirely of security

165
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,000
researchers and our job is to sort of

166
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,479
expand people's ideas about cyber

167
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,199
security because often when we think

168
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,120
about cyber security

169
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,759
especially in in academia and uh sort of

170
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,639
in information security uh we think

171
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,039
about security for corporations and we

172
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,840
think about security for governments and

173
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,120
that leaves uh that leaves a lot out

174
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,840
that leaves out security for uh for

175
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,560
individuals it leaves out security for

176
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,039
journalists and activists for dissidents

177
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,800
for

178
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,319
people in domestic abuse situations for

179
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,160
you know people who are being harassed

180
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,520
online uh and so the the work of threat

181
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,639
lab is really to take uh all of these

182
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,039
conversations about privacy and security

183
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,280
especially digital privacy and security

184
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,759
that have been pushed out to the margins

185
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,639
as

186
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,560
as corner cases and as special cases

187
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,879
and really move them to the center and

188
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,960
the the thesis of our work is that

189
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,560
if you

190
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,520
if you start with securing governments

191
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,039
and uh corporations if you start by

192
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,520
securing people in power

193
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,120
you will never get around to securing uh

194
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,280
the people without power uh to securing

195
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,720
the people on the margins the people

196
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,879
without money the people without a voice

197
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,800
but if you start

198
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,240
by building tools that are secure to use

199
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,560
and that are safe to use for the

200
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,199
marginalized that you will automatically

201
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,399
build tools that are also safe uh for

202
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,159
people who are you know sort of at the

203
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,320
center of conversations and people who

204
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,519
are already in power so that's uh that's

205
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,958
what we do

206
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,640
um

207
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,240
i can talk a little bit about how we got

208
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,040
there

209
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,080
uh

210
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,640
i started out at eff i as a answering

211
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,760
the phone

212
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,279
i was on my way to law school and i took

213
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,839
a job before starting law school and

214
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,000
somehow never quite left

215
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,680
but my job at the in 2007 was to answer

216
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,120
the phone and do legal intake so people

217
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,279
would call me up and

218
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,839
they would uh describe their legal

219
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,800
problem and then i had to figure out

220
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,040
whether or not this was the kind of case

221
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,200
that that eff might take or this was the

222
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,440
the sort of situation the eff might blog

223
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,519
about or uh write a petition about uh or

224
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,320
an angry letter about so i had to get

225
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,480
very good at recognizing all of eff's

226
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,000
issues very quickly uh this was also

227
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,399
again at the at the height of the nsa

228
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,000
case and so there were a lot of people

229
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,839
who uh were calling me to tell me that

230
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,399
uh that they were being spied on uh who

231
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,640
actually just had mental health problems

232
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,760
and so i had to learn a a tremendous

233
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,000
amount of empathy and patience

234
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,720
um not everybody who called us

235
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,760
uh

236
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,560
really had a you know a digital security

237
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,320
problem or a case the eff could take

238
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,480
but every single one of those people

239
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,640
deserve to be taken seriously and

240
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,200
deserve to be heard and deserved to be

241
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,640
sent to

242
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,279
to resources that could help them even

243
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,800
if that resource is is not necessarily

244
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,800
my organization

245
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,120
so i did that for a while i and then

246
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,760
after a few years of legal intake i

247
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,320
moved into that activism team and i did

248
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,040
a bunch of work on uh on internet

249
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,240
censorship

250
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,680
and at the time uh sort of the the big

251
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,200
issue in internet censorship uh was uh

252
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,959
that facebook

253
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,279
had instituted a real names policy

254
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,320
so

255
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,399
up until then i don't know how many of

256
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,000
you are are old enough to remember

257
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,720
an internet where it was normal for

258
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,200
people not to use their real names uh it

259
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,720
was considered a little weird for people

260
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,560
to use their real names online almost

261
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,760
everybody used

262
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,320
some sort of handle on you know on

263
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,240
myspace and friendster and tribe

264
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,040
and

265
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,519
a lot of these sort of uh early social

266
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,120
networks and uh facebook because it was

267
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,279
based around the sort of uh

268
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,000
college idea of a facebook where

269
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,120
everybody knows everybody else uh was

270
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,079
really hung up on the notion that uh

271
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,680
that everybody should use their real

272
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,920
names uh and they started taking down

273
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,200
accounts that did not look like they

274
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,560
were real um or names that they felt

275
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,720
didn't look particularly real and i'm

276
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,480
sure you can already see the problem

277
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,000
with this which is that um all kinds of

278
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,360
people have names that um

279
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,800
by the standards of some you know white

280
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,000
guy working in santa clara for facebook

281
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,720
look fake um they're

282
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,839
it it is not common uh across the world

283
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,920
especially once you have a billion

284
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,200
accounts

285
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,040
for people's names to uh to have two

286
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,920
parts

287
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,720
for

288
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,720
the uh for the last name to be second uh

289
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,440
for their for there to only be two names

290
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,040
um four

291
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,680
you know names to be you know symbols

292
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,279
this is this is also a thing that

293
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,200
happens um lots of people use uh

294
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,360
pseudonyms or uh you know stage names by

295
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,880
which uh especially if they're

296
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,920
performers um by which they are known

297
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,160
better and a lot of people don't even

298
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,440
know their real names uh and that is

299
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,399
incredibly common uh marilyn monroe for

300
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,680
example was not born marilyn monroe her

301
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,240
original name's norma jean

302
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,160
and if somebody had made her v norma

303
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,480
jean on facebook nobody would have known

304
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,680
that they were looking at marilyn

305
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,120
monroe's account

306
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,560
so

307
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,200
this was a very serious problem

308
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,639
and it was a big problem for

309
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,959
uh for people who were not using their

310
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,360
real names for a variety of other

311
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,839
reasons uh people were not using their

312
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,680
real names because they were doing

313
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,680
activism and they didn't want their

314
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,600
activism to be linked to uh to their

315
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,720
jobs or to their real identity sometimes

316
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,920
people worked as school teachers or they

317
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,800
were

318
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,440
pastors in a church

319
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,560
and they wanted to separate their uh

320
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,680
their work identity from the identity

321
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,040
that did other things and this is normal

322
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,120
the idea that we should all have the

323
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,440
same identity that is the same to

324
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,720
everybody

325
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,519
is uh is actually fairly new and a

326
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,959
little bit crazy

327
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,760
we are different people

328
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,680
at a conference online than we are at

329
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,959
work than we are to our parents than we

330
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,399
are at school

331
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,279
than we are at church than we are at the

332
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,920
nightclub than we are at the bar and

333
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,600
that is perfectly normal and they don't

334
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,279
all have to exist together and they

335
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,800
definitely don't all have to hang out

336
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,480
with one another and know about each

337
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,519
other

338
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,760
so there were all kinds of ways in which

339
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,600
uh facebook's real names policy was a

340
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,480
very serious problem and uh i spent a

341
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,279
lot of time yelling at them

342
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,320
while i was yelling at facebook the arab

343
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,639
springs started and

344
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,279
at the time the internet was largely uh

345
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,760
still unencrypted so people were sending

346
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,600
their their web traffic over straight

347
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,880
http

348
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,920
and

349
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,959
this meant that if you were a government

350
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,680
and you ran a telco

351
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,760
it was actually really easy to spy on

352
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,240
all of the traffic

353
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,959
at the time facebook had just started

354
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,920
moving some things to https

355
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,480
same with twitter same with google and

356
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,040
the uh the common thinking was that

357
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,399
https was for logins and it was for uh

358
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,160
for credit card information because

359
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,680
otherwise who would buy things online um

360
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,600
but that it was not for everything else

361
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,959
because the uh contents of your chats

362
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:19,279
and the photos that you send and the uh

363
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,760
specific urls that you're going to that

364
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,839
stuff's not private that stuff won't

365
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,079
give away you know important information

366
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,160
about who you are or what you're doing

367
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,360
surely that will be fine so i know all

368
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,120
of you can can poke holes in this

369
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,000
argument really uh quite easily

370
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,079
so there we were uh and it was the

371
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,920
beginning of the arab spring and the

372
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,600
assad government

373
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,040
had uh gotten this reputation in the

374
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,240
united states as

375
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,279
sort of

376
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,680
as a liberal government

377
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,360
assad was described as the father of the

378
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,240
syrian internet and the reason for this

379
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,040
was that he had sort of

380
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,199
throttled back

381
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,199
the

382
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,480
censorship and the blocking of uh of

383
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,759
social media inside of uh inside of

384
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,800
syria but it turned out that the reason

385
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,399
he was doing this was so that he could

386
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,759
spy on uh on people's traffic and the

387
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,839
way that it turned out the syrian

388
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,360
government was doing this uh was by uh

389
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,000
faking ssl certificates and man in the

390
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,279
middling all of the traffic uh so

391
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,959
again we had to go and yell at the

392
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,560
companies and

393
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,320
convince them that what they really

394
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,079
needed to do was to implement uh https

395
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:47,759
uh for everything ssl by default i and

396
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,160
we got a lot of pushback on that we got

397
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,160
a lot of pushback basically saying that

398
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,320
again these are edge cases these are

399
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,959
just activists it's just people in syria

400
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,440
it's just people in tunisia

401
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,759
and what we started to see was that as

402
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,120
more and more governments became

403
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,839
interested in man in the middling

404
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,319
this sort of traffic the more important

405
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,039
it became uh for everything to go out

406
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:11,919
over

407
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,720
over https and also for those

408
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,880
certificates to be trustworthy and

409
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,079
pinned so i spent a bunch of time

410
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,439
working on that

411
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,520
uh right around this time

412
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,480
people in in the middle east became very

413
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,600
interested in uh sort of digital

414
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,600
security uh because they became more and

415
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,799
more aware that uh the their efforts to

416
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,080
organize were being spied on and so i

417
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,679
spent some time traveling all over the

418
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,720
world uh teaching uh people in

419
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,200
vulnerable populations about privacy and

420
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,679
security online so i taught people um

421
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,640
you know how how to use end-to-end

422
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,919
encryption tools how to make sure that

423
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:56,720
their

424
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,200
web traffic was not going to be spied on

425
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,799
how to maintain their anonymity online

426
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,520
and uh the kind of advice that we were

427
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,440
giving at the time can sort of be um

428
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,360
you know uh

429
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,280
summarized as

430
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,840
uh use pigeon used tor

431
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,200
but it was actually much more

432
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,280
complicated than that and one of the big

433
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,799
problems was that a lot of trainings

434
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,799
were uh were entirely too simplistic and

435
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,520
uh weren't taking into account the way

436
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,160
that that people were really using their

437
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,080
tools um and the stakes were very high

438
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,200
uh there was a journalist whose name was

439
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,880
andy carvin who

440
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,160
got

441
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,360
reasonably well known uh for his

442
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,160
reporting on what was going on inside of

443
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,160
syria at a time when syria was closed

444
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,120
off to journalists entirely and so the

445
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,120
way that he was getting his stories was

446
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,280
by communicating securely with people

447
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,880
inside of syria

448
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,000
and uh one day someone asked him you

449
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,919
know so what what tools do you use in

450
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,400
order to communicate with your sources

451
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,120
are are you using skype are you using

452
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,400
tor are you using you know uh

453
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,799
are you using pigeon and

454
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,720
he replied that

455
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,840
he

456
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,640
had all of his communication over tor

457
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,160
and when asked why he replied that

458
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,240
everyone he knew who was not using tor

459
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,840
was dead

460
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,799
so

461
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,200
this this was very serious business

462
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,360
uh and as i was going around um

463
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,280
working with uh with all of these

464
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,480
different groups

465
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,280
i started to notice that they were being

466
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,240
targeted with malware they were

467
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,000
receiving uh emails mostly because

468
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,160
at this at this time malware was largely

469
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,120
still

470
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,120
targeting people's desktops they were

471
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,720
receiving emails with sketchy

472
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,919
attachments and i started collecting

473
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,120
these attachments as sort of a hobby and

474
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,240
reverse engineering them and

475
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,960
i spent several years publishing

476
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,640
publishing reports

477
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,600
about uh about what i found in there so

478
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,039
uh

479
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,880
i wrote about

480
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,480
uh malware

481
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,120
that was used by the uh

482
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,520
in kazakhstan that had been used by the

483
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,400
government in lebanon that was being

484
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,120
used by uh the vietnamese government i

485
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,720
don't know how many of you are familiar

486
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,080
with uh ocean lotus as an apt

487
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,679
i and

488
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,960
i i spent several years working on this

489
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,600
um again one of the ways in which this

490
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,159
really uh related back

491
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:42,960
to

492
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,720
uh the

493
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,600
to the the thing that threat lab does

494
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,679
was that at the time

495
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,200
um

496
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,120
companies like mandiant and crowdstrike

497
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,440
and kaspersky

498
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,880
were already publishing reports about

499
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,240
apts you know the the mandiants apt-1

500
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,720
report had already gone out uh one of

501
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,400
the interesting things about that report

502
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,520
was that they really emphasized that uh

503
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,559
that china was targeting journalists

504
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,400
specifically and

505
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,600
that

506
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,840
journalist organizations and newsrooms

507
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,919
really needed to step up their game in

508
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,480
terms of security which which was really

509
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,640
interesting so a lot of money suddenly

510
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,880
went into uh journalist trainings uh

511
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,840
who got left out of that uh usually

512
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,200
freelancers

513
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,600
most journalists do not work for large

514
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,240
organizations on salaries they work

515
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,880
freelance and if you're a freelancer at

516
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,039
the time you were essentially left on

517
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:48,080
your own to figure out your own uh you

518
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,400
know digital security uh workflow and if

519
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,000
you messed up

520
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,400
once more you you were just left out in

521
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,320
the cold there was there was no training

522
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,880
for you and there was no help for you so

523
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,360
that was a very serious problem uh one

524
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,840
of the things that that eff did in order

525
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,760
to deal with that problem was we took

526
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,120
all of these trainings that we did all

527
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,880
over the world and

528
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,960
we took that information and we put it

529
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,240
online uh in fact you can find it at

530
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,480
surveillance self-defense

531
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,440
which is at ssd.eff.org

532
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,720
and we did

533
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,320
um a lot of things with our uh privacy

534
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,799
and security guides that other privacy

535
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:35,039
and security guides were not doing uh to

536
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,760
begin with we translated it into a bunch

537
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,360
of languages we had

538
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,600
people read it and test it and let us

539
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,440
know whether or not stuff was working

540
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,720
properly

541
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,520
we updated our guide

542
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:54,400
in 2013 i gave a talk at ccc in which i

543
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,480
described the internet as sort of a

544
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,320
graveyard of abandoned security guides

545
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,880
so actually keeping a security guide up

546
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,080
to date is really hard especially when

547
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,760
every update that you make has to be

548
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,760
translated into several languages and

549
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,120
eff really put in uh put in the time

550
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,960
into doing this

551
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,120
so around this time we start seeing we

552
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,840
start seeing malware and malware is

553
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,520
targeting journalists it's targeting

554
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,159
activists it's targeting dissidents and

555
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:25,919
it's not getting a lot of attention from

556
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,760
the big security companies because it's

557
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,320
not that sophisticated because we're

558
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,919
we're looking at stuff from iran and

559
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,640
going oh look it's written in delphi

560
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,480
because it's using

561
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,279
uh you know our rtf vulnerabilities and

562
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,400
vulnerabilities in uh you know

563
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,279
all kinds of stuff that are flash for

564
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,400
example uh and you know this is

565
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,240
20 2012 2013 so it's not like we were we

566
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,880
were short on vulnerabilities in flash

567
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,440
uh there we were not looking at a lot of

568
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,799
new techniques in uh in

569
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,960
phishing and malware we were mostly

570
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,799
looking at

571
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,039
governments using extremely well-known

572
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,039
techniques and so this wasn't very

573
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,720
interesting to security researchers so

574
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,480
they rarely wrote it up um but if you

575
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,919
were a journalist or activist

576
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,919
in a place like kazakhstan or lebanon or

577
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,600
vietnam

578
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,840
these were

579
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,679
these were attacks with very serious

580
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,279
consequences

581
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,720
vietnam has a long history of of

582
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,080
targeting dissent and uh jailing

583
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,440
journalists and bloggers who are

584
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,960
critical of the government uh the

585
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,360
same goes for kazakhstan most definitely

586
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,080
uh lebanon has uh has some very serious

587
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,640
problems in the press freedom area i and

588
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,320
so again the the stakes are high uh and

589
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,919
we started tracking uh a couple of uh of

590
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,559
apts that were

591
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,520
sort of

592
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,520
pro assad hackers that were going after

593
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,880
um

594
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,440
that were going after opposition uh

595
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,440
groups on facebook and that were going

596
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,240
after uh sort of prominent opposition

597
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,000
activists uh so i spent about two and a

598
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,360
half years

599
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,919
uh writing reports about this

600
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,480
and again uh very few other people were

601
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,400
writing these kinds of reports because

602
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,520
the techniques were not novel i and so

603
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,760
instead of focusing on uh on the

604
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,880
technical end of it i really focused on

605
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,840
the people who were being uh who were

606
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,720
being affected uh because those effects

607
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,799
are very real um

608
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,640
so i've been doing this for a few years

609
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,840
and

610
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,400
unfortunately somewhere around the

611
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,039
beginning of 2018

612
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,760
it came to light that

613
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,000
one of my research partners with whom i

614
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,480
had done the majority of my research uh

615
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,039
was a serial rapist

616
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,640
so that was great

617
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,799
and uh

618
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,799
this came out in the press

619
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,919
there were a series of interviews with

620
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:10,799
with

621
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:11,919
survivors

622
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:16,000
and in 2018 i read an interview with a

623
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,919
survivor in

624
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,919
i think it was vice

625
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,080
and what really struck me about this

626
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,120
interview was how scared she was and how

627
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,640
scared everybody who was being

628
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,240
interviewed was uh they all had stickers

629
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,880
over the um

630
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,799
they had stickers over their cameras

631
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,559
they were really concerned about the

632
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,240
security of their phones they were

633
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,679
concerned about the security of their

634
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,039
laptops and the reason for this was that

635
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,000
not only uh you know was this guy a

636
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,960
reasonably famous hacker uh who had sort

637
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,000
of made his reputation by working on you

638
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,240
know fairly you know high profile and

639
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,480
sophisticated cases but apparently he

640
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,880
had also threatened them and said you

641
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,080
know if you come out and you say

642
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,760
anything i uh i will hack your devices

643
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,799
so

644
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,360
i was really mad

645
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,480
and i i did what i usually do when i get

646
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,240
mad which was that i tweeted and in 2018

647
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,200
i tweeted that if you were a woman who

648
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,600
had been sexually assaulted by a hacker

649
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,720
and you were concerned about

650
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,360
about your device being compromised that

651
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,760
you could reach out to me and i would

652
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,520
make sure that your device would get a

653
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,360
forensic analysis

654
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,600
and then i

655
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,399
went to lunch or i went to sleep or

656
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,640
something i definitely ran off for a

657
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,640
while and when i came back

658
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,559
uh the tweet had gone viral uh it got

659
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,120
something like 10 000 retweets and i

660
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,600
started hearing from people every single

661
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,120
day i was being contacted by dozens and

662
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,120
dozens of people a day and that's

663
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,440
actually something that continues now in

664
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,440
in 2021 i have not worked on an abuse

665
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,200
case since oh yesterday so uh people

666
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,200
still come to me with this stuff

667
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,960
and it was an overwhelming number of

668
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,840
people i i cannot emphasize how many

669
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,720
people were were knocking on my door it

670
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,480
was very disturbing

671
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,880
and also exhausting

672
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,279
but i learned some really interesting

673
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,399
stuff uh from having worked with you

674
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:29,600
know dozens and dozens of uh abuse

675
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,440
survivors and people who are concerned

676
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,919
about their uh about the safety of their

677
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,120
devices

678
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,640
every day for several years straight

679
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,679
uh to begin with i learned some of the

680
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,159
same lessons that i learned talking to

681
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:45,760
journalists and activists all over the

682
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,760
world and the first lesson is

683
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,679
that

684
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,960
i have always been wrong about what i

685
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,039
think the problem is when i start to

686
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,880
approach a problem uh my my first guess

687
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,279
about how to solve it is almost always

688
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,559
going to be wrong um so what i started

689
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,880
seeing in uh in the people who are

690
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,840
coming to me uh was that the problem

691
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,399
usually was not device compromise

692
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,880
it wasn't usually stalkerware

693
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,360
installed on their phone it was almost

694
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,399
always a count compromise

695
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:21,520
so

696
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,320
again

697
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,320
one of the biggest uh one of the biggest

698
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,679
problems that i was seeing was account

699
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,720
compromise and you could get a lot of

700
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,559
bang for your buck by teaching people

701
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,960
how to lock down their accounts

702
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,159
the good news is that a lot of research

703
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,399
and a lot of work has already gone into

704
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:42,240
teaching people how to create

705
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,039
safe passwords uh unique and strong

706
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,840
passwords how to use a password manager

707
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,840
uh and how to

708
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,159
uh enable and use

709
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,480
various levels of 2fa

710
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,120
um again this was another area where i

711
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,760
had to sort of deviate from uh from the

712
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:04,080
orthodoxy because uh on one hand you

713
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,120
uh

714
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,679
really don't want people to use

715
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,640
text-based you know sms-based

716
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,880
2fa if you can avoid it

717
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,279
but for many accounts at the time

718
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:18,159
sms-based 2fa was the only kind of 2fa

719
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:19,440
available

720
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,039
or i was dealing with people who were

721
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:27,360
not comfortable using you know a yubikey

722
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,799
or uh figuring out how uh you know how

723
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,159
authy works

724
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,399
so uh those were some very serious

725
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,240
problems and i really had to learn how

726
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,120
to uh how to meet people where they are

727
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,760
and get them the most security that i

728
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,720
thought that they would actually use uh

729
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,799
rather than coming to them

730
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,960
with uh with my

731
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,640
sort of pre-baked ideas about what it is

732
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,200
that they should do the uh the sort of

733
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,000
more recent equivalent of you know use

734
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,960
signal use tor and then fly away

735
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,120
and that's something that i try really

736
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,120
hard not to do

737
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,840
so i was wrong about a bunch of stuff

738
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,640
and

739
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,120
fixing account compromise could get us

740
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,840
really really far

741
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,640
having said that sometimes it really was

742
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,120
a device compromise and when it was

743
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,200
those cases were really disturbing those

744
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,919
were often the cases that involved uh

745
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:26,960
stalking and harassment those were cases

746
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,480
that sometimes involved physical

747
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,080
violence that involved kidnapping uh i

748
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,679
saw a lot of really disturbing stuff uh

749
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,919
that happened as a result of somebody

750
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,799
installing uh you know spyware on

751
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,279
someone's computer one moment my cat has

752
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,600
decided that he has opinions okay there

753
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,080
we go uh my cat will not be making a

754
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,679
cameo in uh in this keynote uh perhaps

755
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,840
uh perhaps a little bit later

756
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:58,080
so where was i uh we were

757
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,840
there was stalker ware there was

758
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,279
stalkerware uh so people's uh people's

759
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,960
laptops were being targeted with

760
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,039
stalkerware and increasingly we were

761
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,360
starting to see mobile malware and

762
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,000
soccerware for phones and the reason for

763
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,159
that is that getting all of the

764
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:17,600
information off of a phone it gives you

765
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,120
an enormous amount of information about

766
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,039
what a person is doing

767
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,840
you know you pull all of their passwords

768
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,360
and their

769
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,480
web browsing history and their photos

770
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,159
and their

771
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,399
text messages and their end-to-end

772
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,720
encrypted communications and most

773
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,440
importantly they are carrying a tracking

774
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,200
device around in their pocket

775
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,279
conveniently enough for you telling you

776
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,840
where they are at all times so this

777
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,519
stuff is uh you know a

778
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,120
bonanza of spying uh whether you are a

779
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:55,279
government or an uh abusive ex or some

780
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,960
sort of harasser

781
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,159
um

782
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,960
so my first thought when uh when i saw

783
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,360
that that stalkerware was not the

784
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,000
biggest problem but definitely a problem

785
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,720
linked to the the most disturbing abuses

786
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,799
that i saw was

787
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,720
that

788
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,799
surely we have a way of detecting this

789
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:15,840
stuff

790
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,320
i mean that's what the av industry does

791
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,240
right you're supposed to install

792
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,080
antivirus on your on your device and

793
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,440
then it's supposed to tell you if

794
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,960
there's bad stuff on it right

795
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,279
so i ran some tests i did a little bit

796
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:32,480
of research

797
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,159
back in

798
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:37,200
i think it was 2018 and

799
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,640
i discovered that uh antivirus was

800
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,480
actually not very good at detecting uh

801
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,960
at detecting even the most popular

802
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,679
stalker wear and i was really surprised

803
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,519
i had all kinds of theories about why

804
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,360
this was but really it came down to the

805
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,559
fact that

806
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:58,000
most av companies uh shrugged it off

807
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,440
they uh they figured that there were

808
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,679
sure there were abuses but they could

809
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,720
imagine some legitimate cases uh some

810
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,520
legitimate uses for first stalker wear

811
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,560
and therefore they thought that labeling

812
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,079
it as uh as malicious uh would be bad

813
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:17,918
and so they should err on the side of

814
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:19,760
caution and just let stalker ware sit

815
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,679
there undetected on people's devices

816
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,320
so the first thing that i did was i went

817
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,599
to av companies and i asked them to stop

818
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:33,520
it uh it is not very hard to stay on top

819
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,440
of uh what uh what stalkerware makers

820
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,079
are doing and that is because unlike

821
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,520
apts uh stalkerware companies sell their

822
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,280
products they sell them commercially

823
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,918
they have they make ads

824
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:49,599
and therefore it's actually really easy

825
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:51,760
to find them uh it's very easy to

826
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,719
purchase them uh unlike uh the you know

827
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,680
companies like nso group uh and uh and

828
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,680
their products like pegasus you don't

829
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,440
have to be a government you don't have

830
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,119
to be law enforcement in order to get

831
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,839
your hands on this stuff i and so

832
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,160
research is a cinch you simply buy it

833
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,560
and figure out what it's doing

834
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,920
uh and

835
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,480
that made my work so much easier but it

836
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,280
also made the work of of researchers at

837
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,920
the different av companies uh much

838
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,359
easier and we've seen the av companies

839
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:25,760
have gotten much better at detecting

840
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,280
stalker ware

841
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,880
across the board

842
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,119
there is a organization called av

843
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:32,800
comparatives that

844
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,200
very that publishes a

845
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,720
list of uh of the different av products

846
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,040
every year and talks about how well they

847
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,160
do at detecting stalkerware uh the

848
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,599
biggest stalkerware problem is

849
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,560
definitely in uh in the android market

850
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,440
and

851
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,040
uh we we've really seen um detection

852
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,320
improve a lot so i've been very excited

853
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,839
about that

854
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:01,280
but there are uh also some other recent

855
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,599
developments um

856
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,920
for example just uh the day before

857
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,560
yesterday i in the united states the

858
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,200
federal trade commission uh announced

859
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,040
that uh they were issuing a ban

860
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,000
on uh on a stalker ware company they

861
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
issued a ban on a company called spy

862
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,320
phone and uh its parent company uh as

863
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,520
well as its ceo uh telling them that

864
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,440
essentially they they have to stop doing

865
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,359
business not only do they have to stop

866
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:35,119
doing business um but they have to

867
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:36,160
um

868
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,000
reach out to everyone that had had their

869
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,240
product installed covertly on their

870
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,119
device and they

871
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,280
needed to alert them and let them know

872
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,440
that they had been spied on

873
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,200
so right now the ftc is in a 30-day

874
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,520
comment period during which

875
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,040
people can can comment on on the ban

876
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,800
but as the ban

877
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,880
goes into effect i'm going to be very

878
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,079
curious to see how things go forward and

879
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,680
one of the things that i'm most

880
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,359
interested in seeing is uh

881
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:14,960
how many people end up getting these

882
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,920
alerts and uh you know what these

883
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,800
messages look like

884
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,880
one of the reasons why the ftc went

885
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,960
after spy phone is the same reason that

886
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,680
they went after a company called retina

887
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,400
x uh a few years ago and that is that

888
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,320
not only do they make spyware but they

889
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,839
don't even make spyware very well

890
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:39,119
so both retina x and spy phone had had

891
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,760
some really interesting data breaches so

892
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,079
not only were they you know

893
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:47,359
allowing people to you know steal data

894
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:50,720
um but then that data was left wide open

895
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,800
on cnc's uh where it could be stolen uh

896
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,440
many many times over

897
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,160
and we've seen this happen many times so

898
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,040
again the the people who are making this

899
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,520
this software are not very sophisticated

900
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,520
they're not very diligent they're not

901
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,720
particularly good at it uh and

902
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,520
not only do they put the the people who

903
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,240
are being spied on at risk

904
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,200
because their data is being given to uh

905
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,040
you know to to their stalkers to their

906
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,280
harassers uh to people with whom they

907
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,240
are in abusive relationships um but they

908
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:30,320
are also leaking that data to uh

909
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,119
to other potential malicious actors and

910
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:36,640
that is really problematic

911
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,119
um one of the other interesting things

912
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:42,800
that i have seen uh in uh recent months

913
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,599
is that apple came out with a new

914
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,480
product uh called the air tag

915
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,480
so we saw a lot of uh you know spying by

916
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,760
uh by

917
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,560
abusive partners by covertly installing

918
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,160
spyware on their

919
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,520
on their computers or covertly

920
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,920
installing spyware on their phones um

921
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,280
but sometimes uh abusive partners are

922
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,839
not in a position to compromise

923
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:10,400
somebody's phone uh perhaps they have an

924
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,400
android and some av and they're worried

925
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,720
about you know the av picking up picking

926
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,240
up the stalker wear

927
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,599
so uh apple conveniently came out with a

928
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:22,800
with the air tag which is a

929
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,720
device about the size of a quarter this

930
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,640
big i and it is designed

931
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,440
to

932
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,960
um

933
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,400
to be attached to your uh

934
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,160
to your keys or to your wallet or

935
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,680
something else that you are worried

936
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,560
about losing i it

937
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,320
connects over over bluetooth it pairs

938
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,800
with your apple id with um with the air

939
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,280
tag and what's particularly interesting

940
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,560
about this is that when your air tag

941
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,520
goes

942
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,040
out of range of the phone uh you can

943
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,960
consult your phone and it will tell you

944
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,680
where the air tag is located

945
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,400
so that is very useful um

946
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,680
apple is not the first company to

947
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,319
to have made this particular type of

948
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:16,720
product uh i don't know how many of you

949
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,440
are familiar with the tile uh but it is

950
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,240
a

951
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,720
very similar product that uh has been

952
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,280
out for many years um

953
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,400
however what makes the tile different

954
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,319
is that uh the tile only communicates

955
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:35,280
with uh over bluetooth with other phones

956
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,200
that have the tile app

957
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,440
installed on the phone so there's a

958
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,960
limited number of tiles out there

959
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,880
there's a limited number of tie laps out

960
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,079
there and uh if you

961
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,400
lose your uh

962
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,040
something that is attached to the tile

963
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,000
you may yeah you know your your lost

964
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,040
item may go all day without coming

965
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,480
within bluetooth range of somebody with

966
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,880
a phone with the tile app installed uh

967
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,520
in order to tell you where it is um the

968
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,319
way that apple devices work

969
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:11,920
is different so what apple did was they

970
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,960
decided that every air tag

971
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,400
would talk to

972
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,240
every iphone

973
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:22,160
the iphones would create a network uh by

974
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,440
default um you actually have to you have

975
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,800
to go in

976
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,280
and you have to go into find by phone

977
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,640
and specifically opt out of this network

978
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,680
if

979
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,760
if you find it creepy and you don't want

980
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,680
to contribute to it

981
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,720
and what that means is that when a

982
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,680
when a

983
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:45,440
an air tag is lost when it goes astray

984
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,880
when it is

985
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,920
say left inside the

986
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,599
a car belonging to someone uh who is

987
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:56,480
going through a messy divorce um then

988
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,800
all the the air tag needs to do is it

989
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,079
needs to come

990
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:04,480
within 30 feet of another iphone and

991
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,319
going through the day without coming

992
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:08,880
within bluetooth distance of an iphone

993
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,280
is actually pretty difficult and that

994
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,520
means that the apple tracking

995
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,640
capabilities are much much stronger than

996
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,480
the tiles

997
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,240
this is why i was particularly concerned

998
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,760
about the air tag

999
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,520
now not to be outdone as soon as apple

1000
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,400
announced the air tag and i

1001
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,800
started yelling at them uh for for

1002
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,920
having created this thing uh amazon

1003
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,960
announced that they were entering into

1004
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,359
an agreement with tile and they were

1005
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:42,160
going to try to uh set things up so that

1006
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,839
every tile would communicate with every

1007
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:47,599
amazon echo in order to increase the

1008
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:49,760
the size of its network to make it even

1009
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,359
better for spying

1010
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:52,319
um

1011
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:55,599
i did manage to convince apple to change

1012
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:58,319
some of the things that it was doing uh

1013
00:42:58,319 --> 00:42:59,599
it uh

1014
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:02,000
in order to mitigate

1015
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,160
the ability of

1016
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,160
of abusers to

1017
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,280
you know track people using their tools

1018
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,240
uh one of the things that they had done

1019
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,720
that that they were especially proud of

1020
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:15,680
was

1021
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,480
that if a

1022
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,480
if an air tag was out of uh out of range

1023
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,000
of a phone

1024
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,480
for i think more than three days

1025
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,760
it would start to emit a beep

1026
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,079
so the idea was that this beep would uh

1027
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:34,400
would alert uh somebody who was being

1028
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,680
spied on uh furthermore if you had you

1029
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,800
know find my turned on it would it would

1030
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,560
alert you that some you know some

1031
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,920
strange air tag is uh is possibly

1032
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,520
following you

1033
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,400
so

1034
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,119
those things were potentially useful uh

1035
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,839
the the alert was useful but only if you

1036
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:56,000
have an iphone so if somebody with an

1037
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,920
iphone was tracking somebody who had an

1038
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,760
android they had no way of getting the

1039
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,240
alert and what they had to rely on

1040
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,440
instead of the alert was the beep

1041
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,319
unfortunately the beep is not very loud

1042
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:11,119
the beep is about 60 decibels and i was

1043
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:13,119
able to silence it just by you know

1044
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:16,319
clenching my fist um i was also able to

1045
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:18,400
silence it by leaving it between the

1046
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,680
cushions of a couch um by hiding it

1047
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,440
under the seat in a car uh by leaving it

1048
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,760
in a pocket in a purse uh it was

1049
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,599
actually really difficult to hear the

1050
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:33,280
beep it was also possible to um

1051
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,640
to adjust the uh

1052
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,720
the air tag in such a way as to make the

1053
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,920
beep even more inaudible uh and last of

1054
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,319
all if you were a person with a hearing

1055
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:47,040
disability or if you were deaf um then

1056
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,480
there was simply no way for you to hear

1057
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,079
the beep at all

1058
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:53,440
so one of the things that i got uh apple

1059
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,640
to commit to is that starting in

1060
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,280
uh or they're expecting that in december

1061
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,720
uh they will put out an android app that

1062
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,640
will allow you to know whether or not

1063
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,359
there is an air tag uh which is tracking

1064
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:10,000
you uh so that at least you have the

1065
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,880
same benefit with an android that you do

1066
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,680
if you are not in the apple ecosystem

1067
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,079
and this is a particularly good example

1068
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:22,240
of uh of the kind of activism that i was

1069
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,839
talking about at the beginning of this

1070
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,760
talk which is that

1071
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,720
when apple put out the air tag they

1072
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,880
thought that they had done enough to

1073
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,400
mitigate the problem

1074
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,400
uh they thought that they had already

1075
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,599
thought about the abuse case and uh that

1076
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:40,240
they had solved it i and it turns out

1077
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,480
that wasn't the case at all and the

1078
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,079
thing that they could not imagine was a

1079
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,520
person who didn't own an iphone uh they

1080
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,800
their weakness was imagining uh you know

1081
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,880
people who existed entirely outside of

1082
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,319
their ecosystem

1083
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:59,119
and uh that's that's really a

1084
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:01,440
um one of those things where you know

1085
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,119
threat lab thinking would have been

1086
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:06,079
extremely useful to them

1087
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,800
so let's talk a little bit about uh

1088
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,599
what you can do uh the sort of everyday

1089
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:15,119
hacker uh can do uh to have sort of a

1090
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:17,920
threat lab mindset uh the first is of

1091
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,800
course uh most of the people here are

1092
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,040
you know security professionals and do

1093
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,160
security research and it would be great

1094
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,560
if more people looked at security

1095
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,200
research that impacted vulnerable

1096
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,920
populations everybody has a population

1097
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,440
that they care about

1098
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,040
that other people are not paying

1099
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,560
attention to

1100
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,880
everybody has groups of people that they

1101
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,640
know well and whose problems they

1102
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:45,280
understand that people in power are not

1103
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,280
building things for and that people in

1104
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,920
power are simply not thinking of

1105
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,040
when you know white middle class

1106
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,920
male professionals in an office in santa

1107
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,880
clara uh build a tool they often build

1108
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,040
it for people like themselves and they

1109
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,920
don't imagine how it's going to be used

1110
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:08,400
by uh and by a journalist in turkey or

1111
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,520
an activist in hong kong

1112
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,800
or

1113
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:17,119
by a soldier on an army base or a victim

1114
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:20,559
of domestic violence and because they

1115
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:22,400
don't think of these things

1116
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,200
they don't make the correct mitigations

1117
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,359
and the best way to sort of point out

1118
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:31,760
the flaws in uh in these tools is to to

1119
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,760
do the security research and to publish

1120
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,079
it to let everybody know about the kind

1121
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:38,000
of stuff that you're doing

1122
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,240
the second thing that everybody can do

1123
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,520
is uh that everybody has

1124
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,920
uh a a group of people for whom they are

1125
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,720
tech support um almost all of us go back

1126
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,880
to our families and you know have people

1127
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,440
who ask us for privacy and security

1128
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,960
advice because we are privacy and

1129
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,200
security professionals we are the people

1130
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,640
who should be able to tell you what

1131
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,680
password manager to use what computer

1132
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,240
you do you want to buy uh what kind of

1133
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,800
phone is secure and

1134
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,160
so learning how to give good advice is

1135
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,040
really important uh and furthermore

1136
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,920
beyond giving good advice learning how

1137
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,760
to give good training is important

1138
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,559
in your community so uh one of the

1139
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:24,720
things that i discovered by traveling

1140
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,000
all over the world and training

1141
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,680
activists and journalists is that

1142
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,480
information security professionals are

1143
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,960
terrible terrible digital security

1144
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,760
trainers we suck and the reason for that

1145
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,240
is because we completely misunderstand

1146
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:41,760
uh what the training is for

1147
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,599
often what digital security

1148
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:45,839
professionals feel that training is for

1149
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,760
is that you get up in front of people

1150
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,119
and you demonstrate that you understand

1151
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:53,520
privacy and security concepts and you

1152
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,200
know what to do so you get up in front

1153
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,800
of them you tell them use these tools

1154
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,800
use them in this particular way and if

1155
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,400
you don't do it this way you don't

1156
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,800
deserve privacy or security

1157
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,559
uh this is a terrible way to teach

1158
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:05,920
because the people in the room simply

1159
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,680
aren't going to do the things you tell

1160
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,599
them to do because you are not giving

1161
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:12,079
them advice that works with their lives

1162
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:14,160
and all you're really doing is scaring

1163
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,720
them and being arrogant at them

1164
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,240
so i spent a bunch of time learning how

1165
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,520
to teach

1166
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,520
because it turns out that that's a very

1167
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,680
important skill people regularly get

1168
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,520
master's degrees in this skill before

1169
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,440
they become teachers

1170
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,640
and

1171
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,119
i worked with others who have done

1172
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:34,079
trainings at eff to distill that

1173
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:36,160
knowledge into

1174
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,240
what we call the security education

1175
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,880
companion uh and you can find that at

1176
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,880
sec.eff.org

1177
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,800
that's a bunch of uh a bunch of tools

1178
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:52,160
and advice and handouts and charts that

1179
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,559
that you can use when you are giving

1180
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:57,359
security trainings uh to

1181
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:00,079
uh you know to new people or to

1182
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:03,200
vulnerable populations um or you know

1183
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,640
you're you're

1184
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:08,000
teaching a class uh so that stuff is

1185
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,359
also really useful and there are

1186
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:13,599
lengthy discussions of the sort of

1187
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:16,319
philosophy of teaching and

1188
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:18,800
how to really meet people where they are

1189
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,720
and give them the advice

1190
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,800
that they need instead of the advice

1191
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,720
that you think they need

1192
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,480
which was really one of the hardest

1193
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,319
lessons i had to learn

1194
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:31,759
when i was doing this work

1195
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:32,880
and

1196
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:37,200
finally you can go out and volunteer

1197
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,880
for example i

1198
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,200
recently tweeted that an organization

1199
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,559
called seta

1200
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:45,119
which is uh

1201
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:49,119
at the um at cornell university in

1202
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:51,680
new york is looking for

1203
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,480
volunteers for

1204
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,040
providing um

1205
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:59,280
security advice to

1206
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,839
victims of domestic abuse i i think

1207
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:03,119
they're looking for for people to

1208
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:05,040
volunteer about 10 hours a week so

1209
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,480
that's something that everybody here can

1210
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,920
do and you can definitely make a

1211
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,359
difference

1212
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:12,559
and finally the very last thing that you

1213
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:14,000
can do

1214
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,119
is

1215
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:17,440
join the electronic frontier foundation

1216
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,000
you can become a member

1217
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,680
eff is almost entirely funded by our

1218
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:27,280
majority funded by uh contributions

1219
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,760
from uh from individual members we have

1220
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,760
more than 40 000 members all over the

1221
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:35,040
world and in exchange for

1222
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,200
for your money and your love uh we will

1223
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,240
send you

1224
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:41,040
t-shirts and stickers we are essentially

1225
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,880
a t-shirt and sticker company with a law

1226
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,520
firm and some engineers attached

1227
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,760
so give us some love and we would

1228
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,640
definitely appreciate that thank you so

1229
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,480
much for your time

1230
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,440
i hope to be able to answer questions

1231
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,559
later this uh what is morning for me and

1232
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:02,400
evening for you uh and uh now i think

1233
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,680
we'll get to the q a thank you so uh we

1234
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,880
will start with questions

1235
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,960
aggregated by

1236
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,319
our crew

1237
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:14,880
i will uh read them to you and then we

1238
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,839
will adjust them one by one

1239
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:19,599
so government officials and some people

1240
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:21,760
who are far from information security

1241
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,839
believe that it is impossible to protect

1242
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:26,400
citizens from terrorism or cyber crime

1243
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,559
without spying in the information

1244
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:31,520
collection with breaking human rights

1245
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,000
what can you tell them

1246
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,040
how to convince them that that's wrong

1247
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:41,839
well uh to begin with uh eff worked with

1248
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:44,720
uh dozens of other civil society

1249
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,319
organizations

1250
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:48,000
to create

1251
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,119
the

1252
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:50,880
13 principles

1253
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:54,319
of the application of

1254
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:55,280
of

1255
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,559
surveillance

1256
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:57,520
and

1257
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,440
let me see whether or not

1258
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,040
i can find

1259
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:04,079
the website

1260
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,000
there we go they're called the necessary

1261
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,839
and proportionate principles and you can

1262
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:13,920
get to them at necessary and

1263
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:16,720
proportionate dot org so these are the

1264
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,079
international principles on the

1265
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:19,520
application of human rights to

1266
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:23,200
communications surveillance so not only

1267
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:27,359
have a bunch of professionals in

1268
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:30,480
in civil society spent a bunch of time

1269
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,720
thinking about this issue but we've got

1270
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:35,280
it down to just 13 bullet points of

1271
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,480
here's how you should do it uh and you

1272
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,240
shouldn't do it and i think that was

1273
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,119
fast

1274
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:42,880
yeah we

1275
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,000
spent some time on this just google it

1276
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,160
it's come up before

1277
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,440
more than once

1278
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,119
and i think that the most important

1279
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:54,000
thing to know is that again uh

1280
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,640
surveillance needs to be necessary and

1281
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,040
proportionate to the thing that you are

1282
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,040
trying to fight uh

1283
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,359
you can't if the government shows up and

1284
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:05,359
says we need to be able to see

1285
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:07,760
everything all the time in order to

1286
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:10,000
protect you that is neither necessary

1287
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,800
nor proportionate that is not in line

1288
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,880
with the principles so that starts right

1289
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,119
there and i think the very first

1290
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:19,280
principle essentially says that mass

1291
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:23,200
surveillance is a uh is a violation of

1292
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:27,200
uh of all of our human rights um because

1293
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:30,800
it uh because it looks at everyone all

1294
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,160
the time and that is extremely invasive

1295
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:37,680
and there is uh no danger which is both

1296
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,160
necessary and proportionate which

1297
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:43,040
justifies mass surveillance and so that

1298
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,520
leaves us with uh surveillance which is

1299
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:48,400
more narrow in scope and it's important

1300
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,119
to sort of rein that surveillance in as

1301
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:52,640
much as possible

1302
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:57,359
while still empowering the government to

1303
00:54:57,359 --> 00:55:00,000
you know do law enforcement or to do its

1304
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,240
job but generally when the government or

1305
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,079
law enforcement comes to me and says we

1306
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:05,680
need more powers and we need to be able

1307
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,760
to see more stuff i am immediately

1308
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,040
skeptical

1309
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,319
because essentially what they're telling

1310
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:12,559
me is they're incompetent

1311
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,480
oh that's that's what i also always

1312
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,960
answer to them when they raise the topic

1313
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:17,760
they

1314
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,559
say okay we need this aggregation of

1315
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:24,160
data in order to provide you safety

1316
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,880
and i respond no you need that in order

1317
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,400
to

1318
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,520
do your work with less effort

1319
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,079
it's just more convenient for you

1320
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:35,680
all that they're telling me is that

1321
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,640
they're lazy or that they're not good

1322
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,799
yeah lazy is a good word i will use it

1323
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,000
from now on

1324
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,319
next eva do you think

1325
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:46,799
it is possible to consider that the tor

1326
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:49,680
network is still safe to use

1327
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,440
there are rumors that the same

1328
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,839
government agencies control the nodes

1329
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:54,960
now

1330
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,480
so

1331
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:59,040
as with any question in information

1332
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,480
security

1333
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,400
the answer begins with a long and

1334
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,119
painful sigh

1335
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,960
followed by looking off into the

1336
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,880
distance and saying well

1337
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,880
it depends on your threat model

1338
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:14,240
uh if you are using tor in order to

1339
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,440
maintain

1340
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,760
anonymity from government and law

1341
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,680
enforcement surveillance which is

1342
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,319
targeted at you be specifically because

1343
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:25,040
you are breaking the law uh no i would

1344
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,640
not count on tour

1345
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:30,319
uh and part of the reason for that is

1346
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:32,720
not so much that the government owns all

1347
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:36,640
the nodes um but that if you

1348
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:40,559
if any one party has a large enough

1349
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:42,079
number of nodes or a large enough

1350
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:44,160
percentage of the nodes then they can do

1351
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:47,520
a timing attack where they can correlate

1352
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:48,880
the traffic that goes in with the

1353
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,079
traffic that goes out and they don't

1354
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:51,359
even need to know what's happening in

1355
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:52,559
the middle node

1356
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:55,520
um right now we are fairly certain that

1357
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,599
it's it's not that all the nodes are

1358
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,680
owned by the u.s government or all the

1359
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,319
nodes are owned by the nsa

1360
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:06,079
but it's possible that enough nodes are

1361
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:08,400
owned by certain types of law

1362
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,640
enforcement that i

1363
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,640
i would not count on it if my life

1364
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,000
depended on

1365
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,559
um having said that there are all kinds

1366
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:20,400
of uses for uh for anonymous uh browsing

1367
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,960
and anonymous internet use uh in which

1368
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:25,839
your life does not depend and uh i think

1369
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:27,920
for that tour is often the appropriate

1370
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,680
tool

1371
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,319
oh thank you for that quite reassuring

1372
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:35,280
now we have series of questions from

1373
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,400
alex uh who i believe is your biggest

1374
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,280
fan

1375
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,920
because he has invited you he was the

1376
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,640
author of this idea and uh he wrote you

1377
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,960
that you basically your your activity

1378
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,359
and your activism inspired a lot of his

1379
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:51,599
professional career uh

1380
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:54,319
in particular his phd thesis so the

1381
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:56,400
first question from alex is what does

1382
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,640
the ff think about digitalization in

1383
00:57:58,640 --> 00:57:59,760
ukraine

1384
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,760
is it possible to keep privacy online

1385
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,760
with digitalization

1386
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:06,160
have you heard about the dia app what

1387
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,480
are your thoughts about evoding so i

1388
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:11,200
started to

1389
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,960
put you into the context before we

1390
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,319
shifted

1391
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:17,040
the

1392
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,119
live stream to the q a

1393
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:20,160
but

1394
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,480
just to give you more of the perspective

1395
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:25,599
so dia is basically the mobile app

1396
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:27,359
uh and uh

1397
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:29,200
some some portion of his functionality

1398
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:32,000
is also a web portal that gives you

1399
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,599
ability to

1400
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:36,880
basically present yourself to government

1401
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,359
officials because you can authenticate

1402
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:41,440
yourself with a qr code they just scan

1403
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,480
it and they get a request sent to some

1404
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,400
public

1405
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,640
registry that is already publicly

1406
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,599
available but now we have just this

1407
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:54,480
app yeah we have the nap for that

1408
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:57,440
uh so it simplifies everything but it

1409
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,680
also glues everything together and maybe

1410
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,440
there is no

1411
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:04,480
aggregation as such but there is now

1412
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:08,079
this central point of uh

1413
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:10,160
authority i guess

1414
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,839
right so this this point where

1415
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:13,760
everything is mediated

1416
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:16,160
and everything is routed through we have

1417
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,319
it now so this is what they call

1418
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:21,520
digitalization and uh other social

1419
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,599
impacts and the political perspective

1420
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:27,760
they put it in i outlined to you a bit

1421
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:30,160
earlier so what do you think about that

1422
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:33,520
i i think that the primary risk of

1423
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:36,079
digitization is that when you have a

1424
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:38,559
single point uh that everything is going

1425
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:39,920
through you also have a single point of

1426
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:43,119
failure and so you are extremely

1427
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:46,559
vulnerable to uh to ddos

1428
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,720
uh so i would be very concerned about

1429
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:51,920
that and once you start having uh

1430
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,960
mandatory use of the app uh or people

1431
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,040
become so reliant on the app that they

1432
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:00,319
don't have uh other ways of identifying

1433
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:02,000
themselves

1434
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,880
then you start getting uh really serious

1435
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:05,839
problems

1436
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:06,559
so

1437
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:10,720
i am skeptical and uh my primary concern

1438
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:13,599
is about the mandatory use normalization

1439
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:15,200
and ddos

1440
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,359
yeah for sure and considering our threat

1441
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:19,680
model

1442
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,000
uh yes uh considering your threat model

1443
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,760
i would say uh

1444
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:27,200
ddos is is uh fairly high on the list

1445
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,599
yeah yeah there are people to the east

1446
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:32,079
that that are quite

1447
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:33,119
quite

1448
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:35,200
that are following this progress with a

1449
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,359
lot of attention they're providing you

1450
01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:40,240
with free pen testing services yeah yeah

1451
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:42,720
thanks very vigorously

1452
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,240
if they only provided us with the

1453
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,760
reports you know

1454
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,359
they don't send us through which they

1455
01:00:47,359 --> 01:00:49,440
don't

1456
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:52,160
okay so the second question from alex is

1457
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,400
you mentioned censorship what about

1458
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,960
propaganda fake news disinformation does

1459
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:00,079
eff have task forces for that

1460
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:02,240
uh yes eff is actually very concerned

1461
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,960
about propaganda and misinformation and

1462
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:05,839
uh

1463
01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:08,000
you would think that we would be you

1464
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,079
know as a as a digital civil liberties

1465
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:11,760
organization that we spend a lot of time

1466
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:14,880
worried about uh about free speech about

1467
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,240
making sure that you can express

1468
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:19,040
yourself online and this is absolutely

1469
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,920
true uh but one of the elements of free

1470
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:26,079
speech is acknowledging that if you just

1471
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:28,720
leave everything wide open with no

1472
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,000
moderation

1473
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,200
then

1474
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,920
the people without power will very

1475
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:36,559
frequently get shouted down they will be

1476
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:38,079
they will be harassed they will be

1477
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:39,760
attacked

1478
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:40,559
or

1479
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:42,000
you can launch

1480
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,920
very effective misinformation campaigns

1481
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:47,119
as we have learned in recent years

1482
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:48,960
having said that we need to be really

1483
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:52,880
careful about the proposed solutions to

1484
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,400
misinformation

1485
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:57,119
and content moderation problems because

1486
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:58,880
frequently when we talk about content

1487
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,520
moderation uh people say well just just

1488
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,599
take down the things that are bad and

1489
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:05,039
you ask them

1490
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:06,640
how do i identify a bad thing and

1491
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,400
they're like i know what a bad thing is

1492
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:09,920
take down the things that i think are

1493
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:11,119
bad

1494
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:13,359
because i'm a perfect human being i am a

1495
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:15,119
perfect human being the rest of you on

1496
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:17,839
the other hand so uh yes this would be

1497
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:19,680
fine if i were queen of the universe and

1498
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:21,680
i decided what was good and bad but

1499
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,599
that's simply not true it turns out that

1500
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:26,480
these are not uh these are not objective

1501
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,799
facts and so we start having a really

1502
01:02:28,799 --> 01:02:30,720
hard time figuring out what you can and

1503
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:35,520
cannot take down and how um so um

1504
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,520
platforms have tried to fix this by

1505
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,119
saying we'll just apply machine learning

1506
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:41,039
to the problem and that only makes

1507
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:43,760
things worse because now the machines

1508
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,680
are deciding now algorithms are deciding

1509
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,280
what is good and what is bad yeah and

1510
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:50,400
what they do is they reflect existing

1511
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,000
biases

1512
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,640
and yes there is a really fabulous

1513
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:56,079
organization called the algorithmic

1514
01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:58,319
justice league that does nothing but

1515
01:02:58,319 --> 01:03:00,640
produce research on this and it's really

1516
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:03,440
really fascinating stuff

1517
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:06,480
so what happens is uh anytime that you

1518
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:07,280
hear

1519
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:09,280
a government or a platform say oh we're

1520
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:10,960
just going to solve this with machine

1521
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,160
learning

1522
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:13,760
what you should hear is no we're not

1523
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:16,559
going to solve this uh this is this is

1524
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:20,319
not a solution uh the solutions involve

1525
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:21,599
uh

1526
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:25,359
giving a lot more uh money to content

1527
01:03:25,359 --> 01:03:27,599
moderation having content moderation

1528
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:29,680
done by people who understand the

1529
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:30,880
context

1530
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:32,640
uh which again is something that doesn't

1531
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,559
happen on platforms very often

1532
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:36,160
especially if your platforms are run in

1533
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:39,200
the united states uh they're frequently

1534
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,640
uh the people who are making these

1535
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:43,280
moderation decisions uh don't really

1536
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:45,280
understand the rest of the world

1537
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:48,000
uh or the specific political situation

1538
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,359
where they don't have enough people who

1539
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:51,359
speak the language one of the biggest

1540
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:54,880
problems in uh in myanmar a couple of

1541
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:58,079
years ago was that essentially uh

1542
01:03:58,079 --> 01:03:59,839
there were groups in myanmar that

1543
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:02,400
managed to you know very successfully

1544
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,799
call for a genocide against the rohingya

1545
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:07,280
uh which are a muslim

1546
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,079
uh

1547
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:10,079
sort of minority ethnic group and the

1548
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:11,359
reason they were able to do that is

1549
01:04:11,359 --> 01:04:12,799
because there just weren't enough people

1550
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:15,200
in uh in facebook's moderation

1551
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:18,319
department who read burmese

1552
01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:19,680
so they kept being told there is a

1553
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:20,960
problem but there were not enough people

1554
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,240
who could even understand what the

1555
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:24,160
problem was much less identify the

1556
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,720
problem they couldn't read it much less

1557
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,799
even understand what they were reading

1558
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:31,039
um so yeah way more money needs to go

1559
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:34,079
into content moderation and way more

1560
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:36,319
thought and and subtlety needs to go

1561
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:37,680
into it and we cannot fix it with

1562
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:40,319
machine learning

1563
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:41,839
but

1564
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:44,640
to stay with that for a moment uh

1565
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:47,760
do platforms do anything related to

1566
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,200
applying machine learning to this

1567
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:51,359
problem because as far as i know there

1568
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:53,200
was a piece of news from twitter or

1569
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,039
someone else where a

1570
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:56,720
why do i know it

1571
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,799
because a graduate from ukrainian

1572
01:04:58,799 --> 01:05:00,960
university was a winner of a contest

1573
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:02,559
that basically

1574
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:04,000
mathematically proved that machine

1575
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,079
learning algorithms

1576
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:08,640
employed by twitter are

1577
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,960
racially biased or something

1578
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:13,680
yeah surprisingly

1579
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,760
they just reflect what we already know

1580
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:17,520
about ourselves

1581
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:19,599
absolutely don't come from nowhere

1582
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:22,720
um yeah uh actually all of the platforms

1583
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:24,640
have been trying to use machine learning

1584
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:26,960
in order to solve this problem for years

1585
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:27,760
and

1586
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:30,720
they have been doing a terrible job and

1587
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:32,000
because

1588
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,839
because they're not transparent about

1589
01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:36,400
the algorithms that they're using or

1590
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,960
um how they're using them or even if

1591
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:40,400
they're using them or what kind of

1592
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,240
experiments they're trying

1593
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:44,960
i it is really difficult to hold them

1594
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:47,440
accountable

1595
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:50,559
yeah absolutely and this is this is a

1596
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:53,839
very serious problem uh there are lots

1597
01:05:53,839 --> 01:05:55,760
of academics who work on this issue

1598
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:57,599
right now who are trying to understand

1599
01:05:57,599 --> 01:05:59,359
the various uh algorithms that are being

1600
01:05:59,359 --> 01:06:01,520
used by the platforms and the platforms

1601
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,119
are even working with academics saying

1602
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:05,280
hey help us come up with algorithms or

1603
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,200
experiments that we can run on on this

1604
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,400
data set

1605
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:11,920
um but uh relationships between the

1606
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,839
platforms and academics are really

1607
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:15,440
strained

1608
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,760
because the platforms are interested in

1609
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,440
working with academics as long as they

1610
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,920
never really criticize their work or as

1611
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:25,760
long as they are uh silenced by ndas and

1612
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:26,880
can never

1613
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:28,480
never talk about the things that they

1614
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:29,599
find

1615
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:32,720
which is really problematic

1616
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:33,839
yeah

1617
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:34,880
yeah

1618
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:37,200
all good points so

1619
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,440
with all that in mind what the next

1620
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:42,079
question from alex is naturally

1621
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:44,160
how do you envision

1622
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:46,079
the global

1623
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:49,280
internet uh in 10 or 20 years are we

1624
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:52,079
going back to pseudonymous and uh not

1625
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:54,240
using real information

1626
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,400
or is it possible to have safe social

1627
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,079
networks

1628
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:00,400
i think this is so special that's very

1629
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,160
efficient all right so obviously the

1630
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:04,160
internet is bigger than social media and

1631
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,280
thank god

1632
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:08,720
um but i think that the the safest

1633
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:10,720
prediction the way to always look like a

1634
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:12,559
genius when you're making predictions is

1635
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:14,079
to say that everything will get better

1636
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:16,319
but also everything will get worse

1637
01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:19,680
so uh on one hand i think that we are

1638
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:21,039
going to see

1639
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:24,720
uh more efforts in the area of uh

1640
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,720
protecting encryption and sort of

1641
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:29,200
ubiquitous and end encryption i think

1642
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:32,559
we're going to see greater rollout of uh

1643
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:34,559
two-factor authentication which really

1644
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:37,039
does a lot to protect uh people's

1645
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:39,520
accounts um i know that for people who

1646
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,359
work in information security this is a

1647
01:07:41,359 --> 01:07:43,920
no-brainer but trying to get people

1648
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:46,240
outside of information security to both

1649
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,799
you know use and implement a strong

1650
01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:52,400
two-factor authentication is

1651
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:55,839
a whole universe of nightmares

1652
01:07:55,839 --> 01:07:58,319
so there's that but i think we're also

1653
01:07:58,319 --> 01:07:59,520
going to see

1654
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:03,039
more efforts by governments uh to to

1655
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:05,440
circumvent this we're going to see more

1656
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:08,160
attacks on uh on journalists and on

1657
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,079
activists on people who speak up to the

1658
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:12,640
government on people who report on

1659
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:14,720
government corruption

1660
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:16,880
and that's really just a continuation of

1661
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:19,359
a trend that we have already seen

1662
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:20,479
with

1663
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:23,520
essentially the impunity of people in

1664
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:24,399
power

1665
01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:28,799
uh and that's also really worrisome uh

1666
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:30,799
so i i don't think i'm going to run out

1667
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:32,960
of work anytime soon

1668
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:35,759
yeah yeah and i hope we won't run out of

1669
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:37,120
people

1670
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:40,158
capable and willing to speak up to the

1671
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:41,600
authority

1672
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:44,560
to say the truth to people in power

1673
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:47,359
okay what's eff's or your personal

1674
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:50,560
position about recent famous cases

1675
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:52,640
this one we briefly covered apple's plan

1676
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,719
to scan photos

1677
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:57,359
for child abuse imagery and facebook

1678
01:08:57,359 --> 01:09:00,960
blocking nyu disinformation research

1679
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:03,520
all right well uh i think the my view on

1680
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:06,000
facebook blocking nyu disinformation

1681
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,920
research is already pretty clear

1682
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:08,719
uh

1683
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:11,040
the what facebook is doing is ridiculous

1684
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:13,839
uh i understand why facebook is doing it

1685
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:17,679
um but it's just blatantly self-serving

1686
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:19,198
i and

1687
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:21,279
uh as for the

1688
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:23,040
don't don't i'm sorry just just to

1689
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:25,520
clarify don't you see it as they

1690
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:27,198
do don't you give them benefit of a

1691
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:29,279
doubt maybe just it's a it's a blip

1692
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:31,120
caused by their

1693
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,359
lowest legalistic approach to to do

1694
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:34,719
things

1695
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:36,719
i think that it does not matter why they

1696
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:38,560
do it i think it only matters only the

1697
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:40,000
end result matters

1698
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,960
if if in the end you have uh entered

1699
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:45,839
into an agreement to uh to work with

1700
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:48,000
researchers to find out you know how

1701
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
effective your algorithms are

1702
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,640
and uh in the end you just muzzle them

1703
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,480
in their research and you cut off their

1704
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:56,239
access uh

1705
01:09:56,239 --> 01:09:58,640
to to the ways that they use in order to

1706
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:00,960
find out what the hell you're doing uh

1707
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:03,120
that's not right

1708
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:04,320
sure

1709
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:06,640
so yeah there's so there's that

1710
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:11,760
and also uh so the apple csam uh plan

1711
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:14,080
has had some recent developments

1712
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:14,960
uh

1713
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:17,760
as as i was as i was telling you earlier

1714
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:20,239
today uh apple has announced that they

1715
01:10:20,239 --> 01:10:22,080
are pausing their plan

1716
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:27,840
to uh scan for csam on uh directly on uh

1717
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:31,040
on iphones in in the united states

1718
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:33,440
um

1719
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:36,320
i think that this is really good news i

1720
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:39,520
was really despairing that the decision

1721
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:41,280
had already been made and it had been

1722
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:43,040
made at the executive level and

1723
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:44,800
therefore we were not going to be able

1724
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:49,600
to launch uh an effective uh sort of uh

1725
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:52,800
protest but the public outcry has been

1726
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,640
really effective and i think that this

1727
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:56,880
is a reminder to everybody that

1728
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:59,280
collective action works

1729
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:01,040
we're not done

1730
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:02,960
pausing the program is really only the

1731
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:04,880
beginning and we have to make sure that

1732
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,480
they're not just going to restart the

1733
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:07,920
program as soon as we stop paying

1734
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:09,679
attention

1735
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:12,000
but it is movement in the right

1736
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,040
direction

1737
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,800
and uh

1738
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:17,600
if they had been allowed to continue

1739
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:21,280
with uh with their plan uh unopposed

1740
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:24,719
that would have uh and it still might

1741
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:26,560
lead to

1742
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:29,280
device side scanning for all kinds of

1743
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:30,400
content

1744
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:32,400
that has nothing to do with csam for

1745
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,320
political content

1746
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:35,920
for

1747
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,920
content that violates

1748
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:41,360
intellectual property laws and uh that

1749
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:46,880
is a dystopia that i'm not here for

1750
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:48,719
yeah let's wait and see if they remove

1751
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:50,960
that functionality from ios

1752
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:52,560
well fortunately they haven't they

1753
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,480
haven't put it in yet so

1754
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:56,880
oh it's already there as far as i know

1755
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:59,840
there was a guy who already like

1756
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:02,719
devastated this part of the ios

1757
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:04,719
operating system it's not activated yet

1758
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:06,400
it's not working but it's already in

1759
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:07,280
there

1760
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:09,600
so if it disappears that would be like a

1761
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:12,640
final uh good sign

1762
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:13,920
i see i'm going to have to read some

1763
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:15,920
release notes

1764
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,360
uh

1765
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:19,440
will they put it into release notes i

1766
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:21,360
don't know let's find out they've you

1767
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:22,560
know companies put all kinds of

1768
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:24,800
interesting stuff into release notes

1769
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:27,520
let's wait and see let's be attentive so

1770
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:29,920
uh fifth and the final question from

1771
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:32,960
alex is uh is the only way to restore

1772
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:35,760
privacy in cyber security

1773
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:39,440
in educating web users

1774
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,640
it's not the only way i think it is very

1775
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:43,600
important

1776
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:46,080
uh it's a suggestive question that i

1777
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:47,760
would i would yeah

1778
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:50,400
if i were a lawyer educating

1779
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,080
users is really important

1780
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:54,800
i absolutely agree uh but it's not the

1781
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:57,199
only method the good news about activism

1782
01:12:57,199 --> 01:12:58,640
is that we have all kinds of tools in

1783
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:00,960
our toolbox and one of the things that

1784
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,840
i'm most enthusiastic about when i go to

1785
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,840
hacker conferences is to talk to the

1786
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,679
people who are starting companies who

1787
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:10,560
are making the information security uh

1788
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:12,320
decisions at large companies and at

1789
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:14,480
startups and getting them

1790
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:15,360
to

1791
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:17,679
think about the needs of vulnerable

1792
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:19,679
populations from the very beginning and

1793
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:21,760
to think about how their products are

1794
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:24,960
going to be misused by governments and

1795
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:27,280
law enforcement and people in power that

1796
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:28,640
they don't like

1797
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:31,840
uh down the line and to build things

1798
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:35,679
that are robust and that uh protect

1799
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:37,679
themselves against abuse from the very

1800
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:39,199
beginning instead of just trying to add

1801
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:42,080
security on at the end the best security

1802
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:45,040
that we can provide for end users is the

1803
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:46,880
level of security and privacy which is

1804
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:50,560
there by default uh so that people don't

1805
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,560
even see it they don't even know that

1806
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:55,360
they have it uh and therefore they don't

1807
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:56,960
have to turn it on and they don't have

1808
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:58,159
to opt in

1809
01:13:58,159 --> 01:14:00,560
uh that is i think the the most

1810
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:02,560
effective way of doing things and the

1811
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:04,080
people who are at this conference are

1812
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:05,360
the people who are in a position to

1813
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:07,360
affect that kind of change

1814
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:08,480
so true

1815
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:11,199
yeah and we work hard we work hard

1816
01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:12,480
towards that

1817
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:14,000
uh this is the general theme of our

1818
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,719
second day i think yeah put everything

1819
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:19,679
into architectural decisions not uh not

1820
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:22,800
optional user choices

1821
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:26,080
next one imagine that everyone on the

1822
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:28,480
planet is aware about information

1823
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:30,880
security and the rights

1824
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:33,280
everyone starts to use store secure

1825
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:36,159
messengers vpn and so on

1826
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:37,600
what's next

1827
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,760
what's the next challenge oh man there's

1828
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:42,640
still so much left to do

1829
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:44,320
yeah

1830
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:47,360
again there's uh there's still e-voting

1831
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:48,640
there's still

1832
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:50,800
the problems with information security

1833
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:51,920
there are still problems with

1834
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:55,040
misinformation there are

1835
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:57,280
still problems with the government

1836
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:58,480
overreach

1837
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:02,640
of uh for your data uh i'm never gonna

1838
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:06,000
run out of work uh end user security is

1839
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,239
only a very very small part of the stuff

1840
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:13,520
that eff is is worried about

1841
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:16,000
when eff was founded in 1990 and

1842
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,640
dinosaurs roamed the earth

1843
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,880
it was

1844
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:22,840
we were an obscure little hipster

1845
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:26,320
organization our worries were considered

1846
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:29,120
to be niche

1847
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:32,960
but what's happened over the last 31

1848
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:35,440
years is that

1849
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:37,280
everyone's lives

1850
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:39,920
have a digital component everyone has a

1851
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:42,159
life online everybody's information is

1852
01:15:42,159 --> 01:15:44,000
online and so all of the things that we

1853
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,760
worried about 31 years ago are uh

1854
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:50,320
that were obscure are now central to

1855
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,640
everybody's existence

1856
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:56,080
i and our issues are now very mainstream

1857
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:57,040
issues

1858
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:57,920
uh

1859
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:00,480
you don't have to uh point out that

1860
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:02,080
something is digital or point out that

1861
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:03,679
something is online it is taken for

1862
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:05,440
granted most things

1863
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:07,440
are are digital most things are

1864
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,600
happening online

1865
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:12,159
and when so much information is out

1866
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:13,280
there

1867
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:15,360
then protecting it becomes that much

1868
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:18,880
more important and uh really

1869
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:21,520
understanding how we treat it is also

1870
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:22,960
really important

1871
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:24,159
so

1872
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:25,760
no eff is never going to run out of

1873
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:28,000
things to do

1874
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,520
pretty sure

1875
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,760
you won't

1876
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:35,920
okay next one how far can you sh how far

1877
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:37,600
can and should

1878
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:39,920
and again

1879
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,760
i should suggestion here a fairly

1880
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:44,000
suggestion how far can and should

1881
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,199
governments go in what we now have here

1882
01:16:47,199 --> 01:16:50,480
in the netherlands oh peter hi again

1883
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:52,400
in uh

1884
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,480
or excluding people including or

1885
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:56,560
excluding people based on the fact that

1886
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:59,679
they are vaccinated or not

1887
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:01,520
so what's the extents of government

1888
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:04,000
regulations that you deem appropriate in

1889
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:04,800
uh

1890
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,679
socially significant issues i guess

1891
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:10,960
well i'm not sure exactly how the dutch

1892
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:13,600
government is implementing

1893
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:15,440
uh

1894
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:19,440
vaccines or vaccine requirements so i'm

1895
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:22,960
not really qualified not enough data

1896
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:25,679
ah i don't have enough data but i can

1897
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:28,400
tell you that my colleague alexis

1898
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:29,440
hancock

1899
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:32,560
has published several blog posts on the

1900
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:34,960
eff website about

1901
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:36,640
vaccine passports

1902
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:37,920
and

1903
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:41,360
why we should be skeptical of them as

1904
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:42,960
a panacea

1905
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:45,520
so those are definitely worth reading so

1906
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:47,600
it's not so much vaccine passports are

1907
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:50,400
all bad all the time just uh

1908
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,080
we we should give it some side eye we

1909
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:55,600
should be skeptical and it's all in the

1910
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:57,360
um

1911
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:59,120
it's all in the details and it's all in

1912
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:01,760
the execution

1913
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,840
as always

1914
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:05,040
devil

1915
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:06,800
surprising details

1916
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:08,000
next one

1917
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,520
do you have any partnership with

1918
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:12,719
organizations from ukraine that protect

1919
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:14,400
human rights

1920
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:17,040
what kind of coordination can help

1921
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:19,120
to do their job

1922
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:20,640
i've spent a lot of time working with

1923
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:22,480
individuals in the ukraine and with

1924
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:24,640
journalists that cover

1925
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:27,679
digital rights issues in the ukraine

1926
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:30,000
and for that matter uh government

1927
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,520
corruption and all kinds of things that

1928
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:32,640
get them

1929
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:34,400
the attention of the government

1930
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:37,040
but not with any uh

1931
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:39,520
formal nonprofit organizations inside of

1932
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:40,960
the ukraine

1933
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:42,719

1934
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:45,440
are listening you can email me at eva

with eva

1942
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:02,400
next one

1943
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,800
how do you assess the chances in the

1944
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:06,880
fight against governments

1945
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:08,719
in 10 years

1946
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:10,640
will the whole world

1947
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:12,640
not be similar to today's

1948
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:13,920
china

1949
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:15,600
social rating

1950
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:18,480
recognition of faces

1951
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:20,880
and so on what else do you think can be

1952
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:22,920
done to prevent such

1953
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:26,320
inclinations from governments a very

1954
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:28,640
politicized question i will understand

1955
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:30,560
if you skip that

1956
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:32,719
i i understand why people ask these

1957
01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:35,520
questions i mean it's essentially

1958
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,360
i'll just give you a safe way out if you

1959
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:39,120
don't want to answer

1960
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:42,000
uh are we headed for dystopia a little

1961
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,360
um i if i believed that it was not

1962
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:48,800
possible to stop dystopia uh i wouldn't

1963
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:52,080
be a professional activist

1964
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:54,640
i i think that collective action is

1965
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:56,080
really powerful

1966
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:59,280
and that framing the issues in ways that

1967
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:01,679
are compelling uh to people and that

1968
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:03,520
help them understand why their rights

1969
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:05,920
are important and what they can do about

1970
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:10,080
it what concrete steps they can take

1971
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:13,840
is really essential uh for example uh

1972
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:16,639
apple had this terrible plan to go and

1973
01:20:16,639 --> 01:20:19,120
stand for csam directly on our devices

1974
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:21,440
leaving our devices vulnerable to all

1975
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:24,880
kinds of requests for scanning uh by uh

1976
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:26,639
governments and law enforcement all over

1977
01:20:26,639 --> 01:20:28,480
the world especially in china where

1978
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:30,719
iphones are manufactured and apple is

1979
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:32,400
really not in a position to just tell

1980
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:33,920
them to bugger off

1981
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:34,800
so

1982
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:37,040
um

1983
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:40,320
we managed to to fight that to a

1984
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:42,880
standstill this morning i think that

1985
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:45,760
that is a really significant achievement

1986
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:47,440
and it would not have happened if people

1987
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:51,040
hadn't spoken out if they had not

1988
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:53,440
written to apple if they had not written

1989
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:56,080
op-eds in newspapers

1990
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:57,679
and made it clear that they're

1991
01:20:57,679 --> 01:20:59,520
reconsidering the purchase of apple

1992
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,360
devices

1993
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:03,520
collective action is

1994
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:06,880
is really one of the only things

1995
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:08,960
that makes a difference and that is why

1996
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:10,800
it's so important for us all to work

1997
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:13,800
together

1998
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:17,040
we are well beyond the cyber security

1999
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:19,199
topics already so this one will not

2000
01:21:19,199 --> 01:21:20,719
surprise you

2001
01:21:20,719 --> 01:21:23,679
uh at our university uh where i work we

2002
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:26,639
have a student who is an afghanistan now

2003
01:21:26,639 --> 01:21:29,600
easy eff somehow involved in helping the

2004
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:32,480
people of afghanistan

2005
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:33,920
um

2006
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:35,120
i don't know

2007
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:38,159
i um i used to work on efs international

2008
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:41,440
team and i don't right now i can tell

2009
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:44,480
you that we've been in a hurry to

2010
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:46,320
translate uh

2011
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:48,960
parts of surveillance self uh defense

2012
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:50,560
into pashtun

2013
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:53,840
uh which is the language spoken and read

2014
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:57,199
by most people in afghanistan so uh in

2015
01:21:57,199 --> 01:21:58,800
that sense yes we have been doing some

2016
01:21:58,800 --> 01:21:59,600
work

2017
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:03,760
um i personally outside of eff have been

2018
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:04,560
down

2019
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:06,320
have been donating lots of money to

2020
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:08,960
refugee relief funds and the reason for

2021
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:11,600
that is that i uh i came to the united

2022
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:14,080
states as a child as a refugee and i

2023
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:17,120
think it's really important to uh to

2024
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:20,000
support uh refugees all over the world

2025
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,280
and people in afghanistan are

2026
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:25,840
are in a lot of danger and it is

2027
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:28,400
literally the least we can do

2028
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:31,360
to help them get out

2029
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:33,440
yes indeed

2030
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:35,040
okay

2031
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:36,560
on this note

2032
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:39,360
i think we have run out of questions

2033
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:42,000
which was huge thank you very much this

2034
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,760

2035
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:45,760
personal best for

2036
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:48,239
non-income closing keynote

2037
01:22:48,239 --> 01:22:50,560
uh we only have one remark here

2038
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:53,040
it's a lot of cheering damn i'm

2039
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:55,120
wondering how i didn't know all this for

2040
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:56,320
so long

2041
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:59,040
uh really it's like watching a

2042
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:01,440
spy agent movie thanks for putting this

2043
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:03,360
uh as closing keynote

2044
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:07,280
loved this so much uh thank you too for

2045
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:10,480
the positive feedback eva it was a

2046
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:12,719
huge pleasure

2047
01:23:12,719 --> 01:23:14,960
i think for us all to have you as a

2048
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:17,840
special closing keynote this was uh very

2049
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:21,120
refreshing and uh

2050
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:23,040
a little bit depressing but this news

2051
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:24,960
about apple that you broke

2052
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:27,840
out to us uh

2053
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:29,679
this this was a positive note and we

2054
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:32,800
think that uh it's an argument you know

2055
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:35,040
it's a fact that proves that collective

2056
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:37,199
activism works

2057
01:23:37,199 --> 01:23:40,080
and uh we have to

2058
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:41,360
bear some

2059
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:44,480
optimism in the future with us and look

2060
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:45,520

2061
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,679

with

2063
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:52,400
collective optimism because only with

2064
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:55,040
that optimism we could go on our

2065
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:58,000
activism right and we all wish you
