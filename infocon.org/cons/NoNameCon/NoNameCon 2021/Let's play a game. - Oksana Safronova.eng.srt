1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,319
my name is alexander safronova and i'm

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:08,639
lead security systems engineer at ipam

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,000
systems

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,799
and gaming considered to be a

5
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,360
fun industry

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,160
full of various entertainment but at the

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,160
end of the day from cyber security

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,279
perspective it has its own challenges

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,240
why is this research because uh gaming

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,279
market value and user base in general

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,439
increased dramatically during the

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:32,800
pandemic

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,880
and with this the volume of cyber

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,480
attacks on gaming increased too

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,960
also i am working with a company in this

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,719
industry as security analyst for some

17
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,039
time already that's why i need to

18
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,200
basically understand what are the

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,280
attacks and attackers and how to build a

20
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,480
proper

21
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,280
defense against them

22
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,520
this research is an overview of known

23
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,160
attacks on gaming industry analysis of

24
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,640
some attack vectors and trends and

25
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,280
cautionary tales about how these attacks

26
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,879
actually impacted

27
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,240
gaming companies involved

28
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,960
general statistics for this research is

29
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,400
around 50

30
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,520
incidents in which gaming companies was

31
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,920
involved during the last i guess around

32
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,759
10 years

33
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,680
and note that

34
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,159
i've counted only a big and

35
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,640
proved and acknowledged

36
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,200
incidents and breaches acknowledged by

37
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,600
companies or by security researchers

38
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,439
statistic

39
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,320
does not include ddos attacks and most

40
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,640
of the attacks won't have any technical

41
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,799
details and that's completely fine

42
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,280
because in incidents like this

43
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,159
company's primary priority is to

44
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,040
acknowledge and secure affected users

45
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,200
so this research will be structured

46
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,759
based on attacks prime attackers the

47
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,079
primary motives that we can describe

48
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,640
based on observer activity

49
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,640
and the first one

50
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,640
is account spawning

51
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,759
so user accounts are valuable assets in

52
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,560
this industry and the most abused one

53
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,200
popular gaming platform uh steam

54
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,920
actually mentioned that they have

55
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,440
around 77 thousands of breached accounts

56
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,800
each month

57
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,400
55 of all active gamers had at least one

58
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,200
account compromised in the past

59
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,840
and talking about uh known gaming

60
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,840
breaches it's hard not to mention the

61
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,959
incidents with sony from 2011.

62
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:33,680
as

63
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,280
on 2011

64
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,920
on april the sony playstation network

65
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,720
network for playstation owners actually

66
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,000
went offline

67
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,800
and

68
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,560
after several days sony actually

69
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,800
confirmed that this was caused by a

70
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,480
massive hacker attack

71
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,319
they needed three weeks to rebuild their

72
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,400
network and to go back online

73
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,760
affected data amount was huge for that

74
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,760
moment it was around 77 million of psn

75
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,519
accounts like accounts for the

76
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,680
playstation network and also millions of

77
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,800
accounts for another gaming company all

78
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,480
owned by sony

79
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,480
also some credit card data was stolen it

80
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,319
was one of the biggest and most known

81
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,200
gaming breaches occurred in industry

82
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,519
the threat to the attacker here was

83
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,799
lolsek a hacking group which was active

84
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,239
from may to june of 2011 they had a lot

85
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,400
of victims in different industries

86
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,480
including gaming in total they were

87
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,360
involved in the four gaming breaches

88
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,519
that are known

89
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,319
initial access vector here was unknown

90
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,040
based on the previously known attacks by

91
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,680
lal sac as it probably was an

92
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,560
exploitation of web vulnerabilities

93
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,239
but sony never

94
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,560
sony worked with forensic investigators

95
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,239
to found

96
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,280
how

97
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,959
hackers actually breached their network

98
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,599
but never discovered the

99
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,080
never publicly discussed the results of

100
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,400
this investigation

101
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,120
in total the public image was damaged

102
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,840
psn network was offline for three weeks

103
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,200
sony had

104
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,238
171 million of losses and was fined by

105
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,279
uk data protection act

106
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,399
this was

107
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,360
this was not the first

108
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,400
breach in gaming industry at all as you

109
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,800
can see uh industry had

110
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,520
its problems like in the before and

111
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,080
after it

112
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,759
and also as you can see uh

113
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,639
the account of the compromised accounts

114
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,759
was not like changing during the years

115
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,120
or was not impacted by anything

116
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,280
at some point just some company could

117
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,759
have a vulnerability and the

118
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,759
millions of accounts suddenly could be

119
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,240
stolen even if you don't know the name

120
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,840
of this specific gaming company

121
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,800
the largest bridge currently is the

122
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,800
breach of singa company uh

123
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,919
172 million accounts involved and some

124
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,080
millions of accounts of

125
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,080
the

126
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,840
other project is involved too which

127
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,800
means that attackers were actually deep

128
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,639
in their infrastructure and could

129
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,199
recover this data

130
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,000
uh in this case uh actually hackers was

131
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,160
the one who reported on this

132
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,440
uh and as consequences uh dinga got a

133
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,440
class action lawsuit which was declining

134
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,840
in court later so no details no

135
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,360
consequences nothing

136
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,400
and on this slide you can see just

137
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,440
the

138
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,759
number of attacks that actually had some

139
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,919
technical details that are publicly

140
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,840
available to analyze

141
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,639
in

142
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,919
most cases the reason of those attack

143
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,240
like the primary initial access vector

144
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,360
was web vulnerability exploitation

145
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,560
and sometimes credential staffing and or

146
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,280
unauthorized access to cloud resources

147
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,919
but on the most recent action

148
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,400
incidents i guess

149
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,440
and in most cases those incidents were

150
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,160
disclosed by companies themselves which

151
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,360
is good

152
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,280
actually

153
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,639
uh on last few years akamai

154
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,039
published two different researches

155
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,199
regarding the gaming industry and gaming

156
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,479
and pandemic and they confirmed that

157
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,680
actually industry suffered an increase

158
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,479
in

159
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,880
credential staffing attack

160
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,479
and in web attack during the last

161
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,280
i guess one half year

162
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,160
when we are in isolation

163
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,960
as bonus statistic it's a

164
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,360
tale about the breached forms so forum

165
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,599
accounts are not probably are not as

166
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,199
critical as user accounts to the games

167
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,319
but in general uh the obtained passwords

168
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,039
can later be reused for credential

169
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,479
staffing attacks

170
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,160
and some users may have the same

171
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,120
password to the forum uh as they have to

172
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,199
the game itself

173
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,479
and this is a list of breached companies

174
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,840
with

175
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,240
incidents related to forms

176
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,639
and this is a list of initial access

177
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,599
vectors and in half of the cases

178
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,199
those were

179
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,360
exploitation of vulnerabilities in

180
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,599
viability the bulletin is a popular

181
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,280
software for

182
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,680
forum building

183
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,720
in conclusion most known attack vector

184
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,120
for pounding cases exploitation of web

185
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,560
vulnerabilities

186
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,960
the number of all attacks

187
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,960
is dramatically increased during the

188
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,080
pandemic

189
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,919
and there is no direct correlation

190
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,639
between the count of accounts

191
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,360
attack vectors and years so

192
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,520
anything can happen

193
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,400
with the company based on its primary

194
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,359
security flaws

195
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,599
the next motivation is malicious

196
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,240
fund-based activity

197
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,960
so industry itself has a lot of talented

198
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,560
fans who

199
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,080
who can

200
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,960
potentially want to obtain uh some

201
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,800
publicly unknown information about the

202
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,080
game

203
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:22,879
and

204
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,960
goal their goals may vary

205
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,520
from publishing this information to the

206
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,400
world to preserve it for themselves in

207
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,958
private collections but in general uh

208
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,200
incidents like this could potentially

209
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,360
harm the industry

210
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,240
the most known case and probably the

211
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,000
oldest one in my uh general statistic is

212
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,320
a case with valve as

213
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,839
on

214
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,360
2003 uh the source code of half-life 2

215
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,240
was

216
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,440
published

217
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,880
online

218
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,519
and it was as a result of an attack of

219
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,320
the hacker and in this case we can tell

220
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,920
what happened because basically the

221
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,399
hacker later published the description

222
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,959
of how he operated so he found the

223
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,200
unprotected server or

224
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,839
partner company involved network

225
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,440
and uploaded

226
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,279
the shell to publicly writable web route

227
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,560
he

228
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,600
assessed the vault's infrastructure and

229
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,600
actually found out that their primary

230
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,519
domain controller had a blank password

231
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,560
so

232
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,760
after dumping

233
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,640
all the password hashes he had the keys

234
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,959
to all to the kingdom

235
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,200
but actually the data the source code

236
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,000
was leaked by someone with whom he just

237
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,720
shared the obtained code

238
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,120
later wealth acknowledged the leak and

239
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,360
asked community for the help asked to

240
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,880
find a hacker

241
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,600
so

242
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,920
after some time from anonymous source

243
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,160
some blocks related to this hacker was

244
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,360
submitted

245
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,519
to valve and in seven months the hacker

246
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,760
was actually arrested

247
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,959
uh

248
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,480
those actually this leak

249
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,440
did not

250
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,399
impact the sales of the game itself

251
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,480
because probably at that period of time

252
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,600
it was not shared so publicly that can

253
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,760
be shared today

254
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,160
the next case has no

255
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,120
known actor has a known actor but no

256
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,959
technical details but is still important

257
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,040
for the industry it's giga league by

258
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,279
nintendo so this is the biggest breach

259
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,399
in

260
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,079
nintendo's history publicly known from

261
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,480
games to development tools everything

262
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,360
was leaked around two terabytes of data

263
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,560
uh hacker was actually arrested uh

264
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,200
after a year of investigation i guess

265
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,839
but the data keeps leaking it keeps

266
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,600
getting released and last release was

267
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,560
actually this year

268
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,240
and

269
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,279
the last case is from naughty dog gaming

270
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,040
company

271
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,079
which are the developers of last of us

272
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,959
game so last year uh content of their

273
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,680
cutscenes things from the unreleased

274
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,360
game was

275
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,519
published online

276
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,480
and have some debug information on it so

277
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,279
the

278
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,680
videos with those cutscenes and plot of

279
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,040
the game actually revealed some details

280
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,279
of the gaming process which were not

281
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,920
liked by gamers because that was not

282
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,480
apparently it was not what they expected

283
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,360
and this at some point impacted the

284
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,360
image of the game even before its

285
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,040
release

286
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,279
the theories about the possible source

287
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,440
of those videos were different first of

288
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,320
all like this granted employee because

289
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,440
those

290
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,959
videos contained the debug data

291
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,720
which are like a

292
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,000
mark of authenticity of this data

293
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,399
but most likely it was caused by the

294
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,440
vulnerability disc discussed of one of

295
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,959
the researchers who is was not involved

296
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,600
with this leak but knew some details

297
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,600
because every game of naughty dog had a

298
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,320
final patch which contained

299
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,480
aws key

300
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,360
that can be paired with a secret bucket

301
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,600
id and reveals the content of the server

302
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,200
so per each

303
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,920
game title they have a separate bucket

304
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,959
id and a different key they've tried to

305
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,920
dump the data from older games of the

306
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,839
company just to preserve it but

307
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,440
apparently for searching for the data of

308
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,959
the

309
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,880
materials for last of us one they

310
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,040
discovered the data of last of

311
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,920
us too which was not yet released

312
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,279
and

313
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,519
later someone actually compiled this and

314
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,279
published it

315
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,680
and this theory later was confirmed by

316
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,079
one of the game journalists but we will

317
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,079
never know what the initial vector is

318
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,399
but the version with aws sounds

319
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,399
realistic

320
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,120
in conclusion industry has a lot of

321
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,360
talented fans who could really cross the

322
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,600
line in finding the new materials about

323
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,440
various game titles

324
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,760
information obtained by them can be

325
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,920
hidden from the public eye or published

326
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,959
to the most

327
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,880
known forums

328
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,360
uh and probably there are more

329
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,279
vulnerabilities in the wild which are

330
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,800
actually can be compromised by hackers

331
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,480
but they are not disclosed publicly as

332
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,880
they need a way to obtain a new

333
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,800
materials from the company

334
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,839
uh the next vector it's the exploitation

335
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,800
so exploitation it's an abuse of legit

336
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,279
functionality of the game itself

337
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,720
and or compromising of the company on

338
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,920
stages of games development actually

339
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,480
the example of the first one is the case

340
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,480
with nintendo last year so one day a

341
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,839
huge amount

342
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,600
of

343
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,079
users started to experience

344
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,480
the unauthorized access attempt to their

345
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,160
accounts

346
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,320
and those were like accounts with the

347
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,000
payment information attached because

348
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,920
this is critical for the existence of

349
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,040
this account

350
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,519
and users suddenly started to

351
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,760
see the purchasing of uh

352
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,720
in currency in current in-game currency

353
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,839
bundles from a popular free to play

354
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,560
game fortnite what was it

355
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,279
it was money laundry scheme so

356
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,120
some games suggest players to buy

357
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,880
in-game currency to

358
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,120
purchase some unique or supportive items

359
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,519
and this will require you to attach your

360
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,160
payment a payment system of your choice

361
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,480
to your gaming account

362
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,040
this potentially can abuse be abused by

363
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,360
hackers in two ways first of all they

364
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,480
can create dynamic accounts and attach

365
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,519
data from stolen credit cards

366
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,320
and purchase this in-game currency or

367
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,639
attacker can access the bridge account

368
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,480
and use them the same way as demi

369
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,440
accounts but now they had they will have

370
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,880
a legit payment option attached actually

371
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,720
and later they will result those in-game

372
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,680
currency bundles to other gamers with a

373
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,240
discount and receive real money from

374
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,519
those

375
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,240
in-game currency bundles

376
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,399
with nintendo all compromised accounts

377
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,040
had something in common they had a login

378
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,519
through nintendo network id which was a

379
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,199
way to login to one of a way to login to

380
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,920
older consoles of nintendo older

381
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,920
generation of consoles so

382
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,240
all of the existing nintendo consoles

383
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,880
have this uh have ability to login

384
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,959
through this nintendo the network

385
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,600
ideally against and to have a shared

386
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,600
wallet for all of your platforms

387
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,720
involved

388
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,680
and potentially someone obtains a list

389
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,639
of the password for this specific way of

390
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,720
logging in because it was like a

391
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,440
different uh it should have a different

392
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,600
password from the main nintendo account

393
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,920
nintendo says that this probably was

394
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,680
leaked outside of them because they

395
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,079
didn't found uh those accounts bridge

396
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,399
from their site

397
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,880
and after investigation they found

398
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,279
around

399
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:18,000
300 000 accounts affected by this issue

400
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,240
and ability to login into nintendo

401
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,360
account via network nintendo network id

402
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,440
was disabled completely by the company

403
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,600
after this incident and compromise users

404
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,480
we already found it

405
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,320
the next case is more severe it's

406
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,240
related to apt group which actually

407
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,360
targets gaming industry so winter apt

408
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,320
was first mentioned on 2013 by kaspersky

409
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,560
in the report regarding the attacks on

410
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,800
gaming industry winty is the name of the

411
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,360
malware assigned to the samples by

412
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,720
semantic av

413
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,600
for the timeline it looks like

414
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,240
winte apt started the activity around

415
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,199
2010 based on traces found on another

416
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,639
investigations and on 2011 kaspersky

417
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,199
found the trojan dll

418
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,439
dropped on machines with updates to

419
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,119
popular online game apparently did those

420
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:16,240
dll files was not meant to attack users

421
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,880
those were actually for the developments

422
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,319
company because

423
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,640
on users machines

424
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,480
it was hard to execute them actually

425
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,679
and as for kaspersky this was the first

426
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:35,360
time they saw a 64-bit signed

427
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,760
valley signed with a valid digital

428
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,480
certificate uh binary

429
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,160
as a malware

430
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,840
and apparently as the digital

431
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,160
certificate

432
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,640
belonged to other game developer which

433
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,799
apparently was previously compromised by

434
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:51,760
winty

435
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,400
so this this actually

436
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,440
opens

437
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,080
an understanding of what your the goals

438
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,600
of this specific apt group first of all

439
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,679
they wanted to obtain the source code of

440
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,720
the online games to probably deploy some

441
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,919
private servers to scam users or found

442
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,400
vulnerabilities on these source codes to

443
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,200
steal digital certificates to reuse them

444
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,360
later in attacks on

445
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,919
the other industries or bigger targets

446
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,840
because they actually had lots of

447
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,919
targets in various industries not on the

448
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,799
gaming and accumulate in-game currency

449
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,120
to later convert it into real money like

450
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,000
with

451
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,120
one of the ways as i've described before

452
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,840
they've did it by injecting malicious

453
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,960
code into the processes on game server

454
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,360
which were related to generation of

455
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,640
in-game currency in general

456
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,720
they had a large list of the targets

457
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,120
which were actually post identified by

458
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,400
kaspersky with the certificates that

459
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,320
were used to sign those samples

460
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,320
and as i've mentioned they had lots of

461
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,400
targets outside of gaming industry

462
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,080
thailand cert actually

463
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,720
released a report that summarized their

464
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,880
activity over various

465
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,440
businesses around

466
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,080
as for 2020 they are still active uh

467
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,360
they still sign in their samples with

468
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,000
previously affected company certificates

469
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,320
and develop new backdoors like coin

470
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,760
miner or backdoor to modify my

471
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,200
sql databases to generate more in-game

472
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,200
currency

473
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,720
on 2014 the company garena online was

474
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,080
compromised

475
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,280
as

476
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,799
they are

477
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,200
they are a distributor of several games

478
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,720
uh for the southeast asia region

479
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,840
and on all of the samples uh all of the

480
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,400
executables for those games uh

481
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,200
researchers found a

482
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,039
remote access tool

483
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,160
uh

484
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,160
this remote actual so

485
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,720
this tool actually was dropped by

486
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,880
compromised game launcher

487
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,240
uh and after the deployment of uh

488
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,600
plug x malware the legit launcher was

489
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,840
dropped on the machine to

490
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,559
hide the traces of involvement of

491
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,120
compromised launcher

492
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,280
as a consequences

493
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,679
they had a few reports from players and

494
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,679
after the second attempt they got this

495
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,440
fixed but no details were never provided

496
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,080
on 2013 uh game war z were hacked

497
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,480
and servers were shut down as game was

498
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,919
not so popular later the source code of

499
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,760
this game confirmed to be breached

500
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,440
in 2018 two partner companies apparently

501
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,440
picked up this code and tried to develop

502
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,559
their own game based on some

503
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,640
technologies related to those games

504
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,799
in total there were like two separate

505
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,360
games in the wild uh

506
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,960
signed by certificates by those

507
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,000
companies

508
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,039
uh what is about the this code in

509
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,000
general all games included it ended up

510
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,760
compromised

511
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,000
so shadowhammer is a name of supply

512
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,120
chain attack involving the asus update

513
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,039
on 2018.

514
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,240
shadow pad is a name of a backdoor used

515
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,440
on this operation modified version of

516
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,760
shadow pad was found on machines with

517
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,320
stronized games from those two companies

518
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,000
mentioned

519
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,559
shadow path in general is a privately

520
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,840
sold modular malware platform this was

521
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,480
proven by the research base recent

522
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,640
research like in 2021 by sentinel one

523
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,720
in the use it's in use by several

524
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,120
chinese ipt because before it

525
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:45,840
they

526
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,080
researchers had an idea that those

527
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,640
groups just sharing the sharing some

528
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,039
malware sharing some models between all

529
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,360
of them but looks like they are just

530
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,679
buying buying the variants of shadow

531
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,480
paths with various models

532
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,480
with attacks on previously mentioned

533
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,120
games usage of shadowpath is assigned to

534
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,600
barium ipt it was identified by

535
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,080
microsoft so infection of the games is

536
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,400
similar to the case with asus that's why

537
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,559
this cases

538
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,240
is considered to be the part of

539
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,799
shadowhammer operation but

540
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,960
with different products

541
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,600
in general malicious code was compiled

542
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,919
into games executable one of the

543
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,240
malicious samples from the attacks was

544
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,480
an altered part of microsoft visual

545
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,120
studio to summarize attackers should

546
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,880
either had an ability to inject

547
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,880
malicious code from the compromised

548
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,360
machine of the developer or try ice

549
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,760
development software was downloaded and

550
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,520
used by developer willingly

551
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,159
we will never know what is the correct

552
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,520
uh version of events here in general uh

553
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,679
industries project has the large specter

554
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,159
of functionalities which

555
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,240
are actively developed to attract new

556
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,799
players but those functionalities can

557
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:04,320
often be used by attackers and exploited

558
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,480
and this is hard to prevent completely

559
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,159
there are hiking groups that are out

560
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:11,840
there which are targeting specific

561
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,760
gaming industry and developing their

562
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,559
tooling uh specifically to gain the

563
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:21,039
gains the most from this intrusion

564
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,760
into the company's workflow

565
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,240
and the last vector is extortion

566
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,280
so it's about stealing of sensitive data

567
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,360
with further black mailing of affected

568
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,480
companies

569
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,440
most used and recent attack vector here

570
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,280
is ransomware attack but with

571
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,919
exfiltration as an important part

572
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,320
publicity of the incident is used as an

573
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,640
advantage by attackers

574
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,039
on 2020 crytek company reportedly was

575
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,520
hated by a gregor ransomware

576
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,760
a gregor ransomware is a ransomware

577
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,640
service which used banking trojans to

578
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,960
deliver cobalt strike payload and a

579
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,760
number of legit tools to complete the

580
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,919
discovery of the environment compression

581
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:05,360
of the data and with further

582
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,400
exfiltration of it

583
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,360
how it became public actually because

584
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,520
the samples of data from crytek were

585
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,840
published on mcgregor's website because

586
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,200
they used to publish some detail some

587
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,440
documents of the affected or materials

588
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,840
any materials of affected company to

589
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,640
their website in dark web

590
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,520
so there were a few documents related to

591
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,360
company

592
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,080
and some general cast customers data but

593
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,720
also it's included allegedly

594
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,039
they had a source code of ubisoft's

595
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,840
watchdogs uh recent game

596
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,480
uh the scene was that crytek was a

597
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,760
partner with ubisoft and hackers stated

598
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,640
that they could access ubisoft's network

599
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,200
from crytex network which was actually

600
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,600
encrypted by ransomware

601
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,320
as consequences they demanded ubisoft

602
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,240
actually to pay because ubisoft was a

603
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,960
big company in this scheme in general uh

604
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,279
ubisoft declined this and in a month

605
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,039
allegedly the source code of the game

606
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,440
were released in public but authenticity

607
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,120
and existence of the squad is not

608
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,640
confirmed

609
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,559
the second case also last year is

610
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,360
related to cd projekt red company uh

611
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,440
they've announced it on their twitter

612
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,679
they publicly acknowledged it they were

613
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,720
hated by hello kitty ransomware uh this

614
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,000
was identified by the published transom

615
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,760
notes naming

616
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,830
the action behind the ransomware

617
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,039
[Music]

618
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:33,840
was

619
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,559
not like like other actors in those

620
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,320
cases as they

621
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,240
usually just ran ransomware and

622
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,520
collected ransom their usual tactics did

623
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,520
not include exfiltration but looks like

624
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,440
with this company they decided to give

625
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,559
it a try uh ransomware doesn't bother to

626
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,559
hide its execution or activity from

627
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,559
affected users it's found invisible

628
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,720
command line windows and running like

629
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,720
commands that can be seen in locks in

630
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,720
general but it doesn't make it less

631
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,640
deadly for the environment it currently

632
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,320
has both windows and linux variants

633
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,880
affected data or source code of the game

634
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,440
some sensitive documentation and data of

635
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,640
employees

636
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,360
and in this case source code confirmed

637
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,679
to exist and be completely valid by

638
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,240
researchers because it was spread

639
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,240
across public platforms i guess since

640
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,159
day one

641
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,679
as consequences a hacker

642
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,960
attacker organized an auction to solve

643
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,440
this data and they stated they that

644
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,360
actually they sold it out of auction but

645
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,240
this all could be just a hoax to

646
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,960
pressure the company to pay them at the

647
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,559
end

648
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,799
as consequences in five months as data

649
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,400
was on public forum released in

650
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,640
encrypted folders with the group asking

651
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,279
for 10k donation to unlock each folder

652
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,600
also last year capcom company was

653
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,020
compromised in this case we actually can

654
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,520
[Music]

655
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,679
gather some understanding about initial

656
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,919
access because capcom published all of

657
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:09,840
the details of it so it was uh initial

658
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,320
access was made through compromised old

659
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,679
vpn device

660
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,840
which were emergency backup in case of

661
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,320
communication problems which became

662
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,080
crucial for the companies during the

663
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,320
pandemic

664
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,799
the threat here was a regular locker

665
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,919
ransomware which utilizing virtualbox to

666
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:28,720
run

667
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,039
itself actually and

668
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,880
encrypting the content of the infected

669
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,399
machine by attaching the folders from

670
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,559
infected machine to the virtual machine

671
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,960
on which a ransomware actually is

672
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,600
executed

673
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,159
protected data around one terabytes of

674
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,080
data from personal information of

675
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,320
employees to resources connected to

676
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,399
their games

677
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,880
ransom was not paid

678
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,679
and as in previous cases in few weeks

679
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,679
all of the information were published

680
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,320
and in i guess in a few months

681
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,399
capcom published detailed investigation

682
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,240
about how they've handled it and what

683
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,279
data was actually compromised there

684
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,760
and the most recent case is related to

685
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,960
electronic arts games company but it was

686
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,120
not a ransomware it was just a pure

687
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,760
exfiltration by attackers the initial

688
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,000
access was actually described by hackers

689
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,799
to one of new sources

690
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,399
it was a stolen authentication cookie

691
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,399
purchased online

692
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:35,039
which provided them with access to a

693
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,120
games slack instance

694
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,440
in slack attackers contacted i.t and

695
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,559
asked for a multi-character talking

696
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,360
for them as they've lost their phone

697
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,480
token was provided attackers could login

698
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,279
into ea infrastructure

699
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,440
affected data included the source code

700
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,840
of the games sdks

701
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,399
and

702
00:28:58,399 --> 00:28:59,279
the

703
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,960
source engine for uh more of most of the

704
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,720
games by this company

705
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,960
why this incident is different from

706
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,600
others we've seen because it included

707
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,039
source code for online competitive games

708
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,760
and engines in general because

709
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,000
those source codes most likely won't be

710
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,760
reused based on the copyright by other

711
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,559
companies but a possible competitor

712
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,880
actually can analyze this code to get a

713
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,720
general understanding of products

714
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,600
advantages weaknesses and

715
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,760
source codes are valuable really

716
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,240
valuable for cheats development which is

717
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,240
a separate financially successful

718
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,399
business which is built on unauthorized

719
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,720
development of softwares that

720
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,279
using exploits in gamescode to alter the

721
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,360
gaming process

722
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,640
as consequences hackers tried to get

723
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,600
money

724
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,679
they tried first of all they've tried to

725
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,720
sell the store the stolen data then

726
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,039
they've tried to extort the ea games to

727
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,000
pay them for this data and later when

728
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,799
this

729
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,240
went nowhere they just published it as

730
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,320
we can see this is a new and quite

731
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,320
damaging attack type for the industry

732
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,399
ransomware as a service can lead to

733
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:17,360
increased number of actors who will have

734
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,480
a similar goals and attacking can

735
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,640
actively communicate with press about

736
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,640
the attacks and threaten to source

737
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,279
sensitive information to press to

738
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:31,120
pressure the affected companies

739
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,840
and the last one is a few words about

740
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,760
the defense tactics here

741
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,840
first of all some general security

742
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,799
practices we saw which are valid for all

743
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,279
companies from all industries like

744
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,200
continuous security monitoring

745
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,440
vulnerability management penetration

746
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,240
testing and internal security trainings

747
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,960
for gaming platform itself multi-factor

748
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,440
authentication capture implementation

749
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,200
and fraud protection

750
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,399
and what about the

751
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,480
defense techniques that we can already

752
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,440
see implemented by industry itself first

753
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,679
of all user education

754
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,720
on malicious tactics within platforms so

755
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,440
platform can compile a list of the

756
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,000
popular scenarios at least to make user

757
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
know that hey this potentially can

758
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
happen to you

759
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,519
the second is about mfa enrollment

760
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,159
encouragement so it's good to have mfa

761
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,080
on your platform but you need to make

762
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,600
users to use it

763
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,600
you can make it

764
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,840
make some functionality available only

765
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,399
with mfa like trading because this is

766
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,000
really

767
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,200
sensitive as it involves real money

768
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,559
and temporary promotion of the mfa is

769
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,440
great reversed because gaming can

770
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,480
allow itself to provide

771
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,000
users with some rare bonuses

772
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,279
and password security measures which can

773
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,840
be done on the side of the company like

774
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,159
monitoring of public clicks

775
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,039
with

776
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,679
unknown passwords and integration with

777
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,279
password checking services to

778
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:10,000
acknowledge user if they even want to

779
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,320
type a password that

780
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,440
are already that is already somewhere in

781
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,679
the league databases

782
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,919
also mo at least on hacker one uh seven

783
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,000
big gaming companies has their back

784
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,919
bounty programs released

785
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,760
so that's how

786
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,440
actually community can country

787
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,679
contribute into the security of the game

788
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,159
and gain something from it

789
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,399
in general successful attack techniques

790
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,559
in industry changed over the years from

791
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,720
just collecting of the accounts to black

792
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,960
main in the whole blackmailing the whole

793
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,720
companies but industries defense

794
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,120
capabilities and user awareness change

795
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,760
too so confrontation continue with

796
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,600
evolution from both sides

797
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,120
thank you for your attention play safe

798
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,640
am i in

799
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,080
yep i think so axana thank you

800
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,919
it's a very

801
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:17,519
stylish

802
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,080
presentation i must admit

803
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,960
very excited with the with the content

804
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,799
and yeah it looks really cool

805
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,000
okay so uh

806
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,159
thank you once again for the great talk

807
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,519
and uh we are ready to start our q a

808
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,679
session with questions from our audience

809
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:42,960
both in zoom and

810
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,519
youtube

811
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:49,600
our previous experience

812
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:54,159
tells me that we need to give

813
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,200
our attendees a couple of minutes

814
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,559
for it to

815
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,960
sink in yeah and

816
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,159
yeah

817
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,159
basically

818
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:07,360
type something in

819
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,599
the chats because

820
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,159
virtual format

821
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,720
adds up

822
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:18,159
latency

823
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,159
okay

824
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,440
uh

825
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,359
why am i particularly interested

826
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,079
in this topic

827
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:35,079
um

828
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,800
i think it's enough

829
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,079
time passed since uh

830
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,520
since my wild youth and i can't disclose

831
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,480
how i

832
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,199
actually got into cyber security so um

833
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:52,719
me and my friends we are

834
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,280
um

835
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,800
we were known for some very interesting

836
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,720
hacking cheats

837
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,920
uh in online gaming

838
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,960
and

839
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,560
yeah that was a long time ago it was udp

840
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,530
i'm not proud of it

841
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:10,960
[Laughter]

842
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,720
but you know

843
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,800
back in those days it was

844
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,400
quite fun because

845
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,800
most people just cheated

846
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,880
yeah around some business logic already

847
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,240
implemented

848
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,680
in the game but we tried to go down the

849
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,680
stack and see what's going on under the

850
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,119
hood and maybe we could uh do something

851
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:32,720
with it we never

852
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,800
got down to monetizing any of it

853
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,480
but it it was fun

854
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,440
you know

855
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,440
uh

856
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,000
having to

857
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,320
valuable

858
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,280
digital assets instead of one

859
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,920
with a couple of packets cents sent it

860
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,720
was it was really nice so maybe these

861
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,200
early experimentation

862
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,160
got me into the business after all

863
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,960
uh so i think we have some questions

864
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,640
uh if you want to ask questions aloud

865
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,280
right and you are not ashamed of your

866
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,119
voice

867
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,920
uh which you shouldn't be

868
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,960
uh

869
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,720
please raise your hand and i will give

870
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,520
you the virtual mic if not just type it

871
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,320
in so the first question is what

872
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,119
is a chance to catch an intruder

873
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,359
physically

874
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:31,839
any such cases maybe

875
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:34,560
okay demon i will give you the mic

876
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,119
if i can

877
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,640
oh yeah you already gotta hear me

878
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:44,000
yes okay uh my question

879
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,040
hi uh thanks uh for the presentation

880
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,079
very cool and my question is what's

881
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:51,760
what's the chance to catch an intruder

882
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,200
actually i mean physically like a

883
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,599
physical person maybe

884
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:57,920
in some cases or whatever

885
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,599
thank you

886
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,520
unfortunately i can't disclose like lots

887
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,320
of cases but in my opinion it depends on

888
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,280
the

889
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,400
only the coverage of your monitoring and

890
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,320
investigating cases like this can

891
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,720
actually help you to understand what you

892
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,800
should monitor in which components of

893
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,880
your environment you should look closer

894
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,200
and potentially see if this

895
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,119
sometimes can

896
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,880
lead to the further exploitation

897
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,200
and as i've mentioned uh

898
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,520
the intrusion can have lots of lots of

899
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,880
different variants and looks it can be

900
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,119
intrusions through the compromising of

901
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,359
the game itself or compromising the

902
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:42,160
people who worked in the gaming company

903
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,520
and

904
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,079
can you answer one more question please

905
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:49,040
how many such incidents are connected to

906
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,480
insiders not some external actions but

907
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,480
inside networks yeah that's i mean

908
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,560
malicious my follow-up that's exactly

909
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,880
what i wanted to ask right after you

910
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,920
finished that

911
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,119
insider i stole your question okay yeah

912
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,200
how many insiders are actually in

913
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,280
because yeah you know this uh modern

914
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,079
trend when uh log b

915
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,800
2.0 just hires insiders and large

916
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,640
consulting firms and gets into all their

917
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,480
clients

918
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,400
so uh in the scope of those 50 cases no

919
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,040
cases related to insiders but in my

920
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,280
opinion there should be lots of them

921
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,400
because

922
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,680
those 50 cases are just the public ones

923
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,640
so

924
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,880
there might be lots of attacks which are

925
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,680
uh publicly completely unknown and uh

926
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,520
swept under the

927
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,560
by companies i just i can like i can

928
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,440
decline it and i can just say that hey i

929
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,920
know the whole

930
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,720
statistics and the whole trends here but

931
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,280
the public information is the only thing

932
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,760
i have as an analyst like a lessons

933
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,440
learned live action essence learn

934
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,920
because no simulation can prepare you

935
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,599
for the fact that the source code of

936
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,760
your game is leaked but you at least see

937
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,240
how the company handles it and how it

938
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,640
actually works

939
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,200
so outside there should be lots of uh

940
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,280
internal intruders to be honest

941
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,040
as well as vulnerabilities of the

942
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,480
platforms which are hidden by

943
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,640
for sure yeah but you know uh

944
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,720
taking the first part of your answer you

945
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,800
know data shows that there is some

946
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,400
potential for optimums but i will break

947
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,560
it

948
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,800
i will destroy it for you

949
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,040
yeah i totally agree but this is just

950
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,640
this is not the sample representative

951
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,839
enough

952
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:42,560
yep

953
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,400
okay peter do you want to ask your

954
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,359
question out loud

955
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:53,119
or i can read it for you

956
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,960
and mute

957
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,800
uh low can you hear me

958
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,680
yes yeah i'm out loud i have to find a

959
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,040
way to

960
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,319
if there is a camera available or not

961
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:07,280
uh

962
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,319
i don't want to see my fat hat

963
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,280
the question was what i noticed from

964
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,720
your uh from from your talk is that um i

965
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,800
see a lot of um

966
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,040
economical driven actors in um in in the

967
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,800
atmosphere you're working in but do you

968
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,720
also notice that there is interest of

969
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,800
state actress to to

970
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,400
misuse or

971
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,440
um

972
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,400
yeah

973
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,880
abused the the gaming industries

974
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,599
infrastructures to gain for political

975
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:46,079
reasons or

976
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,200
i guess the winter apt actually had some

977
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,680
cases related to government not sure if

978
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,920
i can name all of them but yeah they

979
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,760
were involved with various industry

980
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,599
gaming was just a step for them to

981
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,680
gather the certificates to sign their

982
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,839
samples nothing more and to collect some

983
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:03,920
money for in-game currency

984
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,800
okay

985
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,000
so then

986
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,760
the gaming industry is a stepping stone

987
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,160
to a wider goal instead of a goal

988
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,480
sometimes yes okay

989
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,520
thank you

990
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,319

1006
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,370
first of the game was obsolete

00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:10,400
[Music]

well i i like to ask one more thing the

1015
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:30,560
last one i promise and is it a case

1016
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,359
where one gaming company

1017
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,760
hire a hacker to hack another gaming

1018
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,920
company to get the technologies

1019
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,160
i mean to get theirs what does it get

1020
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,319
their source code get their technologies

1021
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:45,200
to get june to get there

1022
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,200
i don't know what

1023
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,960
what what what's the technology in the

1024
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,200
game i'm not a game developer but it

1025
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,520
should be something right

1026
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,640
okay so no public knowledge about cases

1027
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,920
like this and i'm not sure if they will

1028
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,400
take the risks to do it actually but

1029
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,359
with cases like with uh

1030
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:07,520
with who was the last company with

1031
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,520
electronic arts games the engine is

1032
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,880
already public

1033
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,599
and so those attackers also

1034
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:16,079
can as i've mentioned those attackers

1035
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,720
who leak the source code sources of game

1036
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,960
actually can provide a great value for

1037
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,119
the potential competitors to analyze the

1038
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:25,760
codes yes they won't reuse it but yeah

1039
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,319
they can at least research it and

1040
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,880
understand how it works so i guess

1041
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,800
sometimes they don't even need to hire a

1042
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,880
hacker they need to wait long enough to

1043
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,760
data to be licked

1044
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,200
but the idea

1045
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:46,750
[Music]

1046
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,839
horrible

1047
00:43:58,720 --> 00:43:59,839
and girls

1048
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:02,720
and nothing nothing nothing in q a

1049
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,920
everything covered nothing in chat

1050
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,040
nothing

1051
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,839
in

1052
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,880
nothing

1053
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,280
oh i see the question that is i think

1054
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,200
partially answered already how many

1055
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,000
insiders had been caught and delivered

1056
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,880
to jail so we don't insiders not sure

1057
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:29,040
yeah in general like uh in most cases

1058
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,160
with uh fan activism like uh the only

1059
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,480
one which was not investigated i guess

1060
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,119
was not with naughty dog in cases with

1061
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:39,760
valve hacker was caught in cases with

1062
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,680
nintendo two hackers was caught actually

1063
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,760
but i have included only one because

1064
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,839
some companies are taking care of their

1065
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:48,400
intellectual property like more than

1066
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,880
anyone and nintendo is one of them they

1067
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,720
uh

1068
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:53,839
they are

1069
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:56,000
strongly defending their intellectual

1070
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,160
property from any leakage

1071
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,520
however yeah as you as you properly

1072
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,839
highlighted

1073
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:04,720
the s

1074
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,640
the source code itself the product

1075
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,680
itself

1076
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,280
is not very

1077
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,960
profitable to steal right because time

1078
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,200
to market is so long

1079
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,960
yes if so if the game is not developing

1080
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,079
yes

1081
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:20,000
but if you are talking about like some

1082
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,480
popular compatible games it's still like

1083
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,520
a great values you can develop cheats to

1084
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,280
exploit it

1085
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,880
yeah for sure i mean just between

1086
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,720
different developers like legitimate

1087
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,280
developers of gaming products it's not

1088
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,760
it's not valuable at all because it's so

1089
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,280
easy to

1090
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,560
uh to apprehend the similarity yeah and

1091
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,560
file ip

1092
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,000
lawsuit

1093
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,800
it's just not worth trying but in order

1094
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,040
to like uh

1095
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,800
uh

1096
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,839
in order to harm a business of an

1097
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:55,119
opponent

1098
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:58,640
it looks like a viable strategy

1099
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,560
like one of the ransomware actors

1100
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,280
actually mentioned that uh if you will

1101
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,839
not pay we will uh leak all of your

1102
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:07,839
documents to the game and press and they

1103
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:10,160
won't be pleased with it

1104
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,920
so in general this is like another

1105
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,240
vector is to harm the reputation by

1106
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,160
leaking the documents

1107
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:16,960
yeah

1108
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,160
yeah

1109
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,160
okay maybe the last question i should

1110
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,040
ask did you do any correlation with the

1111
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,680
financial figures around these incidents

1112
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,960
like how it is

1113
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,040
the problem is that like uh

1114
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,040
not all companies actually disclose this

1115
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,680
sometimes companies can disclose the

1116
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,680
okay we have a breach or we have an

1117
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,599
attack but we won't disclose how it

1118
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:42,319
happened we won't disclose how many

1119
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:44,480
financial losses we have

1120
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,400
like i guess

1121
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,000
we can't keep it a secret we are not

1122
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,400
critical infrastructure we basically

1123
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,200
absolutely so unfortunately like uh in

1124
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,119
uh

1125
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:58,240
do like unfortunately lack of data

1126
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,760
here okay okay so this means that they

1127
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,040
uh

1128
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,880
they are rarely public companies and

1129
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,440
they rarely have insurance

1130
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,319
for this but i guess public uh this

1131
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:12,880
information became public in cases when

1132
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,440
there are like court uh

1133
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,440
cases

1134
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,280
in public in terms of they they have uh

1135
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,240
they are traded in the exchange so in

1136
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,680
this case they just have to disclose

1137
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,440
they must according to laws and

1138
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,720
regulations

1139
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,880
okay okay so if they are hard uh if they

1140
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,599
are large enough uh

1141
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:38,240
we can know if they if they are not

1142
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,680
there is no way

1143
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,200
yes

1144
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,599
okay the last question i promise do you

1145
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:45,599
think that companies may implement some

1146
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:46,880
attacks to

1147
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,960
shift the focus to their new game

1148
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,119
really interesting hiking mentality

1149
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:56,079
right here okay what do you think

1150
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:58,160
can they do that in order to do some

1151
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,839
marketing hype

1152
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:02,960
i don't think so to be honest losses are

1153
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,240
like

1154
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,800
considering how much time and resources

1155
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,920
may be spent to create this game

1156
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,160
yeah actual like uh

1157
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,680
public exploitation of it doesn't sound

1158
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,119
right

1159
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:20,800
and don't have image marketing around it

1160
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,359
this won't help

1161
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:25,440
okay okay i will i always want to

1162
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,800
connect to the game which were

1163
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,599
compromised recently

1164
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:31,040
main selling point

1165
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,079
yeah

1166
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:35,760
very logical approach yeah this

1167
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,040
i didn't stop play cyberpunk

1168
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,280
when they got hacked really

1169
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,079
why

1170
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:44,160
oh i'm not on pc i don't play games on

1171
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,440
pcs because

1172
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,680
yeah it's too much risk

1173
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:52,079
but console why not what can they steal

1174
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:54,240
okay okay but it it makes it makes

1175
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,240
perfect point thank you thank you this

1176
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,160
is a really really cool question and uh

1177
