welcome to uh to ukrainian cyber

27
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,640
conference and thanks for finding the

28
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,799
finding the time to speak with us

29
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,560
absolutely

30
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,159
um

31
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,159
to start this we wanted to ask a

32
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,840
question which i think will be fairly

33
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,520
familiar to you and will probably ring

34
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,560
some bells um and basically it goes

35
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,080
tell us what you're passionate about

36
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,920
what kind of problems you like to so to

37
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,840
work on and to solve and what made you

38
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,680
choose your previous projects and how

39
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,920
they went

40
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,720
um

41
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,119
that's a lot um

42
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,960
what i'm passionate about right now

43
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,399
actually is

44
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,200
is models i'm really passionate about

45
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,479
simplifying

46
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,079
ways of understanding the world

47
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,240
for really hard problems especially

48
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,479
something like human meaning

49
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,920
right so if you're if you're trying to

50
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,479
figure out why somebody is unhappy or

51
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,119
why large groups of people are unhappy

52
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,000
is there a model for how reality works

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
or how meaning works that you could put

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,560
together to build a methodology similar

55
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,959
to a web testing methodology

56
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,000
that allow you to to be more happy so

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,160
that that's kind of a big project that i

58
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,680
think about right now

59
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,640
um

60
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,200
how do i choose projects

61
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,800
um

62
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,280
i guess i choose projects based on

63
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,120
how ambitious they are but also how

64
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,800
practical they are and i look for a

65
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,360
meeting in between

66
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,680
great uh so without a blink daniel went

67
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,000
straight into into the answer um

68
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
basically it was kind of also as a joke

69
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,080
question because to those who don't know

70
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,519
who done

71
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,319
his blog uh this is exactly the question

72
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,000
that daniel recommends as a best

73
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,200
interview question when you uh hire uh

74
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,200
cyber security professionals because it

75
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,720
kind of brings the person and their

76
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,400
true self right to

77
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,360
to the front and uh helps to highlight

78
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,800
you know their their passion their

79
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,200
interests interests and uh what they

80
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,280
really uh what they really want to do so

81
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,200
we thought this is going to be a great

82
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,319
start to

83
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,800
kind of describe what you know what you

84
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,560
care the most about

85
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,760
and uh

86
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,879
you've been in cyber security uh

87
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,120
industry for for multiple decades now

88
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,959
right but i think it's fair to say that

89
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,480
right now it's probably

90
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,799
as hard as never before and uh

91
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,280
popularity kind of continues to

92
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,440
to rise we have a lot of uh cyber

93
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,760
security courses in universities youtube

94
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,799
videos

95
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,680
plenty of materials and still we have

96
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,159
shortage of workforce at least we feel

97
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,000
it definitely in ukraine i think us has

98
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,480
the same the same problem

99
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,640
it's still pretty hard to find uh good

100
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,519
uh

101
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,920
good uh professionals do you expect this

102
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,560
to to get worse to get better basically

103
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,319
what's your what's your thoughts on

104
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,680
career in infosec for the next decade

105
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,000
yeah i i think it's gonna get better

106
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,480
only because it has to i think what will

107
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,920
essentially happen is kind of what

108
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,599
happened to nursing

109
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,400
where

110
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,480
everything was like four-year degree

111
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,319
required rn

112
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,799
and now it's become oh well i guess you

113
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,799
could be an x-ray tech

114
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,478
i guess you could be

115
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,720
someone who officially helps the x-ray

116
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,600
tech

117
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,639
if you do a certain uh certification so

118
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,240
i think what's going to happen is the

119
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,479
industry is going to realize that

120
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,400
skills and four-year degrees don't

121
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,080
necessarily correlate

122
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,560
and they're going to start opening it up

123
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,560
to people who have who have talent or

124
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,560
people who get certification in another

125
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,680
way

126
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,680
um and i do i do think it's going to get

127
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,120
better and i also think there's probably

128
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,120
going to be some government programs

129
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,919
that just pour a lot of money into this

130
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,360
to get people more um

131
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,160
more more people into the industry

132
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,479
yeah i think it also would help

133
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:55,520
if

134
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,600
there would be more kind of standard

135
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,520
practices like in in construction for

136
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,320
example right there are typically uh

137
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,639
very well defined procedures of how to

138
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,039
do things and i think in in security

139
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,960
we're lacking that so even to do

140
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,960
something very simple or a simple

141
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,039
something that's been done billions time

142
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,039
before just to build a website you still

143
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,880
need a professional to to actually

144
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,479
ensure that it is secure there is

145
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,800
nothing that you can pick off uh uh pick

146
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,759
up from the shelf and and have it uh

147
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,039
working for you unless it's like very um

148
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,720
most of the time like the hostess

149
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,199
solutions don't exactly um

150
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,360
either don't meet the expectations or

151
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,120
they're very um

152
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,360
not very secure themselves

153
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,639
so hopefully yeah maybe this will help

154
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,000
yeah the the other thing i would say

155
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,240
about this industry is that it's so

156
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,960
young and it's so dynamic it

157
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,639
it's quite interesting so you can have

158
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,880
somebody who

159
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,560
drops out of college or doesn't go to

160
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,919
college or they're still in high school

161
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:54,960
or whatever

162
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,319
and they start messing around with bug

163
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,000
bounties

164
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,039
and

165
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,520
in six months they get a few bucks and

166
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,039
they're having fun

167
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,960
and they start writing articles they get

168
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,479
a twitter account

169
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,800
they start putting content on youtube in

170
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,720
about a year and a half they're an

171
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,560
industry expert

172
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,000
right they learned they taught

173
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,440
themselves networking they taught

174
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,360
themselves some programming

175
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,600
they've got a bunch of videos on youtube

176
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,840
explaining how to do hacking

177
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,800
and

178
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,880
they have a public website and they're

179
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,120
known for finding bugs in all these big

180
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,880
programs

181
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,639
they have jumped ahead

182
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,280
10 to 15 years in their career

183
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,039
right yeah

184
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,639
whereas you could have someone else who

185
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,639
doesn't do any of those things

186
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,759
has a masters in cyber security

187
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,520
they get no traction whatsoever they

188
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,759
can't get interviews

189
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,720
right

190
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,000
and they definitely can't pass

191
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,759
interviews and land a job

192
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,759
so the disconnect between those are so

193
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,599
stark right

194
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:54,400
and

195
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,080
here's the other thing that we don't

196
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,240
have as an early industry

197
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,960
we don't have a pipeline

198
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,199
so if you look at the military nobody

199
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,840
comes in the military and starts in the

200
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,840
middle or at the top

201
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,160
yeah and you can't actually cheat

202
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,120
right

203
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,440
there is a set methodology you must

204
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,440
start at the bottom

205
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,840
and it's the same as like in old times

206
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,120
where it's like oh you're going to be a

207
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,639
woodworker you're going to be a stone

208
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,599
worker

209
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,599
you have to start in the beginning you

210
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,680
train with someone who knows it and they

211
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,520
move you through the steps in a methyl

212
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,440
according to a methodology

213
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,160
that gets you to the later stages and it

214
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,520
guarantees that you've done all the

215
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,520
steps before and it's basically a

216
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,919
formalized process and it's super

217
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:40,960
efficient

218
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,120
at getting people into the system

219
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,599
and we don't have that in security

220
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,840
um

221
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,599
yeah and you have a whole bunch of

222
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,120
hiring managers

223
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,639
who

224
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,120
need somebody at the third or fourth

225
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,120
level let's say it's one through ten

226
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,879
they they need somebody at the third or

227
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,160
fourth level

228
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,000
they can't use somebody at the one and

229
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,599
two level

230
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,360
the one and two level

231
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,520
are saying there's no jobs

232
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,039
and the hiring managers are saying

233
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,960
there's no people

234
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,960
so that's where the disconnect is the

235
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,560
the ramp is not

236
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,720
gradual enough

237
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,039
yeah absolutely and uh but like you said

238
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,960
hopefully over time because it's a new

239
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,440
industry hopefully over time this will

240
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,840
improve and we'll have more defined uh

241
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,479
passes and processes for for cyber

242
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,958
security careers um

243
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,880
but what the next thing that we're

244
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,559
wondering about is

245
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,559
uh with advancement of technologies

246
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,320
right sometimes it doesn't go exactly as

247
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,039
planned and

248
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,360
what we want to find out is what do you

249
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,680
think about the largest menace to cyber

250
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,040
security profession in light of

251
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,519
automation and machine learning and all

252
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,040
this stuff all the concerns that you

253
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,680
know some of the jobs um get uh replaced

254
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,600
by automation and so on i'll try to

255
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,920
avoid like the ai uh buzzword because

256
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,399
it's really hard to even define ai we'll

257
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,240
we would need to get into that so i'll

258
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,680
just use machine learning but i guess

259
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,920
you know you understand what they mean

260
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,839
so what's your thought on this will we

261
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,120
um or will a big part of

262
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,560
cyber security professionals will be

263
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,120
affected by uh advancement in machine

264
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,519
learning and these algorithms

265
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,600
yeah well first i've got a great

266
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,440
definition for you i i think you'll love

267
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,959
for ai

268
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,880
it's uh the ability for a machine to do

269
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,120
a thing that could only be done before

270
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,200
by a human

271
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,839
what's amazing about that definition

272
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,519
is that it keeps moving

273
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,240
and that's what happens in reality right

274
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,200
um

275
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,360
before it was pretty much anything back

276
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,760
in the 60s was ai

277
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,040
and now

278
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,959
they keep moving the bar because as soon

279
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,880
as something is able to be done by

280
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,240
computer they say well that's not what i

281
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,000
meant i meant something else

282
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,600
yes but larry definition absolutely um

283
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,519
so

284
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,440
i would say that the biggest threats to

285
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,040
cyber security people it's actually the

286
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,839
same threat to any knowledge worker

287
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,200
is if you're not flexible enough to

288
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,519
[Music]

289
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,800
think about the tech and the

290
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,600
implementation but also think about the

291
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,440
purpose and the meaning of the work that

292
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,480
you're doing

293
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,720
so you have to be able to formulate a

294
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,920
problem

295
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,240
and formulate an answer

296
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,880
uh as a knowledge worker and as an id

297
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,200
person and as a security person

298
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,880
so the more that you could do both of

299
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,640
those things the more safe you're going

300
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,600
to be

301
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,160
right because

302
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,880
if you can't find new problems

303
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,680
and understand new problems

304
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,560
then you're going to be forced to be in

305
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,640
the implementation pool and you will be

306
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,000
competing with automation directly

307
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,959
right

308
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,360
and uh what do you think so yeah of

309
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,440
course given the right skill set it

310
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,200
there is a way for people i guess to to

311
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,200
stay in front of

312
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,279
of the development because

313
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,640
at the end of the day we are the ones

314
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,399
who are developing the machine learning

315
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,160
and all these algorithms so if

316
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,920
if you're one of those or or close to

317
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,600
them right you should be fine

318
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,680
uh which part of the industry do you

319
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,079
think is going to be affected uh by this

320
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,399
first though because obviously some some

321
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,880
people will or some fields some parts of

322
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,120
the field will be affected first and

323
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,560
others will be barely damaged

324
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,079
yeah

325
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,359
it's hard to say um

326
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,040
i do think there's a tremendous

327
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,880
opportunity in

328
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,640
incident response

329
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,720
because it's kind of the it's kind of

330
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,760
the uh

331
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,480
most important part of security in some

332
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,440
senses

333
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,600
it's like are we being hacked that's a

334
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,440
huge question right

335
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,240
uh it's very strange though because

336
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,480
there's such a lack of people in

337
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,000
incident response

338
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,200
and

339
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,160
that

340
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,680
there's lots more room for people to

341
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,720
come in

342
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,720
but incident response

343
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,560
this is going to sound strange but it's

344
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,560
kind of similar to

345
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,079
customer service

346
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,839
in the sense that

347
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,600
everybody needs it

348
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,200
and it's hard to do well at scale

349
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,959
and those are exactly the types of

350
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,680
problems that ai is good at

351
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,120
because it doesn't need to solve the

352
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,880
problem

353
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,920
uh

354
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,680
multiple times it could

355
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,360
for certain situations it can solve the

356
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,200
problem once and apply it across the

357
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,680
scale now obviously lots of different

358
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,800
threats are different different

359
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,560
companies are different so there's a

360
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,000
limit to this

361
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
but

362
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,680
i think you're going to see machine

363
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,720
learning

364
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,120
applied to incident response more

365
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,399
specifically

366
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,720
looking at tons and tons of data

367
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,000
and then doing

368
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,320
higher and higher level stuff so

369
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,880
right now today we're

370
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,000
below basically a level one analyst

371
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,839
when you look at what ai could do for

372
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,360
incident response

373
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,200
it could do basic pattern matching i

374
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,600
mean it's not even

375
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,639
well

376
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,839
it's barely ml right it's it's barely

377
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,000
showing you stuff that only a ai could

378
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,240
do mostly but

379
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,800
yeah as it moves up into like the level

380
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,560
one analyst

381
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,279
that's a lot of jobs that just got

382
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,880
uh became less necessary right

383
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,639
and

384
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,079
here's the interesting thing about it

385
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,480
that the ml doesn't get tired

386
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,079
and you could just give it more and more

387
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,720
data and it will do the job the same way

388
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,519
each time right it's kind of similar to

389
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,480
staring at the sky looking at stars

390
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,480
and you can ask that ml

391
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,800
which one is a meteor

392
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,360
that might be coming towards earth

393
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,480
um

394
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,920
you can't really do that to humans

395
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,000
because they can only look for so long

396
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,680
their eyes get tired

397
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,440
their attention wonders

398
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,199
and it's the same with incident response

399
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,000
so

400
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,240
if you start to see it move from level

401
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,560
one and now it moves into what a level

402
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,480
two analyst can do

403
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,720
that would be a huge jump but that would

404
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,519
be

405
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,240
another map that's most people in

406
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,920
incident responses like level one or

407
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,120
level two

408
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,360
now how long before it gets into like a

409
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,440
tier three or tier four that'll probably

410
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,120
be quite some time

411
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,519
but most of the problem is at level one

412
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,079
and level two so i i think if ml can

413
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,760
cross that barrier

414
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,000
those two barriers

415
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,360
it's going to have a major impact on

416
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,720
security

417
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,399
interesting for me i actually thought

418
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,279
that maybe a bug bounty would be quite

419
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,120
affected by this because if you think

420
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,519
about it first of all we have a growing

421
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,079
database of uh you know

422
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,399
analysis and results and reports and all

423
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,240
this stuff so there's plenty of data to

424
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,120
analyze at the same time we have we see

425
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,519
like advancement in analysis tools

426
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,240
static analysis like various um you know

427
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,399
automated things so there's less and

428
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,399
less low-hanging fruits so i was

429
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,560
thinking it would be over time with

430
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,920
advancement of these tools and

431
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,079
algorithms it would be harder and harder

432
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,920
to get into bug bounty because you would

433
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,920
only need to find some very kind of

434
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,000
complicated um

435
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,680
bugs that need kind of cross-domain

436
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,800
knowledge and and all the stuff um and

437
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,000
the the more

438
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,040
um

439
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,320
the the more these tools uh advance the

440
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,560
the less opportunities there will be for

441
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,279
for bug hunters i did uh just

442
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,040
i have cryptography background and i did

443
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,199
a little bit of uh um cryptography

444
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,560
audits and in my little experience it's

445
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,320
rarely some complicated cryptography or

446
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,639
mass-related bug most of the time people

447
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,639
would be saved by just at least running

448
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,399
static analyzer on their code because

449
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,320
it's usually memory management or

450
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,519
something like that

451
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,839
what are you thinking about

452
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:40,959
that yeah

453
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,759
i think that's right

454
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,839
the question is does that need ml or

455
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,279
does that just need

456
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,440
visibility into the data where you can

457
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,440
run to basically fn

458
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,399
right

459
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,399
how much could something like semgrep

460
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,240
for example i don't know if you've ever

461
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,800
seen this tool it's it's fantastic it's

462
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,639
basically universal

463
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:01,839
uh

464
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,320
search language uh

465
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,279
platform

466
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,639
so

467
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,480
you use something like semgrap and you

468
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,160
just look at more and more data i think

469
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,360
you're going to be able to find those

470
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,519
patterns i i think that's the general

471
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,360
rule is that ml

472
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,240
and

473
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,560
that type of analysis really benefits

474
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,320
when you have total exposure to lots of

475
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,600
different stuff

476
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,639
um

477
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,639
one thing i think ml might be able to

478
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:25,600
help with

479
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,040
let's say

480
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,959
you know china was attacking the us and

481
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,360
the u.s was attacking china which

482
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,959
is not theoretical it's probably

483
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,560
happening or we know what's happened to

484
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,519
that

485
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,079
but but let's say that um you're

486
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,959
evaluating all the attack surface data

487
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,120
for every service every port that was

488
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,160
open

489
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,720
uh everything right and

490
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,839
you wanted to know what should i go

491
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,120
after right

492
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,759
you could potentially do something like

493
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,240
a supervised learning type situation

494
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,040
uh and rate the tears of vulnerability

495
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,519
in order to prioritize

496
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,680
uh what a small attack team should go

497
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,720
after

498
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,359
and so if you're looking at terabytes of

499
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,760
open port data and service data and

500
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,599
version data it might be able to

501
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,839
prioritize for you you should go after

502
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,559
this because it's definitely vulnerable

503
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,400
so i think

504
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,240
i think that is probably another space

505
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,319
uh basically attack and defense because

506
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,000
defense would run the same thing on

507
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,199
themselves

508
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,039
and then focus on that for remediation

509
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,960
got it um

510
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,400
it's it's cool that you actually

511
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,080
attached to you know nation states and

512
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,880
uh um more kind of

513
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,360
geopolitical spectrum but uh we'll we'll

514
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,880
get to that shortly and before the next

515
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,880
question i'd like to remind that uh uh

516
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,240
our viewers are welcome to pose

517
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,400
questions for daniel either in zoom chat

518
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,799
or on youtube and we'll try to get to

519
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,200
them in the end i suspect the next

520
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,120
question may uh you know support some

521
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,679
reaction and and some questions

522
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,400
uh we wanted to talk about uh some

523
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,400
problems or issues that are

524
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,960
you know uh bothering ukrainian citizens

525
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,120
at the moment and uh

526
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,400
one of these is actually um some

527
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,559
web portal and uh at the same time a

528
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,720
mobile app called dia which roughly

529
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,559
translates to translates to english as

530
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,520
action and this is a effort by the

531
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,760
government to provide uh more online

532
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,679
service and more governmental services

533
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,120
available online um but also since march

534
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,360
2021 ukrainian parliament adopted the

535
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,240
bill equating the digital identity

536
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,160
documents uploaded to this application

537
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,080
uh with their physical analog so

538
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,240
basically now you can upload id cards

539
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,799
passports some other documents and and

540
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,559
use it as if as if you would have a

541
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,080
passport in you which is of course

542
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,919
convenient but

543
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:44,799
uh

544
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,880
to a security-minded person right the

545
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,960
first thing that comes to mind are

546
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,720
usually the negative scenarios like what

547
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,880
can go wrong and what can what that can

548
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,120
happen with with this approach um

549
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,200
ukrainian cybersecurity community is of

550
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,000
course

551
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,520
concerned about this and there are split

552
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,200
opinions some

553
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,520
believe there is a way to to do it right

554
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,280
they just disagree with how it's been

555
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,080
done

556
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,080
some people say like you shouldn't just

557
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,760
be doing it at all because there is no

558
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,120
ways to do it securely uh what are

559
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,000
thoughts on on basically the idea you

560
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,720
know of putting something that had

561
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,360
always been uh just a physical document

562
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,240
id cards passwords and sensitive

563
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,000
information and documents like that into

564
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,919
on the hands of uh

565
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,880
you know basically in our phones and uh

566
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,480
making everything available online

567
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,440
turning it electronic

568
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,559
yeah so

569
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,280
to me it really depends on the context

570
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,880
the time and place

571
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,000
of society right if you ask me

572
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,520
and i'm thinking about star trek the

573
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,679
next generation my answer my answer is

574
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:48,640
100

575
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,160
let's get it all online that's the

576
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,360
future

577
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,880
obviously this is the direction we

578
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,480
should be going

579
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,360
um

580
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,799
i i find myself highly informed by

581
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,880
donald trump and batman

582
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,960
when it comes to this okay

583
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,840
so

584
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,799
so essentially i remember when obama was

585
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,159
talking about doing a bunch of this

586
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,799
stuff or his administration or whatever

587
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,799
and i was like yeah that sounds amazing

588
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,159
and everyone's like no you don't want

589
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,919
the government to have it i'm like no

590
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,000
that's stupid right

591
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,480
well then trump came in

592
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,640
and i realized hey wait a minute

593
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,360
if you give all the power to somebody

594
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,600
you don't know who's going to be next

595
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,320
and they will have all that access right

596
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,200
um

597
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,039
and the same sort of situation happened

598
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,039
i don't remember i'm not a batman fan

599
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,039
but it was the one with uh morgan

600
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,320
freeman

601
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,840
where uh

602
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,440
they built that system that could

603
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,360
capture all the data

604
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,280
and batman was like yeah we have to use

605
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,080
this to solve terrorism and uh the guy

606
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,559
had to blow it up because he didn't want

607
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,320
that thing to exist because it was too

608
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,559
powerful right and you merge those

609
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:55,919
together

610
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,600
and now you have everyone's identity in

611
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,760
one place and one app you have all the

612
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,840
stuff it's extremely powerful it's

613
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,240
extremely useful to citizens

614
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,559
when used correctly the problem is you

615
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,880
don't know who will be in charge of that

616
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,880
and whether it will be used as a tool or

617
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,159
as a weapon

618
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:13,840
so

619
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,360
if you don't know what the future looks

620
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,880
like in terms of leadership or

621
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,440
geopolitical stability

622
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,760
then

623
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,320
i become more and more cautious of

624
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,720
building powerful things because i

625
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,240
assume that they will be used as weapons

626
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,280
and the more i feel stable and safe the

627
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,440
more i i want to centralize that kind of

628
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,440
stuff so

629
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,400
i'm not an expert on ukraine by any uh

630
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,840
stretch so

631
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,080
i don't know the answer to that i do

632
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,200
know that

633
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,919
the us feels a lot less stable

634
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,840
europe feels a lot less stable

635
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,400
so i i would tend to probably feel less

636
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,360
stable

637
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,520
about bringing everything together into

638
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,360
a centralized place right now just

639
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,080
because it doesn't feel great

640
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,200
yeah that's actually a good point

641
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,280
because i think when people in ukraine

642
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,120
think about possible threats related to

643
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,159
this they mostly think of you know

644
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,880
attackers outside of uh or stress

645
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,360
outside of government right but

646
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,120
also like you said when you bring

647
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,440
everything like that centralized

648
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,760
the government itself or some people in

649
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,799
it can also uh they also get much more

650
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,200
power and and uh

651
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,200
tools kind of to to to do whatever

652
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,720
depending on what the services are and

653
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,960
what the features of the application

654
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,360
are and i was actually when i was

655
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,159
preparing my and and before kind of

656
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:37,679
uh

657
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,320
we had this uh these conversations uh on

658
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,039
the right uh with zlatan podcast and and

659
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,400
other places um my main point was that

660
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,640
well a lot of very well developed

661
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,520
countries in terms of um cyber security

662
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,679
uh fields right so there is much more

663
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,520
cyber security professionals in the us

664
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,000
than there are in ukraine uh we had like

665
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,679
only what vlad said like 50 cissps

666
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,280
recently and just like a decade ago we

667
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,760
had like pretty much none um

668
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,200
and

669
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,880
basically the main point that these

670
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,640
countries do not do something like that

671
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,039
and ukraine does and there seems to be

672
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,280
like miss you know mismatching in terms

673
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,840
of uh capabilities and what's been done

674
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,840
uh but recently we actually discovered

675
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,960
that

676
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,120
apple is doing something similar in some

677
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,919
states uh uh in the us where you can

678
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,240
upload your driver's license to iphone

679
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,480
and uh use i'm not sure if it's equating

680
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,640
to the probably it's not equating to the

681
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,039
like physical document but uh from what

682
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,880
i've read you can show it uh when you

683
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,880
board the plane and stuff like that so i

684
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,880
guess people are moving in in this

685
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,880
direction but uh

686
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,480
yeah right now

687
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,320
like we speak spoke in previous

688
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,120
questions uh right there is no

689
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,559
good kind of established means of uh

690
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,120
implementing these scenes securely and

691
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,880
to me it seems like the

692
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,080
um

693
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,360
the surface and the threat is just

694
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,039
possibly not manageable right now maybe

695
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,480
a little bit later and we should work on

696
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,720
that but right now it seems like

697
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,559
um there are a lot of things that can go

698
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,640
wrong with it uh but that's just my

699
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,640
opinion do you see that happening in the

700
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,400
u.s any time soon

701
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,000
i think you would want in the future

702
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
right but right now do you think this is

703
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,360
a good time to

704
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,120
um

705
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,600
to move this forward and try to work to

706
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,720
get this done

707
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,720
i i do think it's a good time to move it

708
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,320
forward i don't think it's likely to

709
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,679
happen right now because we're kind of

710
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,679
fragmenting so it's

711
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,279
the ability to do this is slowing down

712
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,159
not speeding up um

713
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,600
but i do think it's a little bit

714
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,200
different when a private company does it

715
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,520
rather than the government itself

716
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,320
and

717
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,039
in the us there's obviously this this

718
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,200
separation between states and federal so

719
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,679
there's a lot of drama around federal

720
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,200
policies like this

721
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,880
i think another big thing just for

722
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,720
building a system like this is like

723
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,559
who's building it is it a bunch of cyber

724
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,000
security experts

725
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,600
or is it the actual like the dmv like

726
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,919
the the non-experts who issue driver's

727
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,240
licenses are they collecting all this

728
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,559
data about every single citizen and

729
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,120
putting it into some unsecured system

730
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,760
because what that really ends up being i

731
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,080
mean we've had a million different

732
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,480
places get popped in the u.s that were

733
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,640
government organizations that had very

734
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,840
sensitive data opm is the worst one it

735
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,080
was a list of every single most

736
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,520
sensitive document that you tell all

737
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,760
your dirty secrets you have to tell the

738
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,840
government before you get a security

739
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,880
clearance

740
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,600
that database was stolen by china

741
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,480
so

742
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,520
what you face in ukraine is

743
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,360
somebody who's not competent to secure

744
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,840
the system they collect all the data

745
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:50,080
essentially for russia or china to steal

746
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,760
and that's just what's going to happen

747
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,919
if it's not built by experts even if it

748
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,440
is built by experts it could still be

749
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,000
attacked but that that's the danger of

750
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,080
centralization is just making a lot

751
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,480
easier for your enemies

752
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,760
right and uh you we touched uh the the

753
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,240
topic of kind of cyber politics um

754
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,640
already a few times but uh generally

755
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,320
just wondering what uh

756
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,559
since you think about cyber politics in

757
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,799
warfare a lot right uh and uh often

758
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,600
compared to like military tactics and

759
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,120
um

760
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,320
this kind of makes this question

761
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,919
inevitable right with everything going

762
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:26,080
on on the intersection of cyber and jail

763
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,840
politics right now what do you think

764
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,520
would be the best case and the worst

765
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,559
case scenarios um for the near future

766
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,799
maybe for a decade or two um not

767
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,120
necessarily in ukraine or we of course

768
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,919
have our own kind of issues right uh

769
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,919
russia airplane and all the stuff but uh

770
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,279
generally worldwide what do you think

771
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,520
yeah best case is we have all these

772
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,279
small skirmishes

773
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:52,080
kind of pick up and continue and they

774
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,840
stay small

775
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,880
and

776
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,840
economies continue to link and become so

777
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,320
strong together

778
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,960
that cyber attacks become elevated to

779
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,640
the point of

780
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,039
kinetic attacks and people stop doing

781
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,640
them because it's too dangerous to their

782
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,000
economy

783
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,320
that's the best case scenario worst case

784
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,120
scenario is the economies break off from

785
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,440
each other and isolate

786
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,559
and people start using cyber as a proxy

787
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:21,919
for kinetic

788
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,200
and they just start getting really

789
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,799
aggressive and start taking each other

790
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,480
offline and we basically have

791
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,039
like actual warfare

792
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,360
in the cyber world which then obviously

793
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,760
correlates to kinetic versions

794
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,200
um

795
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,039
unfortunately i think we're a little bit

796
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:39,919
uh

797
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,679
likely to head down the second path at

798
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,840
least short term

799
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,960
um

800
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,320
i don't know i don't think too much

801
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,799
about that but i definitely know what

802
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,559
the good version looks like

803
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,200
the bad version can go multiple ways

804
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,200
so in your opinion the good basically

805
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,720
this equilibrium of like similar

806
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,240
situation we have with nuclear weapons

807
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,840
where like

808
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,600
none nobody's doing it just because

809
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,679
they're afraid of retaliation that's the

810
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,440
best case scenario for for the cyber

811
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,600
world as well

812
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,080
um no it's not so much nuclear weapon

813
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,840
because that's like a one or a zero and

814
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,679
it's like really bad if it happens i'm

815
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,679
thinking more along the lines of

816
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,159
people don't consider cyber right now to

817
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:19,120
be

818
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,679
on par with kinetic

819
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,919
right

820
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,320
so it's kind of tolerated

821
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,799
and hopefully as we mature

822
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,360
and we're able to detect them and do

823
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,279
better attribution

824
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,440
then over time it'll be like

825
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,919
it's really not allowed and everyone can

826
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,880
see if it happens and it's more noticed

827
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,799
it would be more like troop movements on

828
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:46,240
a border where it would be on the news

829
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,880
and and people would be like okay don't

830
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,880
don't ever do that again so it would

831
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,640
kind of stop because it would become

832
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,760
more visible and more unacceptable

833
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,640
right

834
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,520
um we already touched uh the topic of

835
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,600
privacy as well like you said there are

836
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,679
there were some very sensitive breaches

837
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,080
and uh actually recently you had a essay

838
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,720
on a blog po on your blog uh a future

839
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,159
without privacy um which so far we seems

840
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,159
to be on track for predictions outlined

841
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,600
there uh after the xfx and and uh other

842
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,480
sensitive documents that that leaked um

843
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,039
i think it became clear over time that

844
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,200
the way forward is uh basically instead

845
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,159
of trying to uh protect the the data

846
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,720
right we just need to shift uh our mind

847
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,279
to building systems that don't rely on

848
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,279
security by you know just discovering

849
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:38,159
some data about you uh but that concerns

850
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,640
mostly kind of authorization and access

851
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,279
control uh privacy is not only about

852
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:44,799
access control though it's also about

853
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:47,440
safety reputation you know just general

854
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,159
persons comfort and and well-being

855
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,360
um so as we continue moving in this

856
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,760
future without privacy and say we can

857
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,240
build some measures um to you know

858
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,200
safeguard against tax uh

859
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,799
tax returns being

860
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,440
hijacked by people who discover ssn and

861
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,600
stuff like that say we we solved that

862
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,399
part

863
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,159
but how can we solve

864
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:11,279
um

865
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,440
leakage of other personal data that you

866
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,440
can't really even avoid of sharing with

867
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,480
the world nowadays practically uh right

868
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,120
whether it's medical data or just your

869
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,120
personal personal things that you don't

870
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,120
wanna don't wanna be shared anything

871
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,279
that kind of you know leaks in the world

872
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:28,880
it doesn't necessarily cause financial

873
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,480
damage to you but

874
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,640
it's still it's still a distress to

875
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,039
people um how can we

876
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,640
do do you think there is a way to to

877
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,480
fight that back and somehow come up with

878
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,840
a solution to

879
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,600
to solve this

880
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,760
i don't think so

881
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,600
and the reason i don't think so is

882
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,000
because

883
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:51,760
it's a little bit of a uh

884
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,640
misnomer or a misunderstanding so i

885
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,960
think everyone's data is being massively

886
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,320
shared like i i feel like stolen data on

887
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,720
a dark web is like five percent above

888
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,120
the surface and then

889
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,440
legitimately when i say legitimate i

890
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,720
mean legally shared data is the other 95

891
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,640
under the surface so you have all these

892
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,880
data brokers they know way more about

893
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,799
you than the entire dark web put

894
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,760
together and their information is in a

895
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,039
perfect database perfectly organized

896
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,600
it's maintained every single day

897
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,840
it's constantly it has all these feeds

898
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,559
it has people working there who

899
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,399
get coffee in the morning

900
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:36,240
they have a parking lot they have a 401k

901
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,640
right it's completely legal they have

902
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,960
lobbyists in washington right so you

903
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,039
have this massive data

904
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,440
and it's being shared to all the sister

905
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,840
companies

906
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,120
excuse me

907
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,360
no problem it's being shared like

908
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,640
everywhere

909
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,559
and it's just being passed around via

910
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,480
apis and being sold to all these

911
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,919
different companies

912
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,559
and the reason that this will continue

913
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:10,000
is because our experiences online are so

914
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,120
awesome

915
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,880
people love

916
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,679
i mean i'm amazed i i hate facebook but

917
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:18,399
i love facebook ads

918
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:21,039
when i go to facebook and i get an ad

919
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,440
i'm like okay yeah i do want to try

920
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,279
these pants that

921
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:27,120
uh look like jeans but they don't fit

922
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,480
like jeans

923
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,720
how did you know that i want that

924
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,519
every single thing that they recommend

925
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,600
is like amazing

926
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,320
and uh all the convenience like all the

927
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,000
stuff i have in my house for like

928
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,919
automation and stuff

929
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,080
so much of that is powered by data

930
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,240
people will not give that up they will

931
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,399
not give that up they will continue

932
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,559
asking for the features that require

933
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,080
more and more data and pretty soon it's

934
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,200
going to be like

935
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,120
tell me about all your private thoughts

936
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,519
because then we'll make whatever this

937
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,840
other thing even better and you'll be

938
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,480
like oh sure let me upload that to you

939
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,240
and that'll go right to the data brokers

940
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,679
and that'll be shared and now your

941
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,960
facebook ads will be even better so

942
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,320
if you imagine the 95

943
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,799
of your data being shared legally

944
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,480
then

945
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,480
there's going to be some small piece of

946
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,519
exhaust where those companies get popped

947
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,440
or they have a leak or they leave

948
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,360
something on s3

949
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,360
and that gets take taken to the dark web

950
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,720
but as soon as it goes to the dark web

951
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,200
it gets stale right the real version is

952
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,120
in these legitimate systems

953
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,640
and until people actually put their own

954
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,880
privacy above their own features this

955
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,880
will never stop and that won't ever

956
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,080
happen

957
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,679
people will always like the features

958
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,480
more than the the security so i don't

959
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,320
think there's any way to stop

960
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,960
this from happening um

961
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,679
the dark web stuff i mean that that'll

962
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,840
get better as security gets better but

963
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,360
the data will still be out there it'll

964
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,760
just be in legitimate companies

965
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,760
right it's always a trade-off and it

966
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,640
seems like we get more um benefits from

967
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,320
from using technologies than than we

968
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,719
have the the threads uh we have one of

969
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,800
the comments in zoom which uh say can i

970
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,719
refuse with a smile of course refuse

971
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,199
from phone usage exactly like

972
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,879
it's inconvenient right you can refuse

973
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:20,879
from phone usage you can avoid putting

974
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,639
anything online but then you can barely

975
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,239
do anything it's the same like in the

976
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,320
u.s technically you are allowed not to

977
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,560
have passport uh document which is not

978
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,480
the case in ukraine in ukraine like it's

979
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,399
illegal basically in yes you can not

980
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,040
have the id as far as i'm aware but

981
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,399
it's very inconvenient you cannot drive

982
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,800
a car you cannot buy alcohol you you

983
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,239
barely can do anything you can only go

984
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,159
to wyoming and stay and hang out there

985
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,159
for a while

986
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,119
so

987
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,599
but like you said i think the problem is

988
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,199
that a lot of it

989
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,280
is happening not due to um

990
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,960
not only because of like security

991
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,440
breaches and exposures but also legally

992
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,359
and it also boggles my mind how we can

993
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,440
have gdpr and ccpa

994
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,359
in place but at the same time completely

995
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:04,240
legal data brokers um you know still

996
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,119
gathering data without

997
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,359
maybe you would have given consent kind

998
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:11,520
of implicitly without even realizing it

999
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,680
but at least like not no

1000
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,440
you know without your conscious

1001
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,359
decision it kind of was somewhere in the

1002
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:19,680
in the small print so do you think it's

1003
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,040
also a job of improving policies and

1004
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,800
regulations around this and that will

1005
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,880
help to

1006
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,720
kind of take that under control

1007
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,839
um

1008
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:34,000
i'm sure there's some improvement that

1009
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,839
can be made there

1010
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:38,480
but the problem is human nature the

1011
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,880
problem is humans want these features

1012
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,119
that are powered by data brokers

1013
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,760
data brokers are offering a service

1014
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,079
which is to make your ads and your life

1015
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,720
convenient and beautiful

1016
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,680
and

1017
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,680
humans are saying yes i want that

1018
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,960
service

1019
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,040
so there is nothing that is going to get

1020
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,200
in between those two things happening

1021
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,000
right

1022
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,680
that's why

1023
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,599
privacy ultimately is going to hit a

1024
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:04,800
wall

1025
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,839
um

1026
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:07,760
i mean the types of things we should be

1027
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,079
going after are egregious

1028
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,200
like malicious data brokers and you know

1029
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,839
security breaches and and you know dark

1030
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,839
web postings and all that kind of stuff

1031
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:20,079
that'll get removed but that like i said

1032
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,280
that's only five percent of the problem

1033
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,079
right

1034
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:28,240
uh staying on the uh privacy um

1035
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,240
issues right i i guess it's hard to

1036
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,320
avoid this topic as well and i know you

1037
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,560
already voiced some of uh your views on

1038
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,800
the blog as well but just wanted uh to

1039
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,920
still discuss this uh uh for like live

1040
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,160
because it may not affect ukraine as

1041
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,880
much uh but who knows uh basically in

1042
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,760
your essay right on apple and uh child

1043
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,880
safety and story voice concerns that um

1044
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,280
this may cause apple to to lose users

1045
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,280
and market share for many years

1046
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,160
um

1047
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,000
do you still think it's the case because

1048
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,720
from what we see uh typically different

1049
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,280
types of security issues uh data

1050
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,800
breaches and stuff like that don't

1051
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,560
really seem to have

1052
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,480
in the long term at least don't seem to

1053
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,359
affect um the companies financially if

1054
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,520
we look at xfx facebook at the end of

1055
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,680
the day is still doing just fine uh do

1056
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,079
you think uh why do you think apple uh

1057
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,119
would be

1058
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:22,240
different in this case

1059
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,680
um

1060
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,000
well there's kind of a rule about uh

1061
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,960
apple

1062
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,880
you kind of don't talk about things too

1063
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,040
much so i try to try to avoid it a

1064
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,119
little bit but um okay

1065
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,280
what i would say is that

1066
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,400
that company has done extremely well

1067
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,720
at pr and maintaining a very clear

1068
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,920
singular

1069
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,119
narrative

1070
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,440
about security and privacy

1071
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,160
and that i'm not sure they actually made

1072
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,079
a mistake too much

1073
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:53,440
in the tech

1074
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,200
or what they actually did

1075
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,920
but in my mind this was a pr issue there

1076
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,920
was a communication issue and i talked

1077
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,520
about in that post

1078
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,079
what they what people heard versus what

1079
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,680
they should have said

1080
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,560
right if if they had said look everyone

1081
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,000
does this

1082
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,760
and we have avoided doing this for a

1083
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,280
long time

1084
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,680
but now we finally are going to do it

1085
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,520
and here's what it looks like

1086
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,440
i think that would have been fine but

1087
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,200
the way people heard it was that this

1088
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,640
was the first time and they were the

1089
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,040
only ones doing it and it just landed

1090
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,200
really badly so i i do think it will

1091
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,160
probably have an effect

1092
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,320
interesting yeah it's kind of also very

1093
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,240
surprising to me how a company who's

1094
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,240
having pr and marketing to the level

1095
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,400
where they can sell a thousand dollar

1096
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,520
monitor stands and 500 computer 500

1097
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,880
computer wheels right how could they

1098
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,280
misrepresent miss message uh there's

1099
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,160
another feature so much um

1100
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,839
it's kind of surprising but at the same

1101
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,839
time um

1102
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:54,640
and

1103
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,400
just let me know if you don't wanna talk

1104
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,800
about it i was just wondering like

1105
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,920
for a company of this scale typically

1106
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,079
anything that's done right there is some

1107
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:05,839
it always comes down to some economic

1108
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:07,200
incentives and i'm just trying to

1109
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,280
understand why why apple

1110
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,960
uh would be doing this because they

1111
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,520
genuinely think that um you know this

1112
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,560
would help with with safety or

1113
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,480
they considered this feature but it came

1114
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,400
out a little bit different right for

1115
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,640
people it was kind of uh

1116
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,359
people treated as a you know a blow to

1117
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:27,520
the privacy not another feature to the

1118
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,560
privacy what do you think

1119
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,720
um

1120
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,960
yeah so i definitely don't want to speak

1121
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,640
for them and i can't speak for them

1122
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,060
because i'm not there but

1123
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,920
[Music]

1124
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,839
i would say that they generally do

1125
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,520
policies like this because they think

1126
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,119
it's the right thing

1127
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,800
they absolutely

1128
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,720
see it as a problem what was happening

1129
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,040
before so they implement a policy to fix

1130
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,839
it

1131
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,240
um again i i honestly think that this

1132
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,520
was a communication misstep rather than

1133
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,800
a

1134
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,720
policy misstep

1135
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,079
got it i wonder uh would it be

1136
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,800
maybe more convincing for people if uh

1137
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,720
and i'm not sure if this is possible but

1138
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,880
if this would be a little bit more data

1139
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,040
driven uh from the point of like the

1140
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,880
company of saying like

1141
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,880
you know at least exposing some some

1142
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,200
numbers in hey look

1143
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,240
like

1144
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,079
here's how much people will stop from

1145
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:24,560
from doing bad things or uh you know and

1146
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,480
maybe also like how much false positives

1147
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,319
we had or something like that and kind

1148
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:30,000
of be transparent about that do you

1149
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,720
think uh first can they do it uh because

1150
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,400
i'm not aware maybe there is some policy

1151
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,760
that prevents them from doing it or

1152
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,319
anything like that and and uh should

1153
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:40,319
they do it basically to be a little bit

1154
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:42,400
more transparent than like

1155
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,160
if you show people that on average this

1156
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,079
works right just like with any measures

1157
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,440
it's

1158
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,920
barely we have any measures that 100 uh

1159
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,680
proof and correct and always working but

1160
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,280
as long as it's working most of the time

1161
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,000
people are usually okay with it

1162
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,640
yeah i mean the magic that they have

1163
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,800
always had pr wise

1164
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,880
is the ability to

1165
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,200
say don't worry about it we have it

1166
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,200
right it's the idea of like not

1167
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,040
presenting details

1168
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,920
and just making it easy to to trust and

1169
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,400
move on about your life right

1170
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,280
a big part of the the allure

1171
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,520
is to focus on the actual creativity

1172
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,480
that you want to use that you want to do

1173
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,119
and not focus so much on the tools so i

1174
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,280
think it would go against the main

1175
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,119
mantra to present a whole bunch of

1176
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,880
details because then it sort of kicks up

1177
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,640
conversation

1178
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,839
i think

1179
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:36,400
it's kind of the hand wave we have this

1180
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,920
under control we're doing good things

1181
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,200
for you

1182
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,359
and that's what simply did not work this

1183
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:42,240
time

1184
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,440
uh and

1185
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,599
because i just think it was a bad way it

1186
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,200
was communicated

1187
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,839
got it got it thanks um

1188
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:51,040
um

1189
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,599
i guess we we talked uh quite enough

1190
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:56,000
about privacy by this time what am i

1191
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,920
wondering next is basically what it

1192
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,000
allows us to speak right now essentially

1193
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,359
uh is coveted right because uh somehow

1194
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:04,640
we managed to be present at the

1195
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,720
ukrainian uh cyber security conference

1196
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,760
both being in the bay area right now um

1197
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,079
but uh obviously it had

1198
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:14,240
negative and maybe some positive uh

1199
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,240
impact on the industry what do you think

1200
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,920
have been the most notable shift that

1201
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,359
you noticed for uh cyber security uh

1202
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:24,560
kind of caused by the pandemic

1203
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,359
i haven't thought too much about it but

1204
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:30,800
i imagine it's going to be around talent

1205
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,079
i think

1206
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,240
that going more remote

1207
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,119
balances out places like the bay area

1208
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:41,040
versus places like ukraine or

1209
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:45,440
ireland or vietnam right um

1210
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,520
if you have extreme talent

1211
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,400
that um exist anywhere in the planet and

1212
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,480
everyone's on zoom anyway

1213
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,599
i think you just

1214
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:57,440
thomas friedman wrote a book the world

1215
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,640
was flat

1216
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,240
i think it might have been around 2000

1217
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,400
or something and it was kind of early

1218
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,000
but i think it's starting to actually

1219
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,079
happen

1220
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:07,200
so

1221
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,480
i think that's probably going to be the

1222
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,200
biggest impact is people realizing

1223
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,000
that remote workforces are an option

1224
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
and like seriously

1225
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,280
attracting

1226
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,319
and utilizing talent from anywhere

1227
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,319
i wonder how much that will be a

1228
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:24,480
backlash once we go back

1229
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,160
and how much it will go back to the old

1230
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,599
way but

1231
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,920
i feel like some of that will never go

1232
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:30,720
back

1233
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,880
and we will be more open to getting

1234
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,319
people from anywhere

1235
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:37,119
right i think it also drove a lot of

1236
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:39,760
companies to expedite their move from

1237
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,480
perimeter security to uh more uh you

1238
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,000
know zero trust network and all this

1239
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
stuff but just because they had to

1240
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,200
uh just like with remote work as well

1241
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,440
yeah i wonder how much progress they've

1242
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,560
actually made though i i feel like

1243
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,160
people are better about

1244
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,800
starting those projects than actually

1245
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,800
doing them uh

1246
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,119
but no i agree there's at least a lot of

1247
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,040
people thinking about it right now

1248
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,280
yep absolutely it brings brings it to

1249
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,280
the attention did you notice uh since

1250
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,920
you have a podcast and like quite a big

1251
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,720
um audience both in on the blog and in

1252
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,960
the podcast patterns did you notice any

1253
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,119
uh sorry they do notice any change of

1254
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:20,800
patterns in in behavior during the

1255
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,119
epidemic for me for example i typically

1256
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:24,720
would listen to podcasts during the

1257
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,640
commute and now that i don't have that i

1258
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,800
barely listen to any podcast did you

1259
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,160
notice any changes in behavior like that

1260
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,160
um

1261
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,560
not really i think there was a big drop

1262
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,839
in the beginning

1263
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:39,920
not for my show but for a lot of shows

1264
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,079
um

1265
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,839
where they just didn't have that time a

1266
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:45,680
lot of long-form podcasts where you

1267
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,839
actually have multiple people long and

1268
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:49,760
they kind of tell jokes and they venture

1269
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,720
back and forth and that kind of thing

1270
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,720
people didn't have time for that but

1271
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,280
because my thing is like 15 minutes of

1272
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,920
here's just the news it's kind of

1273
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,880
boring and fast but very informative

1274
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,800
i think people kind of stuck with it um

1275
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,920
but uh

1276
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,359
yeah i think that was the big thing that

1277
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,359
i saw

1278
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:14,640
got it and uh now since we uh i talked

1279
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,280
about podcast a little bit you also kind

1280
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,000
of promote the idea of creators uh

1281
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,319
independence from day one uh what do you

1282
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:23,760
think um

1283
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,440
what content do you deem the most

1284
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,119
available and efficient nowadays would

1285
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:29,839
it be podcasts or blogs videos mailing

1286
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:32,560
lists maybe

1287
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,640
yeah i think two things are kind of

1288
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,680
magical right now um newsletters and

1289
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,680
youtube videos

1290
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,440
i i think that's where everything is

1291
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,760
going uh newsletters

1292
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,520
are really powerful because

1293
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,839
they basically take

1294
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:51,680
an expert or an

1295
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,319
influencer really just anybody who you

1296
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:56,400
respect the perspective of and they

1297
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,119
become a filter i love seeing other

1298
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:00,800
people's filters

1299
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,280
i would love to have you know five of my

1300
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,960
smart friends tell me about the same

1301
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,040
exact issue because i hear a different

1302
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,560
thing from each of them

1303
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,160
and that's what's really powerful about

1304
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,680
newsletters and youtube videos are like

1305
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,200
they're better in the blog post they're

1306
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,040
better than a podcast because it

1307
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,800
combines it all together into a

1308
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,079
presentation

1309
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:22,240
and it kind of forces them to be concise

1310
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,240
otherwise people will just leave

1311
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,200
so it's a really powerful medium

1312
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,640
yeah for for something that kind of

1313
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,240
fully brings your attention because

1314
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,680
video you wouldn't be able to watch when

1315
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,680
driving but for something that you can

1316
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,720
spend and focus your uh

1317
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,880
attention to right videos are very

1318
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:39,920
helpful

1319
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,640
do you think um so youtube has very kind

1320
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,960
of stringent um

1321
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,040
decisions when it comes to

1322
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,359
uh you know the algorithm and how they

1323
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:51,839
show videos right so shorter videos

1324
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:54,319
typically work better than longer and

1325
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:55,760
maybe this will change but stuff like

1326
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,000
that do you think um

1327
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,160
it creates a big struggle for content

1328
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,599
creators to

1329
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:03,200
um you know

1330
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,440
it kind of imposes the way they need to

1331
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,760
present uh too much or or do you think

1332
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,720
it's fine

1333
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,640
i i don't really know

1334
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,980
i've not done too much on youtube yet um

1335
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:16,400
[Music]

1336
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,560
i do know it is pretty restrictive but i

1337
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,119
also know that people who thrive there

1338
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:23,119
are finding ways to do it and and to do

1339
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:26,319
it really well um alexander

1340
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:28,640
asked about tick tock

1341
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,440
so

1342
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,720
great question i think um

1343
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,480
tick tock is basically just better

1344
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,680
youtube

1345
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,480
um because all the things that make uh

1346
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,880
youtube great tick tock is kind of doing

1347
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,200
better and the most important thing

1348
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,680
is it forces you to be extremely clear

1349
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:46,800
and short

1350
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,520
otherwise and the algorithm punishes you

1351
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,280
right if you produce a video that

1352
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,119
someone leaves a quarter of the way

1353
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:55,040
through or half of the way through

1354
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,880
the number one metric for all of

1355
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:57,920
tick-tock

1356
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,280
is um do you stay on the video do you

1357
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,040
watch it all the way through that is the

1358
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,359
number one thing it's even stronger than

1359
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:07,520
a follow or a like

1360
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:08,960
if you watch the video all the way

1361
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,319
through it's the strongest signal

1362
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:13,920
someone did analysis of that so

1363
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,079
uh they recently went to like a full

1364
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:18,160
minute or maybe even two minutes i can't

1365
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,920
remember what they extended it to but it

1366
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,000
used to be like 30 seconds

1367
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,760
and that's what made it so powerful it

1368
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,119
was like

1369
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:25,980
going from

1370
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:27,119
[Music]

1371
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:30,240
an opium plant that you rub on your arm

1372
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,720
directly to fentanyl right

1373
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,680
that's what tick tock basically did and

1374
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,760
um

1375
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,800
100 so basically if you have

1376
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,720
the powerful medium of

1377
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,480
uh youtube

1378
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,319
and people are producing cyber security

1379
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:49,119
content or podcast content or whatever

1380
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:51,839
you collapse that down into these super

1381
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:54,800
clean 30 second one minute clips

1382
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,720
that is going to be even more powerful

1383
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,319
than youtube and then there's going to

1384
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:00,800
be a version better than that but

1385
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,119
i would say that this youtube phenomenon

1386
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:05,520
is being enhanced and approved by tick

1387
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,319
tock

1388
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:07,920
not really replace i would put them in

1389
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,319
the same category with the tick tock

1390
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,000
just being better

1391
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,880
interesting that's definitely a

1392
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,240
interesting point of view of this do you

1393
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,240
think

1394
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,000
like i get it that tick tock is much

1395
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,559
more kind of catchy if you will right uh

1396
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,480
but well because you have to to make

1397
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,319
videos sketchy in order for this to work

1398
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:29,440
but do you think um such short videos

1399
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,920
are um can be efficient in kind of

1400
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,000
getting the point through is is it not

1401
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,800
going to be like twitter where it's um

1402
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,119
kind of hard to talk about complicated

1403
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:41,119
questions because of the brevities that

1404
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,359
you are forced into

1405
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:47,280
yes i mean you kind of lose something um

1406
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,440
oh you you should all check out uh neil

1407
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,200
postman um

1408
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,200
amusing ourselves to death

1409
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,520
he actually talks about what you lose

1410
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,680
when you go from

1411
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:01,119
long-form conversations

1412
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:03,839
newspapers writing in a book writing

1413
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:06,319
long letters

1414
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:07,520
to

1415
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:08,800
radio

1416
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,040
to television and of course he died in

1417
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,440
like 2000 so he never saw social media

1418
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,119
but there's a degradation of the

1419
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:17,200
conversation that happens when it

1420
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,720
becomes easier

1421
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,280
um so there is some of that happening

1422
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,880
but luckily

1423
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,720
you can link from one thing to another

1424
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,720
you could have a 30 second version of a

1425
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,960
philosophy concept like absurdism or

1426
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,160
something

1427
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,760
and then you can have a bunch of links

1428
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,760
and it goes into a two-hour conversation

1429
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,240
or you find out about the influencer and

1430
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,640
you go read everything they produce

1431
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,880
so i would say it's like a gateway type

1432
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,599
situation to get into bigger content i

1433
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:46,160
think you do lose this uh

1434
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:49,200
something in the small form but

1435
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,200
i think what's most important about

1436
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,760
media is exposure

1437
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,920
so if you hear a philosophical concept

1438
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,280
in 30 seconds

1439
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,119
first of all if you can't explain at

1440
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:00,640
least to get someone excited about it in

1441
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,960
30 seconds

1442
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,640
maybe maybe you shouldn't be talking

1443
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,240
about it or maybe

1444
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,000
maybe um

1445
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,160
that wasn't a clear articulation of the

1446
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,000
concept right right

1447
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,359
so um i love the forcing function i love

1448
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:17,680
that it forces you to fully understand

1449
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,640
the concept and get it down short

1450
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,480
got it and uh

1451
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,680
that's a yeah definitely a very

1452
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,760
interesting point of view and uh before

1453
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,400
we switch to uh to audience questions i

1454
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,160
just will be kind of in more of a

1455
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,800
lifestyle uh you know questions i just

1456
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,839
had to ask uh as a coffin juices myself

1457
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:37,520
what are your favorite coffee beans

1458
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,520
nowadays

1459
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,359
uh phil's coffee

1460
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:43,680
phil's coffee is my favorite

1461
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,079
yes so check this out i um

1462
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:48,400
i went and found like all the

1463
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,040
not all a lot i went and found like 20

1464
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,000
different

1465
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,559
highly recommended coffee beans

1466
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:56,480
from all over this was during the

1467
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,599
pandemic

1468
00:51:57,599 --> 00:51:59,040
and i had them all shipped to my house

1469
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,880
and i tried them all and i ended up

1470
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,200
going back to phil's

1471
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,520
so now i order beans like directly from

1472
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,400
the the factory it's in oakland

1473
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,760
the factory is in oakland and um

1474
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:15,839
yeah that's where i get my stuff and um

1475
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:18,400
i've recently been using the clever

1476
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,640
uh coffee making technique um it is

1477
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,800
oh it's it's amazing so it's kind of

1478
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,319
like a hario

1479
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:28,000
v60

1480
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,520
except for there's a stopper at the

1481
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,720
bottom

1482
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:34,400
um so it gives you both um

1483
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,960
exposure to the beam but also steeping

1484
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,079
time

1485
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:40,880
so rather than a v60 where it just

1486
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,520
pours over and goes through

1487
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,680
what you do is you pour the water in it

1488
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,000
just sits there and you you set it on

1489
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,319
the counter it just sits there i i put

1490
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:52,079
it in there for like 90 seconds after

1491
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:53,680
the pour which is probably a total of

1492
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,559
like two minutes two and a half minutes

1493
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:58,640
just sits there then you put it on top

1494
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,200
of the thing on top of the cup it opens

1495
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,400
the stopper

1496
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,119
and

1497
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:05,440
it comes through so you basically get

1498
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:09,200
the advantages of a french press with

1499
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,440
the convenience of a v60

1500
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,000
i was gonna say kind of almost like you

1501
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,079
know green fusion in in espresso i

1502
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:17,680
typically do espresso so it's like a

1503
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,079
pre-infusion on uh for espresso brewing

1504
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:20,960
method

1505
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,960
interesting i was also surprised

1506
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,200
with fills but i guess the trick is to

1507
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,880
order it directly because like if you go

1508
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,240
to the store they typically not fresh

1509
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,400
there but i guess if you order it it's

1510
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,040
uh it's still profession that would work

1511
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,680
cool uh thanks for sharing and uh

1512
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,839
i think so far we have uh one question

1513
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:38,640
uh

1514
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,200
back to the um time when we talked about

1515
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,920
uh um

1516
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,319
kind of cyber politics and geopolitical

1517
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:48,880
stuff and and so on uh do you think

1518
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,520
china's recent gaming ban for for young

1519
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,520
kids correlate to better or worse

1520
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,200
hackers in the future is there a

1521
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,920
correlation with gaming and security

1522
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,240
what do you think about that

1523
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,050
oh interesting

1524
00:54:01,050 --> 00:54:02,319
[Music]

1525
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:04,640
um

1526
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,640
i don't know the answer to that

1527
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,559
here here's what i worked yeah here's

1528
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:10,880
what i worry about um

1529
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:11,599
no

1530
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:13,520
china didn't say you can't study how to

1531
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,800
hack the us

1532
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,040
they said you can't play video games

1533
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:21,119
so they could be providing other um

1534
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:22,720
other means of people to get into

1535
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:23,680
hacking

1536
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:24,640
right

1537
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,960
by giving them cybersecurity curriculum

1538
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,240
or something

1539
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,920
who knows i do think there is a

1540
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,880
correlation the correlation is curiosity

1541
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,559
and just enjoying

1542
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:36,799
you know exploring different things

1543
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,480
but yeah

1544
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,799
i was gonna say that i think uh for

1545
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:42,480
security it's very important to have

1546
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,880
this kind of curiosity and you know

1547
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,240
having fun um vibe because that's what

1548
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,640
kind of drives you forward and gaming is

1549
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,880
kind of also there like you also try

1550
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,640
different things and also get it get

1551
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:56,960
excited about them and and spend a lot

1552
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,400
of time at the computer which is not

1553
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,760
necessarily a bad thing because it

1554
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,000
depends what you do with it right

1555
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,599
um

1556
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:05,520
so but you don't think it will have much

1557
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,920
uh much effect on

1558
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,720
uh you know the the the

1559
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,240
kind of development of cyber security

1560
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,680
professionals in in in china no because

1561
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,680
they're still in school right first of

1562
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,920
all it's only up to 18 but they're still

1563
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,119
in school they're still learning

1564
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:23,200
computer science way better than anyone

1565
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,359
else basically in the world

1566
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:26,880
they're still studying all this stuff

1567
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,160
and they're not going to be discouraged

1568
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,240
from learning cyber security they're not

1569
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,160
going to be discouraged from

1570
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,960
finding bugs uh they're going to be

1571
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,720
restricted from reporting them anywhere

1572
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:39,520
else other than china but

1573
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:40,720
they're not going to shut down the

1574
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,559
curiosity thing i think they're just

1575
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:44,559
trying to shut down you know the

1576
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:46,880
minister ministry of culture

1577
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,440
trying to shut down unhealthy things

1578
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,040
yeah it kind of says that ukraine also

1579
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,799
has ministry of culture but

1580
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:53,760
oh really

1581
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:54,640
yeah

1582
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:57,119
i think it's still legacy from like uh

1583
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:00,079
soviet times but we still have it

1584
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:02,400
uh cool thank you so much uh i think

1585
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,720
we're ending the kind of time slot and

1586
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,079
the times that we have but thank you so

1587
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:08,079

this conversation it's been amazing and

1589
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,200

1590
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,480

1591
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:17,599
