1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,520
so hello everyone again my name is julia

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,000
glad to see you all here

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,880
and let's start my topic today is why

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,759
can developers make it secure

5
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,320
and before we begin let me quickly

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,279
present myself

7
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,279
again my name is julia this is my

8
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,240
twitter account you can follow me ask me

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,400
different questions you can

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,240
tell me your thoughts about my talk

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,279
later

12
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,160
and also i will share my slides here

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,040
so you can follow me uh i am a security

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,079
software engineer at kozak labs

15
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,480
uh we are a security and

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,280
data security and cryptography company

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,840
we work with different platforms uh

18
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,800
different languages our our products are

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,399
for different platforms and different

20
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,760
languages

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,800
and my personal specialization is mobile

22
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,480
application security

23
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,480
because well yeah i'm

24
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,199
a former mobile application developer

25
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,240
yeah and my topic is why can developers

26
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,680
make it secure

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,640
so i know what it feels like to be asked

28
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,280
this question

29
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,159
if you ask developers what is the

30
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,520
problem what will they answer

31
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,320
let's stop here for just a quick moment

32
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,560
and i'd like you to think about the

33
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,600
answer and maybe share your thoughts

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,479
in

35
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,880
zoom and on youtube i think it will be

36
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,040
an interesting for us to go through at

37
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,280
the end and see if we are aligned on

38
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,640
this topic

39
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,880
and i will share my thoughts with you as

40
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,400
well

41
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,439
uh

42
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,680
okay

43
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,040
i think that the most common answers

44
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,640
would be that

45
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,119
developers just have no time for

46
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,799
security they have very tight deadlines

47
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,240
and features usually have have a

48
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,880
much higher priority than security than

49
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,680
security controls

50
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,799
but you know it's just a tip of the

51
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,000
iceberg this thing uh on the left

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,480
represents an iceberg

53
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,280
and you know icebergs they are much

54
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,760
larger than it seems from the beginning

55
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,800
uh if you give developers more time for

56
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,000
security if you set higher priority for

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,640
security controls to be implemented you

58
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,920
will still have some problems because

59
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,879
because

60
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:31,840
you

61
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,640
will see that your team lacks security

62
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,200
expertise you will see that some

63
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,000
security controls are in conflict with

64
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,640
other features

65
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,280
and if we look a little bit closer we'll

66
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,319
see that the second item

67
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,760
is usually the result of lack of secure

68
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,720
architecture and our iceberg is getting

69
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,560
even bigger

70
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,519
i hope we are aligned on this part if

71
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,920
not i will be glad to see your thoughts

72
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,239
uh in chats

73
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,560
and for now i want to share some

74
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,519
interesting statistics with you

75
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,760
uh you know some companies

76
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,599
survey c-level executives like cto ciso

77
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,400
and others and ask them different

78
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,760
questions about security

79
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,400
some reports may not be of the very high

80
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,480
quality but still they're pretty

81
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,799
interesting to look at

82
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,519
regarding tight deadlines you see

83
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:32,879
58

84
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,680
say that release deadlines are often too

85
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,840
tight to properly implement security

86
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,879
controls this survey is

87
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,799
for mobile applications

88
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,959
and i think it's pretty realistic right

89
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,519
from the same survey regarding security

90
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,680
controls being in conflict with other

91
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,959
features

92
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,640
63 percent agrees that there is often a

93
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,439
lack of alignment between departments to

94
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,080
align user facing features and security

95
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,560
controls implementation

96
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,239
and a very sad statistics lower that

97
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,599
only

98
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,799
25 of respondents are fully aware of

99
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,680
changes made to in-house applications

100
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,160
and apis within their software

101
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,600
development environment so no one knows

102
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,800
everything communication is essential

103
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,440
here for security

104
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,520
a little bit more numbers

105
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,960
uh about lack of security expertise and

106
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,680
no

107
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,919
uh secure coding skills

108
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,759
uh just 32 percent have confidence that

109
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,639
they

110
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,360
could secure sensitive data

111
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,919
this is a little bit sad they will

112
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,160
probably need to hire an external

113
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,759
security team or some other experts

114
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,240
uh 61 percent of

115
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,199
applications had at least one critical

116
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,880
and high issue not covered by overs top

117
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,479
10 so you see

118
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,199
uh very very basic knowledge is not

119
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,800
enough like always knowing of us top 10

120
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,440
and checking for obvious top 10

121
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,240
vulnerabilities is not enough to build

122
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,800
secure system secure product it's way

123
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,560
too basic

124
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,960
and like it's just for web

125
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,840
uh

126
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,199
57

127
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,039
do not inspect

128
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,520
uh data that is being transferred

129
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,880
returned via apis

130
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,840
that is not good it's one of the very

131
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,960
basic secure coding things you know

132
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,479
and this piece

133
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,639
of text at the right top corner says

134
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,440
that

135
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,720
vulnerabilities caused by lack of secure

136
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,000
coding are not very common in general

137
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,880
but they are very dense

138
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,400
it means that

139
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,840
not many apps have such issues but if

140
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,639
they have then they have a lot a lot of

141
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,600
vulnerabilities related to it

142
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,840
so it has very very high density

143
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,319
as i've started with secure coding

144
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,400
i want to talk a little bit more about

145
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,520
it

146
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,400
right now secure coding is like a

147
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,520
separate skill developers learn it as

148
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,600
any other skill it does not come by the

149
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,800
default

150
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,360
there are general best practices and

151
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,440
platform specific recommendations to

152
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,560
learn and well in the perfect world in a

153
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,840
perfect world your organization has a

154
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,319
security training to teach these secure

155
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,639
coding skills not just how to detect

156
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,880
phishing emails

157
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,080
but there are

158
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,280
other options for self-education

159
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,240
for self-education uh like online

160
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,560
materials like

161
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,520
for example like all that materials

162
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,680
uh there are security conferences to

163
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,160
attend like today's one

164
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,960
or there are also some uh platform

165
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,440
specific conferences that may be also

166
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,039
useful to gain secure coding skills

167
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,000
uh here just for the sake of example

168
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,720
i've listed some basic uh general secure

169
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,960
coding principles

170
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,120
there are many many more

171
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,919
but i hope that if developers are

172
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,319
watching me right now they know these

173
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,840
three very well

174
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,960
uh the first one is data minimization

175
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,880
principle that you do not that you store

176
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,319
on the data that you really need

177
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,680
uh you know if the api if your back end

178
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,599
returns you

179
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,599
a lot a lot of data it doesn't mean that

180
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,199
you need to store everything you store

181
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,440
just what you actually need

182
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,280
so this uh this is one of the very basic

183
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,479
principle principles of secure coding

184
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,759
the second one listed here is

185
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,720
validate any input from external sources

186
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,000
yeah we said

187
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,199
we saw

188
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,599
statistics about it

189
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,280
you need to validate

190
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,919
any input from the user from network

191
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,199
request for

192
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,400
any api calls and so on so on and to

193
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,240
everything you get from the database and

194
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,520
so on

195
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,639
uh and the third one listed here is

196
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,520
deny access by the default

197
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,720
um

198
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,360
you know like a very straightforward

199
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,520
example is that

200
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,560
uh

201
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,519
if authorization request fails

202
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,320
you do not give the user the author

203
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,479
authorization rights

204
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,200
like if password validation fails you do

205
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,039
not allow user to proceed it's pretty

206
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,959
straightforward example

207
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,440
but another example

208
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,800
i saw

209
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,360
in a real project is like

210
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,080
uh

211
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,680
the application was showing an image and

212
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,320
applying watermark on it

213
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,120
and to get an image it has a

214
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,440
it had a separate request to get an

215
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,600
image and a separate request to get a

216
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,000
watermark and then it put it all

217
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,519
together

218
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,920
and it was funny that

219
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,959
if the request for watermark fails then

220
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,279
the application showed

221
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,480
an image with no watermark and that's it

222
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,200
it's a nice example where uh the

223
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,040
developers didn't thought about the

224
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,839
third principle

225
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:28,800
uh

226
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,920
okay so secure coding is just a small

227
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,920
part of what we need to build secure

228
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,440
product

229
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,080
and this is a typical software

230
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,720
development life cycle i hope everyone

231
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,399
here is familiar what with what it is

232
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,160
uh yeah we have

233
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,200
here requirements definition design

234
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,600
phase development testing deployment and

235
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,160
repeat repeat repeat

236
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,720
and if we add secure coding it will be

237
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,720
somewhere here during development phase

238
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,360
but you see it is not enough a lot of

239
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,760
things are not covered

240
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,880
and the truth is that usually those

241
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,000
parts

242
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,640
may not be covered at all

243
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,440
uh usually well it's

244
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,440
pretty often case that security is

245
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,040
postponed like a last minute feature and

246
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,920
such attitude is not good

247
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,040
uh we want security to be in the core of

248
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,399
our system not to be added as a last

249
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,200
minute thing you know like we want it

250
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,000
like inside the core

251
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,880
and

252
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,760
you know

253
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,959
if security is so important why do we

254
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,640
postpone it what is the problem

255
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,640
because security is not visible usually

256
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,760
it has no direct business value

257
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,240
it is not something you can sell

258
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,560
you can sell nice features but not

259
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,959
security and basic security stuff is

260
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,120
usually supposed to be there by the

261
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,399
default

262
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,760
and

263
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,440
you can't see if it's actually working

264
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,519
you can only see when it fails

265
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,120
monitoring is nice but actual incidents

266
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,160
are much much more visible for the whole

267
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,920
company for your management team for

268
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,719
business owners

269
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,560
if security is not built in into our

270
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,279
core and if security is the last meanest

271
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,480
feature

272
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,200
and the more we delay security the more

273
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,240
effort it takes to be added and the more

274
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,680
chances it has to be ignored at all

275
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,240
another interesting statistic related to

276
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,000
it

277
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,360
usually

278
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,880
it happens with issues and tasks that

279
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,760
require significant changes for multiple

280
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,320
platforms for architecture

281
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,880
like big big changes

282
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,600
uh the longer it takes to fix an issue

283
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,880
the less chances it has to be fixed

284
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,839
uh you can see here in this uh

285
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,560
report this that

286
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,639
black text saying that

287
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,639
while many flows are

288
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,440
being addressed promptly older flows

289
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,800
tend to linger over time that one in

290
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,839
four flows remain open after a year and

291
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,839
a half that is very sad

292
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,760
this graph also

293
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,120
uh

294
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,680
works nicely for an example with

295
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,040
penetration testing that is done

296
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,639
for example with

297
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,760
for example with penetration testing

298
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,880
because

299
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,000
many companies do not address security

300
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,320
during development

301
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,560
they just order

302
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,200
external penetration testing

303
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,240
when everything is ready and deployed

304
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,040
and they get reports with found some

305
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,240
issues they fix low-hanging fruits and

306
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,600
that's it

307
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,760
everything else that requires like

308
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,399
complex changes big changes

309
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,360
is postponed for later or just ignored

310
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,519
forever

311
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,680
and we don't want that to happen we want

312
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,760
to have security in the core of the

313
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,279
product and as a result we'll have less

314
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,839
issues find found by pen testers and

315
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,279
less problems fixing these issues

316
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,240
we want to address security on each step

317
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,120
not just during development

318
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,839
or after the very final deployment you

319
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,680
know

320
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,639
so

321
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,200
uh here is what a

322
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,600
secure software development life cycle

323
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,920
may look like it's just one of the

324
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,680
visions you can find

325
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,800
a lot of different schemes for that

326
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,920
uh it is very close to what i do as a

327
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,800
part of external security team

328
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,160
so during

329
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,360
the phase of requirements definition

330
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,800
we

331
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,519
assess risks during design we do threat

332
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,800
modeling and design review during

333
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,600
development we watch for

334
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,440
uh secure coding skills of the

335
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,440
developers

336
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,800
we have some static analyzers integrated

337
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,600
during test phase so we do code review

338
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,440
security testing

339
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,959
and

340
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,720
after deployment we have again

341
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,639
penetration testing

342
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,079
and we will watch for secure

343
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,920
configuration

344
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,880
uh

345
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,600
security team can assist dev team on

346
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,800
each step

347
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,880
uh they help during

348
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,800
every every step here

349
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,800
like they help during risk assessment

350
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,279
threat modeling design review like on

351
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,800
each iteration if new feature appears it

352
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,000
requires like another security review so

353
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,680
it's not something that you've done at

354
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,760
the very beginning and that's it you do

355
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,160
it on each each iteration

356
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,519
uh during development phase we may also

357
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,399
have

358
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,160
as i mentioned different security

359
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,199
trainings like secure coding trainings

360
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,040
uh during testing

361
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,079
phase

362
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,240
development team together with security

363
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,920
team can

364
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,560
create a different useful documentation

365
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,440
for example security checklist security

366
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,800
test cases and feature description from

367
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,120
a security perspective you know not a

368
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,800
report with found box but the report

369
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,959
that describes your feature

370
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,320
from uh security perspective like how it

371
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,360
works what is important here

372
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,519
and then yeah then deployment and

373
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:36,639
external

374
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,680
internal penetration testing

375
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,479
and you see

376
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,920
there are

377
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,759
much more actors in this process than

378
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,920
just developers

379
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,320
actually developers usually take

380
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,600
take care of this small part

381
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,320
and an important thing to understand

382
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,320
here is that

383
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,120
architectural decisions are usually made

384
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,240
here not during design and development

385
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,480
but during requirements definition and

386
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,959
design

387
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,000
so developers do not cover everything

388
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,639
so i mentioned at the beginning that

389
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,360
developers can't make it secure because

390
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,160
of lack of secure architecture

391
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,199
so let's try to figure it out what the

392
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,680
problem is and how to fix it

393
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,560
there is a lot of pressure in the fast

394
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,519
pace and environment and people make

395
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,320
poor decisions under the pressure and

396
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,320
secure architecture is about decision

397
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,639
making people mess up processes under

398
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,279
pressure and secure architecture is

399
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,959
about following the process

400
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,800
so isn't it a typical responsibility for

401
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,000
developers

402
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,079
like to build a secure architecture i

403
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,440
think it's a pretty common answer so

404
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,480
we'll try to answer it and first of all

405
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,359
we'll

406
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,880
give a definition to secure architecture

407
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,720
secure architecture

408
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,839
is a combination of structural security

409
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,679
decisions

410
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,559
if we were talking about just

411
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,799
architecture general architecture we

412
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,039
would say that it is a combination of

413
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,839
structural decisions and as we are

414
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,799
adding security here we are saying that

415
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,960
it is a combination of structural

416
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,360
security decisions

417
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,640
that efficiently addresses risks like

418
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,360
our main goal here is to address risks

419
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,960
considering

420
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,720
business goals

421
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,679
we don't need security for the sake of

422
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,160
security we don't want

423
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,280
uh to break key features for sake of

424
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,039
security

425
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,440
we want to look for traders that will

426
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,880
satisfy both build business goals and

427
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,840
address risks

428
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,640
okay

429
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,799
now you see there is a significant

430
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,960
difference between secure architecture

431
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,880
and secure coding

432
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,440
secure architecture is an abstraction it

433
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,919
is about decision making process it is

434
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,799
based on risks and business goals and

435
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,919
secure coding is platform specific it's

436
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,840
about writing code it is about

437
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,039
following it is about following industry

438
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,240
guidelines and best practices

439
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,400
secure architecture when you work on

440
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,200
secure architecture you operate risks

441
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,679
and business goals abstracting from the

442
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:42,640
tools

443
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,919
and when you do secure coding you are

444
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,760
actually operating the tools you do not

445
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,600
make any business decisions

446
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,240
so secure architecture is about creating

447
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,039
structure while secure coding is about

448
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,320
adding some details

449
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,320
okay

450
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,559
building secure architecture what it

451
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,000
looks like

452
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,200
first step

453
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,919
uh we define business goals like we were

454
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,600
talking a lot about business goals so

455
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,840
here we define them

456
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,240
uh and we need business people involved

457
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,440
for it

458
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,760
like main people main

459
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,520
actors for these steps are business

460
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,520
people like business owners or dr

461
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,360
representatives

462
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,919
second step

463
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,160
based on business goals so the team

464
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,440
defines risks measure risks look for

465
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,120
trade-offs

466
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,760
then when risk assessment is ready we

467
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,320
can work on thread model decide what

468
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,480
security controls we need

469
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,080
uh what is the priority of for each of

470
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,240
them how do we need to implement them

471
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,600
and so on

472
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,200
and then on the next step we are

473
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,880
actually implementing all of this

474
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,919
uh you see

475
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,559
business owners are usually involved

476
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,440
mainly during defining business goals

477
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,200
and risk assessment

478
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,720
and a little bit

479
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,600
on the

480
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,960
face of

481
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,280
decision making and design while dev

482
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,159
team is more involved during decision

483
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,280
making and building the architecture and

484
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,679
a little bit less involved during a risk

485
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,760
assessment

486
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,360
sometimes it works as is

487
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,960
but it helps to involve security team

488
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,159
because you know

489
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,440
communication between business owners

490
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,480
and dev team it's really really tough

491
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,240
sometimes

492
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,679
so we are adding security experts here

493
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,720
and then if you still see that things

494
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,120
are not moving properly you probably

495
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,080
want your security team to be involved

496
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,440
on each step

497
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,799
like that

498
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,280
uh and each step of building secure

499
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,679
architecture and of course each step of

500
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,360
secure software development lifecycle

501
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,039
it shows the importance of the team

502
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:13,720
communication and shared responsibility

503
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,679
i would like to talk more about shared

504
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,120
responsibility and ownership

505
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,640
uh because like no one knows everything

506
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,000
we always need a person to ask questions

507
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,960
we always need to know who is making

508
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,120
decisions for each

509
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,639
let's call them domains

510
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,120
when you design secure architecture

511
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,480
you'd want

512
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,159
you'd want to

513
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,280
know the opinion from each domain

514
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,360
now i mean from like

515
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,840
business owners product project manager

516
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,720
software developers ui ux designers

517
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,159
devops team qa engineers and so on so on

518
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,720
and probably the best example here apart

519
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,720
from security

520
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,919
is qa engineers they usually are not

521
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,240
involved in decision making and

522
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,080
architecture design

523
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,080
however as a result they may not be able

524
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,200
to automate some flows

525
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,480
edin

526
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,919
like and we

527
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,320
if we add

528
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,679
security to this example

529
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,280
for example

530
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,559
some applications have bot detection

531
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,039
malicious user detection

532
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,799
and your automated tests like ui tests

533
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:35,760
are very very similar to bots and if you

534
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,000
do not plan such case in advance you

535
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,799
won't be able to automate it properly

536
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,039
and you know adding a boolean flag is

537
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,080
prod or is also a bad decision

538
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,280
so you should think in advance how

539
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,000
how to make this feature work

540
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,440
and how to test it that's why even qa

541
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,120
team should be

542
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,919
involved in the initial

543
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,799
architecture design

544
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,200
and you see it is

545
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,760
everything all of this is a part of our

546
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,880
security of security of our system and

547
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,360
each team is responsible for

548
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,320
its

549
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,880
own domain so they need to raise these

550
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,559
questions and they

551
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,720
need to have some expertise in these

552
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,240
questions

553
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,559
uh and when we talk about software

554
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,880
developers we should understand that

555
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,520
each platform is also different

556
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,280
uh secure architecture requires

557
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,480
expertise like in each platform

558
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,559
now for example

559
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,360
a force upgrade feature

560
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,400
unlike web you cannot control the user

561
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,320
updates on desktop and mobile

562
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,520
applications

563
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,440
unless you have implemented additional

564
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,600
feature for that

565
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,000
the front-end developer may be

566
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,200
absolutely not aware that the app needs

567
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,120
a specific feature for that

568
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,520
like for web you just update your

569
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,760
website and it works with the new

570
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,960
version

571
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,240
but it doesn't work that way for desktop

572
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,080
mobile applications

573
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,400
uh what is more the feature requires

574
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,880
back-end changes and back-end developers

575
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,960
may also be absolutely not aware that

576
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,960
they need to do something to make your

577
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,919
application more secure

578
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,600
so the

579
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,360
application team

580
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,000
needs to tell them like it they need to

581
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,640
communicate

582
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,480
another example

583
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,559
imagine a website

584
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,559
for sharing some secret corporate images

585
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,240
like schemes diagrams and so on

586
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,080
and then

587
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,960
imagine they have an android application

588
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,760
and the security expert tells you that

589
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,840
you need to have a screenshot prevention

590
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,600
for the android app

591
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,720
you ask

592
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,200
why would i need that users can easily

593
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,919
make screenshots like from the web on

594
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,640
their desktop what what why do i need it

595
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,840
for android

596
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,880
why do i need to prevent screenshots

597
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,840
but

598
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,120
android devices are different

599
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,360
usually users

600
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,240
sync their photos including screenshots

601
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,360
with google photos always icloud

602
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,480
and

603
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,760
sometimes they share their images with

604
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,159
family members

605
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:25,840
i'm sorry

606
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,440
so

607
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,440
they may accidentally

608
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,799
share

609
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,679
some corporate secrets with their family

610
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:36,080
members and that is not good

611
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,880
and you see there is huge difference

612
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,679
between two platforms

613
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,480
there are very different attack vectors

614
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,120
that's why you need expertise in each

615
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,240
each platform you have

616
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,159
next

617
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,679
i have already mentioned ownership and i

618
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,760
want to talk a little bit more i like

619
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,440
this phrase that

620
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,159
if you own you care

621
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,760
i like it because

622
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,760
ownership can be

623
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,720
like natural and assigned natural

624
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,919
ownership is when you do your job and

625
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,799
you care you just naturally care

626
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,120
for what you do

627
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,320
and assign ownership is like you are

628
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,520
assigned to take care of these or that

629
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,080
part like it's your job you are assigned

630
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,880
to do that so if you own you care

631
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,159
as for me

632
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:33,600
ownership

633
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,159
in software development process means

634
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,960
that you understand your role

635
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,159
you know uh what you are doing and what

636
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:46,080
for and you communicate these to others

637
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,120
remember our goal here is

638
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,279
that each member

639
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,000
knows who to ask questions

640
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,440
and the person who owns some parts of

641
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,120
the system some part of the project

642
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,640
is a person

643
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,000
who you can address questions to

644
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,799
for example it's an example of natural

645
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:12,880
ownership like you know like

646
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,159
let's say

647
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,799
uh a personal characteristics you may

648
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:17,600
look

649
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,240
for when you hire developers

650
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,600
uh what it feels like to own a feature

651
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,000
like you understand the

652
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,159
real business value of the feature you

653
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,080
are implementing

654
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,279
so you you just take closer looks

655
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,880
take closer look

656
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,960
at related prs to this feature that

657
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,200
you've implemented like it's your own

658
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,520
feature you take care of it you want to

659
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,960
see how it changes

660
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,720
you keep an eye on updates and you are

661
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,399
ready to speak up

662
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,399
if you see that some other feature may

663
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:55,919
break feature you implemented so it's

664
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,000
natural ownership when you take care

665
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,039
about your work

666
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:04,320
and another example of ownership i like

667
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,880
it a lot because it works both for

668
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,159
natural ownership and for assigned

669
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:11,840
ownership

670
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,760
reading security documentation

671
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,919
uh

672
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,320
if you have implemented a security

673
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,919
feature

674
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:23,600
you may be just

675
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,480
uh you may just feel the ownership

676
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,840
natural ownership of it so you're

677
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,600
interested uh in reading security

678
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,760
documentation because you're you just

679
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,000
care for what you're doing so you just

680
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,520
go and read

681
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,159
from the other side if it is an assigned

682
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,720
ownership if you are assigned to take

683
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,200
care of this security feature you it's

684
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,360
just your job to go and read the

685
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,799
documentation

686
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:49,919
so

687
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,320
both cases can work here you can just

688
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,880
assign a person to do that or

689
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,600
you just may be lucky and someone is

690
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,559
already doing that

691
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,559
so

692
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:06,240
to sum up everything that was said about

693
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,039
secure architecture

694
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,840
secure architecture requires security

695
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,320
expertise processes

696
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,080
shared responsibility and ownership

697
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,120
and back back to the

698
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,039
very first question

699
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:26,960
why can developers make it secure like

700
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,200
because because of this list

701
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,679
because there is lack of security

702
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,320
expertise lack of processes lack of

703
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,399
shared responsibility and lack of

704
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,559
ownership

705
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:39,440
you know

706
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,640
these things they do not appear on their

707
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,679
own

708
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,919
you need to work on them

709
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,480
some teams are able to set everything up

710
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,760
on their own

711
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,279
at least they will have enough security

712
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,000
for the current moment for the business

713
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,799
goals like for the current state of what

714
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,440
they have they are okay

715
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,039
we don't know what will

716
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,880
they need in the future

717
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,600
but many teams require help

718
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,799
and they just hire internal or external

719
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:13,360
security teams

720
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,559
here i have gathered some useful links

721
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,919
the first one is a talk from the info

722
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,679
queue about

723
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,640
security architecture actually this talk

724
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,559
was an is

725
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,919
inspiration for my talk so i

726
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,760
recommend it a lot uh and the second one

727
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,640
is about secure software development

728
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,559
life cycle

729
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,960
here is

730
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:44,000
it is a video of one of this talk and a

731
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,960
presentation and also i have mentioned

732
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,440
two links to this

733
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,600
interesting statistics about data

734
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,200
security

735
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,120
and application

736
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,320
security so you can take a look and see

737
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,440
some interesting numbers

738
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,399
so generally that is it from me

739
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,480
again here is my twitter account i will

740
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,840
post my slides here as well

741
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,120
and i think we can proceed to questions

742
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,279
and see if there were any interesting

743
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:20,240
answers in the chat thank you

744
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:26,559
julia what did i miss

745
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,399
there was a quiz

746
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:31,440
i could win no i i asked what do you

747
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,159
audience think about

748
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,720
about why can developers actually make

749
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,320
it secure

750
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,159
maybe they have okay

751
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:41,679
yeah maybe they can give you more

752
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,600
interesting thoughts

753
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,440
go ahead i'll give you my answer but ah

754
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,600
you know you know

755
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,760
it's all about you know i'm marxist by

756
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,840
heart so it's all about economic

757
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,640
incentive for me uh we do not pay them

758
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,279
for security we pay them for features

759
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,440
yeah features are visible features are

760
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,320
useful security basically is not

761
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,360
visible and the yeah is not useful until

762
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,039
until something bad happens you know

763
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,799
like plumber

764
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,120
you never need a plumber until you

765
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,120
really need a plumber

766
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,519
you know yeah that's true

767
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,320
oh like extinguisher the same example

768
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,960
yeah yeah the same same thing it hangs

769
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,120
around in the corner you never need it

770
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,439
it just

771
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,279
it just

772
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,799
you know

773
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,880
ruins your selfies

774
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,440
yeah you have a background for a really

775
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,880
nice selfie and there is a fire

776
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,279
extinguisher why why on earth we need

777
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,279
them but when you need them you really

778
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,919
really need them

779
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:47,200
okay so what do we have as answers

780
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,159
yeah i think nice to summarize it very

781
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,159
much

782
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,480
and i agree with her we create secure by

783
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,559
default software

784
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,440
it's a good answer

785
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,320
oh okay

786
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,039
security is overvalued yeah security is

787
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:08,720
overrated yeah

788
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,360
in this audience nowhere else though but

789
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,440
okay okay okay okay we have some

790
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,519
questions we have some questions to can

791
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:23,120
we can jump into questions

792
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,159
let me just summarize

793
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:27,600
uh

794
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,760
whether we have all of them here okay

795
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,880
yeah we have

796
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,519
so uh

797
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:37,039
another excuse that anastasia has

798
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,480
highlighted we don't

799
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,120
have such ticket in jira that's it's a

800
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,519
universal answer basically

801
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:47,279
yeah you wanted processes you have them

802
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,720
uh

803
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,440
and a question

804
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,480
thanks for the great presentation could

805
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,919
you please suggest some training

806
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,000
platforms that can be used by developers

807
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,159
to improve their secure coding

808
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:01,760
skills

809
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,399
in parenthesis something like pentaster

810
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,519
lab called review challenges hdb academy

811
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,599
modules related to secure coding

812
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,159
i can say that

813
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,800
like as for me when i was a developer

814
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,280
and i tried to learn some secure coding

815
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,960
skills i just

816
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,679
browsed the internet you know and with

817
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,918
no particular platform recommendations

818
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:29,440
and there were always something

819
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,119
interesting to read

820
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,000
and

821
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,760
well you know

822
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,399
it's it is all these articles online and

823
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,719
courses online they uh

824
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,359
like free courses online they are about

825
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,359
of the same quality

826
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:44,159
and

827
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,359
like

828
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:48,639
actual trainings by security experts or

829
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,599
actual life courses with a particular

830
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,520
group of people is much more efficient

831
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,839
like when you can ask some particular

832
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:57,520
questions when

833
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,480
uh

834
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,119
like it's important to

835
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,079
like if you look for a

836
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,200
secure coding course for java you will

837
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,520
not get a lot of interest in information

838
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,440
because there are a lot of users of java

839
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,920
and you probably need just small piece

840
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,680
of that

841
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,800
so probably it's better like

842
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,800
to consult some

843
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,079
um

844
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,599
like to look for

845
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,320
uh specific courses like

846
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,440
specific experts in this or that field

847
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,680
who can give training to you like a

848
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,920
corporate training because free courses

849
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,480
like they are just

850
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,560
all just general online courses they're

851
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,880
just free like free materials online

852
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,119
they're not of a very high quality from

853
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,280
my opinion

854
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,200
do what do you think about secure flag

855
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:50,960
um

856
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,520
i haven't

857
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,960
i have no experience with it

858
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,160
yeah so uh let me then maybe share this

859
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,480
information it's not free at all but

860
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,280
it's free when you're a os member which

861
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,520
is basically virtually free because for

862
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,320
ukraine it's 20 bucks per year

863
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,040
so you have access to secure flag that

864
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,040
is basically you know like

865
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,839
uh

866
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:18,560
boards wiggy web security academy but

867
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,720
for source code analysis so there are

868
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,079
different

869
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,119
uh portions of code and for different

870
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,560
development uh stacks and platforms and

871
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,680
languages

872
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,880
and you can basically interactively find

873
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,920
bugs try to fix bugs and validate

874
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,320
whether the fixes were

875
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,520
efficient it looks

876
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,920
better than anything i saw i would say

877
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,599
so it's not perfect

878
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,680
by any means but

879
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,480
it's really practical because it shows

880
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,079
you the workflow

881
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,720
how to review the code

882
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,320
and

883
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,920
i summarized it to myself as grammarly

884
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,240
for secure coding you know because as

885
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,280
you use grammarly use you you gradually

886
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,839
become better writer yourself

887
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:10,720
yeah and you use grammar less and less

888
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,680
the same way i suppose people who

889
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,200
[Music]

890
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,920
develop software can use secure flag to

891
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,280
to like

892
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,280
become better

893
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,920
more secure developers

894
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,400
and and then of course it's in the last

895
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,320
project that's why that's why i'm

896
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,240
endorsing for it but

897
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,440
but still it's quite a good quality

898
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,599
i suggest you look at that direction

899
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:40,400
yeah it's a very interesting project

900
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,280
uh

901
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,880
okay other questions

902
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:50,800
we have one more

903
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,760
question if the developers will start to

904
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,520
think about security

905
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,359
will we lose our fancy security jobs

906
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:03,640
oh no of course not

907
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,700
like you know

908
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,680
[Laughter]

909
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,640
just one person cannot know just

910
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,599
everything and security is a huge thing

911
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:14,400
you

912
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,720
like a great example uh is one of uh i

913
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,320
have multiple i had multiple projects

914
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,079
on react native

915
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:26,079
and you know when you work on react

916
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,400
native they they have just react native

917
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,720
developers but these rack native

918
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,040
developers they need to know like react

919
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,040
native they need to know

920
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,160
uh android they need to know ios and

921
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,320
like they just have no chance to learn

922
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,200
security on top of all these like it's

923
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,680
just way too much information for a

924
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,599
single person

925
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:50,079
that's like that's why security people

926
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:52,240
are here because it's just not possible

927
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,040
to know everything another great example

928
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,320
is cryptography like you

929
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,920
you can be a developer who knows it but

930
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,520
like to hire a good let's say c plus

931
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,200
plus developer with excellent

932
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,839
cryptography knowledge it's

933
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,680
it's just almost

934
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,720
not possible you are very lucky to hire

935
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,640
one when you need one

936
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,960
it's much easier to hire just a good

937
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,880
developer and the security expert

938
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,640
separately

939
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,400
yeah yeah for sure because i know like

940
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,599
two of them

941
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,920
and both of them would be really hard to

942
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,240
hire

943
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,760
okay okay it's uh

944
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,680
it's a good question really

945
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,400
thought-provoking so next one is do you

946
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,040
think github autopilot will improve

947
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,320
security of our software

948
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,160
it obviously won't if you don't use

949
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,200
github but what chances are that

950
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,599
if you use github autopilot will improve

951
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,720
the security of the software

952
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,040
like again i don't have experience with

953
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,880
it there are way too many tools in this

954
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,760
world

955
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,280
to know how everything works

956
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,079
but

957
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:09,839
the general idea of putting some

958
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:11,200
security

959
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,560
measures

960
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,599
on the level of

961
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,240
basically it's it's sas

962
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,079
yeah so you use a platform like github

963
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:22,560
or gitlab or bitbucket and they

964
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,720
implement something that is available i

965
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,680
either as an option or by default

966
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:31,440
right as they already do for

967
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,960
for what for dependency checking right

968
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,160
yeah but uh github is not microsoft and

969
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,560
just starting from there microsoft has

970
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,880
like access to a lot of coders and a lot

971
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,079
of code so maybe the right chances

972
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,119
yeah and you know again it covers just

973
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:52,400
small parts so small parts can be

974
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,160
improved but

975
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,599
uh

976
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,319
main security flows like this part is

977
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:01,440
easy to automate not just with

978
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,480
github tools like with different tools

979
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,200
and yeah you can automate some parts of

980
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,560
the projects uh security checking but

981
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,240
there are still a lot of parts that

982
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,599
cannot be automated and like these uh

983
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,240
very painful flows are usually happen

984
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,520
like in

985
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,079
error related to errors in business

986
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,319
logic or like

987
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:25,200
some

988
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,079
architectural decisions not like using

989
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,640
wrong methods somewhere

990
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,480
like it's something that is easy to

991
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,400
detect something easy to fix and a lot

992
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,560
of tools are all already helping with it

993
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:41,760
so maybe it will help with the technical

994
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,240
vulnerabilities uh i mean

995
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,839
implementation level implementation

996
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,920
level but not with the security flaws

997
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,599
that are like design and architectural

998
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:50,720
level

999
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,960
yeah yeah because you still will need a

1000
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,920
human

1001
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,359
for that yeah

1002
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:56,640
okay

1003
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,319
any more questions if you want to

1004
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,359
grab

1005
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:05,440
the mic and ask questions out loud

1006
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,640
in our zoom chat

1007
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,760
do it now

1008
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,880
or be silent forever

1009
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,280
no question oh you can come to my next

1010
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,359
conference

1011
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:22,560
yeah or catch up with julia somewhere

1012
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,280
else because she is quite

1013
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,160
an active contributor to ukrainian cyber

1014
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,200
security thing and we are all thankful

1015
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,160
for that as well as we are thankful for

1016
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,880
your presentation today thank you for
