became more than actual in modern world

16
00:00:53,120 --> 00:01:00,280
ukraine was on an epicenter

17
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:03,599
of cyber attacks in 2014

18
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:06,960
2015 2016

19

and 2017.

20
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:14,320
let's remind what happened on ukrainian

21
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,320
cyber battlefields

22
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:23,280
in may 2014 pro-russian hackers

23
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,479
intruded into central election committee

24
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,759
network

25
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:30,960
and tried to mispresent far-right

26
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:35,680
candidate dwitro yarosh

27
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,679
as a winner of presidential action

28
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:46,479
in december 2015 pro-russian hackers

29
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:49,600
intruded into ricarpatia obal energo

30
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:54,759
power station network which

31
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:57,839
led to blackout for more than

32
00:01:54,759 --> 00:02:00,880
230 000 people

33
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:04,320
in more than for more than six hours

34
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,320
in western ukraine

35
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:12,000
in june 2017

36
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,280
attack against popular bookkeeping

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,920
company

38
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:20,319
caused huge damage for ukrainian economy

39
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,119
many companies had to stop the

40
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:26,238
activities

41
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,239
for weeks and even months

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,760
in 2016 2018

43
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:39,040
many types of malware affected

44
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:43,120
energy and transport companies media

45
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:45,679
banks many other critical infrastructure

46
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,680
objects

47
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,319
whole world carefully watched the

48
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,440
biggest

49
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,440
cyber attacks

50
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:03,200
after similar attacks on the ground

51
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:06,640
in 2014 2019

52
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:10,879
ukrainian army became one of the

53
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,879
most efficient in europe

54
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,879
as the same happened with ukrainian

55
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:22,159
national

56
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:22,159
cyber defense and cyber security

57
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,360
let's take a look and make our own

58
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,360
conclusions

59
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:37,440
uh so let's begin with the volunteers

60
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,560
initiatives

61
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:43,920
uh ukrainian cyber alliance

62
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,959
set up in 2016 as

63
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:50,079
informal community of patriotic

64
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:54,159
pro-ukrainian cyber activists

65
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:56,560
from ukraine and worldwide

66
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,560
you see

67
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:04,400
united falcon flames trinity

cyborg hackers groups

70
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:16,079
main goal of uc is protection

71
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,079
from russian cyber aggression

72
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:25,199
uca took responsibility for many

73
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:28,000
cyber attacks and cyber operations

74
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,280

as as well as pro-russian militants

99
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:59,680
ngo informed nepal was set up in

100
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:02,880
2014 their main focus

101
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:06,560
is open source intelligence

102
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,120
uh they also revealed tons of evidence

103
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:12,560
on

104
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,560
russian relation to mh17 crash

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:32,000
next initiative responsible disclosure

108
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:37,199
frd it was set up

109
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,199
by ukrainian cyber alliance as well

110
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:46,240
i told on frd in details

111
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,880
at some cyber conferences including

112
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:52,960
international ones

113
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:57,520
at a glance this was something like

114
00:06:52,960 --> 00:07:00,560
patriotic activists flash mob

115
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,120
when activists make public incredible

116
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,160
facts

117
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:07,599
of low protection of critical

118
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:10,319
infrastructure including governmental

119
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,319
resources

120
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:17,440
it should be said previous government

121
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:20,560
didn't like frd but

122
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,919
supported it unofficially because

123
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:27,120
eventually

124
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:27,120
it was useful for the country's security

125
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,400
current government fabricated false

126
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:37,360
criminal investigation

127
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:45,758
against activists and the project died

128
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:49,120
in february 2020

129
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:52,639
so what has ukrainian government

130
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:59,840
been doing since 2014

131
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:59,840
let's consider facts and figure it out

132
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:08,240
more cyber centers had been set up

133
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:13,840
for millions of dollars however

134
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,840
they still don't work correctly

135
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,919
law of ukraine of main principle of

136
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,119
providing cybersecurity of

137
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:27,280
ukraine this law was

138
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:30,720
adopted in 2017.

139
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:33,760
below is very weak

140
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:37,200
and doesn't work now it was

141
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,479
born only because of western partners

142
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,680
requirements

143
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:45,600
to and in law on cyber

144
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:48,800
any according to

145
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:51,839
current valid law six

146
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,719
central authorities and one coordination

147
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,040
center

148
00:08:52,720 --> 00:09:00,160
should provide national cyber security

149
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:03,760
all of them are governmental

150
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:08,480
agencies no private sector

151
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:12,000
no community no ngo no academia

152
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:15,200
only total government

153
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,399
and of course such a system

154
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,399
cannot work

155
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:28,160
totalitarian draft law number

156
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,160
6688

157
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:35,120
it was about digital civil surveillance

158
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,800
and against freedom of speech freedom of

159
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,560
the internet

160
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:44,439
freedom of access to information

161
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:46,160
ukrainian parliament tried to vote it in

162
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:51,519
2017

163
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:55,199
and 2018 twice

164
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:59,200
but civil society and cyber community

165
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,200
united and stopped it

166
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:09,279
and incredibly motivated blocking

167
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:12,880
of about 100 websites

168
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,880
by ukrainian courts

169
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:19,680
a quotation from court's decision

170
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:23,199
to arrest intellectual property

171
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:26,640
right which a website visitor

172
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:30,240
gets by viewing this

173
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:35,040
website one more time

174
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:38,160
to arrest intellectual property right

175
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:42,800
which a website visitor gets

176
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,800
by viewing the website

177
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,279
more than 100 websites including big

178
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,120
platform

179
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:54,160
with million of users like enigma.ua

180
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,160
have been blocked

181
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:05,680
they are still blocked now

182
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:08,959
in november 2019 vice prime minister

183
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:12,839
minister of digital transformation mr

184
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:14,239
mikhailov fedorov stated literally

185
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:18,000
following

186
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:21,519
i think that the role of cyber security

187
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,560
is a bit overstated

188
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,560
vice prime minister

189
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,800
this is how my emotions look like on the

190
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,920
previous statement

191
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:36,479
and of course this is picture of

192
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,479
loyalty

193
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:46,160

197
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:58,240
governmental application dia

198
00:11:53,760 --> 00:12:02,720
this name could be translated as action

199
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:06,240
its security still haven't been proven

200
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:10,800
no documentation no security reports

201
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:15,279
no open community research nothing

202
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,279
just trust us guys it's secure

203
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:26,399

238
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,439

245
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:38,560
covet agitators they

fabricate criminal investigations

247
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,319
against

248
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:45,279
activists they

249
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,880
purchased electronic surveillance

250
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,760
complexes

251
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:52,160
in two times more expensive that it

252
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,160
should be

253
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:59,839
they they catch horse and

254
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,839
play football

255
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:08,240
what else no improvement of cyber

256
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:13,839
legislation since 2017

257
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,839
no one nothing

258
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:19,040
million dollars and million euros from

259
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,920
united states

260
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,120
european union international

261
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:27,839
organizations

262
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,839
have been wasted

263
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:36,639
so what all mentioned above

264
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,639
mean in my humble opinion

265
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:44,719
to be honest the lessons have

266
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:47,920
not been learned at least by

267
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,920
ukrainian government

268
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:57,439
critical infrastructure is still very

269
00:15:53,040 --> 00:16:02,560
weak against potential cyber aggressions

270
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,560
like in 2014 2017

271
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:10,959
private public partnership still

272
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:14,160
does not work in cyber security field

273
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,160
of ukraine

274
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,680
cyber tour ukrainian cyber authorities

275
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,120
are still

276
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:27,040
impotent because of lack of

277
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,040
qualified staff mainly

278
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:37,839
and those authorities ignore

279
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,839
community driven initiatives

280
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,758
oh this is just a funny picture i like

281
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,320
it

282
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,320
do you like it

283
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:55,199
local experts are very disappointed

284
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:58,240
with the government's ridiculous effort

285
00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:01,279
to strengthen national cyber security

286
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,279
in cyber protection

287
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:10,720
everyone protects itself only like

288
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:10,720
many years ago sorry

289
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:18,400
personally i created at least three

290
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:21,120
conceptions on how to build an

291
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,679
efficient effective cyber security

292
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,719
system

293
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:27,839
in the country i

294
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,440
presented them three times at cyber

295
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,799
conferences

296
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:36,320
i met politicians and officials

297
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:40,160
and tried to explain them

298
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:43,600
what is wrong and how to improve it

299
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:46,640
no reaction no positive changes

300
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,159
i met foreign diplomats from donald

301
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,360
countries

302
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,080
and they noted they noted yes you're

303
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,600
right

304
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:59,199
but continued financing of

305
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:03,520
useless programs so

306
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,520
i have no idea ideas anymore

307
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:15,600
this is how optimism in ukrainian

308
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:19,039
national cyber security looks like

309
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:23,600
ladies and gentlemen we live in such a

310
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:26,640
sad reality sorry i cannot inspire you

311
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:29,840
and give you false hope

312
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:33,919
our country is still not protected

313
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,918
like in 2014

314
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,520
to make your mood better after this sad

315
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:45,679
presentation

316
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:49,679
just look at that funny pictures from my

317
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:56,000
personal collections and have some fun

318
00:18:49,679 --> 00:19:01,039
this first one is about cat

319
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,039
second one about proper english

320
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:11,840
next one about pronunciation

321
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:24,480
and this is something like very

322
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:29,919
hard to understand joke but i like it

323
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:33,039
oh there is a positive news although

324
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:36,840
the us government is going to

325
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:41,039
support ukrainian cyber security for

326
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:43,760
38 million u.s dollars

327
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:46,480
and this is the biggest amount of

328
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:51,120
investment in such a specific

329
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:54,640
technical area however

330
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:57,918
the main beneficiary of this large-scale

331
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:00,960
scale project was determined

332
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:04,240
surprise surprise ministry

333
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:08,240
of digital transformation i mentioned

334
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,240
it in a in my previous slides

335
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:15,918
just a reminder head of the

336
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:19,200
ministry still believes that

337
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:22,559
the rule of cyber security is

338
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:25,679
a bit overstated

339
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,678
by the prime minister

340
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:33,039
and this is last funny picture for those

341
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:36,480
who is going to celebrate

342
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:39,919

343
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,559

344
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,640

and clear speech and i'm going to read

354
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,039
you some

355
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,320
questions from our q a session are you

356
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:18,720
ready to answer

357
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:21,840
yeah i do okay so the first question is

358
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,080
um what are the worst

359
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,678
current threats to ukrainian government

360
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,480
cyber security now

361
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:31,600
attackers insiders or bad security

362
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,600
culture what is it

363
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,640
actually in our world there are a lot of

364
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,280
attackers protectors and and many other

365
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,480
threats

366
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:45,520
however the level of cyber defense and

367
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:49,440
cyber security depends on

368
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:52,080
about on mainly depend on depends on

369
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,960
cyber culture cyber security culture

370
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,320
level of

371
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:59,679
knowledge maybe skills experience

372
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:03,439
people it's it's a very serious factor

373
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:06,799
uh so uh from my point of view

374
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,679
cyber culture uh compared to other

375
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,039
threats

376
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:14,720
is a most important thing

377
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:17,520
to to build something

378
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,520
better protection

379
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,918
thank you for the answer we have another

380
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:24,240
one uh

381
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,960
what's the best strategy of improving

382
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,600
ukrainian

383
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,280
government cyber security you share a

384
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,240
lot of your thoughts and

385
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:35,360
recommendation in your facebook feed is

386
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,360
there a better way

387
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:42,880
so uh i wouldn't uh

388
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,520
all i thought on that uh on facebook

389
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,200
pages

390
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:51,280
on uh articles and i created

391
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,240
uh very big long reads on how to improve

392
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,639
it and now

393
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,520
i still don't know i i have no better

394
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,640
idea

395
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:01,360
how to improve it and it's a it could be

396
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:04,799
a very long speech for me from my end

397
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:08,000
so at a glance very

398
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:11,918
sure the government could could

399
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:15,039
not be a leading organization uh uniting

400
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:17,120
all cyber security people in ukraine to

401
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:19,760
protect our country better

402
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,360
uh it should be something like mix of

403
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,720
government

404
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,080
community uh probably academia and

405
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,440
science people

406
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,760
uh and many young people skilled

407
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,080
people not very skilled people it should

408
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:37,280
be trusted computing communities

409
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:43,120
trust trusted unity probably where

410
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:43,120
people uh at least trust each other

411
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:49,199
nowadays community

412
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,080
doesn't trust to government government

413
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,400
doesn't trust to

414
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:57,840
anyone uh all people who

415
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:01,279
do not trust to government and to uh

416
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:02,158
commercial companies etc something like

417
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:05,760
chaos

418
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,880
uh this is where no one can trust to

419
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,640
each other

420
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:14,559
so uh the target number one or from my

421
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:16,559
my opinion uh it should be to set some

422
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,760
some organization or maybe unity or

423
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:21,440
maybe

424
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:24,640
i don't know which form it could be

425
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:27,679
uh something where people

426
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:30,640
can not trust but can trust

427
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:33,200
each other this is i think it should be

428
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,200
first time

429
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,320
thank you and the next question is

430
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,678
pretty interesting let me translate it

431
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,559
to you

432
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,919
uh if you were head of ministry of

433
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:47,840
digital transformation

434
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,840
what be your first steps

435
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,440
if i be it's absolutely fantastic

436
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:58,720
situation

437
00:24:53,440 --> 00:25:02,559
i won't be a government employee

438
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:05,760
never again never again so

439
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:07,678
uh uh i believe that

440
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:10,080
minister digital transformation

441
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,840
shouldn't

442
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:15,840
i i will i will do my best to ensure

443
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,840
that

444
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:23,600
okay oh yeah yeah you will uh

445
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,600
thank you vlad for your support

446
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:31,200
and yeah i believe that uh this ministry

447
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,799
is not useful for ukraine now this is my

448
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,480
my private opinion

449
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:40,240
um because of because of many things

450
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,240
so it's it would be long speech again

451
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:49,039
uh however uh it

452
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:52,480
i believe that someone it should be

453
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:54,799
some something like uh

454
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,559
government community and international

455
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,639
donors organizations

456
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,840
organization responsible for cyber

457
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,279
security in uh

458
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:05,439
in this in this country and to set up

459
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:07,600
such kind of organization would be very

460
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,679
very difficult

461
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:14,240
because of untrust because of uh

462
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,279
lack of cooperation lack of conversation

463
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,520
between people

464
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,799
and by the way thank you thank you for

465
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,520
no name conference

466
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:23,679
which unites cyber security expert and

467
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,559
professional professionals and

468
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:28,880
many people related to cyber security so

469
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:32,639
uh

470
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:34,480
this the first uh step would be

471
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,840
set up something like trusted

472
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,520
organization or maybe

473
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:41,840
trusted unity of people trusted

474
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,960
community maybe including government

475
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,240
including community

476
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,360
including commercial sector of cyber

477
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,960
security

478
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:54,959
including somebody else science academia

479
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:58,080
and etc so if

480
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:01,679
it probably if

481
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:05,039
it happens some somewhere

482
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:06,159
and i'll be involved in it in such kind

483
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:09,600
of uh

484
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:13,120
activities uh

485
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:15,678
i will do my best to

486
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:19,199
make people trust each other it it

487
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,200
should be first step from my end

488
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:24,320
okay thank you and the next question is

489

00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,159
no changes no negative changes no

496
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,880
positive changes

497
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:53,440
uh only deputy minister of digital

498
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:56,559
transformation mr alexey wisco

499
00:27:53,440 --> 00:28:00,720
said that

500
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:04,158

some

507
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:23,520
some kind of of this scenario

thank you alexander for your question

511
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:35,600
and one more question is there

512
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:39,520
any countries which steps in cyber

513
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,520
security ukraine should follow

514
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:46,320
oh probably

515
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:49,760
probably finland i like finland uh

516
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:51,360
approach uh because probably uh i know a

517
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:55,120
couple of people from there

518
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,000
from uh finland sword and how it works

519
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,559
there

520
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,960
uh how they improve how they cooperate

521
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:04,000
to with community with business

522
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:07,679
uh with people uh within the country

523
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,880
uh also i've been in uh

524
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:13,840
south korea uh

525
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,279
it they they have very very positive

526
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,520
experience however

527
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,640
i'm not sure that it could be applied

528
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,039
applied

529
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,000
for ukraine because of lack of mentality

530
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,720
because of

531
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,840
differences big differences in culture

532
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,840
and approaches into

533
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,840
some relationships between government

534
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,200
and people

535
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:38,799
etc however it works very good there uh

536
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:41,360
many countries uh i i i like

537
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,879
how they they cooperate and how they

538
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,918
work

539
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:49,760
mainly those countries are

540
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:53,440
germany great britain or

541
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:56,720
france uh mainly in the european union

542
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:59,600
uh it uh the

543
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,720
united states experience is very good as

544
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,959
well however

545
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,840
the strong rule of government in this

546
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,279
country i

547
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:10,320
i'm not big fan of that so

548
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:12,159
uh canada australia new zealand

549
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,439
many there are many countries we could

550
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:17,520
fall to

551
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:21,200
uh however ukraine has

552
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:24,559
unique way so we have to

553
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:27,600
we have to stay stay at at zero point

554
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:30,480
till now sorry okay

555
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,719
thank you uh the next question is really

556
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,440
a

557
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,080
nice question for debates from alexander

558
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,600
kache but

559
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:40,240
i will ask you it now is it possible

560
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:43,760
to support market price for government

561
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,760
cyber security specialist

562
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:50,879
uh one more time please is it possible

563
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:53,918
to support market price for government

564
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:58,320
cyber security specialist uh

565
00:30:53,919 --> 00:31:01,440
genius salaries yep uh

566
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:04,158
i don't think so uh actually it's a big

567
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:07,519
problem worldwide not only in ukraine

568
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,000
uh government pays less than commercial

569
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:11,279
sector

570
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,799
everywhere in great britain in

571
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:18,000
united states in new zealand everywhere

572
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:22,559
however a good practice would be to

573
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:25,919
uh involve commercial services

574
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:30,000
uh as an ad hoc or maybe a

575
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:33,120
uh how to external external company

576
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,080
providing services some services not all

577
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,959
services

578
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,399
are maybe related to cyber security not

579
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,120
completely whole

580
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,760
cyber security at the government agency

581
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:46,080
but

582
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:47,279
uh as uh freelancers or probably

583
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,639
external services

584
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:52,880
partially supporting uh

585
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,760
government's needs how it works

586
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,840
worldwide

587
00:31:53,760 --> 00:32:02,320
in in many different countries

588
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,720
uh at the same time i do not like idea

589
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,240
when

590
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:10,080
foreign governments finance

591
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:12,640
uh ukrainian government uh employees

592
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,399
make a paying them additional additional

593
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:17,679
seller or additional money

594
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:19,760
and it looks like uh probably a

595
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,720
foreign influence into our internal

596
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:24,320
policy

597
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,039
so uh i do not support this idea very

598
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,320
true

599
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:31,519
probably is it some best way right now

600
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:34,879
to to uh to fill the gap

601
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:37,200
great gap between uh salaries in private

602
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,840
sector and salaries in government etc

603
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,880
probably it's a just a temporary

604
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,399
solution

605
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:48,159
uh but i don't think it's a good idea

606
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:51,360
generally and to support

607
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:54,880
uh government

608
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:59,600
cannot pay private sector sellers

609
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:03,039
it's impossible everywhere every time

610
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,719
however it shouldn't be so great gap

611
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:08,720
between those salaries

612
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:11,360
it should be probably 10 or 20 25

613
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,120
differences difference between private

614
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:16,639
sector and government center

615
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:20,158
and government sector could uh hire

616
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:21,440
probably high level expert and those

617
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:24,240
high level experts

618
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,960
could hire external companies for

619
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,080
external

620
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,279
for uh some separated uh external

621
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,960
services

622
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:33,760
to to to supply some some part of cyber

623
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,840
security

624
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:38,080
or probably technical assistance

625
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,639
probably this could be a

626
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:43,039
good way from my point of view but at a

627
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,039
glance

628
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,120
thank you for this nice answer and we

629
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,320
have

630
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:53,439
one more question in our q a

631
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:55,360
session and in q a section maybe

632
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,720
if someone wants to ask one more you

633
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,639
could type it right now

634
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,559
and the question is what's the

635
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:04,080
difference between cyber war

636
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:08,079
and cyber terrorism if russia attacks

637
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:10,719
civil infrastructure i do not like term

638
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:12,560
cyber terrorism terrorism is a when when

639
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:15,598
someone somehow is died

640
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:20,000
somehow is killed uh because of

641
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:22,879
uh criminals yeah terrorists i i do not

642
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,440
there is no cyber terrorism cyber cannot

643
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:27,040
kill

644
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:29,760
uh nobody it's it's impossible

645
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,960
it could help with something with

646
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,240
communication

647
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:36,399
or probably if uh cyber terrorism

648
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,598
switched off uh electricity in a

649
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:41,040
hospital

650
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:44,159
where people is lying on on the on the

651
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,119
maybe some devices uh making the blood

652
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,480
pressure

653
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:51,520
so uh it's uh

654
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:54,879
they do not kill them directly

655
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:58,079
they switched off something which killed

656
00:34:54,879 --> 00:35:01,759
killed the uh some people

657
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:02,560
or a person uh so i do not like this

658
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,280
term

659
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,078
there is no cyber terrorism there is a

660
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,240
regular

661
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:13,599
terrorism uh which uses which which

662
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:17,359
use uses uh cyber technologies

663
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:20,480
and i.t technologies uh so it's

664
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:23,520
again this is my only private opinion

665
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:26,880
i do not like this term i i think

666
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:30,240
terrorist terrorists just use

667
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:33,680
uh cyber technologies i.t technologies

668
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,680
at some other advantages

669
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:38,720
so yep thank you for your answers very

670
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,920
good answer thank you for your speech

671
