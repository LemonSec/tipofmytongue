topic will be in

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,198
uh cyber attacks against georgia which

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,640
happened in

12
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,920
2019 uh there was a lot of cyber attacks

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,960
against georgia in uh

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,879
last 12 years but i'll specifically

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,559
talk about last year's attack because

16
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,559
it's uh

17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,000
interesting not from a technical point

18
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:47,120
of view but from political

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,719
point of view more and also um i would

20
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,440
like to talk a little bit about

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,559
georgian cyber security landscape uh we

22
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,440
made a

23
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,959
like uh research about uh internet

24
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,760
security level

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,800
of georgia of the country and i will i

26
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,800
want to share

27
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,239
a couple of information from these uh

28
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,119

i work at the bank currently and also i

34
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,840
work at my own company at cyber house

35
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,400
we do information security stuff like

36
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,320
security audit consulting so on

37
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,000
and also we have our own product cyber

38
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:30,158
class g which is uh cyber

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,040
uh game platform and let's continue is

40
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,079
our uh talk about cyber attacks against

41
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,479
georgia

42
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,199
uh so last year in october uh there was

43
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,400
a

44
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:44,240
cyber sox and uh uh

45
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:48,079
this cyberattack had uh global like uh

46
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:50,560
uh it was uh reported in bbc cnn

47
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,279
uh for like couple of days a lot of uh

48
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,079
news

49
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,320
foreign news were not talking about it

50
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:59,439
uh georgia was uh you know like uh

51
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,439
cyber security buzzword and uh

52
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,719
now it was reported as fifteen thousand

53
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,719
websites was hacked

54
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:08,878
it's a huge uh and uh can you imagine uh

55
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,239
fifteen 000 websites hacking uh like

56
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,440
simultaneously

57
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,400
and um on one hand it's all it was very

58
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,840
well publicized

59
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,440
this event but on the other hand uh

60
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,959
no we don't really have a lot of

61
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,840
information about this attack

62
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,879
i mean uh there is not uh if you just go

63
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,760
on

64
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,879
try to google and uh try to understand

65
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,640
more about this attacks

66
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,120
you cannot find any technical report

67
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,279
about it you just find the news that

68
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,800
fifteen thousand websites were hacked

69
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,760
and

70
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,879
now a lot of websites were defaced and

71
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,319
there was a

72
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,079
message with the former georgian

73
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:47,760
president mikhail sakashvili

74
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,959
um a picture of him with the written

75
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,599
with title i'll be back uh left

76
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,640
on the heart websites it was defacement

77
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:59,359
so it's interesting what happened really

78
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,920
what happened really is that as i said

79
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,800
publix

80
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,720
sources say not much but in reality one

81
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,360
hosting provider was hacked

82
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,359
and this hosting provider uh has

83
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,840
difficult a lot of different um

84
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,200
like internet services and they have 15

85
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,120
000 customers

86
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,720
and that's why this number was reported

87
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,720
that fifteen thousand websites were

88
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,040
packed in reality it was not

89
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,400
it wasn't the case uh fifteen thousand

90
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,959
websites weren't hard

91
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,680
work the only one service provider and

92
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,239
uh up to three hundred websites defaced

93
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,360
so it was a monthly phase they have just

94
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:36,239
one company

95
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:38,959
and this company had security issues

96
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,280
for a long time uh whoever worked with

97
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,840
them

98
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,959
they knew that they had some issues in

99
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,879
security

100
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:49,040
and most probably uh

101
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,560
the the attackers did not use anything

102
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,798
very sophisticated

103
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,599
and they did not use any like zero days

104
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,480
attack

105
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,959
zero days or uh very like advanced

106
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,840
malware which was not uh which was new

107
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,680
and no one

108
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,680
knew about it um

109
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,159
we think that it was very not very but

110
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,239
uh

111
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,679
relatively easy to get into this company

112
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,480
and

113
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,879
hack these 300 websites on the other

114
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,358
hand

115
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,159
are interested uh interesting uh why did

116
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:21,680
they do in

117
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,560
it in october uh for example this year

118
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,479
its elections

119
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,759
uh in 2020 by 2019 it was not any

120
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:31,840
particular happening

121
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:35,120
back then no political

122
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:38,320
crisis in georgia but this hack

123
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:42,080
had a political message because

124
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,520
they put a picture of former uh

125
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,159
georgian president mikhil sakhashville

126
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:49,280
there which i'll be back and uh

127
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,320
the hack itself did not had uh this in

128
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,840
georgia itself

129
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:57,199
did not had much uh like consequences

130
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:00,880
rather than this picture and

131
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:04,479
probably there was like some theories

132
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,039
who have done it and uh who was behind

133
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,758
it

134
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,960
uh from information security perspective

135
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,520
the people who are in

136
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,479
uh in the field of information security

137
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,120
the only

138
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,479
uh the most important thing from

139
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,320
information the cyber security

140
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,960
perspective a big fan in georgia was

141
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,320
that

142
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,000
law of informal law and information

143
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,039
security was introduced

144
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,240
in uh in the parliament it was

145
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:33,680
updates from the 2012 law

146
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,840
and um there in the parliament

147
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:41,120
there was an uh a new draft flow drafted

148
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:43,440
so um someone somehow there was a theory

149
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,639
that um the government wanted this law

150
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,880
to pass very much

151
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,840
and that's why they somehow organized

152
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,919
this hacking

153
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,758
and say that uh we have a very bad

154
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,198
situation from cyber security point of

155
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,320
view and that's why we have to improve

156
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,120
cyber security

157
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,639
and give um like georgian security

158
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,680
services a lot of power in cyber

159
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,639
security field

160
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,120
but um yeah this was just a theory no

161
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:09,199
technical information or no technical

162
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,199
clues uh were like

163
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,520
made public georgian police was

164
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,240
involved in the investigation but they

165
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,599
did not gave out any technical details

166
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,319
and uh so um

167
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,000
now also there was an idea that it was

168
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:30,080
uh covered up for larger and

169
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,039
stealth attacks and uh this is not um

170
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,719
this larger and the other attack wasn't

171
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,360
also publicized but

172
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,520
from like internal sources we know that

173
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:43,600
uh some of the smaller companies

174
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:46,960
were hacked also and

175
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,840
they are male uh their male systems were

176
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,719
used to target

177
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,758
other bigger companies and it was also

178
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,319
in october

179
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,759
also in october uh shortly before and

180
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,240
after the cyber attack

181
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,360
there was a talks on georgian tv

182
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,599
stations

183
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,080
two or three tv stations were attacked

184
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:06,400
one team station wasn't able to

185
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,960
communicate to the public for several

186
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:12,560
hours another tv station lost uh

187
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:16,000
all the recordings which they made like

188
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,319
in 2019 and they had

189
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,759
like huge problems uh on the other hand

190
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,880
these attacks uh

191
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:25,120
uh on these tv broadcasters

192
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,960
probably were like ransomware attack

193
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,160
generic ransomware attacks there is no

194
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:34,719
clue that it was organized by foreign

195
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:37,759
someone but still and the next big uh

196
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:41,360
like outbreak about this uh

197
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,080
attack was in march in the beginning of

198
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,360
march

199
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:49,120
when suddenly one day uh united states

200
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,919
and uk led the uh like the diplomatic

201
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,039
effort

202
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,240
condemning russia and more specifically

203
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,680
gru

204
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,720
uh a military uh surveillance agency of

205
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,800
russia

206
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,840
for organizing attacks against georgia

207
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,199
in october

208
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,878
and the uk and national cyber security

209
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,800
center said that uh they were almost

210
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,840
certain that it was gru

211
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,639
uh usa uh and and other countries

212
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,719
followed

213
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,160
like norway czech republic poland

214
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,280
estonia lithuania

215
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,599
netherlands and so on and so on like uh

216
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,479
at the same time there was like 40

217
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,759
countries

218
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:28,479
condemning russia for the attacks and

219
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,000
at this time at this point we hope that

220
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,319
there would be some kind of

221
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,200
uh technical report some kind of

222
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,320
indication

223
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:39,440
and like clues that it was really

224
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:42,719
done by russian but nothing so just

225
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,560
countries condemning russia and

226
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,640
saying that uh it was organized by

227
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,079
russian guys uh on the other hand uh

228
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,800
there are some unanswered

229
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,800
questions which people involved in uh

230
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,719
cyber security will uh will ask

231
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,319
definitely ask for example

232
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:00,399
uh jru is known for

233
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,920
their very advanced malware and the

234
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,080
advanced techniques and

235
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,399
sophisticated techniques to attack and

236
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,760
uh why did they attack

237
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:12,640
on this time in october uh 2019

238
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,360
uh then uh no political pressure was

239
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,720
there

240
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:19,200
uh i don't know nobody knows i just uh

241
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,640
people just have for the moment theories

242
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,399
so

243
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,560
uh so this attack was uh used uh like

244
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,000
politically it had political context

245
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,680
but uh there are still a lot of

246
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,480
questions which uh

247
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,760
need uh to be answered and still no

248
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,279
technical uh

249
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,240
uh issues and technical uh no technical

250
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,519
stuff

251
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:45,839
to uh

252
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,839
no technical details about this attack

253
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:54,240
what so um

254
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:56,800
uh some people say that uh uh it was uh

255
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,959
this diplomatic effort which was clearly

256
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,519
organized probably clearly was organized

257
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,518
by

258
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,160
united states and the united kingdom

259
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:07,120
because it was at the same time like 12

260
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,880
30 or 40 countries doing some uh

261
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,399
political announcements

262
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:15,760
uh but um like um they said that

263
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,720
it was used for deterrence against gru

264
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,399
and fsb

265
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,800
you know russia has a huge history

266
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,760
in interfering uh elections of other

267
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,120
countries

268
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:29,200
uh you know the story of american

269
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,920
elections of 2016

270
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,320
and its election year in georgia this

271
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,959
year

272
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,600
and it's election year in usa uh this

273
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,040
year

274
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:41,040
so uh probably it was like this

275
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,959
diplomatic effort was uh

276
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:48,240
like the terrorist step um

277
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,518
against russia not to uh to like to warn

278
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,600
them not to meddle with

279
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,279
uh the u.s elections or any other

280
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,640
elections uh this year

281
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:58,880
which they love to do a lot to do and uh

282
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,160
this also uh just confirmed that cyber

283
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,880
security is a

284
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,199
hot international political issue it's

285
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,399
not

286
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,560
like technical issue but it's a

287
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,279
political issue cyber security

288
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,119
uh if like 10 years ago uh it was

289
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,880
political issue from cyber espionage

290
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,519
perspective there was like a lot of

291
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,160
attacks and

292
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,160
stealing uh technological uh technical

293
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,680
know-hows and information now

294
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,640
it's like it's like about uh information

295
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,000
warfare

296
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:28,480
meddling in the elections so this scope

297
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,320
changed and this cyber attack also like

298
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:34,399
confirms that

299
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,720
uh but we know that um greu and fsp are

300
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,920
not

301
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,800
usually deterred by these political

302
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,199
announcements and

303
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,040
this political pressure and probably and

304
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,720
uh if you just uh

305
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:49,760
check um the

306
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,000
opinion of experts uh like

307
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,200
everyone expects that there will be some

308
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,680
activity in uh

309
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,480
in georgia in october or before and

310
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,479
after elections

311
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,120
during elections and also in united

312
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,279
states in the november elections so

313
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,240
uh it will be interesting uh what

314
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,000
happens

315
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,079
after this attack uh it was very

316
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,440
interesting to check

317
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,920
um we had also uh before that i want to

318
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,720
mention

319
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:17,199
cyber attacks again georgia in 2008. in

320
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,399
2008 georgia had war with russia

321
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,720
uh it was conventional war and uh

322
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,120
in parallel this conventional warfare

323
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,760
there was cyber attacks against georgia

324
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,959
uh during the war time in august which

325
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,480
uh totally

326
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:33,439
uh made uh impossible for georgia and

327
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,480
governmental and

328
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:39,600
media organizations uh to function

329
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:42,240
so uh and this attacks in 2008

330
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,120
um probably was probably was organized

331
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,639
by

332
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,880
russian government but these attacks

333
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,800
were not sophisticated it was very easy

334
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,120
uh easy attacks uh easy to

335
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,519
implement and easy to exploit and

336
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,040
because georgia had uh like zero cyber

337
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:59,040
security batman

338
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:01,680
and uh it showed this attacks in 2008

339
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,199
showed that uh georgia has like zero

340
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,040
level of cyber security

341
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,560
and last year then the cyber attacks

342
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,839
happened we were interested

343
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:12,880
uh what uh

344
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,000
can someone like organized in uh georgia

345
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,720
on internet

346
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,680
uh some kind of attacks which had which

347
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,720
will have

348
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,680
uh like big consequences but uh like me

349
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,720
smaller effort

350
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,560
we know that uh gre and fsb and other

351
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,480
like apart from russia other countries

352
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,119
have like cyber capabilities they can

353
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,680
write

354
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,560
very sophisticated malware and so on but

355
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,839
can

356
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:39,199
someone make like organized uh

357
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,680
countrywide attack easily and we decided

358
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,319
to do

359
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,279
um some kind of uh research on georgian

360
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,320
internet

361
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:49,120
and uh like research internet security

362
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,880
landscape and we decided to research uh

363
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,480
totally open source tools

364
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:56,639
um we use tools which are

365
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,880
like freely available on the internet

366
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:02,320
you can just download from there um

367
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:05,120
like on github from github or from

368
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,040
uh developers websites and report is

369
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,000
freely available here uh unfortunately

370
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,760
it's only in georgia

371
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,839
for the moment but all the technical

372
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,959
information is in night then charts are

373
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,600
in english so

374
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,239
if you just uh go to this link it will

375
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,920
be

376
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,600
i think it will be fully understandable

377
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,160
the results of this um

378
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,560
research and also we gathered some data

379
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,800
now from showdown

380
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,959
is not open source but is like 50

381
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,359
dollars you can

382
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:33,119
buy access to showdown and uh a lot of

383
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,240
data will be available uh

384
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,480
you know for uh you know for you which

385
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,519
uh in turn is uh gathered by sheldon

386
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,600
itself

387
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:45,680
so what we now researched is that um

388
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,680
vulnerabilities ntp vulnerabilities

389
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,239
vulnerable mail servers

390
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,040
smb and different technologies which are

391
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,639
used uh

392
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:57,439
in the country and

393
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,880
we wanted to know uh is there any like

394
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,480
big gaps in um

395
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,360
security and uh what you find is that uh

396
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,519
i just rang

397
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,040
just very shortly just a couple of

398
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,720
findings uh

399
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:14,000
uh 50 i think 71 servers

400
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,120
have had at least uh one and a ssl field

401
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,240
vulnerability

402
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,480
and out of this 71 uh more

403
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,560
more than half had higher critical

404
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,040
necessity and its vulnerabilities

405
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,638
and i can imagine that uh in these

406
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,040
errors are some

407
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,040
very

408
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:36,320
critical uh websites which

409
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,360
which have like governmental data

410
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,320
personal data

411
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,720
financial data and uh you can imagine

412
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,240
that

413
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,839
with high critical and slts

414
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,600
vulnerabilities this data

415
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:52,399
is like not easily accessible but

416
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:55,680
possible uh fairly easily possible to

417
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:58,480
gather this data from these websites so

418
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:01,040
uh why it should be noted that it it was

419
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,040
a big improvement from 2018

420
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,439
uh we had some open source data of uh

421
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,680
some independent researcher

422
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,639
uh in georgia together the ltl is dating

423
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,680
in 2018 and

424
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,880
there was a big improvement uh from

425
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,959
2018.

426
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,000
probably uh this widespread cyber

427
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,319
attacks made

428
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,399
georgian uh like smaller companies think

429
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,759
about their data and uh

430
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:26,639
their customers and um their liability

431
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,399
and they improved somehow uh and this

432
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,120
next interesting thing uh which

433
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,519
we found out was uh potential potential

434
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,839
for

435
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,759
ddos attacks with the dns amplification

436
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,639
or mtpm application amplification

437
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,920
attacks

438
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:44,639
and we checked for uh uh

439
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:46,479
dns recursive servers and also uh

440
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,079
you know servers which had uh some

441
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,279
vulnerability which could be used

442
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:54,719
for the ntp for authentication attacks

443
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:55,519
and we understood that um we estimated

444
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,160
that uh

445
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,600
only with georgian resources uh it's

446
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:03,120
possible to do

447
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:07,280
a four gigabit per second attack and

448
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:10,400
um you know as i remember um

449
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:13,039
as i remember it's um

450
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,039
the largest uh side like the dos attack

451
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:17,839
uh last year was like 19

452
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,799
gb per second uh four gigabit is like a

453
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,359
max mother

454
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:23,280
but uh if we like look at the experience

455
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:26,479
of georgian companies itself

456
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:29,520
it will be uh possible to uh

457
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:32,960
like uh tear down any

458
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:36,240
and like stop any services uh

459
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,400
in georgia because uh georgia is like a

460
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,280
small country and uh we don't have this

461
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,240
uh

462
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,960
um it's not so very much developed

463
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,480
designed

464
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:49,679
also cloud uh like protections for um

465
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,720
megan deduce attacks so this will be uh

466
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:56,080
enough to attack uh like

467
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:59,400
even bigger big georgian companies um

468
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,799
as i mentioned uh uh during the october

469
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,360
2019

470
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:05,360
uh georgian mail servers uh they were

471
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,120
hacked by uh

472
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,600
companies and we discovered that there

473
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:12,080
was still a lot of mail servers which uh

474
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,678
are accessible online and have critical

475
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,720
vulnerabilities

476
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,360
uh in critical vulnerabilities i mean

477
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,240
that

478
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,840
this it's very easy to exploit there are

479
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,520
automated tools there

480
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:28,639
and it's just easy to

481
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,080
get access to these mails um

482
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,160
we understood that wannacry is

483
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,520
intellectual uh this attack

484
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:37,600
was like three years ago it was using uh

485
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,600
that the long deprecated assembly

486
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,719
vulnerability in long duplicated smb

487
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,280
version one

488
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,120
but it's still actual in uh and uh it's

489
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,120
some myself

490
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,479
errors are even accessible like from the

491
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,719
internet and

492
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,880
from technology point of view uh it's uh

493
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,039
it was very interesting that um

494
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,640
three percent of websites in georgia are

495
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:59,600
using the andex metrica

496
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,600
yandex is a you know russian company and

497
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,959
the index metrica is

498
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:07,600
a tool uh which like

499
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,000
uh gathers the browsing uh information

500
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,280
like

501
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,679
google analytics uh or adobe analytics

502
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,320
but it can gather a lot of information

503
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,360
and

504
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:20,960
yandex is a russian company and

505
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:24,000
uh russia is like a

506
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:27,360
country which uh

507
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,720
is also reliable and we know that trust

508
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,799
a lot of russian companies

509
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,640
have to cooperate to cooperate with the

510
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:37,039
russian security services

511
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,360
so um um from what what's next steps for

512
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:41,679
us

513
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,678
we are thinking to um spread this

514
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,200
research to other countries uh in the

515
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,600
region

516
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,559
and uh maybe it's some more technical

517
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,600
details

518
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:54,399
uh we are we still gonna use only uh

519
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,918
like open source tools and what is like

520
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,080
openly available uh

521
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,120
openly available information we are not

522
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,799
scanning any

523
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,039
we are really doing any introduced cons

524
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:05,679
or whatever we are just uh

525
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:06,080
gathering the data what's on the surface

526
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,679
and

527
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:12,799
uh by this very simple uh

528
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:14,400
research it can be shown that there is a

529
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,879
lot of vulnerabilities which can be

530
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,159
found

531
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:21,280
uh you know on the in

532
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:23,039
the internet uh specifically in this

533
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:27,039
case in the country of georgia

534
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:29,200
and uh it's uh very easy to find

535
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:31,280
even critical vulnerabilities and use

536
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,080
these critical vulnerabilities to attack

537
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,200
companies yeah it's uh it's a very uh

538
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,559
sad story on uh

539
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:42,640
on this so um that uh

540
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:45,760
was my like talk uh very brief and

541
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:49,840
i would like to answer questions if you

542
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:53,200
if you have any i will um like

543
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:56,080
yep thank you for this interesting talk

544
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,880
uh thank you for sharing this research

545
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,960
with a lot of

546
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,640
interesting technical information of

547
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,640
course we have bunch of questions for

548
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,840
you from our q a station

549
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,919
and if you're ready i will start so

550
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,600
the first question i see is the same

551
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,720
question as we asked because thinking

552
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,959
about ukraine

553
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,919
now let's talk about georgia what are

554
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,159
the worst

555
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,280
current streets to georgia government

556
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,559
cyber security

557
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,280
now attackers insiders or bad security

558
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,080
culture

559
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,960
and as i remember constantine said that

560
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,360
bad security

561
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,600
culture is the worst for ukraine what

562
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,719
about georgia

563
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:36,639
uh okay i'll try to bring some examples

564
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:39,280
uh in 2008 as i mentioned uh it was very

565
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,679
not sophisticated very easy attacks

566
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,600
totally blocked

567
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,840
georgian governmental agencies uh

568
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,320
because we had zero level of security

569
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,799
we had no security culture we had no

570
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:53,520
technical security levels up so

571
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,960
uh but after that there was like two big

572
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,960
attacks in georgia

573
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,320
organized uh probably by russian

574
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:03,520
security services

575
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,520
one was jerobot and asset made

576
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,960
a report about this you can find it on

577
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:11,039
the internet

578
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:14,159
and another was apt-28 apt-28 is

579
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,158
as i remember gru

580
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:21,678
apt and they

581
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,679
hacked into georgian government and

582
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,600
they used several sophisticated

583
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,640
techniques in this case

584
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:31,439
uh they um the main culprit was that

585
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,919
they got into governmental agencies by

586
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,080
uh

587
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,799
fishing with employee phishing then they

588
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:39,360
used some zero-day attacks against

589
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,879
operating system against microsoft

590
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,639
office and then

591
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,919
the lateral movement in blah blah blah

592
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,880
and so on so on

593
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,400
uh but uh the main threat i think in the

594
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,880
world in every country

595
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,000
is lack of cyber like human is still

596
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,559
weakest link

597
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,640
on the other hand uh what um you know

598
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,360
you feel like dwell on the experience of

599
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,000
uh

600
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,959
last year's attack uh this uh light

601
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,840
company

602
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,039
uh hosting provider which was hacked

603
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,360
hosted uh some

604
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,559
uh websites uh some governmental

605
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,639
websites

606
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,399
and as i mentioned this hosting provider

607
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,360
had some security issues

608
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,280
uh governmental agencies still decided

609
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,240
to host their website with them

610
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,840
and they were very easily attacked this

611
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,039
just shows that some governmental

612
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,520
organizations that

613
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:27,120
just did not pay enough attention to

614
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,440
their cyber security

615
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,719
did not check the like security level of

616
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,760
their hosting provider

617
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,600
did not check did not like made like

618
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,080
very simple security scans on their

619
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,760
website

620
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:42,879
or whatever so it was i just just clear

621
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:46,320
uh the negligence of security

622
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:49,600
uh main threat of course is like

623
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:52,960
russia because

624
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,678
yeah we had experience uh uh of russian

625
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,080
attacks

626
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,840
uh in the in the past we expected uh in

627
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:01,039
the future

628
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:03,039
and uh the main threat is uh like uh

629
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,799
russia but on the other hand there is a

630
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,720
problem that uh

631
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:09,120
from security for from like technical

632
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:12,320
point of view our security is not uh

633
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,520
is much better than in 2008 but it's not

634
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,559
on the level of

635
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,720
like which is required in 2020

636
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,080
and uh it i think in every country it's

637
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,200
problem of uh

638
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,799
like uh human uh human users it's very

639
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:28,480
difficult um

640
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:30,400
to even for like big rich

641
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,080
uh companies who have a lot of security

642
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,320
stuff they try a lot

643
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,080
to like rise awareness level but even

644
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,000
for them it's like difficult

645
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,600
for governmental agencies uh it's much

646
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,960
more difficult because they

647
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:46,399
they are understaffed and uh

648
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:49,919
they don't pay as much as attention

649
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:53,440
is like uh private companies

650
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,240
yep okay thank you for such a nice

651
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,520
answer

652
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,600
and one i think quite easy question

653
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,720
how do you think do you ukraine and

654
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,480
georgia have

655
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,480
similar infosec threats

656
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:11,440
um i think yes

657
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,120
because both of both countries have

658
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:16,880
problems with russia

659
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:20,479
so i think i think that

660
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:22,720
that's a common denominator in this case

661
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,720
and

662
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:28,080
it's a main similarity on the other hand

663
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,760
the

664
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:34,320
the security level of ukraine and uh

665
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,440
georgia are different uh for example we

666
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,200
did not

667
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,799
we have not seen as sophisticated

668
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,679
attacks in georgia as in ukraine for

669
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:43,520
example

670
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:45,520
uh in 2018 or 17 there was attack

671
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,720
against electrical power grid in iran of

672
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,279
frankie's region

673
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,840
which was a very sophisticated attack

674
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:53,679
and

675
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,959
uh as it seems to me ukraine is much

676
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:58,240
more dependent

677
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:02,159
on this uh like country wide level

678
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:04,640
uh of electric grids of water supply

679
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,679
uh on information technology than uh

680
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,400
georgia

681
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,960
uh and i think that uh ukraine in this

682
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,960
case

683
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,960
in this from this perspective can be

684
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,760
more more vulnerable

685
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,120
uh also ukraine has a much bigger attack

686
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,080
surface of course

687
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,120
there is like much bigger country uh and

688
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:25,439
uh

689
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:28,799
like georgia is a smaller target and

690
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,960
we can um if you like research uh

691
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,000
fsb and gear gre operations you can see

692
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,440
that there are some

693
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,120
like technic similarities uh from for

694
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,159
example from apt group

695
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:43,039
but in georgia it's like um

696
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,000
probably they aren't using as many zero

697
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:47,120
days as as

698
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,880
many like manpower or

699
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,479
sources in ukraine because ukraine has a

700
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,840
probably better security level

701
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,840
i think that so yeah

702
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:00,720
thank you and the next question

703
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,840
same also same as we asked question

704
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,559
constantine

705
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,600
are there any countries which steps in

706
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,480
cyber security

707
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,600
georgia should follow constantine liked

708
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,200
finland

709
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:17,039
as uh approach budgeting

710
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:20,080
uh that's a great question because uh

711
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:22,480
in after uh 2008 cyber attacks

712
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,279
in georgia government began thinking

713
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,360
about

714
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,320
improving cyber security in 2012 they

715
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,879
introduced

716
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,320
law on information security and they

717
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,080
defined critical information

718
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,520
infrastructure organizations

719
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,918
which was only governmental

720
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,360
organizations uh like there was like up

721
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,799
to 40 entities

722
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:43,600
but after eight years of this law

723
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,559
we can say that this law was failed uh

724
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,080
because uh

725
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,840
by statistics only like six

726
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:51,199
organizations implemented

727
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:54,320
its requirements and others did not so

728
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,600
this is uh like failure and now they are

729
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,639
updating this law

730
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:01,439
and they want to give powers to

731
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,120
georgia's security service because the

732
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,640
argumentation is that uh security

733
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,279
service has uh

734
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,240
like manpower human resources financial

735
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:11,679
resources

736
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:14,159
uh and capacity to ensure that uh

737
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:16,159
uh governmental agencies will rise their

738
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,919
security levels then they can like

739
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,640
demand from other security

740
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:22,480
other governmental entities to write

741
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,480
securities laws there are risks

742
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,520
uh there was a lot of talks about these

743
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,360
risks that uh

744
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,440
we are giving too much power to security

745
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,719
services and uh we were

746
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,720
discussing a lot of uh

747
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,639
a lot of uh examples from other

748
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,399
countries

749
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,080
i don't know finland's example to be

750
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:43,678
honest uh i know

751
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:46,879
like examples from united states uh uk

752
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:51,600
poland estonia uh germany

753
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:54,159
and these countries like um

754
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,199
of course have models uh which are uh

755
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:56,840
which you know like

756
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,799
takes into account the country's

757
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,559
specifics but uh

758
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,559
the main thing is that for example in

759
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:04,320
united states uh there is one

760
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,520
governmental organization needs

761
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,360
national institute of standards and

762
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,279
technologies who set the standard and

763
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,520
there are other organizations who

764
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:12,399
enforce the standards and also there is

765
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,600
uh

766
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,399
uh like uh some organizations who do the

767
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,240
audits

768
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:23,600
so this uh like uh kind of uh

769
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:26,559
uh the differentiation of uh

770
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,279
like uh powers is i think critical there

771
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,200
should be one

772
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:31,039
entity which study standards another who

773
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:34,320
enforces and the third one who just

774
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:36,879
uh does the audit and i think that uh

775
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,678
and the georgian law does not uh have

776
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,039
this

777
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:43,360
and uh every everything is done by uh

778
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,879
will be done if this if this law will be

779
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,360
enforced will be done by

780
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,200
state security service and which uh i

781
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:52,320
think that uh isn't right and

782
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,399
uh it will not be effective also uh also

783
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:57,678
in the uk um

784
00:29:54,399 --> 00:30:00,080
there is a ghcq which uh like

785
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:02,000
um national cyber security center is a

786
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,600
part of ghcu which is uh

787
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,039
security service but on the other hand

788
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:08,320
the security service

789
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:10,720
uh is part of

790
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,520
ministry of foreign affairs so there is

791
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,960
uh

792
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:18,158
uh there is a civil uh control and civil

793
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:20,720
uh oversight over uh on this

794
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,159
security services so i think that the

795
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,559
main point is that uh

796
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,520
there should be some like division of

797
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,520
powers

798
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,120
uh in cyber security regulation those

799
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:33,120
and also there should be

800
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:36,639
very clear uh civil oversight on

801
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:40,639
whoever will be uh governing uh

802
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,640
like uh cyber security

803
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,520
thank you for your long long but

804
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,679
interesting answer and

805
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:50,080
let me choose the next question it's a

806
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:53,520
question from question tim course

807
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:55,840
and he asked cyberhouse.je

808
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,519
is it a government agency or

809
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,959
organization no it's private

810
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:02,559
organization right

811
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,960
right okay

812
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:06,559
so the next one do georgia have

813
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,840
something similar to our

814
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:14,080
frd activity no

815
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:18,240
uh actually um frg was uh as i remember

816
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:20,879
uh volunteer right volunteer force no

817
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,480
there is nothing uh in georgia like this

818
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,840
we don't know

819
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:28,000
uh okay so next one uh michael

820
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:30,840
are you expecting any big attacks

821
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,240
related to the upcoming elections in

822
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:35,279
georgia

823
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:38,399
um from uh

824
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:40,320
from technical point of view uh

825
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,760
yes we we are expecting some kind of

826
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:46,158
cyber activity

827
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:50,000
uh but as uh like last year showed uh um

828
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:52,080
probably it's not like necessary to do

829
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,279
very sophisticated attacks to have like

830
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,360
big impact

831
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:57,919
uh because of the like security levels

832
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,678
of the different organizations here

833
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:02,320
but on the other hand we are expecting a

834
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:06,240
lot of uh information warfare campaigns

835
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:08,960
i mean uh like campaigns in social media

836
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,360
in uh media which are controlled by some

837
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,240
uh

838
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,199
like forces to uh like disinformation

839
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,080
campaigns

840
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,279
and it's uh for the moment it's like

841
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,600
going on even now

842
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:21,760
and we are expecting this to be very

843
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:24,879
reactive uh before elections

844
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,320
and uh yes we are expecting no i can say

845
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,399
that we are expecting some cyber

846
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,799
activity cyber cyberattacks

847
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:32,399
it will be logical continuation of last

848
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:35,440
week

849
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:38,000
okay the next one

850
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:40,320
what is happening in security education

851
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,080
in georgia at university school

852
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:46,720
some courses um actually

853
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:49,519
i graduated from estonia because i

854
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,000
graduated in 2012 back then there was

855
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,600
nothing

856
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,600
from cyber security point of view in

857

actually

906
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:12,560
so whilst connecting people it's

907
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:16,000
beautiful yes yeah

908
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,960
and let's talk about salaries is there a

909
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,280
large difference

910
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,680
in salary for the commercial sector and

911
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:25,280
government sector

912
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:26,399
yes um it's a like uh there is a lot of

913
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:30,880
difference

914
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:35,119
uh also i i must say that there is huge

915
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:38,640
uh like uh gap in human resources

916
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:40,320
uh for now like everybody is looking for

917
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,279
i.t security people

918
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,640
and every big organizations some

919
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,240
organizations like have

920
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,078
like six seven people over there but

921
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,000
they they need more if you are

922
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,880
like like large organizations have a lot

923
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:56,400
of cyber security like operations

924
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:58,079
so uh of course like private entities uh

925
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,560
pay more than government and

926
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,200
uh that so that will be one of the

927
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,880
challenges

928
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,598
for governmental organizations to

929
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:08,640
somehow uh

930
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:12,000
find uh something else to get

931
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:14,078
interesting people to work them

932
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,920
i myself for work for governmental

933
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,880
organizations now i work uh in the

934
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,160
private sector

935
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:22,960
so yeah we understand it yeah so

936
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,759
and one more specific question what do

937
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,800
you think

938
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,400
the fall of drones in georgia was also

939
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:32,320
the result of cyber attack

940
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,320
or the sale of source code

941
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:41,839
full of drones from drones when

942
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,839
yep i also do not know this news

943
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:50,720
from um who is that and what

944
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:54,400
who is the author of this question okay

945
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:56,799
so yeah

946
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,000
yeah that was a question from a youtube

947
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,359
stream

948
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:04,640
so i know nothing about fall of drones

949
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:05,759
but if uh the the person that asked this

950
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:09,040
question can you like

951
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,880
follow up and tell us more details

952
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,040
me and a while uh because there is a

953
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:16,320
delay so meanwhile

954
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:19,839
um like uh mihail

955
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:23,760
do you think that like what is it often

956
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:25,200
uh what is it often source of

957
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,160
this kind of you know unpredictable

958
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:31,759
event uh is it like a cyberattacks or

959
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:33,200
is it uh like people just make mistakes

960
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,200
and you promise the sense that people

961
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:38,078
are everything right so security is like

962
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,200
connected with how people behave but

963
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:42,800
cyber attacks

964
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:46,160
often so often in georgia

965
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:48,560
um reading and like today i talked about

966
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,720
cyber attacks against government but

967
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,720
last two years uh was very active from

968
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,879
cyber crime perspective too

969
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,759
georgia is getting more and more uh like

970
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,800
online

971
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,680
uh in a sense that uh online financial

972
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,240
services are

973
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,399
like developing very quickly and a lot

974
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,560
of people have like internet banking

975
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,520
uh use internet banking mobile banking

976
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,520
and last year

977
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,680
was like several days of phishing

978
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:14,560
attacks against uh people

979
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:15,598
like on facebook and it was like well

980
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,839
organized

981
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:19,200
we were like setting up like some

982
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:22,720
facebook page

983
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:24,000
then some website and they were they had

984
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,319
even call center

985
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,920
and a lot of people in georgia like uh

986
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,200
have uh like the two-factor

987
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,880
authentication

988
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,560
and uh there was like these cyber

989
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,960
criminals had call center

990
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,160
and uh like for example i have two

991
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,160
factor authentication

992
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,598
and i am lured into some phishing

993
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:42,078
website and now

994
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:44,160
it needs like they bought my password

995
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:46,320
but they don't have sms code

996
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,598
uh so on this call center they were

997
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,640
calling this customer

998
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:51,359
they are asking on facebook their like

999
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,598
phone number

1000
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:55,200
then they're calling and asking for sms

1001
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:57,760
and entering like this

1002
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:59,680
on internet bank and changing their

1003
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,560
settings and so on and so on and

1004
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,960
a lot of people were like uh victims of

1005
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:06,400
this

1006
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:07,440
kind of crimes and uh probably it was

1007
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,480
organized by

1008
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:13,760
foreign cyber criminals who operate

1009
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:16,079
who came to operate in georgia and uh

1010
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,680
there were several arrests made these

1011
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:21,040
waves are still continuing

1012
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:25,919
2020 but uh it's not not

1013
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:29,279
that not at large scale is uh last year

1014
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:31,520
also a real like preparation to

1015
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,280
to do that i mean sit up concentrate on

1016
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,640
this work that that's a lot of efforts

1017
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:38,079
yeah it was a

1018
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:40,078
lot of like at least uh like

1019
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:41,359
four or five people who were involved in

1020
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:44,880
this

1021
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:47,920
operations and also we know that uh

1022
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:51,040
there are some very large

1023
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:53,200
uh international cyber crime groups

1024
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:56,800
uh active in georgia and targeting

1025
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,799
georgian financial institutions

1026
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:03,200
