1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:08,219
it's very very iet's mount speakers from

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:15,719
taking level management level it's

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:17,670
awesome you see in the audience in the

4
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:22,350
background but it's a good knowledge

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:25,769
moments obscured it really free awesome

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:28,439
i think the corporation and the

7
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:34,140
collaboration between government and

8
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:37,380
private sectors crucial cooperation we

9
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:42,480
in there the government ncsc and private

10
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:44,010
sector both side and what i see if you

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,589
add its proliferation of buddies aware

12
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:50,280
about the security we have to deal with

13
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,960
that's never ending story cyrus keeps

14
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,629
right now that's all we need to

15
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:58,039
collaborate in the trend is real to give

16
00:00:54,629 --> 00:01:00,358
more in ukrainian authorities everything

17
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:02,070
so yeah absolutely

18
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:03,239
very good to have to cooperate there's

19
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,129
really good to have all those questions

20
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:08,189
and to see that people have the

21
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:16,470
awareness and realize that cyprus future

22
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:17,880
is the next level is the next threat to

23
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,320
questions first of all would it be here

24
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,539
yes definitely because I like the

25
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,258
interaction between the minister is part

26
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,909
in the technical level

27
00:01:23,259 --> 00:01:28,149
I think that's very attractive because

28
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:31,719
you can choose what you want to see have

29
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:33,729
the discussion of people what should be

30
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:35,399
changed I think what would be in advance

31
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:37,840
you wanna have more cooperation between

32
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:39,159
government in the private sector the

33
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,890
government the private sector doesn't

34
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:43,630
end on the borders from agreement so I

35
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:45,240
think a more international level more

36
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:48,189
English speakers

37
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,630
Stendhal language that makes translation

38
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:50,889
a little bit maybe a little bit

39
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:53,140
difficult for some people but English is

40
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:56,679
living easier now we have all the

41
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:59,049
translations absolutely will organize I

42
00:01:56,679 --> 00:02:00,670
think that's giving more impacts than

43
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:03,250
people to know what their different

44
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:04,689
knowledge these are you can have no more

45
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,700
speakers to be caused by the visitors

46
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:09,239
overall I think they're coping advantage

47
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,240
definitely
