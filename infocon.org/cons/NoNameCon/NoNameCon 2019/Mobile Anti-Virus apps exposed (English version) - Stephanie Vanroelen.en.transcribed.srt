1
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,410
thank you for the great introduction I

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:12,390
didn't really understand any of it but

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:14,490
I'm sure it was a amazing so I'm gonna

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:16,949
introduce myself again in English just

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,890
to make sure nothing was left out my

6
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:21,419
name is Stephanie van Rowland I

7
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:23,730
currently work for an visa it's an IT

8
00:00:21,419 --> 00:00:26,579
security company in Belgium we do

9
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:31,319
anything and all the things security as

10
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:34,260
a consultancy so I'm I'm pretty sure I

11
00:00:31,319 --> 00:00:36,030
heard it before but I'm also part of the

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,820
organizing committee for Brooklyn that's

13
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,760
a conference in Belgium where we do IT

14
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:45,739
security as well and I also am the

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:56,248
co-founder of cyber school which

16
00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:59,819
inspired cyber kids here previously all

17
00:00:56,249 --> 00:01:03,780
right so my talk is about anti-virus

18
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:05,790
apps on Android mobile systems just

19
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:10,620
gonna quickly explain what I'm gonna

20
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:13,530
talk about so it'll what I did is I

21
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:16,200
researched a couple of antivirus apps on

22
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,360
Android mobile just to look and see if

23
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,940
our these apps really doing what I think

24
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,070
they're doing they really delivering on

25
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:25,620
their promise are they keeping my my

26
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:31,729
phone secure are they providing any edit

27
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:31,730
value' this is really loud by the way

28
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,899
I'll quickly explain how I did this

29
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:43,010
explained my research steps and then

30
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:47,220
I'll end with a conclusion let's go

31
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:49,950
all right so how did I get the idea for

32
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:54,150
this talk last year I gave a talk at

33
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:56,850
info security Belgium and it was on the

34
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:59,550
dangers of a rooted phone and bring your

35
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:01,140
own devices in a company so why is it

36
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:04,080
dangerous to have a rooted phone that

37
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,150
has access to company datum and you know

38
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:10,318
how can you defend against it and and

39
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:13,970
such the outcome was you should probably

40
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:16,359
install mobile device management system

41
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:18,940
but at the end of the talk I

42
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,040
I had this person come up to me and she

43
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:23,770
was like you know I've been looking into

44
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:27,040
antivirus apps on mobile which one would

45
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:29,620
you recommend and I just kind of looked

46
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,220
at her and I was like I don't know I

47
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:34,390
mean I could give you the top five

48
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,130
providers that probably give you an app

49
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:37,720
but I can't really tell you if they're

50
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:39,910
any good if they're actually doing what

51
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,430
they're supposed to be doing if they're

52
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:44,170
doing hidden stuff well then I got

53
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,600
thinking why don't I know this I mean

54
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:49,510
I'm IT security specialist I should be

55
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:51,970
able to answer such a simple question so

56
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:54,070
then I decided to research this a little

57
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:57,910
bit to be able to provide a good answer

58
00:02:54,070 --> 00:03:00,190
of you know a well-grounded answer an

59
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:06,640
answer that's based on you know data and

60
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:08,530
not just stuff I read on the Internet so

61
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,589
what I did was I did a little bit of

62
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:15,400
market research and I came up with the

63
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:19,300
top five apps on Android that do

64
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:23,080
antivirus so we have Kaspersky that does

65
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:25,660
it we have a vast Norton then we have

66
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,030
something that androids itself provides

67
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:31,420
it's a mobile security it's called clean

68
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:34,060
master and finally we have sofas those

69
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:40,029
are the top five apps on the market at

70
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:40,840
the time of my research then I was

71
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,910
thinking you know I should probably

72
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,370
think of a couple of questions I want

73
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:48,280
answer to be able to say yes this is

74
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:50,290
good antivirus software so it needs to

75
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,080
you know detect if there's malware on

76
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:55,140
your phone then it needs to quarantine

77
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:59,769
or remove this malware from your phone

78
00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:02,170
it shouldn't do anything hidden so the

79
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:04,180
app should do as it says and not you

80
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:05,950
know gather a whole bunch of data and

81
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:09,160
send it secretly to back to their main

82
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:15,060
offices and finally does the app provide

83
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:19,630
any added value so I started my research

84
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:22,210
and for this I had to set up my research

85
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:25,539
environment so what I did is I had a

86
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:30,109
laptop I set up a collie VM in this case

87
00:04:25,539 --> 00:04:33,438
it was the collie 2018 64-bit

88
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:40,669
version I had a rooted Nexus 5 with

89
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:43,219
android 6.0.1 on it it's a clean install

90
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:45,169
it's a clean phone so I reinstalled it

91
00:04:43,219 --> 00:04:48,560
there was no data on it and then I

92
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:51,378
routed it I also use the pineapple Nano

93
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:56,180
Wireshark and burp sweet to intercept

94
00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:58,490
traffic so there's a couple of

95
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:00,620
assumptions you should probably have in

96
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:02,990
mind one once I'm going through my steps

97
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,159
so once you definitely need a rooted

98
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:07,879
phone if you're doing this kind of

99
00:05:04,159 --> 00:05:09,979
research if you have a rooted phone you

100
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:12,110
can just have access to all the data and

101
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:14,539
all the file paths on the filesystem

102
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:15,889
beneath it which gives you a better

103
00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:20,030
access and a better view of what's

104
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:21,740
happening the second thing and probably

105
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:25,400
really important if you don't know this

106
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:28,580
already use non-isolated network so if

107
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:30,739
you're communicating over Wi-Fi between

108
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:32,599
your laptop and your mobile device it

109
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,979
has to be on a non isolated network

110
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:36,830
because otherwise the devices cannot

111
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:39,349
talk to each other I remember a couple

112
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:42,198
years ago I didn't really know this and

113
00:05:39,349 --> 00:05:43,969
it took me forever to figure this out so

114
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:48,110
I'm just giving it to you right now

115
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:50,990
don't lose time on this and finally have

116
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:52,190
your burps sweet certificate installed

117
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:56,930
on your phone because otherwise it's not

118
00:05:52,190 --> 00:06:00,259
going to work all right so what steps

119
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:03,409
did I take first you know I installed

120
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:05,150
all the apps on the phone after a quick

121
00:06:03,409 --> 00:06:07,219
research I realized that you know

122
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:09,049
installing all the apps at the same time

123
00:06:07,219 --> 00:06:14,150
they don't interact with each other so

124
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:16,819
it was fine then second you know use the

125
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:19,789
app like a normal user just install it

126
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:22,250
open it up have the settings go in have

127
00:06:19,789 --> 00:06:25,909
the app scan the phone to see if there's

128
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:27,800
any malware on it etc then the next step

129
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:30,229
is you know pull all the files from the

130
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,509
phone and pull the official app because

131
00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:34,699
the first step is installing all the

132
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:37,690
apps from the Google Play Store so you

133
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:37,690
have the official apps

134
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:48,300
then then the next step is you know

135
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:50,130
taking a look at the logs for me I

136
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,930
always start by looking at the logs

137
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:54,090
because it's a it's a good way to get

138
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:57,030
you know hints and tips on where to look

139
00:06:54,090 --> 00:07:01,469
and you know where to go what classes to

140
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:04,049
look for then I will you know do network

141
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:07,470
traffic analysis this is both web

142
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:10,920
traffic and you know general internet

143
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:12,480
traffic using wireshark then just look

144
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,790
take a look at the app itself you know

145
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:19,520
do you compile it unzip it take a look

146
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:22,380
at it and then once you've done all that

147
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,659
then we install malware on the phone see

148
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,950
if the app detects it right are these

149
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,950
apps actually doing what they're saying

150
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:32,670
they're doing then repeat steps two

151
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:36,990
through five and finally compare data

152
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:40,500
and making a conclusion so step one is

153
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:43,770
installing all the apps so right away I

154
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:47,190
ran into a little bit of a hiccup

155
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:49,500
I started installing the apps and the

156
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:51,900
sophist app you know asked me for Super

157
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:54,630
User rights right away but that just

158
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:56,489
yeah had that red flag race for me and I

159
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:58,800
was like wait I'm supposed to be looking

160
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:00,660
for an app that I recommend and this

161
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,090
one's already asking for super admin

162
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:05,250
rights forget it so I just dropped that

163
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:07,440
because I had a lot of time constraints

164
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:12,450
so I dropped the app and I didn't even I

165
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:16,469
didn't even look at it furthering step 2

166
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:18,599
is using it like a normal user so I

167
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:21,750
installed all the apps use it like a

168
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:23,850
normal user you know scanned nothing

169
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,620
really special came out of it some of

170
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:28,170
the apps told me my phone was rooted

171
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:30,810
other app students which is interesting

172
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:32,400
for antivirus software that some of the

173
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:38,400
apps don't report that your phone is

174
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:40,829
rooted alright so step three is pulling

175
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,870
all the data from your phone right it's

176
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:45,810
clean data there's no malware installed

177
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:48,150
it's a clean phone so just regular usage

178
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:50,130
so I pull the app from the phone but

179
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:51,430
I'll also pull all the data files all

180
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,410
the databases

181
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:56,290
anything related to the app I'll pull it

182
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:59,319
on to my computer to check it out the

183
00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:02,020
first thing that really hit me was these

184
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:04,830
apps are really big I mean a regular

185
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:08,199
Android app is usually around 15 Meg's

186
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:09,850
these are way bigger you know if you

187
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:13,140
look at Kaspersky it's the biggest one

188
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:16,210
out there it's more than 45 M B's so

189
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:18,370
really big begs the question why are

190
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:22,680
these app so big they're just scanning

191
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:24,940
your phone right or they're supposed to

192
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:29,260
so that got me really thinking what

193
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:33,820
what's going on here then step 4

194
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:35,710
he's taking a look at the logs there's a

195
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:37,180
whole bunch of logs when you start

196
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:38,920
running your app on an Android phone and

197
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:40,870
I mean it keeps going it doesn't stop

198
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,699
and you just go in through all the

199
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:44,980
through all the logs it's it's tedious

200
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:48,310
work but it gives you interesting stuff

201
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:51,490
I took a little screenshot from a little

202
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:53,410
part and beneath it it if I don't know

203
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:57,100
if you can see it but it says you know

204
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:58,480
hey store something in this directory so

205
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:01,510
there you go you go and look at the

206
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,250
directory in this case it was just you

207
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:05,830
know a cached image so it's not nothing

208
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:08,830
really juicy but it gives you an

209
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:12,010
indication of how I went about it you

210
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:15,330
know just looking at different class

211
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:17,770
names to look at different storage

212
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:23,490
places you know what what are the apps

213
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:29,170
doing step 5

214
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:31,840
network analysis great so I was thinking

215
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:33,280
all right so these these mobile app

216
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:38,440
builders they're doing a really good job

217
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:41,920
they're pretty advanced so I installed a

218
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:43,570
pineapple nano to capture all the

219
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,150
traffic I was doing with my phone and

220
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:47,590
then I took a look at it with Wireshark

221
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:50,110
which gives you you know a whole bunch

222
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:52,060
of domains to look at if you really want

223
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:53,860
you can go in and dive in further and

224
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:57,160
look at the domains are they secure they

225
00:10:53,860 --> 00:11:00,610
safe whatever but a couple of weird

226
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:04,610
things came up for example one of the

227
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:07,100
apps asked for my current IP address

228
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:10,850
begs the question why does the antivirus

229
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:12,740
really need my IP address like you

230
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:15,920
really think about it does it matter if

231
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:20,120
I'm at this IP or that IP are they gonna

232
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:23,360
do something different with it maybe you

233
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:26,930
know I can I can imagine they can use it

234
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,970
for actors or lists that they have to

235
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:31,609
see if you know if I'm an evil device or

236
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:33,290
something I don't know that I thought it

237
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:34,040
was like yeah you know I wasn't really

238
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:37,660
sure about that

239
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:41,630
another one is asking my wife I date him

240
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:43,430
so they're asking hey what what Wi-Fi is

241
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:47,209
being used what's the name kind of

242
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:49,339
encryption stuff like that why does an

243
00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:51,439
antivirus app need to know that why is

244
00:11:49,339 --> 00:11:56,480
it being sent over why are they

245
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:58,130
collecting this data I don't know but to

246
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,220
be honest Wireshark didn't really pan

247
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:03,260
out I was hoping you know to see a lot

248
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,610
more a lot of the data that was being

249
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:07,550
sent that looked interesting was

250
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:13,220
encrypted so I didn't get to see what

251
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:18,410
they sent step six is gathering all the

252
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:21,140
data files looking at the app so I did I

253
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:23,269
looked at you know all the apps ID

254
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:25,939
compile all the apps I started to look

255
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:27,829
at all the interesting classes except

256
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:31,760
for in this case every single

257
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:36,739
interesting class that I could find was

258
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:40,149
off you skated okay from a research

259
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:42,680
perspective this kind of really sucks

260
00:12:40,149 --> 00:12:46,399
for a developer's perspective this is

261
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:48,050
great these these you know companies are

262
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,000
using the right techniques and they're

263
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:52,160
they're really you know paying attention

264
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,040
to making their codes secure which is

265
00:12:52,160 --> 00:13:00,529
great but from a research standpoint

266
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:05,390
this kind of blows another interesting

267
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:06,890
part here is if you d compile the apps

268
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:08,510
you get a look at all the permissions

269
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:10,130
that these apps are requesting and

270
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:11,720
they're not you don't see them because

271
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:14,750
they cut dating they don't come up when

272
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,490
you install them but there's like whole

273
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:18,380
bunch of informations I think one of

274
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:23,240
them had like 94 No

275
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:25,250
96 permissions that's all that's a lot I

276
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:28,400
mean if you look at a regular app you

277
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:31,750
know that I have like an 15 permissions

278
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:35,540
maybe he's had 96 and they're asking for

279
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:38,510
anything and everything this is also

280
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:42,800
kind of weird right I mean why do they

281
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:45,050
need all these permissions so I took a

282
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,630
couple of permissions to look at and to

283
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:51,949
talk about because you know 96 is a lot

284
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:54,980
and we would be here until tomorrow so

285
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:58,370
the first thing is they ask forget tasks

286
00:13:54,980 --> 00:14:00,140
what I did is I looked up on the Android

287
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:02,990
developer site exactly what these

288
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:08,140
permissions are allowed to do so on they

289
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:11,630
get tasks you have they're asking the

290
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:15,319
application that you know hey give me

291
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:17,240
all the running tasks and and give me

292
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:20,150
any and all information on these running

293
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:23,510
tasks this is pretty normal for an

294
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:25,220
antivirus I think it's an iffy

295
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:26,000
permission but I think for an antivirus

296
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:30,080
okay

297
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:33,410
I can understand this the next one is a

298
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:38,150
little bit funkier they're asking me

299
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:40,100
permission to call by they're gonna call

300
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:43,430
up my mom and say hey your daughter has

301
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:45,710
a virus on our freaking phone no it's

302
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:49,310
not gonna happen right so why do they

303
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:51,440
need permission to make a call still

304
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:56,209
don't know research the app still don't

305
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:58,550
know then request install packages this

306
00:14:56,210 --> 00:15:01,310
is a really interesting permission a lot

307
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:03,680
of malware's use this permission but

308
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:05,780
this permission does is it allows you or

309
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:09,739
it allows the app to install extra

310
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:11,300
packages on the phone and run them why

311
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:14,540
why isn't it

312
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:16,400
included in here in the original big ass

313
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:19,360
install that we are already pulling from

314
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:21,410
Google why do they need this permission

315
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,390
another one with the right settings

316
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:24,920
they're gonna change the settings on my

317
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:28,400
phone they have this permission they're

318
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:30,349
requesting it what are they gonna do on

319
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,579
my phone what kind of permissions are

320
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:34,190
they changing

321
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:37,760
also did not find out this reason but

322
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:41,000
it's in there another interesting one is

323
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:43,010
authenticate accounts what this does is

324
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,500
allows you to create new accounts but

325
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:51,290
also to change the passwords of existing

326
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:53,209
accounts getting scared yet antivirus

327
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:55,880
apps changing passwords of accounts on

328
00:15:53,209 --> 00:16:00,800
your phone what I don't want this I

329
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:04,420
don't want this on my phone and then you

330
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,420
know the last one I have on here is

331
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:10,880
mount format file systems so what this

332
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:14,209
does this permission allows you to

333
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:17,810
completely format the SD card on your

334
00:16:14,209 --> 00:16:20,899
phone not read it not write to it just

335
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:23,380
completely format the out of it so

336
00:16:20,899 --> 00:16:25,610
this antivirus app on your phone can go

337
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:26,810
you don't have anything important on

338
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:30,980
your phone I'm just gonna format the

339
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:33,050
 out of it ie no more data I don't

340
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:40,820
know why they would need this it just

341
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:42,920
seems excessive alright so now we get to

342
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:46,399
the interesting part let's install some

343
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:49,010
malware so what I did is I decided to be

344
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,930
a little bit thorough and install two

345
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:53,089
different malware so the first one is be

346
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:58,370
news it's a well known malware it

347
00:16:53,089 --> 00:17:01,730
creates a backdoor and it uses local

348
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:03,920
privilege escalation exploit nothing

349
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:08,530
special all the apps noticed this

350
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:13,010
immediately reported it quarantined it

351
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:15,918
the next one read drop I kind of use for

352
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:18,459
nostalgic reasons so in my previous talk

353
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:23,209
the one about bring your own devices I

354
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:24,740
created my own little malware just to

355
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:26,360
show the dangers of rooted phone and

356
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:29,150
what time what type of data I would have

357
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:32,120
access to and a week before I gave this

358
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:33,919
talk the report on this malware came out

359
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,928
it pretty much does exactly the same

360
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:39,080
thing I was going to do but then ten

361
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:41,750
times better and it's out in the wild

362
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,939
right so I thought it was really

363
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,309
interesting so I scoured the internet

364
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:48,230
for

365
00:17:45,309 --> 00:17:54,879
awesome little red drop malware version

366
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:54,879
I swear I didn't install it here

367
00:17:56,019 --> 00:18:00,110
interesting about this malware is

368
00:17:58,009 --> 00:18:03,019
although it's already reported and

369
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:06,049
relatively well known and it had been in

370
00:18:03,019 --> 00:18:09,889
the wild by back then I think more than

371
00:18:06,049 --> 00:18:14,809
six months not all of the apps reported

372
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:20,779
this so that was interesting to see you

373
00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:22,940
know antivirus not so much so then be

374
00:18:20,779 --> 00:18:24,830
repeated you know all the steps we use

375
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:28,070
the app we gathered the data we had them

376
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:31,840
scan it we pulled some data then we

377
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:34,639
started to compare the datum that we got

378
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:41,269
and to be honest I was a little

379
00:18:34,639 --> 00:18:44,119
disappointed if somebody asked me this

380
00:18:41,269 --> 00:18:46,789
question I still cannot answer it so I

381
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:49,039
did all this research and oh you know to

382
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:51,549
put a lot of time into figuring out

383
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:54,799
which antivirus app I would recommend

384
00:18:51,549 --> 00:18:57,129
the answer is none because I still don't

385
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:59,720
know and all these permissions and

386
00:18:57,129 --> 00:19:03,580
anything that would be interesting he's

387
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:08,330
encrypted or send encrypted but yeah I

388
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:12,139
have no conclusion for you which is from

389
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:14,178
research standpoint really annoying it

390
00:19:12,139 --> 00:19:16,519
was an interesting exercise for me to do

391
00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:18,649
I definitely want to you know jump in

392
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:20,929
more and try and break encryption and

393
00:19:18,649 --> 00:19:24,408
stuff like that but I didn't have the

394
00:19:20,929 --> 00:19:26,840
time to do it yet but I think the first

395
00:19:24,409 --> 00:19:28,309
thing I would do is take a look at all

396
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,678
these permissions and what what are they

397
00:19:28,309 --> 00:19:32,389
doing with it because breaking

398
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:35,350
encryptions not my strong suit so if

399
00:19:32,389 --> 00:19:39,258
anybody wants to you know go right ahead

400
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:40,119
uh but yeah I didn't have enough info so

401
00:19:39,259 --> 00:19:48,220
there we go

402
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:48,220
is there any questions hip-hip I'm ready

403
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:59,230
hello I would like to ask you a question

404
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:03,040
about way how you pass through all your

405
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:04,330
network traffic - interception proxy for

406
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:09,040
Bob in your case

407
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:12,159
well weirdly enough there was no SSL

408
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:15,700
pinning on the apps so just installing

409
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:17,740
the perp certificate on the phone and

410
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:20,050
then just intercepting on the same

411
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:23,640
network with burps we you should gather

412
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:27,550
pretty much all the HTTP HTTPS traffic

413
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:30,730
some of the traffic was encrypted which

414
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:32,860
was the problem so the next step would

415
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:35,230
be playing around with installing the

416
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:37,330
certificate in the app repackaging unit

417
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:39,840
making sure you can gather data like

418
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:44,350
that and the other step I did was

419
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:46,270
setting up a pineapple Wi-Fi nano just

420
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:48,510
capturing all data and then running it

421
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:51,190
through Wireshark so this is was not

422
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:53,890
interception so this is what not a

423
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:58,690
transparent proxy in technique you are

424
00:20:53,890 --> 00:21:00,510
using only device Yui yeah yeah okay

425
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:05,370
thank you

426
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:05,370
any other questions yeah but you Patania

427
00:21:15,979 --> 00:21:19,799
nice yeah

428
00:21:17,489 --> 00:21:22,889
we need a translation please we needed

429
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:25,440

00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:44,839
apostasy okay okay so you understood

438
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:47,669
correctly is that you don't trust

439
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:50,668
antivirus software you don't use

440
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:54,509
interior software on your mobile phones

441
00:21:50,669 --> 00:21:57,029
and on your desktops and what do you

442
00:21:54,509 --> 00:21:59,029
think about it's like not trusting not

443
00:21:57,029 --> 00:22:02,609
using antivirus in terms of

444
00:21:59,029 --> 00:22:07,080
cybersecurity typical standards you know

445
00:22:02,609 --> 00:22:09,599
best practices okay so no I don't use

446
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:15,389
antivirus on my mobile yes I use it on

447
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:21,109
my laptop and my desktop I did not look

448
00:22:15,389 --> 00:22:23,459
into antivirus solutions on the computer

449
00:22:21,109 --> 00:22:27,809
because the process is a little bit

450
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:30,269
different but the way they do it on

451
00:22:27,809 --> 00:22:32,190
mobile or on desktop is what got me

452
00:22:30,269 --> 00:22:34,950
thinking is it really doing what they're

453
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:39,019
saying they're doing on on mobile

454
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:43,919
because on your desktop they're actually

455
00:22:39,019 --> 00:22:45,989
reinstalling before the OS is booted

456
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,839
usually to be able to do what they're

457
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:55,849
doing if you do that on a mobile

458
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:58,349
you're breaking the the sandbox system

459
00:22:55,849 --> 00:23:02,210
they're not breaking the sandbox system

460
00:22:58,349 --> 00:23:05,549
so they were doing it in a different way

461
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:09,330
do I trust antivirus solutions in

462
00:23:05,549 --> 00:23:12,299
general I feel I don't really have a

463
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:16,589
choice in the current climate trusting

464
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:18,479
them don't you to be honest no I don't

465
00:23:16,589 --> 00:23:19,470
trust them because there's a lot of

466
00:23:18,479 --> 00:23:20,940
things that's being

467
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:22,470
that you don't have if you want and

468
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:25,770
they're not being very transparent about

469
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:29,010
this so no I would not install it on my

470
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:31,080
phone because I just I I don't think

471
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:33,990
it's necessary

472
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:37,678
I do install it on my you know on my

473
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:39,030
laptop devices and on my computer but

474
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,530
that's because you really don't have a

475
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:43,230
choice there's too much there in the

476
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:45,120
wild they could just you know it's it's

477
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:47,010
a more of an added value to have it than

478
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,979
to not have it and I'm not sure the

479
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:52,520
added value is there on mobile I hope

480
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:55,350
that answers your question

481
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:59,220
and we have one more question

482
00:23:55,350 --> 00:24:01,469
yep it's gonna be for me I already have

483
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:03,840
a microphone so my question would be

484
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:06,360
regarding the publishing of this

485
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,668
research and its details so it'd be

486
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:10,530
interesting to hear what the AV

487
00:24:08,669 --> 00:24:12,090
providers would have to say about the

488
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:15,918
permissions that they request about the

489
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:18,740
traffic that can be seen in the network

490
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:21,390
thanks for the research and for the talk

491
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:23,520
it just that I would have expect to see

492
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:26,190
you know this particular what what

493
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:29,879
permissions were requested by which of

494
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:31,830
the anywhere to know these may be more

495
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:36,419
trustworthy passwords would you like

496
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:38,639
definitely malware on their own are you

497
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:45,270
planning on publishing it

498
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:49,679
I actually I came up with the talk topic

499
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:51,690
I had a very short time frame yeah so I

500
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:54,409
haven't written out everything I have

501
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:57,630
all the data of course written it out

502
00:24:54,409 --> 00:25:00,870
it's a it's an interesting suggestion so

503
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:03,179
I might yeah especially if I if I can

504
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:05,340
finally dive in deeper repackage the

505
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:07,770
apps but then I would you know I would

506
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:17,340
have to contact the providers themselves

507
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:19,490
as well okay thanks question regarding

508
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:24,709
the permission that you

509
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:27,200
ancients about the antivirus as does the

510
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:29,980
antivirus programs that you test it has

511
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:34,670
additional features like funnier for

512
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:38,240
others that can use your permission for

513
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:42,080
GPS to find a phone on the map Google

514
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:46,210
Maps and other other about the

515
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:50,389
permission for Wi-Fi network is it

516
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:53,600
public Wi-Fi network or your own Wi-Fi

517
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:57,920
network does it have enough security key

518
00:25:53,600 --> 00:26:02,629
and so on and so on as I know mostly

519
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:05,500
mobile antivirus has a lot of additional

520
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:09,520
features that use some of that

521
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:14,570
permissions that not use it for your

522
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:17,629
antivirus so thus my question is does

523
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:22,460
the diversity that you taste it have

524
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:26,360
those additional features some of them

525
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:29,300
do if you activate them there be by just

526
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:33,350
if you pay for it then they have added

527
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:35,659
functionality and I understand what

528
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:38,899
you're saying but not all of the

529
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:41,210
permissions explained that so not every

530
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,770
single permission can be explained by

531
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:46,809
the extra functionality that the app

532
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:57,410
would offer and that begs the question

533
00:26:46,809 --> 00:27:01,010
why why is it there yeah hi thank you

534
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:03,860
for talk my question is from the first

535
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:06,160
steps you Bernal isin the traffic and

536
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:08,570
you were allotted by the fact that

537
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:10,820
antivirus system is trying to avoid a

538
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:13,669
network connection what potential

539
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:15,830
problems you see in this fact I don't

540
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:19,850
really understand sorry could you repeat

541
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:22,990
the question my question is what

542
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:27,490
problems do you see an antivirus

543
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:29,740
two programs the ended in the fact

544
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:33,580
they're trying to unlatch a network

545
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:36,360
connection I'm not sure I understand

546
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:39,309
your questions I receive a key problem

547
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:41,110
validity of fact that the Warsaw and

548
00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:43,899
Jerusalem program operates an illicit

549
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:47,350
traffic is high - especially California

550
00:27:43,899 --> 00:27:49,600
so what problem do you do you think like

551
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:53,049
beauty that antivirus software is

552
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:56,279
actually intersecting and analyzing all

553
00:27:53,049 --> 00:27:58,929
I would go in traffic for on your phone

554
00:27:56,279 --> 00:28:00,880
how do you think what do you think about

555
00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:11,799
it I don't think they're actually doing

556
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:15,779
that he is not the traffic but the

557
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:20,740
connection itself let's put it this way

558
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:24,539
do mobile antiviruses analyze outgoing

559
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:28,720
connection from your phone I'm not sure

560
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:30,669
to be honest if they look up going

561
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:35,770
connections to be honest I don't think

562
00:28:30,669 --> 00:28:37,720
they're doing that because what what

563
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:39,010
they're capturing I don't really have a

564
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,270
few of what they're capturing I only

565
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:44,379
have a view of what they would be

566
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:46,440
sending back and that's encrypted so

567
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:49,620
it's very hard for me to say yes or no I

568
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,620
don't have

569
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:07,020
I'm sorry okay I was just trying to

570
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:09,750
maybe explain the question that the way

571
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:11,460
I pursued it used those virus would

572
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:13,559
collect information about the local

573
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:15,779
Wi-Fi network and then would send it

574
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:17,610
disturbers for whatever reasons so I

575
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:21,779
think the questions the person asks is

576
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:24,539
what dangers do you see in someone

577
00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:26,340
obtaining that almost public information

578
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:28,919
that has already broadcast by Wi-Fi

579
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:30,949
becomes part of that information that

580
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:34,830
was being sent was encrypted

581
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:37,289
so the question what I think it

582
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:39,779
happening is they're sending not only

583
00:29:37,289 --> 00:29:43,770
the name of the Wi-Fi but also your

584
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:46,409
password are actually bypassing

585
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:51,809
everything taking this information it's

586
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:54,230
on your phone in clear text so I think

587
00:29:51,809 --> 00:30:03,049
part of this packet encrypted and what

588
00:29:54,230 --> 00:30:12,630
I'm not sure that's why I thought it was

589
00:30:03,049 --> 00:30:17,850
dangerous or I wouldn't go as far as to

590
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:20,220
say there's fire I believe that they

591
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:24,389
could be more transparent in the type of

592
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:32,279
data they're gathering I think there was

593
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:34,520
a question there somewhere thank you it

594
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:34,520
was a
