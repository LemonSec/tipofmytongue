hitomi patootie pursued opioid novellas

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:29,670
oh geez hello Bert hello Bert please

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:33,210
welcome on stage that's yeah you can

6
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:35,640
start probably we won't have slides but

7
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,150
we will draw our best okay okay nobody

8
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,620
uncool

9
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:46,469
that's the only thing I know Wayne

10
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:48,510
cocaine Ian good morning everyone I was

11
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:51,899
here last year talking about security

12
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:55,289
monitoring and I had a lot of questions

13
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:58,440
afterwards what to do before you start

14
00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:03,210
with security monitoring so when I got a

15
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:04,739
request to be here again I decided to do

16
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,860
all my lessons had for the last ten

17
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:10,289
years starting up security operations

18
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,690
around Europe I'm doing security

19
00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:16,340
operations centers for ten years now in

20
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:18,450
all kind of senses in all countries and

21
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:20,819
the funny thing is I'm doing this for

22
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,619
big companies and everybody thinks it's

23
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:25,259
good everything is organized at a big

24
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:28,649
company the truth is sometimes a little

25
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:30,539
bit different so this is one of the

26
00:01:28,649 --> 00:01:36,060
reason I'm using my slides as a heads up

27
00:01:30,539 --> 00:01:37,800
for myself but I gotta start about the

28
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,970
ten major steps you have to do before

29
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:45,899
you can ever gonna start with cyber

30
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:48,149
security okay that's good because if you

31
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:50,670
don't do two steps it makes no sense to

32
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:53,869
have security monitoring in place you

33
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:57,929
don't do cybersecurity at all and those

34
00:01:53,869 --> 00:02:01,910
steps are crucial to be success to be

35
00:01:57,929 --> 00:02:04,500
protected against cyber security threats

36
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:06,390
so it works

37
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,239
I started this morning by reading some

38
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:11,160
stuff I flew here to Wednesday and the

39
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,680
first thing I realized that also boeing

40
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,970
has some issues with software and even

41
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:21,450
more concerning I read this morning is

42
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:23,730
about this one mr. Elias is be able to

43
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:26,310
hack the ILS systems on airplanes

44
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,090
something he does know it pain needs to

45
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,430
land it

46
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:31,769
can be computed organized the doodle

47
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:34,319
ending on the right track it can be

48
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:37,200
hacked easily $600 that you can hack it

49
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,670
I have to fly back tomorrow so please if

50
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:49,530
anybody want to do some testing do it

51
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:51,060
afterwards please so number 10 first

52
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,410
thing we need to start about is well net

53
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,819
rate security I'm not going to talk

54
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,379
about that you need a firewall I'm not

55
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:56,548
going to talk about that you need a VPN

56
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:58,410
connection or whatsoever

57
00:02:56,549 --> 00:03:00,569
I'm not gonna tell you you need a

58
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,980
password I think everybody knows that

59
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:05,458
multi-factor authentication is much

60
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:07,950
better than having one password I'm more

61
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:11,610
concerning if you have a firewall do you

62
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:13,679
maintain your firewall properly do you

63
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:16,709
add rules to your firewall but do you

64
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:21,209
remove rules as well anyone here is a

65
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:23,280
firewall operator do you remove your

66
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:27,950
firewall rules after a while because an

67
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:30,690
application is decommissioned you do and

68
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:35,190
do you maintain it every month every day

69
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:36,959
every week every year very good since

70
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:40,139
one of the funniest thing I had in the

71
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:43,500
last five years I was in a big company

72
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:46,950
should pick the now in there now but and

73
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:49,019
I saw a list of 154 rules in a firewall

74
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:52,399
and the last one was the most

75
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:57,090
interesting one open port any any

76
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,290
destination any any open useless stuff

77
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:02,310
throw it away

78
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:05,130
 so and it's I'm Dutch sorry I'm

79
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:06,329
very direct it's what happens with

80
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,799
firewalls if you don't maintain it

81
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:10,139
properly you don't need cyber security

82
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:12,419
if you don't maintain your systems it

83
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:14,639
doesn't make sense if you have blacklist

84
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:17,549
at all those IP addresses you never

85
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:19,859
maintain them somehow we will be

86
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:20,668
disconnecting the all Internet maybe

87
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:23,340
that's the idea

88
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:26,400
it will never work maintain your IPS in

89
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:30,359
your IDs because if your IPS is creating

90
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,950
noise you will fail you very busy and I

91
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,419
think the biggest problem right now is I

92
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:36,599
heard yesterday some of the guys talk

93
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:38,729
about honey pots decoys real good stuff

94
00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:39,930
but the fun thing is if one of my

95
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:41,880
customers

96
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:45,020
they hacked the honey pot and they

97
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:47,729
abused it one that was very funny

98
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:50,669
your security monitoring is crucial for

99
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:53,520
your security premise you parameter but

100
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:55,650
it's not a box it's about knowledge do

101
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,320
you have the knowledge to maintain your

102
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:00,690
network security properly and what I see

103
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,680
these days is people buy boxes and they

104
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,719
think I'm safe

105
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,330
I got myself a bullet I'll do the right

106
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,090
thing it isn't it's not about the box

107
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:10,469
I'm not interested if you're using a

108
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:12,448
checkpoint or Palo Alto whatsoever I

109
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:14,490
have my preferences but there's more

110
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:16,680
about maintenance you have to maintain

111
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:18,900
your network security properly on a

112
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,009
daily basis weekly basis monthly basis

113
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,349
if you take every time you change

114
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:24,710
something in network change your net

115
00:05:22,349 --> 00:05:29,810
particular T parameter if you don't

116
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:33,210
never start do you be really a target

117
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:35,580
also about the known signatures there's

118
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:37,799
a lot of signatures around the globe B

119
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:39,180
there's some open source one I told last

120
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,430
year about this but there's also some

121
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:43,380
boy stuff you can get some from the NCSC

122
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:46,320
as well in the Netherlands I think the

123
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:48,389
Interpol sharing is this use those

124
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:52,800
signatures but to remove them if they're

125
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:55,409
not necessary I saw an IDs last year and

126
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,389
it has so many signatures that we had 20

127
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:59,280
years ago break orifice I think some old

128
00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:00,840
guys will know who I'm talking about if

129
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,919
you still have those signatures in your

130
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:07,109
IDs really you're out of you're out of

131
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:13,820
rates I'm getting old but IDs as old as

132
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:13,820
well number nine

133
00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:20,880
it's about malware protection and I see

134
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:24,210
people installing all those malware

135
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,880
protection stuff based on we have to be

136
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:28,948
careful but what's your policy what's

137
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,590
the relevancy what you awareness it's

138
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:33,840
about the users because if they use your

139
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:35,159
memory protection summary in your proxy

140
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,590
but if they're at home they press

141
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:40,349
everything what's in their email you're

142
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:42,840
still in a dangerous situation what's

143
00:06:40,349 --> 00:06:45,719
the behavior of the user so if your mail

144
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,750
or protection maybe fails you behavior

145
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:51,120
analysis you use behavior analogies

146
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:53,039
really important so memory protection

147
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,520
doesn't stop with a tool on your laptop

148
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,210
the

149
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:59,430
with the tool somewhere on your server

150
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:04,068
it starts by a tool and then the

151
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:04,069
maintenance again it's about knowledge I

152
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:13,770
have to go faster I heard this is one of

153
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:15,659
my my most special on education and I'm

154
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:17,250
not talking about certifications I got

155
00:07:15,659 --> 00:07:19,500
my certifications I think the majority

156
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:22,229
of you half as well but you are here

157
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,699
because you want to know more and one of

158
00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:27,120
the thing I'm always talking about is

159
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:30,300
about train what happened it worse case

160
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,880
scenario you're here but you call X re

161
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:35,159
at the office what happens if the phone

162
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,539
starts ringing at the office and you're

163
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:38,969
not there you call it pick up the phone

164
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:41,190
and somebody from the customer

165
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:43,169
department says we can't access or CRM

166
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:45,569
database anymore do you know what's

are not on the communication channel you

186
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:43,430
talk to reporters this is why you talk

187
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,980
about cybersecurity

188
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:47,819
practice and crisis said yes a crisis

189
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:51,149
starts now

190
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:53,520
Friday morning 10:30 we're starting a

191
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:54,089
cyber security crisis drop down

192
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,740
everything

193
00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:57,720
what will the management - what will

194
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,760
your IT department do what will all the

195
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,070
guys do if something occurs who's going

196
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,420
to talk to the press

197
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:05,490
practice cyber security because I had

198
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,420
all those sub security challenges and I

199
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,470
said a

200
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,349
we have to be in the office on Tuesday

201
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:13,110
we're gonna do a cyber security training

202
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:14,190
yeah sure but the most crucial part is

203
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:16,530
when you're in the office you got a

204
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:18,140
headache from last night and then it

205
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:21,180
started substitute everything went down

206
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:23,819
practice the worst case scenario

207
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:26,849
practice that's the only thing you know

208
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:29,400
if everybody is cabled to give hat to a

209
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:32,550
cyber security incident and the fun

210
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:34,620
thing is maturity all the managers don't

211
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:36,180
know what to do where's the instruction

212
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:39,180
manual what to do

213
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:40,650
boozing charts razor IT guy is suffering

214
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:44,040
some sitting somewhere an exhibition

215
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:46,530
from no-name come Oh panic that happens

216
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:49,890
because your most crucial people are not

217
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:51,689
available trained the cyber security do

218
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:53,520
not train about system just for the

219
00:09:51,690 --> 00:10:01,020
certification do the service of creative

220
00:09:53,520 --> 00:10:06,000
training based on incidents trying to

221
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:08,520
get them monitoring I've been in a

222
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,390
company and then we bought a new

223
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:13,980
firewall it was an f5 actually it was

224
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:16,949
really funny somebody said well we got a

225
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:21,270
new Wi-Fi firewall we installed it he's

226
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:22,650
working it so on a Friday morning I was

227
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:24,120
not that busy I said all right show me

228
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:26,970
the dashboard what's currently the

229
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,410
occasion how it works and the fun thing

230
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:30,900
was after three weeks

231
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:32,520
nobody had a password they didn't know

232
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:35,850
how to look at the dashboard they didn't

233
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:37,920
know if it was even working you got on

234
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:40,920
all those equipment you have dashboards

235
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,199
you got reports you got alerts it's not

236
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,520
a box it's do something it casually

237
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,040
reports themselves you don't need

238
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,510
security monitoring for that but the

239
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,329
truth is everybody's busy

240
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:52,740
all kinds stuff I didn't look at these

241
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:56,250
desperate they don't know what's going

242
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:57,990
on a lot of customers big customers buy

243
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:00,480
a lot of stuff all those proxies all

244
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:02,400
those dashboards all those stuff they

245
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,500
don't look at it if you don't look at

246
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:08,819
this why would he new security

247
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:10,670
monitoring what do they do with incident

248
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:14,750
management

249
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,750
is this the best solution you could do

250
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:18,720
this is one of my favorite pictures

251
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,459
actually I see it once in Japan and said

252
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,280
yeah that will work

253
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:25,560
but if your system sucks maybe this is

254
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:27,270
the better that you can do your instant

255
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,010
management should be trained your

256
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,060
mandatory time to detect you mandatory

257
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:32,870
time to respond

258
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:34,859
what are you most critical procedures

259
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:36,180
who's in charge

260
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,160
who should be called who should be

261
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:40,650
responsible how do you measure the

262
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:44,790
quality of your servers around your

263
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:46,949
network not about praying know your

264
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:48,030
stuff no I'm saying it stuff later on

265
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,830
and repair stage will tell you more

266
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:52,470
about what's really important to know

267
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:55,350
about your network it's about knowledge

268
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:56,880
if this is your behavior pray that

269
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:59,250
something works we know that from the

270
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,320
screens here what happen this morning it

271
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,920
happens but this is a temporary

272
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:06,210
situation

273
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:08,280
and crucial one your inventory let's

274
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:12,800
call it the CMDB who hasn't seemed to be

275
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:16,650
fully operational 100% way I see hands

276
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:20,370
that's a really small amount your

277
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:21,890
inventories your most crucial part your

278
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:24,510
seem to be is not an asset management

279
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:26,010
it's easy to do with discovery on your

280
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,840
network what's in your network how many

281
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:30,330
routers how many servers but what I do

282
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:32,490
is security monitoring my first question

283
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:33,780
is can see the architecture design can

284
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:35,100
you share how many Windows servers you

285
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:36,480
have how many lining service we have how

286
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,940
many routers you have how many firewalls

287
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,170
you have who are the owners who should

288
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:42,840
be cold if something occurs

289
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:46,260
who's the maintenance guy if you cannot

290
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:50,880
tell me all those details you're not in

291
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:52,680
control if you're not in control well

292
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,020
what will you do with the next step was

293
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,760
something here's I wasn't accustomed and

294
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:59,430
I said can't tell me how much servers

295
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:02,689
you have it was a big big customer and

296
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:04,709
he said I think 2,000 servers really

297
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:07,440
when we were finished with security

298
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:10,080
operations center it were 6,000 already

299
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:15,300
and there were still a lot of service

300
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:18,100
not under monitoring we had 160 80s they

301
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:20,290
expected to have 23

302
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:23,680
throughout our mistake who can maintain

303
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:28,900
this stuff enterprise companies so what

304
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:30,699
happened to the small companies do you

305
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,780
maintain his own stuff and your latest

306
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:34,450
architect the design

307
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:37,620
who is there what's your most recent art

308
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:45,130
until natural design from your network

309
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:45,850
month a year two years five yeah you are

310
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:48,010
good actually

311
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:50,710
I see some hands always what's what's

312
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:56,650
your what you first but you lost update

313
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:59,650
on yardstick the design month really

314
00:13:56,650 --> 00:14:01,780
well it's impressive when I go in

315
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:06,610
companies and see designs in this is the

316
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:09,550
largest update is 2015 oh there that's

317
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:11,140
really complicated I want to do start

318
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:13,050
the security operation center in these

319
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:15,130
companies actually it makes no sense

320
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:18,010
because you're looking at something you

321
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:25,090
cannot predict does anyone recognize

322
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:28,689
this picture it's really funny it's

323
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:31,780
about a military center what was secret

324
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:34,750
somewhere in Afghanistan and people were

325
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:40,689
using a app on their phone and on their

326
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:42,690
watches to run round Strava what are

327
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:45,520
people doing with the mobile phones

328
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:47,350
there you're hiding you being secret

329
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:49,319
operation somewhere in Afghanistan and

330
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:51,970
people using phones and they're

331
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,810
publishing your position public

332
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:55,120
information

333
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:58,329
I see people running around with that

334
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,040
phones with easy passwords and all email

335
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,780
on it

336
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,420
what will you expect from me as a cyber

337
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:07,060
defence specialist if you don't take

338
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:10,150
care of your own information mobile

339
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:13,000
management it got perfect tools for this

340
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:16,150
install Tony laptop and I on your phone

341
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,590
and your iPad and all this stuff I do a

342
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:19,410
policy management what is allowed to

343
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:22,480
install Strava

344
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:24,100
perfect opportunity what do I do with my

345
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,960
mobile management are people walking

346
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,760
around with mobile phones which will be

347
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:31,060
business emulated it without protection

348
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,910
anyone p1 has an idea that is this

349
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:34,369
really

350
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:36,410
Cerie because if you're protecting your

351
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:38,630
network environment but don't do it with

352
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:41,719
mobile phones in Europe we have those

353
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:43,670
European Union GDP our stuff what we're

354
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46,130
doing in this stuff is that people are

355
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:49,130
connecting collecting all these emails

356
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:51,650
crucial information and everything still

357
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:54,920
store it on a phone absolutely

358
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:57,199
outrageous with access to your phone do

359
00:15:54,920 --> 00:16:00,199
you share your phone with your kids it's

360
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:02,630
really funny I saw it sometimes but even

361
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,430
funny anymore these days a lot of these

362
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:07,930
apps are sharing your information your

363
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:10,780
contact list your phone list to anyone

364
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:14,930
this is a crucial one as well

365
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:16,939
what are users allowed to do there's a

366
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:20,479
I'm really curious if I can tell this

367
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:22,400
but there's a telco company in the

368
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,390
Netherlands and they use the same

369
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:27,110
password on routers for eight years now

370
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:31,250
there's a reason for that it's

371
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:33,860
hard-coded and it's also one of the

372
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:36,230
issues they have supplier management if

373
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:38,380
you supply needs to access data they do

374
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:41,510
some maintenance have you outsource it

375
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:43,400
then your supplier should be able to do

376
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:46,550
some investigation on that one to do

377
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:49,160
some maintenance on it what is your

378
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:51,829
supplier allowed to do it's a really

379
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:54,319
funny one I'm in the middle of some

380
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:56,510
projects and projects right now with ot

381
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,400
management as well there are the PCB

382
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:00,200
environments and you see that all those

383
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,630
supplier management that's a real big

384
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,010
issue right now because we make policies

385
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:06,050
about the company but what is your

386
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:07,430
supply allowed to do do you have a

387
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:10,790
stepping stone that can access the

388
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:12,830
company only by one entrance or what you

389
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:16,159
see in the PCB in OT networks in

390
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:18,050
industrial systems the people have a GSM

391
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,430
connection to the network because it's

392
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:24,379
so complicated to use your stepping

393
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:25,760
stone there's a reason for that one what

394
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:28,430
are the agreements what's the

395
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,570
responsibility from a supplier if you

396
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,980
don't take care of your supplier

397
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:32,570
management and I think you know this

398
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:35,630
because you had some instance here in

399
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:37,280
Ukraine as well which suppliers take

400
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:39,020
care of that because it makes no sense

401
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,180
to start the sub security if you don't

402
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:43,070
take care of a privileges what are you

403
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:45,770
users allowed to do what can you modify

404
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:47,360
what if somebody got a promotion

405
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:50,600
do you remove his rights when his

406
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:53,120
previous job one of the biggest mistakes

407
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,530
I see and last one at least it's it's

408
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,439
about your privacy

409
00:17:54,530 --> 00:18:04,820
what are they allowed to see the world

410
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:09,440
has changed especially in Europe social

411
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:12,500
media the easiest one is for hackers is

412
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,660
not only about the tools the easiest one

413
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:18,680
for a hacker to get access to network is

414
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:20,600
to fool the people you see that by

415
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,670
sharing all kind information to a

416
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,110
company if you tell somebody we are

417
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:26,540
working with spelunk we are working with

418
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:28,729
cisco firewalls we're working with the

419
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:30,460
routers all your information you share

420
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:33,350
online contain Facebook or whatsoever

421
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:34,700
can be used to call the service desk hey

422
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:36,199
I heard there's some issue with your

423
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:38,990
Cisco router can you connect me to the

424
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:41,150
right guy and you get connection with it

425
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:43,880
quite easy you don't need a tool to do

426
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:45,590
so they will give you access if you say

427
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,180
yes he did the password has changed no

428
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:49,550
or it doesn't change yeah I see this

429
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:50,780
changed it was in the saved password and

430
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:53,810
they give you the right password

431
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:55,760
it's unbelievable in these days social

432
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:58,520
media giving too much information what

433
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:01,040
you do were your work in it you can see

434
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:03,620
it in my path in my profile as well

435
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:06,290
LinkedIn I'm only announcing what I've

436
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:08,030
done afterwards not when I worked here

437
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:09,710
so you look at my profile right now you

438
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:12,530
only see my own company but not the

439
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:13,760
current customer I work for there's a

440
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:14,629
reason for that it's too much

441
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,600
information

442
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:19,850
I can tell later on so you will see what

443
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,790
I did previously the last one was

444
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:25,780
someone with beer that's really nice a

445
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:27,500
now in different sector different drinks

446
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:29,780
social media can share too much

447
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,460
information be careful what you share a

448
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,930
lot of information it's not about the

449
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:34,820
name of your dog only it's all about

450
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:36,470
your information for your customer what

451
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:38,659
kind of equipment you use and maybe

452
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:41,690
you're proud on all your certifications

453
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:45,160
on Cisco perfect but be careful what you

454
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:45,160
share social media

455
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:54,360
and this is their the peers who want all

456
00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:56,879
about how to convince the management how

457
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,740
to deal with cybersecurity the most

458
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,140
crucial one how you start security

459
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:04,140
monitoring the most crucial one about

460
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:07,350
starting with cybersecurity anyway any

461
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:09,590
company it's the crucial question you do

462
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:14,419
the management what she risk appetite

463
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:17,669
are you able to survive a cyber attack

464
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:19,850
what's the acceptable loss if your

465
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:22,320
company is worth 30 million years and

466
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:25,770
you got a loss of 4 million you will

467
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:28,500
survive if you can't be compromised it

468
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:29,910
was a big company a month ago it was

469
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,530
compromised and he was saying yeah we

470
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:32,490
got some technical issues we got

471
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:35,309
everything under control

472
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:38,429
sure man and all these customer data was

473
00:20:35,309 --> 00:20:40,740
stolen and he keeps saying oh it's not a

474
00:20:38,429 --> 00:20:43,230
problem but at a certain moment you can

475
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,940
go bankrupt in the Netherlands a lot of

476
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:46,470
companies have gone bankrupt small

477
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:49,410
companies not the biggest small

478
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:51,570
companies just easy ordinary guys

479
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:53,160
creating some nice stuff having a very

480
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:56,299
profitable company but at a certain

481
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:58,650
level the customer data got stolen

482
00:20:56,299 --> 00:21:00,809
what are you financial consequences if

483
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:03,059
you know you financial consequences you

484
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:06,110
know what your budget will be to do

485
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:09,270
cyber security that's a tricky one

486
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:11,639
because all the men should say well we

487
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:14,190
are not target what why would he attack

488
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:16,290
us especially in Neyland says he's a lot

489
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,549
of companies saying well it's I'm not

490
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:20,040
concerned about that one

491
00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:22,410
cyber security how many times happens

492
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:24,389
it's not a matter you will but you get

493
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:27,000
hacked the only question is when they

494
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:29,940
will try to hack you are you able to

495
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,370
mitigate the risk it's about business

496
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:34,710
continuity and the next big topic for

497
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:37,439
the next coming years will be the OT

498
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:42,330
networks the technical the the

499
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:45,240
industrial systems because yes you're

500
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:46,918
just starting actually because it's not

501
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,230
about Windows and about Linux it sells

502
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:52,799
PLC systems they don't have protection

503
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:55,110
and insecurity in the mindset so ot will

504
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:58,379
be a really pain in the ass for a lot of

505
00:21:55,110 --> 00:22:00,129
companies a known situation Ukraine but

506
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:02,770
I can hardly imagine

507
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:04,299
that this will maybe the same issue

508
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:06,820
maybe bigger than it is in the

509
00:22:04,299 --> 00:22:09,600
Netherlands and in Ellen's is already

510
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:12,580
big to make the financial consequences

511
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,049
acceptable loss equal see it's about

512
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:16,149
where you seeis ISM you have to do the

513
00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:18,910
calculations the most critical part from

514
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:20,740
system you have to define what is the

515
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:22,780
budget to do your cybersecurity before

516
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:24,549
you go on if you know your budget then

517
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:27,879
you know you can start with better

518
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:29,980
security more people more training get

519
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,860
more knowledge on board and maybe

520
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:34,570
security morning learning as a next step

521
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:36,760
that's why I always start with do you

522
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:39,189
invest that much money on cybersecurity

523
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:41,679
at the beginning before you start with

524
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:44,320
security monitoring because if you spend

525
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,150
well not even that much amount of money

526
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,289
on on cybersecurity on the tooling and

527
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:49,360
the training

528
00:22:47,289 --> 00:22:51,010
why will you do security monitoring in

529
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,590
the Netherlands you start around million

530
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:57,730
euros a year doing security monitoring

531
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:59,949
internally it's a start keep in mind

532
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:01,299
what's a bit cost for B you maybe you

533
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:03,880
have to outsource it but this expensive

534
00:23:01,299 --> 00:23:05,408
is well-disposed a lot of companies even

535
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,870
one company here was doing small sauce

536
00:23:05,409 --> 00:23:09,730
managing on security monitoring the risk

537
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:12,370
appetite is the most crucial question so

538
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:15,400
I hope this if you go back to the office

539
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:17,889
on Monday after finishing the beers of

540
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,850
course afterwards then what the first

541
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:20,049
question you will be to the management

542
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:21,399
what we gonna do about cybersecurity

543
00:23:20,049 --> 00:23:23,500
what's the budget

544
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,600
what's the acceptable loss what's my

545
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,419
risk appetite how do you continue with

546
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,370
sub security do we take it seriously

547
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:32,770
because the budget says a lot how

548
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:36,789
serious cybersecurity is taken in

549
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:38,650
company don't do security operation

550
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:41,500
centers if you don't do the budget for

551
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:44,169
service security makes no sense if you

552
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,340
accept to get bankrupt I don't care you

553
00:23:44,169 --> 00:23:52,049
have to find yourself a new job of

554
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:56,678
course but that's it questions anyone

555
00:23:52,049 --> 00:24:00,929
yes sir intro for I'm doing loss please

556
00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:00,929
raise your hands if you have a question

557
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:12,158
hands hands hands ready for hands okay I

558
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:21,009
see a hand just give me a sec a hand

559
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:27,759
hand hand hi

560
00:24:21,009 --> 00:24:30,730
I saw that you spoke about the mobile

561
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:34,690
apps and mobile phones but you didn't

562
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:37,570
cause a quad security and maybe you can

563
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:42,879
give a hint on waters and modern threats

564
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:47,379
or what you see ours is a bad thing in

565
00:24:42,879 --> 00:24:50,320
cloud security and which will no

566
00:24:47,379 --> 00:24:53,439
bilities and threats you see here which

567
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:56,799
can influence their information security

568
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:59,350
the most so your questions about but

569
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:02,499
didn't mention about cloud security now

570
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:07,619
yeah you talked about all the topics

571
00:25:02,499 --> 00:25:12,869
which are applied to any infrastructure

572
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:16,959
but I think that if you talk about

573
00:25:12,869 --> 00:25:20,110
mobile phones and mobiles then maybe

574
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:22,980
call security can be a separate stack

575
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:26,350
that should be discussed separately also

576
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:30,460
is it in your environment is in the

577
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:34,119
cloud person personal partial account is

578
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:36,460
it part of your infrastructure partially

579
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:42,158
also part of it are you responsible for

580
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:44,889
it partially that was not true you're

581
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:47,980
fully responsible no one else you are

582
00:25:44,889 --> 00:25:50,799
responsible no one else because if you

583
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:53,350
got hacked the consequences for your

584
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:55,899
cloud provider are massive but the

585
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:57,610
consequence for you are more important

586
00:25:55,899 --> 00:25:59,979
because you can get back reps they could

587
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:02,949
get a fine whatever the tables are five

588
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:04,779
you thought so your cloud infrastructure

589
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:06,009
is your responsibility is your cloud

590
00:26:04,779 --> 00:26:08,379
provider taking care of cyber security

591
00:26:06,009 --> 00:26:09,580
because I heard history yesterday I was

592
00:26:08,379 --> 00:26:12,340
in the presentation of kinetics for

593
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:14,168
example a lot of I hear the doubts they

594
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:14,370
have about kubernetes the issues have to

595
00:26:14,169 --> 00:26:16,530
fill

596
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:19,860
bilities who's taking care of those

597
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:22,350
Filner abilities because we had the

598
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:24,479
assumption that every cloud surprise

599
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:26,879
provider will do something about cloud

600
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,190
security but today because that's not

601
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:32,910
their primary target in commercial point

602
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:36,660
of view maybe more it's it's an addition

603
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:39,840
you have to buy but correct me if I'm

604
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:41,970
wrong cyber security and security

605
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,100
monitoring is most in the time not done

606
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:47,010
by a cloud provider still your

607
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:50,610
responsibility or it's part of your

608
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:52,920
supplier agreement let's have you

609
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:55,439
conquer it so yeah it cloud is good I

610
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,820
like cloud I like to speed the cloud

611
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,740
because normally I have to set up a

612
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:01,500
server takes me a week now I can do it

613
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:05,340
in an hour but is it good enough you had

614
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:07,980
all your policies implemented is that

615
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:20,580
answering your question yes yes thank

616
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:24,960
you okay anyone else yeah here is the

617
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:27,960
most models come with realtor Kakadu

618
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:30,600
mate opportunity Pearson Allah as norm

619
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:33,660
city over the past mysteriously punked

620
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:38,850
of Kotori which is a suggested sufi move

621
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:42,450
with the past mr. Mustafa society

622
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:46,020
stop so how do you think if teaching

623
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:48,390
yeah people in cybersecurity is actually

624
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:49,080
the ground layer of cyber security of

625
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:53,400
your company

626
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:57,330
yes it's about knowledge it's not about

627
00:27:53,400 --> 00:28:01,110
the tools if you don't have a knowledge

628
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:02,460
on board or outsource properly taking

629
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:05,189
care of yourself security it's not about

630
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:07,290
box it's not about your car has an

631
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:09,720
impact system implemented spotter driver

632
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:11,610
because she still has an impact if you

633
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,110
buy yourself a Boeing 707

634
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:16,080
you're gonna fly with it and it has some

635
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:17,729
books on it who's gonna take care of the

636
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,110
tools because at the end you are happy

637
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:20,520
that some pilot is onboard who knows

638
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:23,070
what to do with the puppet with your

639
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:25,170
plane I'm a biggest there's always my

640
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:27,540
examples I did last year as well planes

641
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:28,340
if you have a pilot will only fly on

642
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,050
flew

643
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:32,810
Cessna for airplane and then we had to

644
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:36,919
fly in a 737 Bui good luck

645
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:39,590
really trust me you don't want that you

646
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:42,350
want to best pilot in your plane when

647
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:43,760
you're flying to Europe to Amsterdam the

648
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:45,310
one the best guy who's protecting your

649
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:52,420
network taking care of the maintenance

650
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:59,629
that's crucial one sacred Francois okay

651
00:28:52,420 --> 00:29:04,460
yeah I would say a hand okay hello

652
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:07,070
I believe that cybersecurity market is

653
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:11,360
more developing nederlands than in

654
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:13,820
Ukraine for example do you feel some

655
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:19,120
competition with insurance companies for

656
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:23,360
example I'm talking about from the point

657
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:26,989
business owner when he is not sure about

658
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:31,010
his security guys can they take all

659
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:33,290
these risks and just in case he is going

660
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:35,870
to the insurance company and said if

661
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:40,220
something will happen you will take care

662
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:45,530
about that if my guys will make all the

663
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:51,560
their best so maybe it's better solution

664
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:54,560
than put money in in teaching all this

665
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:57,290
security infrastructure or you just go

666
00:29:54,560 --> 00:30:00,409
insurance companies they will give you

667
00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:02,780
all your money back okay

668
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:04,700
that's question I know what you actually

669
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:06,560
two questions first of all is it better

670
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:08,690
in the Netherlands than Ukraine I don't

671
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,800
know what I know is that the government

672
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:11,630
in the Netherlands is putting a lot of

673
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:16,280
effort in order national cybersecurity

674
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:17,750
Center who's advising companies I heard

675
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,580
there were some initiatives here in

676
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:22,930
Ukraine but I wouldn't wait for that one

677
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:26,389
but your next question is more more fun

678
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:28,520
insurance and I don't know about

679
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:30,650
insurance companies in Ukraine if you

680
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:32,629
own the Netherlands they always have one

681
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:34,400
roll somewhere in that contract who says

682
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:38,840
if you haven't updated your system

683
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:41,040
properly at the same way your car if you

684
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:45,300
haven't updated your tires of what

685
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:48,450
of your car Afghani insurance that's a

686
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:51,120
problem we have a bank law from 2014 but

687
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:53,250
if you got hacked as a company the bank

688
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:55,350
they will not pay you unless you can

689
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:58,230
show that you did all the installation

690
00:30:55,350 --> 00:31:00,929
of your updates that all the normal

691
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:04,620
people like me are protected but if you

692
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:06,240
are a company and you got an fine from 1

693
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:08,100
million euros then the bank will look at

694
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,660
your system says well it's not

695
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:12,240
reasonable that we have to pay because

696
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:14,850
you didn't update Windows what's the

697
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,760
level so your insurance I will never

698
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:21,090
never trust on that yes as an additional

699
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:22,950
one but primary take care be responsible

700
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:25,230
you've got an insurance on your car I

701
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:26,730
think the best thing you do is still get

702
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:29,790
your driving license and get experience

703
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:31,950
on it and I hope my pilot will do

704
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:37,460
tomorrow as well that means your of

705
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:42,270
course ok so now I see a discussion ok

706
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:47,400
about your example this military base so

707
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:52,950
you said that nowadays smartphones it's

708
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:57,480
not secure yeah and more or less the one

709
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:59,730
of your solutions is talk with each in

710
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:05,820
you know military man about smartphones

711
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:11,760
how are bad they are and somebody will

712
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:15,689
delete this app or or somebody will not

713
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:20,270
delete this app and what is your

714
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:24,570
solution for this problem that you can't

715
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:28,770
take any smartphone from from every

716
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:29,460
people in this base and check what what

717
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:31,200
they did

718
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:33,630
now of course not mobile device

719
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,650
management in tune from Microsoft

720
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:38,340
something like that

721
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:40,390
it's know they can't leave nowadays

722
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:46,570
without smartphone or

723
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:49,510
or even Wi-Fi so it's if you have your

724
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:52,360
business applications on your phone so

725
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:54,129
that business data on it it becomes data

726
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:56,110
from the company it needs to be

727
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:59,920
protected so there are two options or

728
00:32:56,110 --> 00:33:01,689
you protect you your mobile phone the

729
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:04,059
company protects your phone and it's

730
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:05,200
maybe it's even a company phone you're

731
00:33:04,059 --> 00:33:08,230
not allowed to install it should

732
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:11,140
management apps they enforce you to

733
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:14,290
update apps properly they may be also

734
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:16,000
not using certain apps or you're not

735
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:18,820
allowed to use business data on your

736
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:23,860
mobile phone there's no alternative is

737
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:26,590
white or black or not use the phone not

738
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:29,439
for business all right

739
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:35,230
and for a new three years what's that

740
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:37,450
for military man no they should not use

741
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:39,610
the phone unless you not use the phone

742
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:42,610
if it's not protected properly and you

743
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:45,820
should enforce as a company that if you

744
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:50,379
have mobile data email communication

745
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:52,689
chats Skype whatsoever cloud slack if

746
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:55,750
you use that it should be protected with

747
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:58,419
endpoint protection firewall or even

748
00:33:55,750 --> 00:34:00,640
malware protection I've seen all those

749
00:33:58,419 --> 00:34:02,770
in Boyde apps you can download anywhere

750
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:07,690
in the world having this information on

751
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:10,800
it how you do check that every every

752
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:13,629
phone in this base is protected properly

753
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,639
it's your have some certificates you

754
00:34:13,629 --> 00:34:17,350
install in your mobile phone and it's

755
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:24,429
centrally managed with your monitoring

756
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:26,049
tools 100% solution is there's no such

757
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:28,389
thing as on the present solution but it

758
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:31,929
mitigates risk you can see if somebody

759
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:34,810
installs some Chinese jet program and

760
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:36,250
I'm a little bit curious about the chat

761
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:38,980
programs from China but there are other

762
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:41,679
countries as well of course be careful

763
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:43,750
what you install on your phone you see

764
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:46,480
Strava i was if you are working any

765
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:48,340
military that's my example i gave they

766
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:51,369
were working in india military they do

767
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:52,210
running in all their runs around the

768
00:34:51,369 --> 00:34:55,450
base but

769
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:57,730
to secure base they had the GPS on why

770
00:34:55,449 --> 00:35:00,430
do you need a GPS on you get lost

771
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:03,720
somewhere in the desert you have to put

772
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:06,310
science under boat what what it's insane

773
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:08,470
it's it's about a mindset if we are

774
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:09,940
taking on mindset about security then

775
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:11,379
your mobile phone is one of your first

776
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:13,150
access points from your data from the

777
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:15,760
company point of view so if you want to

778
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:17,440
use your company data about your

779
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,540
position about what you use where you

780
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,910
are what you're doing will you emailing

781
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:25,119
with be aware that if you are using

782
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:27,490
fiber as a jet program I think I use it

783
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:29,109
a lot here in Ukraine what I know from

784
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:32,140
the past is vibrates uploading your

785
00:35:29,109 --> 00:35:34,990
whole contact list to a server who owns

786
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:37,089
that if you're using Facebook on your

787
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:39,000
phone whatever Facebook see on your

788
00:35:37,089 --> 00:35:41,259
phone I don't have facebook on my phone

789
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,510
brother not even use Facebook because

790
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:45,339
it's I don't like it but it's more about

791
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:47,410
what you what you accepting is a risk

792
00:35:45,339 --> 00:35:48,970
it's a privacy risk and if you do it on

793
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:51,250
your private phone I don't care it's

794
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:54,310
about you but if it is a company data on

795
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:59,109
it it becomes responsibility of a

796
00:35:54,310 --> 00:36:04,029
company like a white but you can't no I

797
00:35:59,109 --> 00:36:06,369
think like point is clear right you can

798
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:09,440
continue discussion afterwards yeah

799
00:36:06,369 --> 00:36:12,639
let's say thank you for Burt

800
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,639
[Applause]
