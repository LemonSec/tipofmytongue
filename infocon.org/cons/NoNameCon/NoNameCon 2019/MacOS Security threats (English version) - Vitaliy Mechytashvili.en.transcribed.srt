1
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:08,889
a pirate-themed yak or a speech at a

2
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:11,530
NASA condo in Tohoku support starting

3
00:00:08,889 --> 00:00:17,259
the next presentation I'd like to ask

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:20,890
you who among you who has who is using

5
00:00:17,259 --> 00:00:24,570
markers who believes that Marquez is the

6
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:27,160
most secure operating system possible I

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,980
suggest that you don't listen to this

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:32,558
presentation because now we tally will

9
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:35,830
tell you about Marquez and the

10
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:39,339
recent years all those bypasses all

11
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:41,320
those fissures which would allow you to

12
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:44,729
become an admin with empty password and

13
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:49,900
so on I think for carpet road work here

14
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:51,430
well how do we name it better literally

15
00:00:49,900 --> 00:01:04,780
you're welcome anyway let us welcome

16
00:00:51,430 --> 00:01:06,549
Vitali to welcome everybody as it has

17
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:09,610
already been announced I'll tell you

18
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:13,330
about the key security threats and mark

19
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:19,690
us the tally meters will work for under

20
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:21,759
defense company I am involved in

21
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:27,550
security engineering and my hobby is

22
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:30,460
security research in Makris today I'd

23
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:31,820
like to tell you a lot about the update

24
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,940
which

25
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:38,149
was quite a while ago which is tender

26
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:41,649
for keen the last run release of Mac OS

27
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:44,000
with a large number of security features

28
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:46,460
actually they don't protect that a lot

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,590
on this quiet easy to bypass it to

30
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:55,039
circumvent them and those techniques are

31
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:58,610
even used in malware under Mac OS also

32
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,100
I'd like to tell you about a gatekeeper

33
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:04,900
robotics protect also and better

34
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:07,759
security tools from for markers which

35
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:12,280
shared digital signature and protects

36
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:15,920
against unsigned applications and mobile

37
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:18,620
running until a bit about App Store

38
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,769
because there were cases when some

39
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:23,690
novelty of the mac store and there are

40
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:26,270
cases when this small war still

41
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:28,970
continues to exist there enough store

42
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:32,450
and it's possible to download the time

43
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:36,859
to install it in your computer without

44
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:39,679
any worries and I'll show you how Safari

45
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:42,410
extensions work and they're quite a

46
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:50,019
number of malicious Safari extensions

47
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:52,730
which collect user history they is they

48
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:56,660
change the default search engine for

49
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:59,630
users and some also I will show you a

50
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:03,220
bypass which can be used when installing

51
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:07,070
Safari extensions so in the in the last

52
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:08,720
update Safari extensions seem to only be

53
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:10,250
able to install from App Store but this

54
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,100
is not the case and they'll tell you a

55
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:17,650
bit about CVS if you still have time and

56
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,650
the most serious and markers

57
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:31,880
so that release took place on September

58
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:33,710
24 year 2014 and committed fishers

59
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:37,549
mostly include security features like

60
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:40,550
protection of user data like emails

61
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:43,520
contacts accessed camera and microphone

62
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:45,980
and when the application and application

63
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:48,320
tries to use they thinks it's either

64
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:50,030
prohibited or in the case of microphone

65
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,730
and web camera there will be a prompt

66
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:56,090
window and it will ask the user whether

67
00:03:52,730 --> 00:04:00,440
the user wants to allow that application

68
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:04,780
accessing what some microphone also I

69
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:09,650
will tell you a bit about Safari updates

70
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:11,180
again Apple who was saying quite a lot

71
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:16,820
and showing quite a lot about those on

72
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:20,800
how they actually work this is problem

73
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:26,150
one of the track ups and that's how

74
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:30,320
apple tells users about privacy they say

75
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:32,870
well that when you use Apple hardware

76
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,820
like iPhones Mac computers your

77
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:37,790
protector than your personal data are

78
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:40,880
safe and secure but actually this is not

79
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:43,250
the case and even recently there was an

80
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,690
event when the Chinese government asked

81
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:47,660
to remove all with the ins from App

82
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:49,580
Store and Apple responded in a positive

83
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:58,370
way and removed all the pen applications

84
00:04:49,580 --> 00:05:01,039
from App Store also source codes

85
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:03,560
for Makos are available of source code

86
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:07,790
the temple calm and those are source

87
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:10,610
calls for tender 12 to 10.13 and in

88
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:14,380
those versions in Makos there is a

89
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:16,910
default window well the user should

90
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:19,100
enter his or her password when many

91
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:22,160
application tries to raise to elevate

92
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:25,930
privileges and this window would work as

93
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:28,730
follows the rules there would be a

94
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:32,630
temporary file for the password and that

95
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:35,240
password would require the password and

96
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:37,580
it would be stored in teen people though

97
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,350
and it is in several micro seconds

98
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,940
before the password to thread everybody

99
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:43,220
and anybody would have access to that

100
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:47,630
folder so if you connect that he is

101
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:49,850
bistec and write a simple script we

102
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:51,620
should copy that folder the directory

103
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,750
today is B stick you would be able to

104
00:05:51,620 --> 00:06:01,660
get the user password and use password

105
00:05:53,750 --> 00:06:04,760
from that system similarly the

106
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:10,480
equivalent expert officials in Mac OS

107
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:10,480
and gatekeeper is for digital signatures

108
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,480
for any and every application before

109
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:20,330
it's launched before a transform occurs

110
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:23,740
as digital signature should be checked

111
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:26,750
whether it's signed but with the proper

112
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:29,000
legitimate digital signature or whether

113
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:31,940
the signature is not blue twisted and

114
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,550
whether the hash has not changed for

115
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:36,380
that application for the digital

116
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,390
signature but actually this is not the

117
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:41,370
case

118
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:44,760
applications after being loaded get into

119
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:47,040
current ein they get this content

120
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:50,250
attribute and gatekeeper only would only

121
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:53,160
check applications from one time so if

122
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:55,470
that up was already there in the system

123
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:59,190
and this quote has been modified by

124
00:06:55,470 --> 00:07:02,370
somebody or something that application

125
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:04,469
has bypassed the quarantine done it will

126
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:06,770
not be shared by gatekeeper and it will

127
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:09,899
launch and it will run in the system

128
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:09,899
[Music]

129
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,780
only when the user opened that

130
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:18,090
application the first time that

131
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:19,919
quarantine flag is removed and after

132
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:25,739
that this application has never checked

133
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:29,970
again in the same way if that

134
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:31,320
application comes comes to the computer

135
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:33,270
not through a browser but through the

136
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,460
core it doesn't get that porn time flag

137
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:37,770
and that application can be launched

138
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,479
without having this digital signature

139
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:42,289
checked and without any worries or

140
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,290
security checks

141
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:52,289
in similar way malware can remove

142
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:55,400
content slug 1 it has access to show and

143
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:59,270
it has access to code execution you can

144
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:02,880
execute the Xcode remove attribute and

145
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:04,349
in that way one time flag will removed

146
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:08,600
from the application and again the

147
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:08,600
application will launch and will run and

148
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:14,719
anything can sign that application the

149
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:16,880
users computer with its own certificate

150
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,630
[Music]

151
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:24,840
in same way

152
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:27,330
Apple has certain database of

153
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,310
blacklisted certificates for Marvel for

154
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:32,760
some applications which were already

155
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:35,690
reported to Apple but unfortunately that

156
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:38,189
blacklist is very rarely updated

157
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:40,260
previously I would often do some malware

158
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:42,980
analysis and I saw some traffic from my

159
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:46,170
virtual machine and it happened

160
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:48,390
literally like 2 times during half a

161
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:52,949
year 1 that gatekeeper tried to update

162
00:08:48,390 --> 00:09:02,390
as database the rest of time those

163
00:08:52,950 --> 00:09:07,770
databases would be outdated the same way

164
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:10,860
in the last versions of Mac OS system

165
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:15,290
integrity protection by passwords system

166
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:18,510
integrity protection is something that

167
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:22,459
basically protects your personal data a

168
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:25,470
private data which does not allow

169
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:28,230
execution of certain embedded Mac

170
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:31,670
applications which have access to the

171
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:36,390
poor which route

172
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:38,010
privileges you can see someone off from

173
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:42,030
there in your own but it's better not to

174
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:46,550
do it on first system and again this

175
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:52,410
thing uses secure shell or safety P even

176
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:55,170
worse moreover it can be bypassed there

177
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:58,319
was a lower case respond law one of the

178
00:09:55,170 --> 00:10:03,300
most popular cases from our test when

179
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:06,360
the top would create a keeper a public

180
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:09,209
and private key for secure shell and the

181
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:12,590
user's PC and that public key would be

182
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:16,290
entered in the authorized his database

183
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:17,820
so that it would be able to login with

184
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:20,610
private key only without the password

185
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:23,580
anthem it works in and gets full disk

186
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:25,530
access privileges and system and is that

187
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:29,660
food is pictures view you can get

188
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:32,579
contacts and emails knowns messages and

189
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:35,030
whatever else should be protected by

190
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,030
default

191
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:52,540
after it works you have this security

192
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:57,120
key wrapper I did it here on manually

193
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:59,469
first I opened that directory with odd

194
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,360
system integrity protection switched off

195
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:04,090
right then the system said the operation

196
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,580
not permitted then I entered my public

197
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:08,980
key is authorized keys I connected using

198
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:12,820
secure shell and listed this directory

199
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:15,220
and I see it as available immediately in

200
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:19,200
the same way it works for safety P with

201
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:23,620
a safety P you can download those files

202
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:26,350
and to protect yourself you have to do

203
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:29,410
it in your own and then you should enter

204
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:32,950
full disk access settings privacy

205
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:37,089
settings and remove the checkmark you

206
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:40,090
should not remove that wrapper because

207
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:42,790
next time one secure connection is done

208
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:45,310
it will appear and again will provide

209
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:53,920
access full disk access with all

210
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:57,869
protected directories and so on well I

211
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,870
told you a bit about this part already

213
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:08,899
now about App Store Apple advertises its

214
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:12,319
App Store as a trusted source for

215
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:17,209
applications for us they have certain

216
00:12:12,319 --> 00:12:20,498
rules how to delete an app store there

217
00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:27,109
are certain conditions for for users

218
00:12:20,499 --> 00:12:29,660
they have a sandbox before an Apple

219
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:31,879
extension comes into storage go drop and

220
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:34,670
some box and that box should check it

221
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:40,249
like what is that application doing what

222
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:44,059
does it do to the system and there was

223
00:12:40,249 --> 00:12:48,829
that example of Safari extension store

224
00:12:44,059 --> 00:12:53,749
but very recently there was upward dr.

225
00:12:48,829 --> 00:13:00,290
on App Store and that other doctor who

226
00:12:53,749 --> 00:13:04,910
was a top one yes paid applications and

227
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:08,809
top or Canada top applications there was

228
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:12,529
SQL code and I wish a live bait the milk

229
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:13,999
EDC three eight three two and we did

230
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:15,589
some dynamic analysis of that

231
00:13:13,999 --> 00:13:19,699
application if you're interested you can

232
00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:24,079
scan it have a video with live stream

233
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:27,889
and you're welcome to see it ocean this

234
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:32,599
application would collect all the user

235
00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:36,110
data collect the browsing history packet

236
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:39,290
into into an archive and send it to

237
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:41,899
their servers instead of what they said

238
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:44,800
it has to do namely protecting computer

239
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:44,800
against at work

241

fritzsche tensions there is there are

242
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:05,250
certain requirements you have to comply

243
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:08,690
we stood to contribute to extensions

244
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:13,079
tour however for some reason there were

245
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:18,060
some applications appear there which do

246
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:19,859
not comply with normal criteria it

247
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:22,229
shouldn't every extension which gets

248
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:26,459
into the application store should not

249
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:37,259
contain any additional product placement

250
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:42,119
any ads or certain in-app purchases if

251
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:44,310
it's about advertising they should not

252
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:47,990
interact with Safari and with user

253
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:56,609
interface for user interface in any way

254
00:14:47,990 --> 00:15:00,120

255
00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:02,160
team checking everything that gets into

256
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,709
App Store and that team should check

257
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:09,569
applications before adding that on some

258
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:13,109
top store in fact for some reason reason

259
00:15:09,569 --> 00:15:17,060
it doesn't work that way in a similar

260
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:20,220
way as it was with extension store this

261
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:22,380
the per extension is quite popular it's

262
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:27,269
also add well and it's called search

263
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:29,010
manager it changes your homepage or it

264
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:33,709
does not do it through default settings

265
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:37,920
instead it does it with JavaScript code

266
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:39,689
it will change it would replaces default

267
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:43,719
search manager and standard

268
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:45,610
functionality of new tab in fact this

269
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:48,790
thing does not allow you to manually

270
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:51,759
Android settings and to switch the

271
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:54,639
search system to the default search

272
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:58,060
system you want to use like Google or

273
00:15:54,639 --> 00:16:01,089
something like your loss always have

274
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:03,969
whatever they want us your search system

275
00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:07,959
and they will work through that search

276
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:11,920
it looks like this default search

277
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:15,729
manager is Google however when you type

278
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,620
something into that search for example

279
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:20,740
YouTube you've got the web page with a

280
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:23,589
fake yahoo you don't see the URL here

281
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:25,360
bar here but there is this fake Yahoo

282
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:27,459
which doesn't work in each and every

283
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,209
country and not all of us but with

284
00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:30,670
repent

285
00:16:28,209 --> 00:16:32,529
I did get some advertising without GP

286
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:35,349
and I didn't get any search results at

287
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:37,959
all but in fact I didn't get any proper

288
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:43,709
search results when I was connected or

289
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:48,008
VPN I got a long list of odd promo and

290
00:16:43,709 --> 00:17:02,229
those odds are for Germany but there was

291
00:16:48,009 --> 00:17:05,829
nothing for Ukraine this is the reader

292
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:08,020
redirect for a search and Saoirse direct

293
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:12,459
which works more or less like this there

294
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:15,158
is an event listener and before each and

295
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:20,699
every user search before calling that

296
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:24,110
search function in the browser this code

297
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:28,700
gets parameters from

298
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:32,559
from your hero and it replace of the URL

299
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:36,769
to be opened with its own URL and

300
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:46,940
collects information sending it to its

301
00:17:36,769 --> 00:17:49,640
own servers it collects full collect the

302
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:54,110
internet browsing history and when

303
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:57,529
opening the new website when going to

304
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:59,870
some page it would pass the URL and send

305
00:17:57,529 --> 00:18:02,809
it to its own servers and after that it

306
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:13,989
would collect it would collect the user

307
00:18:02,809 --> 00:18:13,990
history and send target ads in same way

308
00:18:14,179 --> 00:18:19,279
there was the trusted installation

309
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:21,289
source starting from 10.14 it's

310
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:25,399
impossible to install Safari extensions

311
00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:30,230
not from App Store so they should be

312
00:18:25,399 --> 00:18:33,739
signed and they should not violate those

313
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:36,380
criteria however in fact I did have some

314
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:39,860
video which I will not show here there

315
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:44,809
are about twenty six lines of Apple

316
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:47,689
script code we should enter Safari and

317
00:18:44,809 --> 00:18:51,200
interact with user interface and go to

318
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:53,779
settings and set developer menu own and

319
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,450
through the developer menu would allured

320
00:18:53,779 --> 00:18:58,539
extension as its own and after that that

321
00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:02,000
extension would work under safari our

322
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:04,820
until safaris reloaded and it will work

323
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,230
and but it's possible to do code

324
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:08,230
execution and bypass it

325
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:21,940
so that's how the carriers and Stoppers

326
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:25,480
look like this is make a mower and when

327
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:34,179
it needs the user parameters from the

328
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:43,090
system features a picture on the desktop

329
00:19:34,179 --> 00:19:45,340
and AD signs to where the password

330
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:50,049
should be entered kind of social

331
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:57,399
engineering technique there are also

332
00:19:50,049 --> 00:20:02,769
many CVE for mac OS and as you can see

333
00:19:57,399 --> 00:20:08,678
it's top port and the list of vulnerable

334
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:17,889
OSS more vulnerable as you can see are

335
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:24,659
also Linux and Android there is the list

336
00:20:17,889 --> 00:20:24,658
of zero-day exploits under macro as

337
00:20:27,629 --> 00:20:39,969
exploits with privilege escalations much

338
00:20:32,289 --> 00:20:43,710
cheaper than one for Windows as you can

339
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:48,250
see it shows that there are many

340
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:53,169
exploits like this and relatively lower

341
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:55,950
price shows that the Mac OS is no

342
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:55,950
support Allah

343
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:11,908
a bit of information about funny series

344
00:21:04,049 --> 00:21:18,730
this one was easier than 2017 it exposed

345
00:21:11,909 --> 00:21:22,809
the encryption password for some disk

346
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:27,940
partition at the computer as soon as the

347
00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:34,149
user added a hint for the password which

348
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:37,799
was not mandatory but if you do it when

349
00:21:34,149 --> 00:21:43,330
you when the password is asked macaws

350
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:48,418
shows the real passwords and it could be

351
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:53,230
overseen and used to decrypt the disk

352
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:57,600
Portugal discovered the zero day in 2017

353
00:21:53,230 --> 00:22:02,529
which I have shown already the

354
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:06,418
authentication mechanism stored the user

355
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:17,710
passwords in the file that allowed

356
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:22,059
copying another CVE of 2017 it is

357
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:26,519
related to a high sierra version of mac

358
00:22:22,059 --> 00:22:30,149
OS you could bypass the privilege

359
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:33,790
escalation by pressing enter two times

360
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:39,250
instead of password

361
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:42,010
you could give root as your username and

362
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:47,050
then press ENTER two times to get root

363
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:49,240
privileges in the system now what is the

364
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:53,820
best way to protect yourself what should

365
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:59,470
be used what tools are the best

366
00:22:53,820 --> 00:23:02,830
objective-c is a great company these are

367
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:07,750
guys in gold and Opus in developing open

368
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:11,560
source security applications but they

369
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:15,360
have a long list of this application but

370
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:19,000
the main two are block block block block

371
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:24,929
to monitor different persistent the

372
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:29,140
methods under Mac OS checking daemons

373
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:33,390
uploading those of to virus total and

374
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:33,390
the showing you the statistics

375
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:39,400
knock-knock and what block are very

376
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:45,970
similar and the only difference is that

377
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:49,330
not dog is run by the user and you have

378
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:52,960
to hit the Scan button and block block

379
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:56,770
shows at the background showing you

380
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:59,710
every time when an application is trying

381
00:23:56,770 --> 00:24:03,129
to get persistence to be run without the

382
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:09,790
user there is also a Google Center

383
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:14,250
project if you search for Google Center

384
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:21,010
you will be shown first of all

385
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:25,120
Die Linke but you should not use the

386
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:28,570
first one use the second one to get help

387
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:32,250
and this is the project to monitor

388
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:37,389
operating system against running the

389
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:41,920
unsigned applications this project

390
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:46,470
allows you to check Bloodless whitelist

391
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:51,010
and that should be used instead of

392
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:55,270
gatekeeper unfortunately it's still

393
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:59,650
under development the developers are

394
00:24:55,270 --> 00:25:04,350
apparently not so willing to contribute

395
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:09,400
and I could not use it in the proper way

396
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:13,030
ant you also may use anti viruses under

397
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:17,800
mecha RS but there is no default

398
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:21,190
protection under Mac OS we have

399
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:26,230
researched the anti viruses to

400
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:31,300
understand which one that's what and

401
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:37,000
this is the list of NT viruses with the

402
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:41,639
good rating these are the anti viruses

403
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:44,430
that blocked the largest of our number

404
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:50,490
[Music]

405
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:55,670
is anybody taking photos actually I'm

406
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:55,670
through with my presentation or let's

407
00:25:56,510 --> 00:26:04,100
thank was just love and ask questions

408
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:15,150
you have shown the defenders on the last

409
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:18,810
slide as the best one assumes what

410
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:23,610
exactly did you count the overall number

411
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:28,500
of malware detection or just for make it

412
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:36,419
worse we have verified the detect number

413
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:40,410
for Mac OS number for more where that

414
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:45,120
you investigate we had 70 samples on the

415
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:45,870
Mac OS l 34 windows are there any more

416
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:53,280
questions

417
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:56,070
oh yes I see you I thank you for your

418
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,820
exciting presentation my question is as

419
00:26:56,070 --> 00:27:01,399
follows

420
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:04,700
let's assume that your parents have

421
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:07,560
Apple under mock arrest what

422
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:11,940
applications would you install to

423
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:15,300
protect them well I am using Mac and

424
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:21,080
tobacco as I have installed that block

425
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:22,840
then had blockers for Safari and I

426
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:26,040
comply with

427
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:33,159
regular information security rules I

428
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:37,300
avoid hitting all links I managed to

429
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:39,760
avoid any more installations there

430
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:46,600
aren't many fake torrent trackers by the

431
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:50,410
way and you can download many viruses

432
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:57,010
from these fake torrents stolen trackers

433
00:27:50,410 --> 00:28:00,210
to analyze on the virtual machine as far

434
00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:05,820
as I know it's not too simple to install

435
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:05,820
third-party application under mac OS

436
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:13,840
it's an additional stage and if you

437
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:18,850
don't do it you can download on the from

438
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:23,320
App Store and this is safe my question

439
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:25,959
is as follows if it's possible to

440
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:35,980
install Safari extensions from App Store

441
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:38,890
only it means at that or in dimension

442
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:42,520
that our script to be used to bypass

443
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:50,080
this limitation in this case the user

444
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:56,470
will see how the script is running is it

445
00:28:50,080 --> 00:29:01,090
a real life of vulnerability it was a

446
00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:06,090
problem with Safari extensions in the

447
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:06,090
past but after this limitation

448
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:20,750
visit a real solution well and those

449
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:26,360
used the same kind for the scripts by

450
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:30,169
the way when I showed you the screen

451
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:35,330
with the window and the passwords you

452
00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:39,200
see everything that was running was in

453
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:43,309
the background you see the user sees

454
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:46,340
just a window pop-up window to enter the

455
00:29:43,309 --> 00:29:49,428
password and everything else runs in the

456
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:52,399
background so I think this is the best

457
00:29:49,429 --> 00:29:58,690
thing to suggest to your parents or

458
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:58,690
grandparents never enter your password

459
00:29:58,929 --> 00:30:11,799
so the first thing to avoid under Linux

460
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:16,970
is to work has roots and windows again

461
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:22,429
never use admin account but what about

462
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:26,179
in Mac OS well use the anti viruses

463
00:30:22,429 --> 00:30:29,179
there are some applications that just

464
00:30:26,179 --> 00:30:32,030
cannot be run in with the root

465
00:30:29,179 --> 00:30:37,400
privileges are there any more questions

466
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:44,049
please no more or is it yes is there yes

467
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:44,049
no no disappeared no it's there again

468
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:52,800
the people are not so confident what a

469
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:56,100
part of the antivirus

470
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:57,690
did you try Crosstrek Oh things like

471
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:07,550
this as compared with the traditional

472
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:12,360
approach we had her research the

473
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:16,970
antivirus with the ransom protection the

474
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:16,969
citizen protection uses machine learning

475
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:28,740
checking the eventual mover would the

476
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:34,260
use of virustotal

477
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:37,890
we tried to run wanna cry and he reacted

478
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:42,690
when one half of the hard disk was

479
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:46,770
already encrypted and I have another

480
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:50,100
question if I am interested in Mako

481
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:51,150
security what should I read a Patrick

482
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:54,230
Warhol's

483
00:31:51,150 --> 00:32:00,480
to reach our objective see

484
00:31:54,230 --> 00:32:07,760
then Thomas Reid who is in deeply and

485
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:11,130
deeply involved in Mac OS security and

486
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:14,100
the fields of that I have shown you

487
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:17,580
so guys you are interested in backhoe a

488
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:22,639
security read Twitter all the cool

489
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:22,639
experts are there thank you thank you
