1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:03,439
okay good yeah

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,759
uh as the next talk we'll have um

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,000
uh talking about zero kind of protocols

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,040
and their

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,519
numerous men in the middle attacks

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,720
please go ahead and think

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,680
hello everyone i'm dear farah a master

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,600
student at the eurocom in france

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,600
today i'm going to present my paper

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,800
zerukov under

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,199
numerous men in the middle attacks

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,320
supervised by professor mark desi

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,238
with the booming of millions and

14
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,320
millions of iot devices around the globe

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,320
manual network configuration of this

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,160
device is not an option anymore

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,800
thus a zerocoin series of protocols has

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,320
been gaining popularity

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,239
because they ensure the possibility to

20
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,320
just plug and play the gadgets

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,160
a lot of connected devices speaks at

22
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,399
least one of these usability oriented

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,840
protocols even without the user

24
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,680
awareness using

25
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,000
these protocols exposes the devices to

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,920
several security risks and makes them

27
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,960
vulnerable to numerous attacks

28
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,319
so we will start by a brief introduction

29
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,240
about zeroconf and particular metrics

30
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,720
dns and dns service discovery

31
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,720
then we move to the core of our work

32
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,000
which is composed of three

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,560
main parts the first one is describing

34
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,360
our attacks

35
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,600
the second one is evaluating the attacks

36
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,880
and the third one is

37
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,080
detecting the attacks during this

38
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:22,960
presentation

39
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,640
and due to the shortage of time we

40
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,000
cannot describe the last two

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,240
parts and we will focus mainly on the

42
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,920
first part where we

43
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,600
made the attacks but you can read the

44
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,040
paper and you find everything

45
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,159
described in details so we start with

46
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,759
the first part

47
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,240
there is the zero includes several

48
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,040
protocols

49
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,880
such as a multicast dns dnssc and lmnr

50
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,240
we focus on the popular uh mdns and

51
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,200
dnssd

52
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,439
for instance all machines speaking apple

53
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,320
bonjour

54
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,079
are using mdns and in ssd by default

55
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,640
the purpose of mdns is to permit devices

56
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,399
to announce and resolve local domain

57
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:01,520
names

58
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,040
and the purpose of the nssd is to

59
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,560
permit the device to announce and

60
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,720
discover services in the network

61
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,878
these two uh relies on the multicast

62
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,400
group with the multicast

63
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,800
ip address 224.0.0.251

64
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
to communicate with each uh other

65
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,319
devices using the meticus channel

66
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,840
so in devices using mdns and the nssg

67
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,760
has three main properties

68
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,040
we have the ip address we have the local

69
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,239
domain domain name and we have the local

70
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,440
service name

71
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,959
the local domain name and the local

72
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,360
service name shares the pseudotop level

73
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,640
domain.local

74
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,800
which is resolved using the multicast

75
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,040
group mentioned in the previous slide

76
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,040
if you want to find further information

77
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,200
about how this works and how these

78
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,400
names are made you can read our paper

79
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:52,720
and

80
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,319
we find we can find everything in

81
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,760
details

82
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,760
now we move to how these protocols

83
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,599
operate we have

84
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,920
four devices and the multicast group and

85
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,680
the device number four has recently

86
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,120
joined the network

87
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,519
so it requires the others if there is

88
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,280
anyone is using his

89
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,840
uh ip his local domain name or his local

90
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,800
service name

91
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,959
if nobody responds to the query it means

92
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,200
that the properties are available

93
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,280
once the devices claims his properties

94
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,239
he will announce to

95
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,040
everyone and his services his domain

96
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,720
name and additional information

97
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,319
that may be required to establish a

98
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,480
connection later

99
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,480
at this point the device number four

100
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,319
wants to find available services in the

101
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,120
network

102
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,159
so it sounds query asking for

103
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,720
services that are available in this

104
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,319
situation each device

105
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,799
will respond with its services we have a

106
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,400
printing service offered by

107
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,959
connected device number one we have a

108
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,400
web service connected by

109
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,799
uh offered by connected device number

110
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,040
two and streaming service offered by a

111
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,599
connected device number three

112
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,239
now uh device number four six the

113
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,239
printing service so it queries it asking

114
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,080
that about

115
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,920
additional information to establish the

116
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,439
connection with it

117
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,519
so the device number one the provider of

118
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:08,720
the printing service

119
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,400
will respond by saving everything

120
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,799
required to use its services

121
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,439
now we move to the part where we made

122
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:15,920
our

123
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,238
attacks during our experiments we have

124
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,918
designed four different scenarios for

125
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:20,720
attacks

126
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,320
three technical ones and one social

127
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,840
engineering attack

128
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,759
so we start by the first technical

129
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,600
attack which is convincing the client

130
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,840
that the device's local domain name is

131
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,080
resolved to the attacker's ip

132
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,600
the second technical attack is

133
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,600
convincing the client that the

134
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,759
device's local service name is reachable

135
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,000
via the attacker's local domain name

136
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,080
the third technical attack is hijack the

137
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,680
local service name and first

138
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,199
device to change it and you have the

139
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,639
social engineering attack which is

140
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,160
announce a similar local

141
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,080
service name and bait the client into

142
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,360
picking it

143
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,919
we start by the first attack for every

144
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,680
attack i'm oversimplifying the attack

145
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,680
scenario to make the attack succeeds

146
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,280
there is several elements that can

147
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,960
change the outcome of the attack

148
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,919
we went through every tiny detail in the

149
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,560
paper

150
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,000
but for the sake of the time we will

151
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,680
stick to an abstract level of the attack

152
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,039
where we mentioned the most critical

153
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:11,919
parts

154
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,240
so we have the user the attacker and the

155
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,120
connected device

156
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,680
each one has the device properties and

157
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,800
the user will start by

158
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,199
asking about the services in this

159
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,240
situation the

160
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,400
connected device will respond by having

161
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,160
printing service

162
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,360
then the user will ask

163
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,440
the connected device about additional

164
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,360
information about the printing service

165
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,800
in the multicast group now the

166
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,039
connected device responds in multicast

167
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,400
however the attacker

168
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,720
responds in unicast to makes his attack

169
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,680
stealthy so

170
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,800
the connected device won't notice the

171
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,039
malicious response we notice in the

172
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,240
response of the attacker

173
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,759
there is uh the the ip address is

174
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,880
changed

175
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,520
uh which is corresponding to the local

176
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,639
domain name

177
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,199
in this situation well in addition to

178
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,880
several elements that is described in

179
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,680
the paper

180
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,600
the attacker succeeds at poisoning the

181
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,440
cache of the user and

182
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,800
succeeds at releasing the attack now we

183
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,319
move to the attack number

184
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,280
two we have the device properties again

185
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:15,840
the

186
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,960
user asks about the services

187
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,960
the connected device provides the

188
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,160
printing service

189
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,600
the user asks about additional

190
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,000
information about the printing service

191
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,680
and we have the in this situation

192
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,319
the attacker also changed the local

193
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,240
domain name in the response

194
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,319
compared to the first attack so in this

195
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,639
situation to reach the printing service

196
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,400
you have to reach the attacker.local

197
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,000
which is corresponding to the attacker

198
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,199
address and again with

199
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,400
with manipulating some fields and some

200
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,199
bits and

201
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,720
the the responses and the dns records

202
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,800
the attacks the attacker will succeed at

203
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,360
poisoning the cash of the user and

204
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,080
becoming the men in the middle now we

205
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,280
move to the attack

206
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,400
number three which is the most

207
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,720
complicated complicated one

208
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,919
we have the device properties

209
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,880
the user asks about their services the

210
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,599
connected device

211
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,240
provides the printing service the user

212
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,759
asks about more

213
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,560
information about the printing service

214
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,440
and

215
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,440
in the situation both the attacker and

216
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,199
connected device responds in the

217
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,639
multicast group

218
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,639
we notice that the attacker and the

219
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,319
connected device have the same

220
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,479
local service name and then this

221
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:33,680
situation will

222
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,280
uh will uh

223
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,080
will provoke a conflict resolution phase

224
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,960
basically

225
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,440
the two devices will query themselves

226
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,720
and about who is

227
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,960
who's using the printing service one two

228
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,840
three

229
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,639
and if nobody is using it they both want

230
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,599
to

231
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,360
bind it to their local domain names and

232
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,560
basically so the two devices

233
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,039
will have a conflict resolution phase

234
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,960
which is resolved by

235
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,479
the one who is having the higher

236
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,639
lexographic order uh

237
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,560
the one with the higher luxographic

238
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,120
order and you can check the paper how

239
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,240
uh how it works so in this situation

240
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,360
the higher lexicographic order is uh is

241
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,080
gained by

242
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,680
the connected device and he's supposed

243
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,440
to be the winner but

244
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,520
we found during our experiments that the

245
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,000
attacker can be non-compliant to the rfc

246
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
in this in this situation instead of

247
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,280
responding by

248
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,479
a query to verify to bind the

249
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,640
local service name to its local domain

250
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,120
name he will actually

251
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,519
response by a response by saying that

252
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,360
the printing service is corresponding to

253
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,039
his local domain name and it's the

254
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,519
reasonable va

255
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,720
its ip address so in this situation

256
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,360
any device who doesn't play the fair

257
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,040
game and sends his ground wins and

258
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,760
claims the names

259
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,080
by doing that the attacker forces the

260
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,200
connected device

261
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,160
to rename the local service name it is

262
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,040
using

263
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,839
then they will both announce the new

264
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:06,320
local

265
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,440
service names now the user will and will

266
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:09,920
answer

267
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,040
approaching the attacker

268
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,640
the user sees the local service name

269
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,480
only to reach the

270
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,360
printing service now the local service

271
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,880
the old legitimate

272
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,720
local service name is attached to

273
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,040
another machine which is the attackers

274
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,680
and the user cannot notice the change he

275
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,160
uses

276
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,040
the same name but he ends up breaching a

277
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,519
different machine

278
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,320
now we move to the attack number four

279
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,120
where

280
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,399
we have the device properties again

281
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,000
the user will ask about the services

282
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,880
we have the connected device providing

283
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,040
printing service

284
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,000
the user will ask about more additional

285
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,959
information about

286
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,920
printing service and in this situation

287
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,120
the attacker will add

288
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,880
an invisible character in the beginning

289
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,720
of the local service name

290
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,120
the user will find in the user interface

291
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,760
two

292
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,240
services having the same name knowing

293
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,760
that the names are sorted

294
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,720
the user will most will most likely pick

295
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,079
the first one which is

296
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,000
corresponding to the malicious service

297
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,760
thus succeeding at the attack

298
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,320
we move to our experiments during our

299
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,640
experiments we have the following lab

300
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,880
we have for the user we have used

301
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,839
windows machine

302
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,640
and a linux machine you build one for

303
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,640
the attack we have used a kali linux

304
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,360
machine

305
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,600
and for the devices we have used apple

306
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,959
tv third generation

307
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,079
and hp printer we have released

308
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,320
the experiments on other devices but the

309
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,160
behavior is the same

310
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,399
and these two makes us cover uh the

311
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,760
possible uh

312
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,920
all the possible outcomes that we have

313
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,839
seen during our experiments

314
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,000
in addition to the different operating

315
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,680
system the different scenarios and the

316
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,880
different devices

317
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,720
we went deeper through our experiments

318
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,959
into every tiny detail that may impact

319
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:01,839
the attack

320
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,920
like cash flush bit white and priority

321
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,839
of the records etc

322
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,399
thus we have 300 attacks we won't

323
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,079
present them here but you can find

324
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,920
everything and details in our paper

325
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,160
and the lessons we got from uh this are

326
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,160
the following

327
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,720
in addition to the usability uh design

328
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,480
of the protocols there is three main

329
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,839
problems that makes the

330
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,279
hacker's job easier the first

331
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,120
is a non-compliant adversary can

332
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,360
generate a denial of service against a

333
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,640
genuine participant

334
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,519
or he can even seal the properties of

335
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,360
virginian participants

336
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,760
the second one the unicast suppliers

337
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,680
makes the task of the attacker easier by

338
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,519
hiding his replies like we have seen in

339
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,560
attack number one and

340
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,680
attack number two and the third one

341
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,320
a non-compliant implementation makes it

342
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:50,800
even

343
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,360
easier in fact we find we have found

344
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:53,920
cases

345
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,320
where devices accept unikite responses

346
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,760
unicast responses

347
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,760
when they are not supposed to we haven't

348
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,800
found cases

349
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,279
where devices accept unicast responses

350
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,399
without even

351
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,320
asking the questions can we consider

352
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,519
this as a bug

353
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,920
but the good thing is the security the

354
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,839
severity of this problem is limited

355
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,839
because the machines accepting the

356
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,480
responses are only from the same

357
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,880
land domain thus reduce the attack

358
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,200
surface

359
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,120
considering these facts we've been

360
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,279
mentioning the following part of the rfc

361
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,279
that the implementation of protocol must

362
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,519
be robust in general an implementation

363
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,320
must be

364
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,480
conservative and its sending behavior

365
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,920
and liberal

366
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,040
liberal and its receiving behavior so

367
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,959
should we consider all the possibilities

368
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,560
or just consider how these

369
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,000
uh attack works and this one makes us

370
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,560
wonder

371
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,320
if the rfc doesn't consider the

372
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,600
consequence of having

373
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,200
a non-compliant participant is a

374
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,200
vulnerability or it is outside of the

375
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,519
scope of the rfc to do that

376
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,600
because if we look uh the other rfc even

377
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,440
tcp doesn't cover all the possible

378
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,079
outcomes

379
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,480
for example system session hijacking

380
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,800
attacks it relies on the higher level

381
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,000
layer for counter measures so we move on

382
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,839
to our conclusions

383
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,240
so these protocols are used are used a

384
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,200
lot even

385
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,480
in a well configured network the use of

386
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,079
these protocols makes the device

387
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,600
vulnerable

388
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,279
covering every outcome may not be

389
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,880
solution

390
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,920
thus delegate protection for another

391
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,839
entity which brings on to light the code

392
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,600
you have provided to detect such attacks

393
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,079
based on

394
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:35,279
zika known as bravo as well thank you

395
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,440
hey amazing presentation yeah thank you

396
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,880
very much

397
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,920
um let me start with the question until

398
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,720
we see

399
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,040
a couple of other people type them up so

400
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,079
this is great for

401
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,160
local attacks can you clarify

402
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,440
potentially the attack

403
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,399
uh model a bit so are these protocols

404
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,399
only used in trusted networks or how

405
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,600
does the

406
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,839
the attack scenario look like

407
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,880
usually even uh we found that these

408
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,079
protocols are you

409
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,920
used a lot even in by default

410
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,120
uh programs like when you use your uh

411
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,480
user interface of ubuntu machine to uh

412
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,000
search for printers around it

413
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,600
it will use by default even without

414
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,120
knowing uh

415
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,920
multicast dns and dns to find nearby

416
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,479
connected

417
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,680
printers we found the cases that is also

418
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,000
used

419
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,760
in windows and uh these protocols are

420
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,920
used a lot especially in iot devices

421
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,240
like

422
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,560
apple tv google chromecast printers

423
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,399
cctv cameras a lot

424
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,010
thank you um

425
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:48,720
[Music]

426
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,199
let's there's other questions from folks

427
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,680
they will likely come later on thanks

428
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,199
again for your presentation

429
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,320
this is cool it was a nice nice overview

430
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,760
to these vulnerable

431
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:08,079
tags and let's move on to the next talk
