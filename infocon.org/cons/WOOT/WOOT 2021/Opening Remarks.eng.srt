we've worked on on getting this this

30
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,720
nice program for you together this was a

31
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,280
really nice experience working and

32
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,600
collaborating with so many great members

33
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,119
in the program committee

34
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,920
we received a total of 34 papers even

35
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,320
though

36
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,280
the the deadline was very very short so

37
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,960
given the

38
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,200
uh the pandemic issues we had a very

39
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,479
short timeline

40
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,200
um but i i'm amazed by how many people

41
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,280
responded how many people

42
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,000
um agreed to be in the program committee

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,560
and

44
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,400
it's uh it's just super cool that so

45
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,159
many people

46
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,119
joined in helped and we received uh

47
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,240
pretty much the same amount of

48
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,079
submissions as we did last year even

49
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,680
though we only had a very short amount

50
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,240
of

51
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,399
uh of time we selected 12 papers that

52
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,439
you're gonna see today

53
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,920
for 35 percent acceptance rate which is

54
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,479
on par

55
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,280
with with previous years but one of the

56
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:55,759
things

57
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,479
fanfare and myself focused on was to to

58
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,840
like really push

59
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,000
the the review quality in this uh

60
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,960
um in this cycle so each paper got at

61
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,360
least

62
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,840
three reviews and i think the majority

63
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,639
of papers

64
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,040
every paper except two or three i think

65
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,959
two got four reviews

66
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,200
and we made sure that all of the the

67
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,560
reviewers were

68
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,040
extensive clearly stated what the pros

69
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,239
and cons are so that

70
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,800
even if your paper did not get selected

71
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,480
there was extensive amount of feedback

72
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,560
so you can improve your paper for the

73
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,519
uh for the next venue and adjust it

74
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,599
there were several hundred comments

75
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,760
in our online system which is something

76
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,120
i haven't really seen in

77
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,280
other conferences either and it was a

78
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,239
really

79
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,239
vivid and positive discussion so keep

80
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,640
keep that going thanks to all the

81
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,959
the amazing program committee members

82
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:47,840
and

83
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,680
people people working on this and i

84
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,920
think we've got a really nice program

85
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,280
for uh for all of us here

86
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,879
we also did an artifact evaluation so we

87
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,000
invited

88
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,920
officers of accepted papers to submit

89
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,440
their artifacts

90
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,040
we received four artifacts that were

91
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,280
evaluated by

92
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,120
six members in the artifact evaluation

93
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,560
committee and

94
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,879
eric van der kobie from freyja

95
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,560
university

96
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,080
actually led the the artifact evaluation

97
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,120
and work with the

98
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,680
with a team of uh like artifact

99
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,120
evolution community members

100
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,360
on figuring out how to reproduce all of

101
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,599
that and they were able to successfully

102
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,040
reproduce all of these

103
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,440
these issues and um open sourcing is a

104
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,120
big issue in our community and i think

105
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,760
that's a

106
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,760
a really nice step forward so this is

107
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,519
also a very nice

108
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,080
result that i'm quite quite proud of

109
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,440
um student attendees thanks to

110
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,040
sponsorship we were um giving out some

111
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,280
some free registrations for students so

112
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,040
we do want to continue this

113
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,200
over the next years and it was our like

114
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,360
we really intended to to motivate

115
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,920
up and coming hackers and thanks to

116
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,799
sponsorship we

117
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,879
were able to give out 20 free

118
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,799
registrations we received 42.

119
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,400
uh unfortunately we couldn't allow all

120
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,200
of them but we selected 20 amazing

121
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,280
amazing students in their bachelor or

122
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,120
less um

123
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,680
uh uh to actually attend root and come

124
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,918
up and become great hackers going

125
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,079
going forward we tried to balance uh

126
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:20,959
geographic

127
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,199
diversity motivation and potential of

128
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,360
the different people was hard to select

129
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,759
but in the end i think we got a good set

130
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,040
of people out there so keep that coming

131
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,160

234
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,160
