her work focused on investigating

17
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,000
security risk and developing hardware

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,200
and software defense

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,600
strategy against the hardware-based

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,480
attacks

21
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,600
her work has been covered by many media

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,760
outlets such as new york times and the

23
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,719
forbes

24
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,000
she has received the metatronic

award

29
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,159
explorations of trust in ar vr

30
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,080
and the smart devices in 2020

31
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,760
so let's welcome sarah uh sarah you can

32
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,880
take it away and okay so

33
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,520
i'm saran pasi assistant professor at

34
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,360
the university of florida

35
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,759
member of the florida institute of cyber

36
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,600
security

37
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,560
and my research in my lab focus on cyber

38
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,240
physical system security

39
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,840
and privacy but today i will mainly

40
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,560
talk about sense of security what it is

41
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,799
what is changing and what we expect is

42
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,640
gonna happen in the future

43
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,000
but before talking about security let's

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,640
face the elephant in the room first

45
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,119
we cannot talk about sensor security

46
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:51,759
without

47
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,840
mentioning the internet of everything

48
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,200
so cisco coined this term in 2012

49
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,759
to describe a dynamically changing

50
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,520
phenomenon that involves

51
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,280
four main actors people

52
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,720
thinks data and processes combine

53
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,599
into common interrelated and

54
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,000
interconnected system

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,280
so the people interact with themselves

56
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,280
and the surrounding we are physical

57
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,400
things like a

58
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,280
interconnected device then intelligent

59
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:25,920
system

60
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,280
and other smart technologies

61
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,920
process this data to understand what

62
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,560
it's called

63
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,840
human issues and also deliver relevant

64
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,360
content

65
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,599
but what it means the aim of the

66
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,400
internet of

67
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,440
everything is to improve experiences and

68
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,560
make smarter

69
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,200
decisions

70
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,800
but what it means makes market decision

71
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,680
for a machine

72
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,959
a computer a connected device

73
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,640
mainly a matter term i will use

74
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,560
is autonomous decisions does the ability

75
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,519
of a system

76
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,239
to be capable of performing autonomous

77
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,040
computing

78
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,080
and connecting to other devices wiring

79
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,360
wirelesses

80
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,760
for data exchange with partial or

81
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,120
completely absent

82
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,840
human supervision for example by using

83
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,000
artificial intelligence algorithm to

84
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,680
take a decision

85
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,239
but this system or system components

86
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,000
needs to gather information

87
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,959
about its status the environment the

88
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,959
interaction with other systems and

89
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,159
humans

90
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,159
in any given time to perform operations

91
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,519
so how it can able to do that well

92
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,040
the answer is using sensors

93
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,159
so all the device that we use every day

94
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,080
have sensor in it and in the future

95
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,480
system we use sensor as well

96
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,799
sensor has become the fundamental pieces

97
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,080
that allow

98
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,400
artificial intelligence based system to

99
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,840
change the environment

100
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,480
change and adapt themselves communicate

101
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,840
with other system

102
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,959
and with us as well

103
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,560
and the more this sensor become accurate

104
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,760
powerful

105
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,360
small the more the system they use this

106
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,400
sensor become

107
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,440
capable of things never seen before

108
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,918
expanding their primary capabilities to

109
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:20,639
become

110
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,000
multi-purpose systems such as machine

111
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,919
learning-based high-grade for example

112
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,360
for example now we have

113
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,400
cars that can automatically detect your

114
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:32,880
health

115
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,560
or predict your health condition when

116
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,800
you are driving

117
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,280
we have smart home devices that can

118
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,080
exchange

119
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,120
data between them and outside the wi-fi

120
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,479
range and between various homes

121
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,280
and very soon connected gadgets that can

122
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,479
be controlled by howard on top

123
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,080
and we are just at the beginning of this

124
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,520
revolution

125
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,560
all this sounds exciting but

126
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,400
while the internet of everything is

127
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,560
growing faster than ever

128
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,720
from a security perspective it can

129
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,240
become a living nightmare

130
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,639
when critical autonomous decisions are

131
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,240
made using erroneous

132
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,560
or altered data from sensor

133
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,720
we continue to see this gleam so this

134
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,400
effect in the news

135
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,560
we had data center that shot down

136
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,520
because of loud sound few years ago

137
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,520
that's because the sound were inducing

138
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,680
mechanical vibration that were affecting

139
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,639
our drives

140
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,720
and the capability to brighten and read

141
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,960
and consequently causing the operanding

142
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,600
system

143
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,960
to crash we had several recalls of

144
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,440
sensors of airbags and empty seat

145
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,720
detection system

146
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,720
because the normal car behavior were

147
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,240
inducing erroneous

148
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,960
measurement in the sensor and thus

149
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,320
tricking the software

150
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,840
to triggering unexpectedly

151
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,440
and recently we had the news of magnets

152
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,039
of the new iphone 12 able to deactivate

153
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,199
implantable cardiac devices

154
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,800
causing issues in patients but why many

155
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,880
of these effects are unintentional the

156
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,080
things change a lot

157
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,719
when we talk about deliberate attacks

158
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,600
so the more heavily we rely on sensors

159
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,840
to gather data from the environment and

160
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,720
from people

161
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,840
the more they become essential and those

162
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,120
also are viable attack vectors

163
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,000
but when we think about sensor a common

164
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,160
assumption that we have is that sensor

165
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,560
have these on home senses

166
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,960
does camera capture light in a certain

167
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,759
spectrum

168
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,280
range as our eyes might be known in the

169
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,080
same range

170
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,919
but still is appear to follow the same

171
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,520
behavior

172
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,520
microphone can perceive audio as our

173
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,120
ears and so on

174
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,560
however we cannot listen with our eyes

175
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,560
and definitely we cannot smell with our

176
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,720
ears and this is actually happening to

177
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,240
you i suggest to see a doctor

178
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,000
immediately because something is wrong

179
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,160
is happening but let's consider

180
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,319
now what it means attacking essentially

181
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,000
in this context

182
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,599
we are talking about attacks that

183
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,199
doesn't involve tampering with the

184
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,319
beating system

185
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,479
installing malware on intercept

186
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,440
communication

187
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,080
like the classical network based attacks

188
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,599
we are considering here

189
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,160
external signals able to alter the

190
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,080
victim system behavior

191
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,479
by exploiting sensors or electronic

192
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,720
components flaws and vulnerabilities

193
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,800
this signal can be electromagnetic

194
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,919
interference

195
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,800
light sound and other physical signals

196
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,199
or electromechanical vibration

197
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,479
crafted in a way to generate overlap

198
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,199
or hide the legitimate stimulus that

199
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,120
came from the environment

200
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,840
and provoke changes in the system that

201
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,560
can go

202
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,280
from the simple measurement errors to

203
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,599
more complex manipulation of closed-loop

204
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,199
connected system

205
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,360
with extreme case of systematically

206
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,199
changing the decision

207
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,240
takes by machine learning based models

208
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,680
like in object recognition navigation

209
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,840
control and so on

210
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,120
but why this happens well

211
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,080
the reason are mainly in general

212
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,440
electronic components

213
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,160
are affected by physical phenomena and

214
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,240
sensor in particular can perceive

215
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,080
more than what we expect and what we

216
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,840
designed them to do

217
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,360
i will show this example

218
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,959
in two cases of this

219
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,080
so differently from traditional security

220
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,320
threats that exploit vulnerability at

221
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,399
the software or network layer

222
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,600
for example this subtle alteration that

223
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,000
exploit hardware no linearities or

224
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,880
design flow

225
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,279
can remain unnoticed because the system

226
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,200
is not able to recognize what is a

227
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,399
legitimate signal from what is not

228
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,600
furthermore if the system

229
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,080
is taking critical automatic decision

230
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,120
the attacks

231
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,200
can propagate through the sensor to

232
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,959
affect the machine learning based

233
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:09,839
algorithm

234
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,160
that automatically become the final

235
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,600
victim of the adversary

236
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,920
the sensor directly exposed to the

237
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,560
external environment can become not only

238
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,399
the primary victim of the attack

239
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,519
but also a medium used to compromise

240
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,240
every system layer from the electronic

241
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,320
components to the high-level software

242
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,600
application

243
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,600
to gain partial or full control of a

244
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,839
system or the control over multiple

245
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,480
connected system

246
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,720
so classical security mechanisms just

247
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,240
software security

248
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,640
memory protection authentication or

249
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,720
cryptography are not enough

250
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,200
to eliminate these vulnerabilities

251
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,320
and also why despite more than a decade

252
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,720
of research on sensor security is still

253
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,120
extremely difficult to build an effect

254
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,279
in robust defenses against this type of

255
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,720
attacks

256
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,880
especially because mitigation are often

257
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,760
specific

258
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,760
to solve a specific problem rather than

259
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,519
consider a more broader scope

260
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,399
generally speaking there are many ways

261
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,600
to attack sensors

262
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,279
or they are the components directly

263
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,600
connected to it and in general nowadays

264
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,160
it means

265
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,560
exploiting five main factors or a

266
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,720
combination of them

267
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,600
so for example coupling such as the

268
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,880
capability to transfer

269
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,959
electrical energy from a medium to

270
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,600
another usually at a certain frequency

271
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,000
called resonant frequency the typical

272
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,880
example is using electromagnetic

273
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,320
interference to couple with a cable and

274
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,399
transfer ac voltage to the air

275
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,079
into dc voltage in a cable another ways

276
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,640
is not exploiting

277
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,800
non-linearities in the component design

278
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,440
that under certain conditions can

279
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,720
provoke a change

280
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,959
in the component behavior like in the

281
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,040
case of the ratification that we see in

282
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,519
the figure for example

283
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,320
in other cases the fact that when an

284
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,519
electrical signal

285
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,079
passed through a non-linear component it

286
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,079
can generate some signal

287
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,040
that can transfer information as well

288
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,200
but anniversary can also exploit a

289
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,120
certain periodic behavior

290
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,440
to predict when the sensor will capture

291
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,680
data and use it to inject

292
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,360
malicious signals and the right timing

293
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,000
finally over sensing such as the

294
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,040
possibility

295
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,200
the certain hardware act as an address

296
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,440
the modulator or converter to transform

297
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,240
one type of energy to another

298
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,399
but in practice these attacks are two

299
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,680
measures

300
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,959
or output or they generate a new signal

301
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:43,440
that can

302
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,560
overlap or hide the legitimate one from

303
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,920
the environment

304
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,360
or its sum or subtract as an offset to

305
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,560
the legitimacy

306
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,680
stimulus to have the release shape

307
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,320
an example on how an attacker can use on

308
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,639
the other senses to gain control over

309
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,240
connected system

310
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,240
is exploited microphone or voice

311
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,320
controllable system

312
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,639
this system such as google home amazon

313
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,360
alexa

314
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,000
or even to smartphone and tablets they

315
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,600
use voice assistance

316
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,920
hexil can perform many different

317
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,839
operations like setting timers

318
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,639
asking for the weather but also making

319
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,200
online purchases and controlling

320
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,680
other smart devices around the home such

321
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,000
as thermostat smart locks and even cars

322
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,639
this system works by recording an audio

323
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:35,920
signal with a microphone

324
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,000
using speech recognition algorithm to

325
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,279
parse the words

326
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,920
out and then perform its command based

327
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,319
on that

328
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,920
so we have a smaller chips men's

329
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,839
microphone that are using in all these

330
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:50,800
devices

331
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,920
but also our phones and tablets

332
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,160
this microphone are usually exposed to

333
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,120
the environment

334
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,200
through acoustic parts like these tiny

335
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,200
holes in the figure

336
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,279
these ports allowed a plastic pressure

337
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,320
wave to pass

338
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,800
directly to a microphone where they can

339
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,399
be measured

340
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,800
in many of them's microphone a parallel

341
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,079
plate capacitor

342
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,200
is formed out of a movable diaphragm and

343
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,120
a stationary back plate

344
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,279
so whenever the diaphragm moves in

345
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,200
response to acoustic pressure

346
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,079
the capacitance change this change is

347
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,240
then converted to a voltage signal

348
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,519
by the onboard assets

349
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,360
so this voice controllable system are

350
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,240
designed

351
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,160
under the underlying assumption the

352
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,760
microphone can capture

353
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,440
only acoustic signals but in reality

354
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,360
it's quite different so we discovered

355
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,519
that men's microphones are sensitive

356
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,120
also to light signal in particular the

357
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,440
output voltage of the microphone

358
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,160
is affected by lighting irradiance due

359
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,240
to a combination of good acoustic and

360
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,760
photoelectric effects

361
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,440
in the microphone structure that

362
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,920
naturally converts light into measurable

363
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,959
voltage differences

364
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,680
thus by firing a focusing laser beam

365
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,360
into the acoustic port

366
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,839
at a different bright intensity it is

367
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,839
possible to change the microphone output

368
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,839
voltage accordingly

369
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,920
so this is change the overall sensing

370
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,680
of the microphone itself

371
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,160
so if we have an amplitude modulated

372
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,120
light beam

373
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,519
it generates a voltage on the microphone

374
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,839
output the follow the input signal in

375
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,040
the audio frequency

376
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,600
range of the microphone so the higher

377
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,680
the amplitude of the light signal in

378
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,320
input

379
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,560
the higher is the amplitude of the

380
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,760
output voltage

381
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,079
signal with a very little distortion

382
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,160
this discovery has allowed the arbitrary

383
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,760
audio signal to be injected into

384
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:58,320
microphone and make the attack possible

385
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,040
so then we recorded the audio of someone

386
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,639
speaking a voice command

387
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,760
for example okay google what time is it

388
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,240
and then play this recording taking the

389
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,480
voltage signal from the output of the

390
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,440
laptop

391
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,480
amplify it with a simple audio amplifier

392
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,240
and then feed the signal into

393
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,160
the modulation input of the laser

394
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,920
current driver

395
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,839
the laser driver converts then the

396
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,000
voltage into a current signal

397
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,399
and by driving the current across the

398
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,040
diode

399
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,360
we generate this amplitude modulated

400
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,480
slight signal

401
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,360
representing the voice command the

402
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,519
device responded to the light as if

403
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,880
someone has spoken the command we tested

404
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,199
different laser sources with different

405
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:41,920
colors

406
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,040
from infrared to near ultraviolet

407
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,199
and the speaker replied to us every time

408
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,880
we then added optics to the laser to

409
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,959
reduce the beam area at the longer

410
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:55,759
ranges

411
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,920
and increase the irradiance that it

412
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,360
devices

413
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,000
with the help of these optics using a 5

414
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,120
milliwatt laser

415
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,839
namely equivalent to a laser pointer we

416
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,160
were able to achieve a successful attack

417
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,560
to a google home device 110 meters away

418
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,680
from the source and also between

419
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,800
buildings

420
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,720
and through windows so we test

421
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,360
more than 17 different devices from

422
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,519
google home to various model of amazon

423
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,160
echos

424
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,920
to facebook portal to google nest camera

425
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,920
and different models of smartphone and

426
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,199
tablets

427
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,680
beside each of them using different

428
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,040
microphones

429
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,440
all were affected in the same way by the

430
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,920
attack

431
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,480
but as we mentioned before attacking

432
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,639
sensor can be used also as a medium to

433
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,279
attack other connected system as well

434
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,279
we were able to execute the unauthorized

435
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,560
operation and affect

436
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,600
other iot devices connected to the voice

437
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,880
assistant

438
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,440
we were able to unlock from doors turn

439
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,399
on and off

440
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,839
lamps changing settings thermostats

441
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,959
and make purchases we were able to open

442
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,079
garage doors

443
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,119
unlock car doors and even start the car

444
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,520
engine

445
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,640
and more recently at the end of the past

446
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,079
year enable and disable

447
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,079
security cameras and test the more

448
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,760
recent smart speaker

449
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,359
after almost two years from the

450
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,119
vulnerability disclosure

451
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,599
iot device can still be affected by this

452
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,559
attack

453
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,559
and the reason is that while the

454
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:31,600
software

455
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,440
can be updated faster sensor

456
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,600
vulnerability is more the redesign

457
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,520
of the hardware and overall software

458
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,440
together that is difficult to achieve in

459
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,559
a brief period of time

460
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,760
i did notice though the last generation

461
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,559
of smart speaker release it

462
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,120
is changing something in the design and

463
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,080
the microphone

464
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,559
ports are not exposed anymore

465
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,919
but with the hacker mindset i also

466
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,080
noticed that this month a new attack

467
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,960
came out they use intermodulation as we

468
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,360
saw before to send inaudible commands

469
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,440
more than two meters away from the smart

470
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,559
speakers

471
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,640
using electromagnetic interference

472
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,640
instead of the laser

473
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,960
so even if the sensor is not exposed

474
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,799
anymore we can still

475
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,080
be affected by adversarial signals

476
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,679
and the underlying sensor

477
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,679
vulnerabilities are still there

478
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,520
ready for an anniversary to explore

479
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,400
but the problem of sensor security is

480
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,160
even more deeper than that

481
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,240
we are able to attack not just the smart

482
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,400
speaker but also the device connected to

483
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:40,880
it

484
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,919
also because a combination of several

485
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:44,320
vulnerabilities

486
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,960
old and new that together were causing

487
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,919
multiple security issues

488
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,000
first of all personalization and

489
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,120
authentication

490
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,240
are two vertical different concepts for

491
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,080
example smart speakers are designed to

492
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,760
be used by multiple users

493
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,919
so no authentication were present by

494
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,160
default at the time of our attack

495
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,640
allowing any user to perform critical

496
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,520
action

497
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,200
such as unlocking doors using only voice

498
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,440
thus fully rely on the microphone sensor

499
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,880
data

500
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,840
only a personalization feature were

501
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,000
present on these devices

502
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,919
but this feature using this feature

503
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:26,160
where a possible train the system to

504
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,160
distinguish our voice from other

505
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,840
people's voices

506
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,320
personalize the device responses and

507
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,080
execute the selected action

508
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,320
like play a certain music when you

509
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,480
arrive at home

510
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,880
other voice assistants like siri use

511
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,039
speaker recognition by default

512
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,600
however there are too many issues on

513
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,600
this type of feature

514
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,520
first we discovered that the condition

515
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,960
was easily bypassed

516
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,280
using various online tools like

517
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,520
text-to-speech services

518
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,160
for me became the owner voice second we

519
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,080
discovered that the recognition was

520
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,400
limited to only the wake up world

521
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,200
like a siri ignoring the rest of the

522
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,840

523
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,240
another factor that we not in it is

524
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,360
floyd was the present

525
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,559
of routines and apps that can allow the

526
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,880
device to do specific things

527
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,440
they could not do otherwise such as

528
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,760
combining action that involves multiple

529
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,120
devices

530
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,520
these features designed to augmenting

531
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,520
the usability of the device and the

532
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,400
overall

533
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,600
facilitate the user interaction but was

534
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,000
in fact

535
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,880
undermining the security of the system

536
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,840
usually

537
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,320
some critical operations such as unlock

538
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,360
a smart lock

539
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,640
requires the user to speak a pin number

540
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,760
but with these routines or services were

541
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,960
possible to bypass the security checks

542
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,960
for example i was able to set up my

543
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,960
system to unlock the front door

544
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,039
and the alarm system when i use the

545
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,400
sentence i'm home

546
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,480
instead of asking for a pin code or

547
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,840
press a button

548
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,000
finally we encounter still common and

549
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,640
old

550
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,919
iot security vulnerabilities as i

551
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:12,880
mentioned before

552
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,919
some unlocking or design operation are

553
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:17,520
disabled by default

554
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,200
for our security and for execute them

555
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,159
you have to set up a hand digit pin

556
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:24,559
which

557
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,480
must be spoken before the voice

558
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,840
assistant will execute

559
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,640
action we discovered that some smart

560
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,559
devices doesn't require a pin for

561
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:33,840
certain operation

562
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,080
even if they can open to security

563
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,640
threads like open the garage door open

564
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,480
the trunk of a car

565
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,559
and usually we expect that after a

566
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,400
number of wrong pin attempts

567
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,559
the system will disable the feature

568
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,120
erase an alarm or block the operation

569
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,440
however we were able to brute force pin

570
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,559
numbers

571
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,039
since there were no mechanism to stop

572
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:55,919
the attempts

573
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,640
after a number of failed trials or it

574
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,799
was possible to set a pin numbers

575
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:04,080
of only one digit very easy to guess

576
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,880
with a few attempts

577
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,280
even in these specific vulnerabilities

578
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,480
has been fixed

579
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,640
new devices are released every day and

580
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,280
the security best practice can easily be

581
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,840
overlooked

582
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,120
as another example when attacking cars

583
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,880
connected to this poison system we

584
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,640
discovered that some application

585
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,919
official and not official didn't require

586
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:28,320
a pin

587
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,120
for unlocking doors or neither key

588
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,400
proximity

589
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,480
in one of them there is no mechanism to

590
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,760
prevent re-forcing

591
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,158
as well

592
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,960
so why the technology and the internet

593
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,559
of everything evolved faster than

594
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:43,600
heavier

595
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,000
all the well-known vulnerabilities sum

596
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,840
to the newest one and consumer

597
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,280
electronic consensus

598
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,200
still remain unprotected against

599
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,799
malicious attacks

600
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,720
because of the exposure to the

601
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,400
environment and the fact that the

602
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,960
majority of the systems still blindly

603
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,840
rely on sensor data

604
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,440
that's the game they can be attacked

605
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,280
through these weak channels

606
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,000
and even more important this confirm how

607
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,559
the patchfix strategy is not a viable

608
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:11,679
solution anymore

609
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,880
in this evolving world

610
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,919
but what about artificial intelligence

611
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,440
how about machine learning-based

612
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,400
techniques

613
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,480
how the sensor can affect machine

614
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,280
learning models

615
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,600
well as an example on how an attacker

616
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,159
can use

617
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,440
sensor to affect the decision make by

618
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,559
artificial intelligence models is what

619
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,039
is happening in the automotive industry

620
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,039
and in particular in advanced driver

621
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,240
assistance system

622
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,039
in the past years used in autonomous

623
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,080
vehicles for

624
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,000
obstacle avoidance this system has in

625
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,960
drones and

626
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,400
robots use information collected by

627
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,159
sensor for example lidar cameras

628
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,400
and radars to enhance the driver

629
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,919
capabilities

630
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,400
but also to take partial or fulcrum

631
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,880
automatic control of critical driving

632
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,000
processing

633
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,960
like braking or steering or changing the

634
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,760
speed of a car

635
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,640
there are several tons of examples of

636
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,120
how obstacle detection model can be

637
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,760
fought by a versailles example

638
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,880
like stickers on the road or other

639
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,480
cellular physical object

640
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,840
that we saw two days ago in the main

641
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,240
conference but

642
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,720
sensor manipulation can be used as well

643
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,039
to generate these adversarial examples

644
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,880
so if you think about a lidar sensor for

645
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,600
example

646
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,400
using the timing of the laser refraction

647
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,320
to determine the distance

648
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,600
from a potential obstacle building a 2d

649
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,039
or a 3d map of the surrounding

650
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,679
while this technology was very expensive

651
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:58,480
and limited

652
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,360
in use only for cars till few years a

653
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,640
few years ago

654
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,039
nowadays we have cheap lidar sensor

655
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,000
technologies

656
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,559
integrating our phones and vr system for

657
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:09,200
augmented

658
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,799
reality so by

659
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,360
exploiting the periodicity pattern on

660
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,320
this sensor

661
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,640
we were able to conduct a simple relay

662
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,600
attack to fake

663
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,880
echo signal back to the sensor

664
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,840
to trick it into receive real infection

665
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,720
from an object

666
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,960
in a controlled way by adjusting the

667
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,840
post timing

668
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,720
and use that to escalate to the next

669
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,360
level

670
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,559
by creating a versatile example able to

671
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,400
fool the entire perception

672
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,880
system as you can see here the ability

673
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,159
to apollo system

674
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,840
using vehicles and autonomous vehicles

675
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:57,520
to see non-existent obstacles

676
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,559
we don't require to spoof entire

677
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,440
shape of a specific obstacle like a cars

678
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,799
or a pedestrian

679
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,200
but optimizing the attack to increase

680
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,039
the probability of success

681
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,760
with few numbers of spoofed echo signal

682
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,360
as possible

683
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,120
as you can see in this picture the

684
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,120
adversarial example was a simple

685
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,239
horizontal line

686
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,600
we had to demonstrate at the time the

687
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,600
possibility to stop a car

688
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,080
in simulation scenarios conducting two

689
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:30,720
specific

690
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,760
attacks one for making the car

691
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,480
automatically stop and activate the

692
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,520
brakes

693
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,240
while the other by preventing a car to

694
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:40,880
move

695
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,840
in an intersection

696
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,200
but very recently in the past month we

697
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,279
also demonstrate how it's possible to

698
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:49,840
conduct

699
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,840
this attack on moving targets in

700
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,679
realistic scenarios

701
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,120
by tracking the sensor location by using

702
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,360
simple object detection models and

703
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,679
should laser forces synchronize with the

704
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:02,640
target speed

705
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,840
and sensors as you can see in the figure

706
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,480
so why the technology and the internet

707
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,520
of everything

708
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,520
evolve faster than ever also attackers

709
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,240
involved

710
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,799
to exploit new technologies to conduct

711
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,480
attacks

712
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,559
and the hardware components and sensors

713
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,600
can be used as an

714
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,439
attack surfaces to affect

715
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,120
intelligent system and machine learning

716
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,120
based technology

717
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,240
does this paramount to not only build

718
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,880
more robust machine learning models to

719
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,279
defeat adversarial example

720
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,399
but also protecting these sensors

721
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,520
that makes in this model and use

722
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,520
the sensor together in data

723
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,279
but most important we need to stop

724
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,679
thinking about hardware and software as

725
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:00,399
a separate

726
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:03,679
entities with their own separate rules

727
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,279
and paradigms in which way we can better

728
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:08,880
trust autonomous system

729
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,320
if we don't trust if we don't start

730
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,559
from a addressing the security of the

731
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,000
fundamental pieces

732
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
and considering harder and softer

733
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,240
together as a whole

734
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,840
when we research security strategies

735
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,080
conducting conducting this type of

736
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,159
attacks needs to be the first step

737
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,720
to build interconnected system resilient

738
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,559
and transported to current

739
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:36,799
and not yet to be discovered attacks

740
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,440
and this starts also from a dialogue

741
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,840
between software and hardware expert and

742
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,080
manufacturer

743
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,240
we have seen in 2020 the convergence

744
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,559
between cyber security and national

745
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,000
security

746
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,399
and a constant threat to critical

747
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,320
infrastructure

748
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,520
the future it will be

749
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,520
artificial intelligence based cyber

750
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,559
attacks

751
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,760
they start from connected devices

752
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,159
the impact of this attack will depend

753
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:09,440
not only

754
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,159
on the speed of adoption of emerging

755
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:13,760
technologies

756
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,039
but also on the ability to secure them

757
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,520
timely

758
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,720
so the pandemic can show us the world

759
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,480
that can rapidly change

760
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,720
because as a security researcher we need

761
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,559
to be able to predict these kind of

762
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:31,600
changes before

763
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,880
becoming a new security threat so

764
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,720
why don't start from censors so

765
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,840
thanks i shorted the presentation

766
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,480
here we go

767
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,360
oh i can see some questions great

768
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,799
thank you so much for a great

769
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,679
presentation um

770
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:02,640
can people can post questions in a chart

771
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,640
um actually um can you shed some

772
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,360
uh light on what is the major challenge

773
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:11,679
of

774
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,799
uh in the area of senses security

775
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,600
you you said we we need to consider

776
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,679
hardware and software together uh

777
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,799
what do you think uh uh

778
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:26,240
is the major challenge

779
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,559
the major challenges is to understand

780
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,000
that hardware

781
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,840
behave different from software and

782
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,520
it seems there is a like something

783
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,440
obvious but is not as we can see

784
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,320
in like comments all these

785
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,440
vulnerabilities

786
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,520
are related to the fact that the sensor

787
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,279
can perceive more than what

788
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:53,200
we expect so the characteristics

789
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,480
on that depends on the physics

790
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,760
of the electronics component but also

791
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,880
the environment

792
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,880
where the system is immersive too

793
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,320
uh for example the sensors

794
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,640
in cars that were able to um

795
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,559
basically um maybe these are a call that

796
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:17,360
happened

797
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,919
to censoring cars that were tricked

798
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,200
by measurement from the own

799
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,919
vibration of the car itself that was

800
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,000
misinterpreted

801
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,480
so we need to start to study on sensor

802
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,360
to understand

803
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,840
how to be in the even better software

804
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,080
because if i have this changing

805
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,320
in the behavior and like this

806
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,080
interaction how i can build a better

807
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,519
software to compensate with

808
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,640
some when something happen or

809
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,760
in which way i can address when

810
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,279
something is trying

811
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,960
to inject some signals we have different

812
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,399
ways to do it

813
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:05,200
but maybe in many techniques that start

814
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,080
from

815
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,760
detection for example and

816
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,039
they can evolve in something more

817
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,760
and like they can be reconstruction of

818
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,039
the signals

819
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,200
but to do that we need to understand the

820
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,960
physics so i think is this

821
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,760
is the first step

822
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:28,159
since uh we got many questions

823
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,440
in in the chat um so let me

824
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,279
just uh uh take them one by one

825
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:38,480
so this is one question from uh would

826
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,360
you

827
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,919
uh what would be a count measure to

828
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:42,960
these attacks

829
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,480
use multiple sensors and never trust

830
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,760
a single sensor's input

831
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,399
i think this is one way to go and there

832
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:53,200
is

833
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,039
like two different approaches one is

834
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:01,120
uh like only arbor it means

835
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,720
that you can have like check and control

836
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,440
of the structure like the electronic

837
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,000
board

838
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,159
itself and it can be software it means

839
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,960
like a control of the input uh like uh

840
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,679
have

841
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,200
two spaces so

842
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,159
check or maybe all using for example

843
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,240
algorithm and then analyze the normal

844
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,679
behavior so that you can

845
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:28,799
detect anomalies but you have

846
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,600
different levels of these defense that

847
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,200
can be

848
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,039
basically combined together to build a

849
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,880
more resistant defense

850
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,519
because the issue is when you try to

851
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,159
mitigate

852
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:45,200
one it can happen that can become

853
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,919
another vectors attack vectors that can

854
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:48,240
be

855
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,960
exploited so you need to compensate this

856
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,039
hardware and software in the same time

857
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:56,159
but yeah so maybe as you don't trust the

858
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:00,559
uh like processors uh it can happen that

859
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,200
you just assume that you don't trust

860
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,799
every single sensor

861
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,000
okay uh thanks another question from

862
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,918
uh joe hans

863
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,879
most of your attacks so far seem to be

864
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:17,760
based on

865
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,040
what happens if we shoot it with lasers

866
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,839
what are some of the other potential

867
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:25,679
sensor vulnerabilities that you can

868
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,918
think of

869
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:30,239
so as i mentioned at the beginning of

870
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,679
the presentation

871
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,639
i'm not to just only use lasers but i

872
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,839
use also

873
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:38,399
like sound electromagnetic interference

874
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,800
so there are many examples

875
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,359
in the literature and something that i'm

876
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,199
currently work on

877
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:48,879
that are based on a different type of

878
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,040
signal injection

879
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,639
and so for example

880
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,800
one work on medical device that i

881
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,000
recently

882
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
published was how

883
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,560
these temperature sensors they are using

884
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,560
for patient control in this case for

885
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,800
infant incubators and i think

886
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,320
also sharon from university uh professor

887
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,560
of university of louisiana is here

888
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:18,640
and that can be used to manipulate

889
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,920
and a change closed loop system in this

890
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,520
infant incubator but i use

891
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,359
electromagnetic interference

892
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:29,119
from a certain distance so remotely

893
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,480
and this can be an example but yes laser

894
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,520
is more cool in a way but definitely

895
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,079
like

896
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,119
every type of stimulus

897
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,160
external symmetry can be used as

898
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,839
an attack vector

899
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,800
okay another question from james

900
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,000
how hard is it to convert some audio

901
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,960
into an equivalent nasal form so

902
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,240
the conversion is done by modulating the

903
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,599
current

904
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,640
so is automatically done

905
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,640
in our cases by the driver system

906
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,920
so um basically what you do

907
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,280
is to it is similar to an amplitude

908
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,680
modulation

909
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,960
but uh like you're changing the current

910
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,880
and you change the current in base on

911
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,720
the amplitude of the audio signals

912
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:32,320
because the laser are driven by current

913
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,680
and not by voltage

914
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,000
that's the difference yeah maybe a

915
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,200
relevant question is

916
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,240
how um how expensive is those

917
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,520
uh uh like modulator or

918
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,720
or measurement equipment

919
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,920
so it depends maybe uh definitely uh

920
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,280
we had the uh like in the beginning

921
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,040
we use more like a bunch of uh than

922
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,400
top instrumentation like

923
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,680
maybe something design specifically for

924
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,480
that

925
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,400
but for example like some module using

926
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,640
light show can be used so maybe at the

927
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,160
end the cheapest setup

928
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,240
was around three hundred dollars for the

929
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,520
driver

930
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,320
so something relatively cheap compared

931
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:18,800
to

932
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,000
uh like the actual setup and for laser

933
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,119
or maybe a five millivolt laser was

934
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,160
a laser pointer so a few dollars

935
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,200
okay um

936
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,079
i guess um many more questions uh one

937
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,520
question from

938
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:40,720
matias how will we update sensors

939
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,520
so it's difficult this is a very good

940
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,400
question

941
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,520
and updated electronic device is

942
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,160
difficult

943
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,599
it depends on the technology and

944
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,599
it depends on like a balance between the

945
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:56,480
cost

946
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,359
and the actual system so for iot the

947
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,280
problem is there are mostly cheapest

948
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,079
device

949
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,400
and the sensors that are using hardship

950
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,480
for this reason

951
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,040
so for example at the beginning

952
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,640
it happened that the researcher and

953
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,160
the chip designer recognized that uh

954
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,920
this kind of mems microphone were

955
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,119
susceptible to light interference

956
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,560
so exist uh in a certain

957
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,000
um like a commercial product

958
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,160
where you have this kind of sensor that

959
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,440
are resistant on

960
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,720
interference but the difference is how

961
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,400
expensive the device is how expensive it

962
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,040
is

963
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,920
to actually integrate an hardware

964
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,200
defense

965
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,520
so it needs to be a combination between

966
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,400
the two

967
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,720
but when is not possible or maybe you

968
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,240
know like the goal

969
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,880
and this is like the goal for uh our

970
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,520
research

971
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,880
in security should we find an effective

972
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,160
way

973
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,880
to mitigate these attacks and that can

974
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,359
become

975
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:06,000
from software another together so this

976
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,359
is the way to go

977
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,839
and the technology needs to change to

978
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:12,960
include security

979
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,960
okay um then another question from

980
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,240
uh ryan how do you think this attack

981
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,200
modalities and the new sensor arrays and

982
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,000
the types

983
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,040
will affect uh present and future

984
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,720
augmented and virtual reality

985
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,000
system yes so

986
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,359
as i mentioned talking about the lidar

987
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:40,880
this sensor are more and more

988
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,160
cheap because the technology has changed

989
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,000
the technology of the live data has

990
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,079
become less expensive

991
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:52,000
and uh is using for like a materiality

992
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,359
system for example

993
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:57,359
for like face recognition technology

994
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:01,280
is using higher sensors

995
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,480
or camera thermal cameras

996
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,880
you have all this new technology that is

997
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,400
available right now

998
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,440
at lower cost and

999
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,480
for example when we think about

1000
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,160
the future of a virtual reality system

1001
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,359
we are thinking about a system that are

1002
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:22,960
more integrated

1003
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,079
with our environment so

1004
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,440
the pandemic has increased a lot this

1005
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,240
kind

1006
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,760
of product and development

1007
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,440
so this can basically escalate

1008
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:42,880
on this kind of new feature

1009
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,720
okay one more question on

1010
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:51,520
from iranian what is the actual physical

1011
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,079
effect

1012
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,960
that makes the mem's uh microphone

1013
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,880
receive light

1014
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,200
what's this

1015
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,680
yeah this previous known as a

1016
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:07,359
reliability problem immense microphone

1017
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:12,000
so there are two different things um

1018
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,160
that this kind of mems microphone can

1019
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,960
also be susceptible to light

1020
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,079
is due to two main

1021
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,560
effects one is the photo acoustic effect

1022
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,880
and one is the photoelectric effect

1023
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,680
one is on the azex one is on the

1024
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,640
membrane

1025
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:34,079
and you have a differences and

1026
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:37,839
different levels of one is the effect

1027
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:39,280
that is predominant

1028
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,599
compared to the other and based on the

1029
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,440
physical characteristics because the

1030
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,800
structure of the microphone chain

1031
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,359
so it's a combination of multiple effect

1032
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:50,319
that's why

1033
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:53,440
it's uh like

1034
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,359
difficult to uh fabricate a chip

1035
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:00,839
or sensor they can actually avoid

1036
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:04,720
these this problematic in the first

1037
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,040
place

1038
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,920
okay um i guess uh are there any more

1039
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,640
