the athens on

39
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,520
uh on today's workshop i think um i may

40
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,119
be a bit biased but i think that's

41
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,720
that's the best workshop i've actually

42
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,640
seen over the

43
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,119
the last year during the pandemic there

44
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,799
was a lot of interaction there were a

45
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,240
lot of questions

46
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,439
um it worked mostly well apart from a

47
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,280
couple of technical problems that had to

48
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:51,840
be there

49
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,399
and i think overall all of you did an

50
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,240
amazing job joining here

51
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,799

52
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,920
questions

53
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,840
and this brings us to pretty much the

54
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,439
end of today's workshop

55
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,200
