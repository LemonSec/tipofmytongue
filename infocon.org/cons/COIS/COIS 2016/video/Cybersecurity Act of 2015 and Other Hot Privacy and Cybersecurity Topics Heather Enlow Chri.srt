1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,019
but Nowitzki and what the various lost
her dressing room he's with our lockers

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:08,639
while we're going to talk about some hot
topics going right now we're right now

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:14,969
on cybersecurity and Apple and other fun
stuff so we have a lot to cover any of

4
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:18,349
the materials we may go through the
slides pretty quickly but you feel free

5
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:22,439
to interrupt and ask us questions so
many jump right into

6
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:29,090
so it was passed in December 18 last
year a skirt the autonomous budget bill

7
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:32,759
you're asking why with a cybersecurity
bill and the budget bill because that's

8
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,170
how anything is done lately but if you
were following the the various drafted

9
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:43,510
bills to April passed the House dealing
with this issue and as well as well

10
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:49,099
October and Senate and so the one that
was passed was more closely aligned to

11
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,399
the one that was passed in October but
stunning and so the final season there

12
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,940
was intense negotiations to reconcile
these bills and one of the big issues

13
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,930
hot topics time with which agency was
going to be in charge of the federal

14
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,930
information sharing in that ended up
being DHS

15
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:10,870
so what it is the main provision that
we're going to focus on today the

16
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:15,040
mechanism for sharing cyber security
information among the private sector and

17
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,170
federal entities as well as for the
federal entities to shared amongst

18
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:23,230
themselves in authorizes and it needs to
monitor certain information systems and

19
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:28,280
take certain defensive measures however
its you still are subject to limitations

20
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:35,620
under that can be offensive measures
under this bill to provide several safe

21
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:39,640
harbors from liability which to a lot of
industries that were lobbying for this

22
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,750
type of bill was very important about
some gonna spend a few moments of the

23
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:48,810
definitions so has to deal with what is
a cyberthreat indicator this is what's

24
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:55,220
going to share and so they're very broad
and typical what you would expect a

25
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,670
method to feed a security control of are
exploiting a security vulnerability

26
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:06,670
causing a user of legitimate access that
is an information system you note I'm

27
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:11,020
really unable to defeat the security
control orders security vulnerability

28
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:16,020
wishes cyber cyber community control
they take into account that actual

29
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,020
potential harm that could be caused by
the incident

30
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:25,140
abroad catch all the end any other
attribute of a cybersecurity threat of

31
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,269
disclosure which is not otherwise
prohibited by law or any combination of

32
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:33,250
all of these things so it starts out
kinda specific but has hecho bien you

33
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:38,590
know as the space continues to evolve so
what are defensive measures and their

34
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:42,690
interaction device procedure signature
technique or other measure applied to an

35
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:47,380
information system that's stored on
crossfire transit transferring

36
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,140
information that the text prevent or
mitigate unknown suspected cyber

37
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,359
security threat vulnerability

38
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,580
and it excludes measures that destroys
rendered unusable provides unauthorized

39
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:06,590
access to more information system last
year on system or it here you know my

40
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:13,530
train another person system and then
given you so the first problem see says

41
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,830
the federal sharing now this is the
sharing amongst the agency's so they

42
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:23,430
were 22 issue procedures 60 days to its
highly sharing cyberthreat information

43
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:29,030
I'm actually got this one time in
february sixteenth the DHS Department

44
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:34,920
justice released their privacy and civil
liberties in our guidelines that govern

45
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,880
the receipt retention use and
dissemination of cyber threat indicators

46
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:44,320
by federal entity so what they were
instructed to do and have done is to

47
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:49,579
ensure real-time sharing among federal
agencies they've also incorporate

48
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,800
existing processes roles and
responsibilities such as I snacks and

49
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:58,780
other information sharing organizations
that have already been set up rules and

50
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,620
procedures for notifying entities that
receive erroneous information or

51
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:08,440
information like personal information
was shared in violation of interesting

52
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,950
in the interim guidelines the kind of
just want this to if you get information

53
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:18,599
as to where you share inadvertently
follow your own agencies reach

54
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:26,680
notification plan so it's kind of up to
the agency to set her folks and also

55
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,479
requires removal personal information
that's not related to cybersecurity

56
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:39,110
about a portal that will handle all the
sharing and its gonna meet the format

57
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,110
how this entry to share as well as your
personal information

58
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:50,450
created a mechanism for nine federal
sharing this is sharing both the private

59
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:53,450
sector to the federal government and
vice versa

60
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,640
to all parties have to protect
classified information from improper

61
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:03,490
disclosure and comply with any user
share sure he also described personally

62
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:08,110
identifying information sharing
cyberthreat indicators I'm not directly

63
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:15,870
related to this so they had ninety days
to these rules so on March 17 they did

64
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:19,050
actually announce the probable sharing
with the private sector the reason the

65
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:24,169
same portal that you just set up only
four so far about six companies have

66
00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:28,479
signed on its course we don't know any
of these are because they're

67
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:34,360
Freedom of Information Act request and
through this you can actually you can

68
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:40,940
notify them of cyber share with them via
web for the portal or by e-mail e-mail

69
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:57,979
address now where you can share with the
agency's who if they shared improperly

70
00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:03,979
is defined in their own response plans I
think the private sector around data

71
00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:05,229
classifications

72
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:14,020
really identifies you know obvious name
address other things like IP address may

73
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:24,109
be less rare so what can the federal
government do and private sector

74
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:28,360
entities that receive the information
will only be used for security purposes

75
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,600
for identifying security threats and
vulnerabilities responding to preventing

76
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:40,220
or mitigating a specific threat or
attack responding to investigating

77
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:46,490
prosecuting or Thursday to a minor
offenses against minors also just then

78
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:51,750
here's the property offences relating to
fraud identity espionage censorship or

79
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:56,810
the protection of trade secrets so they
start listening offers specific uses

80
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:05,600
this is very wrong with the federal
government or big issue under season

81
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:12,360
that was heavily lobbied sectors prior
to its passage was but these live

82
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,830
witness there going to be any state
partners sharing because there was you

83
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:20,650
know there's not clarity into if for
example and financial services if they

84
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:25,489
shared information other financial
services violation of antitrust do you

85
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:29,620
have to know how to share what happens
if you don't share this is created

86
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,260
so under the bill a lot there's no civil
liability sharing receiving several

87
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:40,070
indicators for defensive measures you
can bring her a court under the case law

88
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,969
in court

89
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:48,610
shared information cannot be used by
regulators you inform their their

90
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:53,740
investigation of you basically against
you and her action however they can use

91
00:07:53,740 --> 00:08:00,770
it to come up with new rules to regulate
generally the sector there's no

92
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:04,010
antitrust liability for private entities
exchange

93
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:08,570
indicators so a lot of industries that
that was a very needed and necessary

94
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:14,040
clarification there's no waiver
privileges and protections including

95
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,640
trade secrets so if you happen to share
something that includes trade secret

96
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,700
information or maybe formation did not
waive that information sharing it

97
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:27,180
through this mechanism also explicitly
provided that there's no duty to warn

98
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:32,030
there's no duty to act in their
liability for not sharing so despite

99
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:36,679
this being set up each use not to be
involved where he received information

100
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:43,510
that don't take action there's no
liability for failure to act or omission

101
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:51,339
and also requiring sharing that they
cannot do that just that as an award of

102
00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:55,440
any sort of federal contract so that we
can really anybody to participate

103
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:54,370
systems and includes those provided
consent of the you can't rendered

104
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:58,890
unusable there's a reporter prior to
Congress about the effectiveness of how

105
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:02,730
this is going to drive preemption of
state laws so you know if they come up

106
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:07,250
and try to modify this they can't
there's also a ten years since I'm not

107
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:13,670
so the concerns remain about you know
what a lot of groups at seventeen

108
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:19,189
organizations in back in January just in
a letter around including the ACLU

109
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:24,390
democracy criticizing but how this bill
is passed the lack of transparency the

110
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:28,120
kind of Hush Hush negotiations and
tacked onto anonymous budget bill

111
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:34,480
they think that this will even brought
into government access to private

112
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,810
information that doesn't acrobatically
protect privacy rights and they think

113
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:44,649
that the government can use probably the
DHS has acknowledged that there is some

114
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:47,829
flaws with the sharing system that's
been set up but it doesn't make it not

115
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:52,258
me not scrap copper with your personal
data but there's kind of saying well

116
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:58,290
we're gonna fix it as we go into people
bring the issue to me so well maybe not

117
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:03,689
you know the best but we'll see how it
happens here so since due to the prison

118
00:11:03,689 --> 00:11:07,800
they're actually has been a bill
introduced in house to repeal it was

119
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,120
introduced on January 8th has bipartisan
work but so far as it moves there's

120
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:17,240
anything so we'll see what happens on
there I did want to mention quickly

121
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:22,499
around the same time you cyber director
was agreed upon it was network and

122
00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:27,920
information security director it was
agreed upon in in principle in you and

123
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,959
this time around the same time as the
draft epr Global Data Protection

124
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:37,399
Directive applies to critical
infrastructure operators as well as

125
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:41,339
digital service providers in the Google
and Facebook and it requires them to

126
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:47,110
maintain appropriate security measures
and egregious new requirements you

127
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:56,490
currently it's still being debated in
Parliament speaking at the EU so another

128
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:02,059
hot topic has been the downfall of the
safe harbor and the rise of the privacy

129
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:08,279
shield so all this in context of the EU
Data Protection Directive originally was

130
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:14,129
enacted in 1995 and amongst its many
provisions are restricted transfers of

131
00:12:14,129 --> 00:12:17,730
personal data he said is in his two
countries that are deemed as not

132
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:24,429
adequate and U S has been deemed not so
there are three measures under and

133
00:12:24,429 --> 00:12:30,929
there's a new GPRS agreed upon in
december is also being debated worked

134
00:12:30,929 --> 00:12:36,589
out it's not expected to come into force
until 2017 2018 but some countries are

135
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,800
talking about stopping it sooner

136
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:45,329
possibly by the end of this year so that
the data prac Protection Directive there

137
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:49,630
are three ways to transfer data to
countries that are not adequate such as

138
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:55,029
the U S one being used these contracts
so what is it you are certified by the

139
00:12:55,029 --> 00:12:59,709
corporate rules and the third very
popular here with the USB partner and so

140
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:03,060
if you certify to the safe harbor you
could transfer data subject to the

141
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:09,268
Privacy Policy to the south to the safe
harbor process is regulated by the FTC

142
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:14,290
and the Department of Commerce and it
was enforced by the FTC auto part of the

143
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:18,990
criticism that there was maybe one or
two enforcement by the FTC about the

144
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:23,769
safe harbor is back in October the
European Court of Justice ruled that the

145
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:28,230
safe harbor was inadequate and it did
not provide the necessary protections

146
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:32,430
are you citizen that was under the
directive

147
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:39,240
citizen I mean he used a lot of the
evidence that snowed in the show that

148
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,070
there is overarching access by the US
government to personal data so the

149
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:47,399
decision came down on the ground because
there was indiscriminate and excessive

150
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:53,130
government access to ease the personal
data and that there was a lack of

151
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:57,120
judicial redress preseason said this is
why the European Court of Justice ruled

152
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,820
the safe harbor with so in the meantime
that means if you were using the safe

153
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:08,700
harbor you had to stop and currently
only stop if you can transfer data back

154
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:15,740
to the USA so much of my time contracts
in place of binding corporate rules to

155
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:23,130
this was a huge problem is continuously
so the FTC and and commerce and others

156
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:32,070
have been negotiating with you so our
proposed framework of its own space at

157
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:35,130
first appear very similar to the same
her

158
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:39,920
again companies are regular by the FTC
other federal government agencies to

159
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,000
publicly commit to hear the Privacy
Principles just close our Privacy Policy

160
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,170
and the Privacy Policy and the
certifications must be renewed annually

161
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:55,930
so I'm gonna get over these pretty quick
but you know she dealt with safe harbor

162
00:14:55,930 --> 00:15:00,959
followed it these all look very similar
notice you have to give notice to the EU

163
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:05,320
citizens data you're collecting and for
what purposes what third parties will

164
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:09,500
have access to it how they can challenge
at how the opt-out choices they have to

165
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:14,200
be able to opt-in or opt-out depending
on the sensitivity of the data there's

166
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,960
accountability and this one is a little
bit more robust and previous for data

167
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,050
transfer to third party such as service
providers and requires increased

168
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:26,270
oversight and the third parties use has
to be consistent with the consent was

169
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:32,090
obtained security data integrity its
collection of personal information to

170
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:35,990
what purpose was for what you collected
and are prohibited from processing it

171
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,370
for any other purpose

172
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:44,940
this particular data integrity has made
a similar principles yeah let me what

173
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:49,750
you're accessing data from Access
individuals have to be able to know you

174
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:55,460
know what do you have about them in the
correct it and then the last one is

175
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:59,250
recourse enforcement liability now
previously under the safe harbor really

176
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:04,620
the first kiss third-grade dispute to
argue that with your privacy is being

177
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:08,920
violated but now you get to binding
arbitration there's going to be

178
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:14,229
increased procedures for EU citizens
have access to challenge it in the you s

179
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:18,790
so you know what are again what are the
main differences like I said it appears

180
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:22,069
very similar but there's been expressed
in prison go she Asian there's an

181
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:27,060
express assurances from the USS
government regarding that their access

182
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:31,640
to your personal data there's going to
be you know increased supervision and

183
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:36,330
potentially finds an agreement up in the
context of the larger GDP are also under

184
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:43,110
it as you may be where the penalties now
under the GDP report violations global

185
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:48,540
revenue not just with any you know your
global revenue so many companies that

186
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:53,329
could be quite sick additional dispute
resolution procedures for EU citizens

187
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:57,200
and there's going to be increased
certification reporting obligations for

188
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:07,080
those who file you certify to the
practice thing has been approved yet

189
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:11,490
they're still debating the proposed tax
it is expected to be decided by cheers

190
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:17,609
so we'll see how this impacts the fact
that the Apple cases we can talk about

191
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:23,379
next as well as the concern was the USS
government access to EU data as well as

192
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:30,100
their inability is challenging you
citizens and there's you know continued

193
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,419
concern by government access so between
that case there's also an interesting

194
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:37,560
Microsoft Microsoft case going on and
that's coming up to second service

195
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:42,629
discovery case where the DOJ when a
warrant or Hotmail Gmail for sitting in

196
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:47,020
their server and Ireland and Microsoft
is challenging this thing it violates a

197
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:50,860
subject mister communication act in a
different country as well as the pilots

198
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:59,540
hehe so you very far discovery process
how much and how much information is

199
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:04,220
turned over so depending on how that
goes I'm very concerned by the

200
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:08,760
parliament as well but currently current
states not pass to cancer fights you

201
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,540
can't use this mechanism right now

202
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:14,100
to be transferring data so right now
you're still stuck in the design of

203
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:20,240
either using model contracts binding
corporate rules which go ahead and

204
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:28,710
switch over to the encryption wars and
Apple everyone just a quick question

205
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:31,770
just show of hands in this room

206
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:38,850
find it to be reasonable and acceptable
is your employer monitor surveil

207
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:51,870
articles and all right how about how
about now about how many of you think

208
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:59,520
it's a more reasonable government to
monitor or have access to your personal

209
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:07,070
cell phones to detect or stop drugs drug
dealers

210
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:18,220
even less alright to trust your employer
so how about how about it would be

211
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:24,960
reasonable to surveil and monitor
yourself to stop terrorists have been

212
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:34,650
announced there's still one takeover got
it and say you know the interesting

213
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:41,310
thing is providing this juxtaposition
between privacy the right of privacy and

214
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:47,550
our security and safety and that brings
us to our smart devices are smartphones

215
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:53,740
that contain more information on that
now you have ever been seen and today

216
00:19:53,740 --> 00:20:00,400
we're talking about hot topics I'm gonna
cover topics starting with a law from

217
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:06,070
1789 many of you are probably familiar
with it read about the case

218
00:20:06,659 --> 00:20:11,529
in that that hinges around the what's
known as the all writs act the thing

219
00:20:11,529 --> 00:20:16,440
about the all writs act was passed by
our first congress it actually was

220
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,359
passed by Congress before the fourth
amendment and the interesting thing is

221
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:28,449
the all writs act has been amended twice
not substance just words and what it

222
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:34,710
says is that federal courts may issue
all writs necessary or appropriate in

223
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:41,710
the aid the court's jurisdiction that's
agreeable to be usages and principles of

224
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:48,259
law what set me or court looked at that
later on in in 1977 and said well it

225
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:53,279
permits a court and sound judgment to
issue orders necessary to achieve the

226
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:59,749
rationale INS of law or to the ends of
justice was that really mean look if we

227
00:20:59,749 --> 00:21:05,239
or if the court needs to enact in order
to have something done to achieve

228
00:21:05,239 --> 00:21:13,009
justice it can make a third-party help
it so in other words if I said if I was

229
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:17,710
ordered to take the just a silly example
take the gentleman's coat by a court

230
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:22,320
the great go to the gym against the wall
and I would say wait a minute your honor

231
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:28,950
I can't take his coat it is and the
court saying well sarah is no burden to

232
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:36,690
you as long as Mr Ingram age you
prevailing rates given the code and we

233
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:43,789
we see this and we saw this in 1977 in a
telephone case where is actually in New

234
00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:49,539
York there was a gambling enterprise
suspected of being being run out and

235
00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:54,440
apartments and the law enforcement went
to the judge and said well your honor we

236
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:59,139
really need to know what numbers they're
dying to know who's in this gambling let

237
00:21:59,139 --> 00:22:06,269
us install a device that we need to and
the judge said sure go ahead you're

238
00:22:06,269 --> 00:22:10,859
probably a probable cause you can do
this and the law enforcement said but we

239
00:22:10,859 --> 00:22:15,639
can't run wires that the suspected
criminals know that's what we're doing

240
00:22:15,639 --> 00:22:17,040
we need a telephone

241
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:21,540
companies help to install this device
and the telephone company challenge that

242
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:25,530
went all the way up to you a supreme
court and the US Supreme Court said you

243
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:29,060
know it's not really a burden to you
telephone company just open your little

244
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:33,700
box on the side of the apartment and let
him put in their wires and in fact as

245
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:38,970
long as they're even gonna pay you for
your time and effort to open that little

246
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:44,990
gizmo and so there's no burden and
there's no other way for them to do that

247
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:53,940
then with your help us began in 77 at
least the words the courts with using

248
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:58,990
this all writs act and you are it's
actors can look to get long course there

249
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:06,780
now fast forward to 2016 just this last
February as many of us it read in New

250
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:18,600
York a law enforcement asked for rates
to decrypt or Apple's assistance to

251
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,669
decrypt a cellphone know this is a
little bit older iPhone running Apple's

252
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:30,950
iOS 7 and at that time Apple are the law
enforcement needed to just break through

253
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:38,310
the passcode on screen and when they
went before the judge the judge said I

254
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:43,290
think you might be past one year I think
you're going on a little bit further to

255
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:49,450
ask Apple to go out of its way to
decrypt this basket and then law

256
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:55,350
enforcement but wait a minute we've done
this seventy times and not once did

257
00:23:55,350 --> 00:24:00,030
Apple raisin objection and actually
Apple's helped us and the judge said but

258
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:05,050
I don't know about that I think you need
I wanna hear from Apple I want to make

259
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:09,700
sure that you guys aren't taking this
law further than it should be and so

260
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:17,380
course the timing of this apple in her
inner seeds and says yeah we're pretty

261
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,170
much done doing this for career

262
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:25,280
there needs to be a line somewhere and
in this new york judge said you know I

263
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:30,040
agree Apple this is a little bit they're
asking you to do too much and so

264
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:34,510
actually denied the rich then on the
west coast

265
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,790
the other Coast United States in
California give a different circumstance

266
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:43,310
I should mention in your case that was
about trying to get a methamphetamine

267
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:52,399
their cellphones long suspected drug and
of course in the California case we all

268
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:58,970
know that it involves a terrorist
shooting now the suspicion and in the

269
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:04,080
California case in that case the judge
originally granted it but our Apple

270
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,159
challenged it

271
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:11,250
newer phone near iOS being the
encryption was as Apple would put it

272
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:15,830
part of their brands we are now but
we're we're now going to value in place

273
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:21,500
the highest importance on their security
and we want our customers to know now

274
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,500
they're asking us in this circumstance
with this newer

275
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:29,379
to actually create an entire new
software that doesn't exist you're our

276
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,740
how can this be

277
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:38,700
and of course as we read earlier this
week turns out there's a way around this

278
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:45,610
to circumvent the interesting thing is
why why the fight why that case and some

279
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:50,909
some folks believe that the government
dropped the case in California to

280
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:57,700
basically establish a precedent you have
known terrorists who's no longer living

281
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:01,380
so what privacy rights are really
involved in everybody wants to know

282
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:04,100
what's on that every

283
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,959
it's unfortunate we didn't get a
decision and it's interesting that just

284
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:13,179
on the cusp of a decision who knows
maybe both sides agreed to work

285
00:26:13,179 --> 00:26:19,510
something out or maybe just the
government's figured out a solution and

286
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:27,620
we are all familiar with at least mister
mister cooks who at the time was saying

287
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:32,049
look if you use this your honor if you
permit the government to use the all

288
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:36,400
writs act the circumstance the
implications would be chillin just think

289
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,990
about that once we are required to
develop the software

290
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:44,490
the bad guys are going to get the keys
to the kingdom they can start

291
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:50,830
surveilling they can saw they can access
your health records the tracker location

292
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:54,899
they could turn on your microphone and
pick up conversations they being the

293
00:26:54,900 --> 00:27:01,760
government and criminals off sure
there's already hackers doing we're

294
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:16,789
getting them I think about the IRS what
you not do you know where you about them

295
00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:35,700
but that has lower precedential value
and can arguably be used to winning

296
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:40,980
outcome in other cases but given all the
press on this is definitely going to be

297
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:45,520
interesting so in the meantime when are
we going to be stuck with well it turns

298
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:51,620
out that at least two states surprise
surprise New York and California are

299
00:27:51,620 --> 00:28:00,059
have at least proposed laws that would
prohibit the manufacture from selling or

300
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:05,809
leasing a smartphone that has full disk
encryption in either state

301
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:13,300
believe the teeth behind this hey Apple
for every phone you sell its 2500 bucks

302
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:19,600
r us at the series at serious
consequence now the New York bill was

303
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,149
introduced last year it's gone nowhere

304
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:25,920
the California bill has been amended its
in committee and the interesting thing

305
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:32,800
about the California bill is the stated
purpose is that this this ban on full

306
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:36,830
disk encryption is tied to human
trafficking the bill's sponsor said you

307
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:40,720
know human traffickers use smartphones
and that's where they're hiding all

308
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,510
their data and if law enforcement could
get to the human traffickers cell phone

309
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:53,360
we could start disentangling this web
and we're going to do is look for 2014

310
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:57,860
human trafficking was at this this thing
and then once you have full disk

311
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:02,149
encryption and the proliferation of
smartphones suddenly human trafficking

312
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:08,010
is exploding with this is one to law
enforcement has to have so let's ban in

313
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:10,820
California

314
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:14,840
hurdles to that the

315
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:22,020
Frontier Foundation came out against
this immediately and said well there's a

316
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:28,580
thing called the dormant Commerce Clause
thats you individual state can't enact

317
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:34,060
laws or regulations that interfere
create substantial burdens on interstate

318
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:42,480
commerce eg you cannot stop the cell the
sailor the flow smartphones by enacting

319
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,230
one law in your state you can get
superseded by congress and then at the

320
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:52,040
same time congressman introduced what's
known as the encrypt act which is

321
00:29:52,040 --> 00:30:00,590
co-sponsored by Reps ted Lieu who is he
is ninety background in computer science

322
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:07,100
majors he says it's clear to me that
creating a pathway for decryption only

323
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:14,110
for good guy is technologically stupid
you just can't do that mean just pretty

324
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:18,010
blonde about it but did you know if you
think about it crashed a reality if you

325
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:21,620
ban the sale of these full disk
encryption iPhones in california where

326
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,219
the criminals in ago

327
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:26,220
Morgan wrote Rep

328
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:33,470
encryption battle between the states and
the fed's who knows where that's going

329
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:39,520
to go apple kinda left us hanging next I
wanted to cover the FTC the federal

330
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,870
trade commission because it's become a
very hot topic in the cybersecurity

331
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:52,209
world now many of you may know that the
FTC these bility to regulate is tied at

332
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:56,300
least in this context to unfair or
deceptive acts or practices that affect

333
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:02,500
commerce and deception is typically
looked at is you know company are you

334
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:06,560
doing what you said your gonna do are
you telling the truth about privacy

335
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:12,820
and how you're using in series data and
so the privacy policies that you posting

336
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:18,450
on your websites turns out lawyers and
regulators look at that so do be since

337
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:25,040
that your privacy policies reflects your
organization's actual practices and in

338
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:32,700
the interesting thing is the other prong
the unfairness problem I gets into you

339
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:37,870
know whether your security practices are
fair so what does that mean in the in

340
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:44,820
the context of dahmer's does the
practice injured injure consumers does

341
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:50,428
the practice violates established public
policy and and that is the practice

342
00:31:50,429 --> 00:31:56,450
itself unethical or or scrupulous I
think about that in the context of what

343
00:31:56,450 --> 00:32:06,960
that means but when you when you get
reached turns out after the fact that

344
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:12,570
the FTC will look to see what data
security practices you had in place and

345
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:17,629
to see whether or not those were fair to
the consumers so we'll take an example a

346
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:22,020
recent example the Wyndham Worldwide
corporation case I don't know how many

347
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:29,220
of you are familiar with what happened
in wind but he wasn't all lawyers you're

348
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:34,270
watching now depend on one thing to keep
in mind is that you know that was a

349
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:40,639
franchisor model they had franchises
hotels and actually saw timeshares

350
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:46,440
through three different subsidiaries now
there are ninety independent hotels as

351
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:52,880
part of this organization and each hotel
had a property management system that

352
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,470
process customer information so that
their private information and went to

353
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:01,429
manage the system it's a franchise who
were it's not going to make the

354
00:33:01,429 --> 00:33:06,370
franchisees is not gonna tell me how to
set things up the franchisees have to

355
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:11,110
actually do that sells customized it but
the franchisees systems

356
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:18,070
and so what happened was the corporate
Windows corporate network everything was

357
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:22,470
in Arizona and so they had a
hub-and-spoke

358
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:30,110
their data center was in Arizona hackers
came in in 2008 got through the

359
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:35,830
corporate network got administrative
credentials moves laterally got into

360
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:44,470
started moving out to the franchisees
installed Mauer and actually obtained

361
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:55,200
500,000 payment card accounts and exel
traded that data to server in russia may

362
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:01,299
find out about it it reached again and
that was the first incident and said it

363
00:34:01,299 --> 00:34:08,300
was in April of 08 March 09 tactic
reached again when it happens a third so

364
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:13,530
the FTC brings an action against
alleging that their data security

365
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:18,139
practices were unfair and that they were
being deceptive in and what they their

366
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:23,300
security policy said their privacy
policy and and just highlight a couple

367
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:29,760
of these alleged security flaws their
payment card data was stored in their

368
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:38,339
attacks know now and PCI as folks
recognize their weak passwords I think

369
00:34:38,339 --> 00:34:44,399
there is one of their vendors was my
crew Trend Micro's something and and the

370
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:50,750
password was micro they lacked fire
walls Lanier was there is very poor

371
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:56,270
segmentation because in their house boat
model and they didn't limit the duration

372
00:34:56,270 --> 00:35:02,740
of their lenders to these are just
things that the FTC investigation picked

373
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:08,959
up on a point out as part of their
complaint so went unchallenged this

374
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:14,390
women said wait a minute FTC you don't
have the jurisdiction to claim that

375
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:18,750
we're being our data security pressure
and fair and turns out

376
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:26,330
at least one Court of Appeals disagreed
with and held at the FTC does have the

377
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:31,160
right to regulate and bring actions
under the unfairness and that this

378
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:36,879
doesn't mean that each one of these
individual factors are unfair but it

379
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,190
does mean that the FTC we can bring an
unfairness action against your

380
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:45,830
organization and they will look for
things like this to build their case in

381
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:53,690
other words they can be a prosecutor but
they still have to prove they're so

382
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:59,490
what's fair in the FTC is really good
news is I think we're running short on

383
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:04,970
time questions the good news is the FTC
published a guideline that kinda

384
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:08,709
highlights what they're looking for out
of their proper enforcement actions and

385
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:16,130
so it gives you things like you know you
secure passwords that the sensitive

386
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:21,690
personal information should be secured
that you segment the network and you're

387
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:25,880
actually monitoring the traffic that's
something that sounds easy to do but it

388
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:33,630
in hindsight it's always like that that
that you are restricting remote access

389
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:38,090
me think about all the big data breaches
that you read about its typically

390
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:42,670
involves a vendor that involves a third
party because indeed a security or only

391
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:48,870
a security weakest link and so the
regulators are looking at what kind of

392
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:58,299
relationship what kind of protections
you have with your service and finally

393
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,790
you know given the proliferation

394
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:07,710
newsworthiness these data breaches
receive there's now the alphabet soup of

395
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:12,190
regulators who are basically all piling
on

396
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:16,920
it's getting to the point now it doesn't
matter what industry you're in your

397
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:21,830
regulator is concerned about you do
security practices so for example the

398
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:30,340
SEC hit someone with a $75,000 fine just
actually last year in September last

399
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:36,780
year the SEC or organizations issued
twenty six million dollars in fines

400
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:47,000
related to these practices and your just
this month the CFP V issued their first

401
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:54,780
space so at the end of the day the
regulators are paying attention and I

402
00:37:54,780 --> 00:38:09,700
believe most of most of their lives they
do not worry so there hasn't happened

403
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,419
yet

404
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:37,290
the reason car payment card that will be
your biggest significant we saved about

405
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:38,670
five minutes

406
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:41,670
questions

407
00:39:09,509 --> 00:39:53,719
there are some understanding with both
syria and yes however are dressing up a

408
00:39:53,719 --> 00:40:00,959
battle against the SEC I saw them
recently and they said well we're

409
00:40:00,959 --> 00:40:05,689
looking at a pretty area there was talk
about work

410
00:40:06,259 --> 00:40:14,669
statement that stirs are relying so wow
my grandmother is some recognition

411
00:40:14,669 --> 00:40:21,179
inside working and partially in a deal
with a

412
00:40:21,179 --> 00:40:32,339
that's not good but scary you know it
it's interesting to you see all these

413
00:40:32,339 --> 00:40:36,639
regulators pounding the table you have
to have data security must keep it

414
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:37,619
secure

415
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:40,619
let's see full disk encryption oh wait a
minute

416
00:40:43,930 --> 00:41:22,250
but a lot of countries their current
data protection not so with E

417
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:29,340
introduction of the word that worldwide
revenue back her parents are much better

418
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:35,500
so it's not clear yet has been adopted
but and then it depends on when each

419
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:40,550
country the doctor so I think that right
now projects that most countries adopted

420
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:42,440
by 2018

421
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,440
France made up by the end of the year

422
00:41:56,610 --> 00:42:23,220
governments are forcing companies go
into their Ireland server revenue but in

423
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:26,970
order to take advantage of the liability
protection you have to follow the

424
00:42:26,970 --> 00:43:04,509
procedures that are each yet that
information and then he actually had his

425
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:13,320
best so you as an individual federal
government directly to the federal

426
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:19,060
government but based on their plan or
he's talking under data breach

427
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:26,100
notification laws and its own air is
required to notify the federal

428
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:33,380
government if they own the data or it
may be someone else in my life so I

429
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:38,930
think right now the notice procedures
are not getting timely notice

430
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:47,119
share that I think they're really
banking on just not sure how that works

431
00:43:49,090 --> 00:44:14,880
back so agencies have their own data
breach their own version of YouTube

432
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:24,290
reach notification laws and typically
they may be liable under their 1880

433
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:29,560
isn't motivated to bring an action
against their own friends are you know

434
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:34,619
state government officials you have to
remember there was a lawsuit against the

435
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:38,730
Department of their reach that was so
bad really you're probably gonna see

436
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:46,420
private litigation the agency regulators
defines

437
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:51,350
CFPB they're they're fine directly goes
into their budget that works for

438
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:55,839
everything so if you don't know this
already the CFPB is very motivated test

439
00:44:55,840 --> 00:45:00,380
hi folks because that's how they find
themselves and pay their salaries and

440
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:06,920
the SEC fine art of it was to cover
costs department was put into a fund to

441
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:11,609
help educate consumers so even though
their mission is not consumer protection

442
00:45:11,609 --> 00:45:21,430
that's where part of it at least
theoretically yeah but the individuals

443
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:25,149
who are so they're fine resulted in
action of a small broker dealer who had

444
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:29,310
to do to breach that affected about a
hundred thousand the SEC actually has

445
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:33,740
two problems of where their oversight
first publicly traded companies no other

446
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:37,660
statements misleading in the aftermath
of the bridge are they say what you

447
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:40,440
really misleading leading up for any of
yours

448
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:45,880
press releases or anything anything he
said after investors etc they do have

449
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:51,000
directors over broker-dealers and
require them to data security measures

450
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,490
placed it there kinda

451
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:58,180
after different ashes and so with a
broker dealers that's where to find him

452
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:03,118
and that's why it was really good
200,000

453
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:13,369

happy to answer any questions thank you

454
