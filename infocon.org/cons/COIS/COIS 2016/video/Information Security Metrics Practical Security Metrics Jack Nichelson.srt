1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,460
how many people here think the CEO
should be more involved and liable for

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:19,580
security on a nice people not like me
for a little bit I don't actually true

3
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,099
that I don't agree with that

4
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:30,010
for one simple reason this state unless
you need security right team this is the

5
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:34,200
same problem every business leader he
worries Asian has do more with less

6
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,980
show continuous improvement drive out
costs for the organization

7
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:44,148
show about you every other business unit
president to do the same thing this

8
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:47,820
isn't unique to us we all have to
challenge for all try to do more with

9
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:58,800
less and I found my challenge first was
language was not communicating

10
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:07,110
effectively and I realize what I want to
play it toward my CEO he was a try to

11
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:20,890
count rate I really respect of our work
today on floor lamp is it and I were

12
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:28,590
watching hockey exactly what was going
on to the root of the problem with this

13
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:37,869
guy I'm just like how isn't very
partisan immediately know what's going

14
00:01:37,869 --> 00:01:47,579
on in talking about what's relevant
talking to people or they have I walk up

15
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:51,809
to that I can see all the loads going
through the plans to offer ship second

16
00:01:51,810 --> 00:02:00,659
shift third shift I can see where she
which read what lures wretch how long

17
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,650
that opera house

18
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:13,480
today we're struggle that so I was like
oh my goodness I would think that I may

19
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:23,260
belong closer to talk to the house floor
and first floor actually were better

20
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,239
communicate their problems

21
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:30,170
senior leadership and I did so hard to
change this so let's look at mattresses

22
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:34,869
and this one measures are important
person in the shop floor was able to do

23
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:39,780
is they distilled down all the
complexities of their working on civil

24
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:48,240
rights and they can go in the house I
want to help them so I certainly look at

25
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:54,940
this as well I started to realize that
she'll go and marketing and the

26
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:58,740
president of the different monitor
business day all communicated their

27
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:02,709
progress their status and their
effectiveness within their business

28
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:19,820
units about what she was to free cash
flow I what's the new color line and I

29
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:23,489
like they're all reporting what they're
doing and standard

30
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:34,190
by GAAP generally accepted accounting
principles and I'm like doing that he

31
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:40,709
was not charged metrics I started to see
these are good metrics in English

32
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:51,620
comprehension 16 pages two in the
morning and cost to do so and action is

33
00:03:51,620 --> 00:04:00,150
taken to go back and I was like ok these
are the same way but my bed one has

34
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:04,370
president taught me how to rebalance
she's like either

35
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:19,650
this live here with rocket and i really
dunno if it's not too bad I don't have

36
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:24,900
to be so complicated off to have this
conversation about security I want to

37
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:36,609
try to make this year having similar so
I'd security metrics brought my senior

38
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:44,100
care how many spam messages we blocked
not at all and that actual metric I had

39
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:52,060
failed one month with other morning page
search anything you can actually do

40
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:52,860
about it

41
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:58,760
to fact that matter yeah it's good to
have a weariness what's your thread

42
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:07,710
surface and yeah there's a nice was to
temperature of the room so is it really

43
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:13,870
worth getting people to track it so
there's seven Habits of Highly Effective

44
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:23,220
People written by dr. Stephen Covey
excellent book during different phases

45
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:29,380
of my life and every time our way
something different from one of the

46
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:34,560
things that always stuck with me is good
with you so we try to fully articulate

47
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:45,730
what the problem statement is the
stakeholders and resolved I was almost

48
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:50,840
like I'm not going to articulate the
others give us one of those that

49
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:57,359
direction so I gotta put together an
outline of what I wanted to do where I

50
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:04,690
wanted to go and something to do with my
talks I go to a little later like six

51
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:07,710
conferences a year I love the stuff I
love this community

52
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:15,729
it's just try doing so much for
affiliates break people up and share

53
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:23,300
their idea is that they always share the
results they don't know for sure and I'm

54
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:28,720
trying to pull myself to a standard of
fun when we talk about it I'm going to

55
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,350
share the results good or that so what I
do is when I read your organization

56
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,780
based on it at all

57
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:43,450
this is a bit tight score she is very
simplistic it's really good for like

58
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:47,920
everyday activities so much time with
your diligence runs on someone to get an

59
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:53,180
idea of what we're doing is looking
better bring cases for yourself besides

60
00:06:53,180 --> 00:07:00,290
I don't show you that I was at 6:30
which is good about the way this news is

61
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,770
I love you

62
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:06,400
average yearly basis so you can tell us
your leadership meeting are lacking in

63
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,380
that area 31 ok we had some problems

64
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:15,920
agency here so the big events what's
right and that some of the diligence of

65
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:37,060
SSP records in place our results are
very simplistic things from the outside

66
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:46,760
world so basically if sheen holes out
and gets to ankara also take down like

67
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:53,240
the up with a hot mess they take a look
at our heads we monitor the ok you're

68
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:58,330
right she went to a home on time he
raised just take down so this kind of

69
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:03,870
tracks that so there's nothing up here
that you can really change it is also

70
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:08,350
the phone outside your organization so
it's proof positive that something bad

71
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:15,170
was popping out and I wanted to make
more progress on this so I want to show

72
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,849
you though that through

73
00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:32,299
implementing Metrix Metrix driven
organization that is our culture

74
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:42,429
637 17 this is part of how Six Sigma
works is you measure of a swine

75
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:52,329
hypothesis I do these things I should
get this resolved those things and then

76
00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:58,839
you measure again and injury just to do
check act right you check do plays a

77
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:11,660
character or something but it's really
good day like this time so I want to

78
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:17,639
show this you like the times to
understand your problem

79
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:25,490
organization situated measures
everyone's focus on a small set of

80
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:36,860
things change will see results so small
I just heard himself a couple of things

81
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:44,449
and this is also idea actually nothing
you ever hear him talk about is my own

82
00:09:44,449 --> 00:09:49,758
idea everything I ever do worse a stolen
yourself and take credit

83
00:09:52,130 --> 00:10:02,600
so our director of sales organization so
he wakes answered sands amazing so

84
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:14,670
however for the state department's was
talk cuz everyone to see the first and

85
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,089
there's an app that runs it

86
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:25,300
president of United States hard to tell
that guy would do it even harder to tell

87
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:31,010
his I T I want to do so its
configuration settings and swelling hard

88
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:38,590
and was talking to his friend over the
beauty is a very structured top-down

89
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:44,280
organization they do it so do it and
they were doing and how they were

90
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:53,020
getting security don't realize is
culture is made it was wrong that

91
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:58,170
organization the way that he was doing
this drop-down security thing was never

92
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:09,300
going to work for him so start small
artisanal three matters not promoting

93
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:13,859
can you name any scanner war in
aggressive and Microsoft Active

94
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:20,940
Directory or LDAP her resolve things to
do with your health issues and sexism or

95
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:24,910
something that's reporting in what
powers the health status your systems

96
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:33,459
with our house lolz women and also help
inventory so sands first 24 total

97
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:40,150
controls or something like a scam
warning

98
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:54,220
kind of Hershey ninety there to start
small items this is what Alan Bollard

99
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:59,320
built for the state department is a
simple score our location in Google

100
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,890
civil right down

101
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:09,550
bilities water also was really
interesting is in just tell them where

102
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:26,630
they have also break by size our users
and running for shooters what's more it

103
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:49,000
sounds hoping so actually there so I
like to do is show themselves emergency

104
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:59,020
is talk about we go we show examples of
the results you get a house built and

105
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:02,020
their results were outstanding

106
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:06,010
state department through this card is
one of the things you did that was

107
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:11,200
really evading this is from my
leadership talking yesterday he set out

108
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,339
to make heroes Nazi ropes are you as my
when I first got into the security role

109
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:22,580
I was so excited to drop a ream of paper
on the server to sit at a desk and say

110
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:29,960
these are all the problems you have you
sucking your job I was like problems in

111
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,370
the company I'm the best security
personnel

112
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:47,140
and yes sir I post Costa Mesa State
Department postion caller he's doing

113
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:52,380
this target stands up on their personal
views 0

114
00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:00,729
chains that sounds right this
conservation actually instructor for the

115
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:06,990
twenty-four controls lot of great stuff
on his website has got a brief law all

116
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:18,950
this information you can find it on
stuff out there so so problems put

117
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:28,029
together this report on how they saw
well I've now done with my news first

118
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:42,580
every time you wanna hear more results
to hear like and what other fruit bowls

119
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:47,400
and articles of heart of the system
because not all particles are really

120
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:59,360
critical for that system its makeup is
aware that worries asian action rights

121
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,680
of your is your goal and you make sure
the panel that goal and then you tell

122
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:10,319
their manager home where they are and
how they got an edge in the next month

123
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:20,620
it'll start with an A and it's gotten
praise they won't find out what if you

124
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:25,370
start off with it and you start telling
them you have to fix every problem in

125
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:27,139
the world it's all their fault

126
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:34,879
defeated 40 ball why do they want to
continue to move forward so this was a

127
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:38,949
mistake that I are really I still
sometimes fall into this trap because

128
00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:47,309
insecurity we find a lot of that and we
know that this organization we want to

129
00:15:47,309 --> 00:15:55,209
take action to resolve it in fact
sometimes go to the root of this

130
00:15:55,209 --> 00:16:09,258
negative news you're trying to now
they're trying to balance out so it's

131
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:20,199
kind of a leadership talk of each day

132
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:35,199
eliminating the problem is the most
important thing possible time working

133
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:41,899
towards fighting with someone you can
start so that's good that's why they're

134
00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:48,160
so I got some bigger organizational
stuff of your life you don't create

135
00:16:48,160 --> 00:17:00,639
charter is an organizational whole your
assets is a little head and when I was a

136
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,099
bigger organization and it was a little
rocker see those are some of the things

137
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:16,928
that get started getting get more but I
see now again always have to adjust your

138
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:25,029
claim based on culture culture will
strategy every day so far more fluid

139
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:25,880
organization

140
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:32,130
don't get caught up in trying to some of
those things have started and then once

141
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:38,260
you get home you can try to hide it in
and get a little more room 312 reason

142
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:43,350
that I have those there is when I set
out this wasn't trying to build a

143
00:17:43,350 --> 00:18:04,969
company in last past me with any company
very long so I will have her hope is

144
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:19,370
your help desk tickets ok this one they
came up through the help desk task

145
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:33,379
killer the time periods I was
undervaluing the amount of amazing

146
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:39,040
knowledge that was coming through the
help desk if someone is willing to pick

147
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:45,260
up the phone and take five minutes to
tell someone there to record to take it

148
00:18:45,260 --> 00:19:01,430
and this is how back to you I see a lot
of years spending a lot of driving

149
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:07,160
threat feet and hands for security
analytics and data and you're getting

150
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:13,540
the change size from your heart of ice
axe for different industries you're

151
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:16,720
getting all this dilemma Terry what's
happening out world

152
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:29,899
and it's all good stuff down through
your own desk to get done not just

153
00:19:29,899 --> 00:19:34,658
always look at help us get attack this
will tell you where you need to put your

154
00:19:34,659 --> 00:19:35,950
attention

155
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:45,600
users are telling you where there and is
focus here you will focus on your Disqus

156
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:53,759
and then like a terrible as soon as her
rapid seven are all awesome scanners

157
00:19:53,759 --> 00:20:06,500
scanner as the remediation report that
comes out of it and deliver it I kept

158
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:14,759
thinking if I hit the report to someone
I did my job was actually very marvelous

159
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:18,259
from getting fixed to take care

160
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:31,960
so so this is part of the presentation
will realize metrics talk and actually

161
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:40,980
slipped down hold him all things about
culture because if you just to say

162
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:59,110
you'll end up spending a lot of harming
yourself just glanced out and that's so

163
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:02,600
the first thing you thought it was you
have to create a sense of urgency you

164
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:07,090
got to get other people to realize
you're not making measurable progress

165
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:13,580
everyone spending a lot of time working
what are you working on the right things

166
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:25,008
delivery results you want to cum laude
and these are people who are doing well

167
00:21:25,009 --> 00:21:25,710
with others

168
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:33,529
and what's this is something to have a
hard wearing a senior leadership you all

169
00:21:33,529 --> 00:21:36,990
know that there are a couple of us you
know site admin your network news

170
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:49,610
sources ivers there where you need to
get the people who carried away with

171
00:21:49,610 --> 00:22:01,360
some words and you don't want to build
and it just delivered to go from

172
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,139
leadership products resignation after we
talked about the other woman after a

173
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:11,360
part of their trade with you build it
together

174
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:23,110
gotta get out there everyone then you
start to remove obstacles for people

175
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:27,709
help them start going and you build the
project and wait where there's gonna be

176
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:37,789
smaller wins we start to see progress
against see it till they got to thinking

177
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:50,070
that way and who's going to take heart
because no one ever if you are not truly

178
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:56,178
sustainable to make sure other people
are moving this forward as well so this

179
00:22:56,179 --> 00:23:02,250
is a game before outlining again before
this is a whole lotta feed developed by

180
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:09,090
damage computer driver deming went over
to Japan after work to help rebuild our

181
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:18,529
automotive industry place the way this
is how I C O clock in 20 playoff

182
00:23:18,529 --> 00:23:22,450
florio's to twenty-six year exactly
what's going on

183
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:25,450
go talk to somebody was knowledge and
intelligence about an issue

184
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:29,500
meanwhile I see you can talk to me the
same level of engagement

185
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:44,920
knowledge of security for its now paul
started inside my office and i dont

186
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:53,470
wanna building it from him filling
station so I went all the teams and we

187
00:23:53,470 --> 00:24:08,830
did this thing going and we had
executive CEO's behind it so now I see

188
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:31,149
very focused on just how sides to every
one sees them very powerful way after

189
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:44,230
work and we'll take turns red and then
heading that read these houses talk

190
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:53,210
about white red and it hurts a lot about
the actions taken so it's very very

191
00:24:53,210 --> 00:25:02,970
everybody would like to see if you
invite to still be surprised how often

192
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:18,180
talk about your room and the things I
asked about and also gets everyone I

193
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:29,430
remember all the windows closed and CEO
was asking about it while our locations

194
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:43,060
in Europe came back side of that team
have rain from the CEO of what the

195
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:52,389
difference it was to move that was how I
was right but Scott level of engagement

196
00:25:53,200 --> 00:26:00,760
you want everybody wants to feel their
job and then gets harder organization

197
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:09,190
was how everyone thinks he was able to
show their job their job back to the

198
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:11,240
company they do see how their job

199
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:29,120
value impact and was helping others like
this one first slide more than anything

200
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:37,510
else and this point here are your
projects including daily jobs of end

201
00:26:37,510 --> 00:27:05,550
users this is something that really got
water projects are you can do to help

202
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:10,070
first home safe there sometimes make
things were you want to be thinking

203
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:26,520
about that is there is one thing here
where I started to realize started

204
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:33,760
projects working on doing a little more
personal stopping her

205
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:46,780
pockets but every to get started outside
of that knowledge to imagery and

206
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:53,320
systemic problems this location

207
00:27:54,620 --> 00:28:05,090
what was going on so close

208
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:11,770
symbolism metrics started a rule change
the culture we worked as a team and what

209
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:17,230
our impact as long as he was on the
company now tell us stories the

210
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:31,350
commenting system the other business
units back when they do something good

211
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:42,490
on the ballot go down I don't see
brackets you guys are going good you

212
00:28:42,490 --> 00:29:01,880
want to have all these different schools
all the different things are going to

213
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,520
work for your organization

214
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:11,980
the core of this is how it's changing
culture

215
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:21,540
$100,000 datafeed to get a person
running out before and you only knew

216
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:28,470
that the internal audit and did you
change your culture invested in those

217
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:35,220
measures are you just reporting
statistics on the tools are those things

218
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:40,660
but I'll tell you I did that I spent
money on schools I spent time generating

219
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:44,150
reports

220
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:56,020
and I wasn't really made good progress
everybody so examples of the tactical

221
00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:02,490
gather some of the metricStream
contracting out we were doing this is

222
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:07,510
almost like texting made available to
everybody I've also got this on my

223
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:11,110
LinkedIn profile got all the other talks
about my LinkedIn profile say you're

224
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:17,010
welcome to get in there also if you
really want was once to talk all the

225
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:25,970
time as they talked with her about 15
minutes alright so now I last talked

226
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:30,920
with three minutes left and he get a
chance to do it and questions and

227
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:35,210
answers and this is my favorite part
that's why I liked it gives talks so I

228
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:55,080
think you're working on what's working
we're here struggles not for me to make

229
00:30:55,080 --> 00:31:02,179
connections with people person has been
horrible show where you have a problem

230
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:09,560
or an answer in a couple of you can
connect all the problems

231
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:16,280
answer that's my role so metrics for
culture

232
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,800

233
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:41,340
so you don't know which direction you're
going in or what they also kohl is a

234
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:56,770
personal level is also we're having that

236
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:43,909

so we're so for instance I was worth my

237
00:34:43,909 --> 00:35:03,950
vote for your house and so when I didn't
go so well now I know I was a gut-check

238
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:18,549
oh no I'm working like crazy and I
realize that I was listening is out

239
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:29,830
there with her interested plowed your
own defy ease know I was chasing I was

240
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:31,619
trying to match yours

241
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:38,249
or right I had all these fundamental
problems and I'm trying to build some

242
00:35:38,249 --> 00:36:00,149
your seizes the fundamental down and I'm
trying to cover all these projects were

243
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:03,890
luck was on the cover of a magazine I
was trying to change all this threat

244
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:18,879
analysis I was always worried about this
sort of us realized the problem we've

245
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:25,289
got a job / problem we have a system
reimaging problem we're impacting users

246
00:36:25,289 --> 00:36:39,249

rearranging systems to see all my stuff

247
00:36:39,249 --> 00:36:45,689

started to then read house my balls not

248
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:51,470
focused on what the industry said I
should I start concentrating on what

249
00:36:51,470 --> 00:37:17,499
might users was a lot last week with an
answer and then restore him how he was

250

also interesting

251
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:21,769
course

252
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:25,939
users happier

253
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:39,450
