1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,490
ok so I guess we can go ahead and get
started and we have some more people

2
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:17,470
flowing in so again everyone having a
good time some good talks I know it went

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:21,169
to a number of yesterday were
outstanding this is probably one of the

4
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:27,010
better conferences that I do go to spend
a lot of fun to meet a lot of new people

5
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:32,390
make some new friends always loved doing
that such a little bit of fun so today's

6
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:37,790
presentation fail now so we don't pay
later I was so tempted to kind of rename

7
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:47,950
this to fail now so we don't flail later
and so I didn't do that can I wish I had

8
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:53,410
to go ahead and get started here so Who
Am I

9
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,019
my name's Sarah Hyland I currently work
for a rapid seven as a research fleet

10
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:05,360
just took on this new role doing
research in biotechnology is what my new

11
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,119
role as I've been rapid seven for about
three years I've been in ITU for over 25

12
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:16,259
years we're sure various Fortune 500
companies to media companies doing

13
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:20,369
almost every role you can imagine within
I T one of my favorite roles has been

14
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:26,330
security so I've been doing security for
about proxy about 15 years and I've been

15
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:31,890
working as a consultant for the last
eight years my role has been to go into

16
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,490
corporations government agencies and
such group in testing consulting

17
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:42,050
advising on various security topics I
love doing a lot of research I expect a

18
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:46,460
number of crises in my presentations in
the past that can get very technical

19
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:50,820
today's presentations not going to get
into a lot of technical stuff I'm gonna

20
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:56,559
have some stories that will help show
point that I'm trying to bring to the

21
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,050
table so that we can improve our overall
security that's the ultimate goal here

22
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:08,889
so many people we have here arnie
military ex-military served in the

23
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:12,559
military so great great thanks a lot for
your service

24
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:25,970
fleet ballistic missile submarine during
the reagan administration during the

25
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:31,890
final height of the Cold War period and
one of the things we used to do and

26
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,790
everyone has been in the military
understands this we train and we

27
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:40,370
training and we train again the kind of
training we do aboard a ballistic some

28
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:46,790
rain would probably make your hair stand
on end we would actually trained

29
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:51,769
literally the annihilation of the human
race every day what was the purpose of

30
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:57,390
that obviously the purpose was to
created to turn so that our enemies with

31
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:01,899
us so that they would not nuke us
knowing that we would turn around and

32
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:06,280
wipe them out one of the other things
that is critical is the day-to-day

33
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,950
survival of a submarine obviously
submerged underneath the ocean is not a

34
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:15,850
comfortable or safe environment we've
lost a number submarines over the years

35
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:24,880
the thresher in 63 the Scorpion and 68
from various failures on board so one of

36
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,720
the things they use of Palin boorda
submarine and Lisa train for was was

37
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:36,060
known as a jammed I so on the stern the
stern of the plane there's the ship

38
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:41,190
there's a storm plans these help the
submarine ago up and help with the dogs

39
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:45,230
typically housework the problem is if
you have a hydraulic system failure

40
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:48,069
those storm planes claps

41
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:54,349
the submarine goes into an instant died
so when we were at what we refer to as

42
00:03:54,349 --> 00:04:00,030
test depth which is the safest
operational depth of the submarine which

43
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:05,859
I trust you was quite deep if you had in
your running head flying you're doing a

44
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:09,989
transit let's say across the Atlantic
Ocean and you had a hydraulic system

45
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:17,019
failure those term planes would class if
you did not take a type of evasive

46
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:22,570
maneuvers and actions survival rate of
the submarine was ten to fifteen seconds

47
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:28,680
the entire submarine would implode
killing everyone on board so we would

48
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,289
literally train probably every week or
two

49
00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:36,250
captain will come up and order a jammed
right drill someone would take the stern

50
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,570
planes put him in the full dive and
everyone had to do their various

51
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:44,849
operations to keep that submarine from
going too deep now obviously we train we

52
00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:49,909
weren't tearing and that test deaths
because they'll hear there was a real

53
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:54,300
failure so we would we would test any
safer death so that we can learn from

54
00:04:54,300 --> 00:05:00,060
and we wish we failed lead retrained we
fail we'd retrain things we used to do

55
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:06,389
as we would reverse the the the blades
on the submarine try to back it down we

56
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:11,539
blow the Ford ballast tanks and then
what we do is we take the one of the

57
00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:16,240
first things I used to do was take the
rudder and put it in a full turn the

58
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,900
idea that is is on a submarine flies
like an airplane underwater so what it

59
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,729
would do is it's a submarine was in a
crash diet but a high rate of speed he

60
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:28,880
took the rubber and threw it to one
direction the submarine would turn in a

61
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,460
net turn would do what's known as a
Snapple whole submarine rolled on its

62
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:39,770
side and go up first is down so we would
do this to prevent obviously the

63
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:43,000
implosion a submarine killing everyone
on board

64
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,300
now of course in the security world if
you fail in the real world you're

65
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:53,060
probably not all going to die that's a
that's a good thing but still if you do

66
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:58,530
fail it can have serious consequences on
your organization and what we're gonna

67
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:05,169
do is we're going to talk about a
specific problem that's been building

68
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:08,320
out there and not necessarily getting
better

69
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:13,640
talking about failing and how maybe
through some other ideas or concepts or

70
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:21,310
us rethinking the whole problem we can
possibly improve that what's going on so

71
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:25,770
today's agenda as I want to discuss and
identify this problem so we had three

72
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:29,909
key areas we want to discuss our current
approach to that problem how are we

73
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:34,530
approaching and I have various stories
about as a consultant I been into a lot

74
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:39,590
of companies or organizations and I've
helped them test alot of these things so

75
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:43,200
I can share some of that fail with you
in some of the successes that have seen

76
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,289
so we can actually learn from some of
those successes and then talk about some

77
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:52,940
of the training aspects or a partnership
expects that we can do with our

78
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,600
consultants are with you know up in
testing company or whatever you're

79
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,540
working with

80
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:01,270
to actually improve your overall
organization I guess it discuss

81
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:06,140
solutions for mitigating that and again
it's very important I'm not here to tell

82
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:10,919
you what to do I'm only here to give you
some food for thought I mean every

83
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:14,969
industries differences yet to figure out
what model works for you and what makes

84
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:21,600
sense again this is not too large of a
crowd this is actually a outstanding

85
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:27,290
sized crowd because I want you to engage
with me let's not turn this into Daryl

86
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:31,200
just talking for an hour even though I
probably have no problem doing that

87
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:36,280
let's go ahead and engage me during this
so you have questions you have comments

88
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,710
you have input please share though so we
can share with everyone we don't turn

89
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,870
this into a full learning opportunity
for everybody

90
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:53,640
so data breaches oh my gosh so how many
people here have lost their data and

91
00:07:53,640 --> 00:08:02,630
data breaches is that all you guys
actually have any data I've lost my data

92
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:06,890
so many times I've lost count of it I
usually lose I usually have somebody

93
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:11,880
steal my data from some third-party
service source but every year I lost I

94
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:18,880
lost target lost data at Home Depot I
lost data when the IRS I lost data with

95
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:24,250
the Navy I lost data with the state of
South Carolina so it seems like if you

96
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:28,600
see me engage in some organization was
my data go the other way because they're

97
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:33,270
going to lose it got to the point where
promised everyone on Twitter I'm just

98
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:36,978
gonna start posting my sis Security
number and credit card every six months

99
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:38,789
and just save a mold problem

100
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:45,300
the hassle so data breaches to hear such
a small sample a small sample the number

101
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,300
of data breaches of Kurt

102
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,650
Ashley Madison so how many people here
were caught in the Ashley Madison 1

103
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:59,740
how many people are not being oscar's
your boss is in this idea how many

104
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:05,590
bosses are not being honest because of
their workers there okay I hope I trap

105
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:10,120
some you there but wasn't that lucky ok
so we get into these are in there's a

106
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,160
couple things we need to make note of
these and when I need to delve into this

107
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,709
one there's just two key points here so
we need to discuss one is his data

108
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:24,160
breaches are taking long time to to
solve to disclose look at these numbers

109
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:31,480
some of them we didn't get any
information you know they don't want to

110
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:36,410
tell us for whatever reason but I expect
it was a period time here we have

111
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:40,850
premier 883 quarter months anthem nine
months Office of Personnel Management

112
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:47,270
11.5 months so it's been averaging out
like two hundred days I think overall

113
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:54,100
that's taken for them to detect these
breaches now the truth is I'm not overly

114
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,870
shocked or even concerned about
organizations breached its going to

115
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:04,690
happen you know if you have data that
the attackers are hackers or any legal

116
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:08,600
entities out there want they're gonna
try to get it and they're going to gain

117
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,230
access to your networks unless you
completely shut your network's down and

118
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:16,150
have no functional access in her out and
of course then you're going to need your

119
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:19,569
your ability to do your job and a lot of
cases are your workers to be able to do

120
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:24,440
their job and get things done and we get
into the so we gonna have to figure out

121
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,760
how to solve this again

122
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,360
data breaches are taking a long time to
detect way too long

123
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,290
second we know they're going after PII
data credit card data security numbers

124
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:39,230
critical data that they can actually
sell online even sell in you know

125
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:44,740
contact information like phone numbers
in you know phone numbers and emails and

126
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:49,850
stuff like that the Verizon wanna just
have risen enterprise from what I

127
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:54,050
understand that bridge only got contact
information but yet I think it was for

128
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:58,740
sale on one of those dark web dark
things for like $100

129
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:05,680
so so they're selling all this type of
data so so we can make the statements is

130
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,040
a solid statement we can make would you
agree something is not working

131
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:18,020
why is this taking so long to any
questions any input anyone have any idea

132
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:24,079
why this is taking so long as anyone
ever had

133
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,930
reached here organization to breach
obviously this public knowledge you can

134
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:35,540
you can let it go public knowledge yet
don't raise your hand ok so so so are

135
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,689
these breaches where they found out
quickly

136
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:42,010
you know that I i mean i cant stand up
and say it took us a year to do this but

137
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:47,319
you know this is the case of what's
going on we're being bridged taken a

138
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:52,540
long time we need to solve that problem
so to me that's the problem I'm not here

139
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,900
to help you solve breaches

140
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,550
never gonna happen here to help you
solve the problem of taking so long

141
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:03,829
early start thinking about that so the
second phase will get into here is in

142
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:09,270
reference to your existing network
infrastructure in your security and how

143
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:13,370
you're doing things it's kind of a
layered approach one of the first layers

144
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:20,830
as prevention so everyone here has a
prevention program right ok I guess you

145
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:26,430
don't have to raise you everyone it
doesn't reason I can produce your name

146
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:33,790
online make money so prevention so good
a good solution for prevention is is

147
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:36,949
some real simple things you know that
just to think about understanding your

148
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:42,530
environment so how many people here you
know they do you really understand your

149
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:48,160
environment most organized organizations
do it's quite common they really truly

150
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,319
understand the environment

151
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:54,210
police say think they often when I go in
and do assessments in pen test I find

152
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:58,540
out otherwise strange things happen when
evil people set foot on their promises

153
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,770
understanding where their wrists lies
where where tall light laid out with an

154
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:09,579
organization and one of the things that
that I did one time I was organization

155
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,950
implementing some best practices covered
efforts to implement best practices what

156
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:17,690
we consider best practices there's like
three that I think are important you

157
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:20,690
least need to consider you know network
segmentation

158
00:13:21,379 --> 00:13:25,299
so you get a good network segmentation
good solid password policies

159
00:13:26,289 --> 00:13:33,529
password policies are big and haven't
good ones turning on Windows complex

160
00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:38,359
password is not a password policy
because your employees gonna go out and

161
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:41,959
eat you know what password are gonna
pick on you had to hear me say this

162
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:46,169
before you answer me talk so what it
what is the current password that your

163
00:13:46,169 --> 00:13:52,859
employees are using right now very good
spring 2016 or spring 16 based on

164
00:13:52,859 --> 00:13:57,449
whether they want to the complex or non
complex version of it you know go to a

165
00:13:57,449 --> 00:14:04,159
high-security when it's spring 2060 just
a basic security wanted spring 16 and

166
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:09,929
reason why is that happening we'll start
with the complexities which requires

167
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:14,199
three out of five possible things you
know uppercase lowercase number special

168
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:18,539
character those type of things so what
they do they're gonna pick you know

169
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:20,379
uppercase lowercase in the number

170
00:14:20,379 --> 00:14:23,159
those are the easiest thing most
employees are gonna do that no matter

171
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:27,529
what and then what do you do you set a
password rotation of every 90 days right

172
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:32,239
so what changes every 90 days the
seasons of the year so insulate

173
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:36,579
employees pick that and it's really easy
for an attacker did not even think about

174
00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:40,919
putting much effort into it he just
needs identify your employees user names

175
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:45,989
which is often your email addresses
which are based off their name which you

176
00:14:45,989 --> 00:14:51,649
can get off LinkedIn you get off Google
or you can get off the UE Census Bureau

177
00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:55,879
which we haven't seen it done and get
rid of post a blog here soon on how

178
00:14:55,879 --> 00:15:00,499
hackers can actually use UE Census
Bureau data to improve their probability

179
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:05,699
of success for carrying out attacks
against your organization's so so you

180
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:10,238
get into two factor also we want to do
two factor authentication that's always

181
00:15:10,239 --> 00:15:13,579
I think that's very important to expose
the stuff to the internet without

182
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:18,659
two-factor authentication you're gonna
have issues when I say two factor

183
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:23,279
authentication I was in a conference not
too long ago and the company was talking

184
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,299
about how they were implemented to
factor

185
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:28,220
version of two factor authentication fun
factor

186
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:35,650
you know so so that you get a a text MMS
message type thing and you can go and

187
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:39,530
enter your code pin pin number in there
and go yet prove and all that type of

188
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:43,839
stuff and they were all kind of may be
familiar with that but there's a there's

189
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:50,310
a lesser secure version of that where
you basically you get MMS messaging you

190
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:54,930
just say yes to reply to it you know I
have dinner in a pin number

191
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:58,680
the problem with that it's really
convenient for your workers but I care

192
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:04,069
team within six months of Internet going
yes yes yes three or four times a day

193
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:08,250
soon as a hacker hits the site and they
get prompted they're gonna go he yes

194
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:13,930
every time someone I'm hacking a company
and they have that I instantly go who

195
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:19,640
this is going to be easy to sure up
their employees always go yes without

196
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,819
going hey I did wasn't trying to log
into that system but they still have

197
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,320
proven

198
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:30,080
also to factor like I said and I'm
saying some of the stuff so you have an

199
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,780
understanding that it's not a cure all
tryna make a point here prevention is

200
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:38,449
never going to be a hundred percent when
the cessnas I did a number of years ago

201
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:42,330
was against will offer and they wanted
me to do a social engineering attacks

202
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:48,930
electronic fishing style attack so what
I did was I went to their website and I

203
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:52,469
go through that easily trying to take
screenshots of that data and build a

204
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,800
website that kinda looks like that
that's one of the approaches so I

205
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,500
decided to do something a little
different I decided I would go ahead to

206
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:04,690
a survey you know everyone likes filling
out surveys right all your employees

207
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:09,500
like surveys of that now from a phishing
attack if I want to get into a company

208
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:15,650
does have a survey and always got kind
of creative with the surveys my goal was

209
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:20,870
to to actually gather dated a break in
the company's but often I would actually

210
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:25,739
put a real survey out there which was
kind of fun and then I'd start off

211
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:29,920
asking simple questions and I but
progressively get to the point where I

212
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,770
would have employees ratting out other
employees of just totally funny

213
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:39,830
you know so under security policies who
do you know violates these policies may

214
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:43,850
start putting in names if you put that
in the beginning then won't do it but if

215
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:47,669
you progressively get evil and evil in
the questions inevitably

216
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,960
almost all of them will start answering
start right right now

217
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:58,180
co-workers managers and I never did give
that information to the customer that

218
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:01,650
would just been wrong in too many
different ways but always found that

219
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:06,470
kind of funny bone this case here but
they had two factor authentication some

220
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:11,270
centered on ok they want me to break
into phishing attacks and break into the

221
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:16,389
organization they didn't want me to run
code on in users box so wasn't like I

222
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:22,300
can get now we're in heaven call back I
had actually farm credentials so I set

223
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:28,980
up a survey site also set up an email
server email server and all that type of

224
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:33,010
stuff so I can communicate with them and
I threw the serbia there in the survey

225
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:40,390
actually had a duplicate looking to
factor validation so they can login and

226
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:45,970
i SAT there and as they pinned in their
two-factor code author RSA tokens I

227
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:51,090
turned around and finding the two-factor
code into their real-life system and I

228
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:54,840
was able to break in using a probably
about a half dozen dozen different

229
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:00,889
accounts in one case I had employees in
an e-mail complaining that it wasn't

230
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,760
were obvious had they were having
problems because you know I didn't

231
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,510
always work so I'm like wow this is cool
I call them up on the phone you know and

232
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:12,580
I kind of talked to him like I entered
again I'm sitting here watching it come

233
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:16,919
across like and I'm heartbroken and with
accounting for some reason they had

234
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:22,680
their user or password wrong code Red
Dead two password so basically to walk

235
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:27,290
them through and go hey maybe your
password change dinner like like given

236
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:31,409
to me and let me try you know so I was
able to log in with that so from there

237
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:36,270
as an example you know this is this is
all about breaches and breaches of data

238
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:41,750
and how long it takes to detect won the
law firm which is pretty good sized did

239
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,170
not detect anything

240
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:46,680
that I was doing during this whole thing
plays never did grab me out which

241
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,810
surprised me usually there's at least
one play goes this doesn't smell right

242
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:56,840
call somebody nobody did that once I
gained access to the network again a

243
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:02,159
user's account to gain a foothold to
machine I move lateral I escalated my

244
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,490
right side broke into all of their
critical data bases and this was a law

245
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:11,110
firm that represented it very
influential people

246
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:16,030
dreamily influential people that's why
they were having this time I literally

247
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:23,620
broke in and throw and he gained access
to all of the records financial records

248
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:30,620
legal documents for these include
influential people I can't say who they

249
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:34,780
are because it would get with the whole
law firm think but but seriously I gain

250
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,260
access to all this put it all in the
report

251
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:45,080
shock is is not the right word to
describe what happened there and this

252
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,710
comes into play in a number of these
things you know understanding your mom

253
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:51,470
you can still understand your
environment you can implement some best

254
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:58,040
practices understanding where your risk
lie a lot of time is overlooked you

255
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:02,060
understand these these concepts of
protecting stop but you don't understand

256
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:06,360
what these protected on your network and
how intact to gain access

257
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:12,159
I seen organizations literally literally
go in and go okay we're gonna take that

258
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:17,690
critical data that CD either financial
data credit card data environment and

259
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:21,260
we're going to harden it it's in this
circle it's hard knowing can get into

260
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:27,390
we're going to protect it but then I
came in in another company gained access

261
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:31,370
to the company pulled from Active
Directory list of the users that were

262
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:35,129
DBA's initially broke into the DBA's
machines

263
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:40,580
setup keyloggers on the DBA but Sheens
gathered all the passwords they used the

264
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:45,220
log into these databases and since they
were allowed into this little round I

265
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,380
pivoted from their machine gain access
all the credit card data

266
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:55,140
now we understand that this was critical
but we forgot about the fact that the

267
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:59,620
employees were critical to those systems
that they had access to they were the

268
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:04,459
weakest point we often overlook some of
these things so the moral of the story

269
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:10,250
is more prevention doesn't work we'll
get to that I got just the thing here I

270
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:14,120
was like the Saints started doing this
recently trying to find some saying so

271
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:18,860
here this fully binge Ben Franklin
saying an ounce of prevention is worth a

272
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:22,830
pound of cure apparently ben franklin
never heard of information security

273
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:31,990
because I mean think about it that's not
always true sometimes secures a hell of

274
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:36,840
alot cheaper than prevention because you
can put everything in place from a

275
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:42,310
prevention standpoint and you can spend
millions of dollars short of taking

276
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:46,590
everyone's computer way from home given
my education requirement shaken on their

277
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:52,580
head on the way out the door every day
your data can be compromised in my

278
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:56,679
opinion you can be breached someone can
get a foothold on your network in almost

279
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:01,540
every case and I've done that across
every industry that exists now I hit

280
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:06,580
some companies who was like you know I
couldn't get nothing but neither could

281
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:13,790
do employees and life for them was very
difficult so that's a no go in the big

282
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:17,310
thing here I want to point out is the
moral story you're never gonna be a

283
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:21,050
hundred percent successful with
prevention so that's only one piece of

284
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:24,370
the puzzle you know if prevention works
eighty percent of the time

285
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:27,689
60% 80% whatever you're doing good

286
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:32,030
ok you know you go to the next piece of
the puzzle and thats detection so how

287
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:35,910
many people here have a solid detection
mechanism in their environment where

288
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:40,250
they actually look at logs gather logs
enumerate the log data and take a look

289
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:43,680
at what's going on in your environment
and consider tracking things like

290
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:48,730
behavioral I don't know how many people
get into behavioral things obviously to

291
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:53,280
me that's kind of critical you know if
you had if you have Joe over here comes

292
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,540
in every morning logs in at eight
o'clock he's logged in until five

293
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:00,730
o'clock he connects the three different
servers everyday and does his job

294
00:24:01,389 --> 00:24:04,579
that's a behavior that can be tracked
and measured she can figure that stuff

295
00:24:04,579 --> 00:24:08,369
out these companies and organizations
that help me figure that stuff out you

296
00:24:08,369 --> 00:24:15,478
create these baselines so happens is is
this guy turns around and logs and eight

297
00:24:15,479 --> 00:24:20,209
o'clock at night nine o'clock at night
don't you think there's probably a

298
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:27,249
problem when you agree I would think so
if it's outside the normal behavior of

299
00:24:27,249 --> 00:24:30,369
your organization someone when your
organization there's something going on

300
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:36,228
either bob is up to the head which is a
possibility or somebody else's got a

301
00:24:36,229 --> 00:24:39,529
hold of his account is actually using or
bob instead of logging into those three

302
00:24:39,529 --> 00:24:43,619
machines logs into thirty different
machines is an indication of something's

303
00:24:43,619 --> 00:24:51,879
going on so good solutions require
effort efforts a big thing and and I i a

304
00:24:51,879 --> 00:24:57,939
joke about this cause I do these pen
test and in the companies that think

305
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:01,269
they have detection capability good
detection capability

306
00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:05,659
it's kind of funny cuz I'm in there I'm
doing a pen test run some scans on break

307
00:25:05,659 --> 00:25:10,169
in a stop in almost all my network
connections go down like and they all

308
00:25:10,169 --> 00:25:15,619
come running in the room going how we
cut she hell yeah that's good good yeah

309
00:25:15,619 --> 00:25:20,718
you caught me you know what I'm thinking
dear god man you better notice the

310
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:24,289
freight train coming through your living
room because I'm doing a pen test I'm

311
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:28,769
not there being quiet I'm there to
discover vulnerabilities in issues I'm

312
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:34,209
taking one attacker does in six months a
year eighteen months and I'm crammed

313
00:25:34,209 --> 00:25:39,849
into five days to think about that when
you're getting assessments done if you

314
00:25:39,849 --> 00:25:44,639
detect that he don't detect at all dear
god you're bad shape and that does

315
00:25:44,639 --> 00:25:49,549
happen I've lost count of the number of
assessments that I've asked the customer

316
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:55,700
did you notice anything now everything
was fine we did hear single peep out of

317
00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:01,190
anybody anything I had one customer did
an assessment of the things I used to do

318
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:03,650
if I broke in from the outside

319
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:07,880
and I would gain access to like some
critical systems are Active Directory I

320
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,290
would kinda like I always like to leave
a trace their one of the things we used

321
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:15,990
to do is we would create a domain admin
account on a system there's two reasons

322
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:21,280
for that one to show that we were there
to give them the ability to track what

323
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:25,950
we're doing is weed weed elevate we we
get a domain admin account and then we

324
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:29,390
would use that to mean m account
compromised lot of other things so now

325
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:34,490
they have a track record you know it
isn't like hey what did you guys do you

326
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:39,470
can see what we did you should have laws
that can track everything we did and

327
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:44,050
then on my way back out the door I would
disable the account so no one can

328
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:48,510
actually use it so I did this on an
engagement I broke in from the outside

329
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:54,170
so this company was a mortgage company
and they had their the way there was set

330
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:59,110
up was they did not use any PII data in
none of their databases that was their

331
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:04,320
claim to fame we track everyone based on
a serial number so they were a mortgage

332
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,490
tracker mortgage company or mortgage
analysis company or something weird like

333
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:12,690
that that was their claim to fame so I
got a phone call with the sky to kick

334
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:17,780
the kickoff and the guy goes you know
yeah what we're our own mortgage company

335
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:22,830
we don't have any PII data but we're
getting a former partnership and the

336
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:26,280
reason why we need this assessment done
is so that we can give this to our

337
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:33,020
customer or partner so he can speak and
know that we are secure and I'm thinking

338
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:37,830
there I know how do i how do I tell this
guy that that will report I deliver him

339
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:42,300
two weeks he probably not gonna wanna
give this to anybody cuz I asking

340
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,780
straight up if you ever had an
assessment not know I'm never done an

341
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:52,410
assessment so I said ok I said you may
have to make some do some fixes and

342
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:55,270
stuff like that goes ok ok

343
00:27:55,270 --> 00:28:01,180
so I did the assessment I broke in from
the outside I took control of this is

344
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:05,100
like three days three days assessment I
took control of all their infrastructure

345
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:09,590
network infrastructure control of all
their systems exposed to the internet I

346
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:13,870
had full access to every client machine
on their network again access to every

347
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:18,600
one of their databases and also managed
to find in steel PII data out of the

348
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:25,610
databases that claim did not exist I put
us in the report and the saddest part of

349
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:31,169
this is we had a close out meeting with
poor guy started crying on the phone you

350
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:36,730
know and I'm like is horrible he
literally started crying you know what

351
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:41,770
am I to do I have to deliver this to my
partners in a week and and I told him up

352
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:47,440
front that that may not be doable and
and of course we laid out everything he

353
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,920
could do to fix these to mitigate these
problems and most of it was was

354
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:58,030
external facing some real good easy fix
decision about a dozen texts so you know

355
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:01,780
a few good tech guys could probably get
these all done in a week so and he never

356
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:06,670
did follow ups I didn't find out how
that played out but but it was it was

357
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:10,990
really sad and that's an example will
you know not understand your environment

358
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:14,910
another thing is matching your business
model

359
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:18,670
everybody has a different business a
different model and how they approach

360
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:23,030
risk insecurity in your organization you
have a different model based on the type

361
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:27,340
of data that you actually holder
contained so for anyone to get up there

362
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:31,379
for me to get up here and say this is
the one solution for everyone is not

363
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:35,860
doable you have to figure out those
solutions for yourself so detection is

364
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:43,320
very critical and a lot of times it's
doesn't happen I'd say probably only 50%

365
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:47,770
the company's I do so with actually
detect the freight train coming through

366
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:51,100
their labor in maybe half and that's
pretty much it

367
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:55,199
and I'll those out of those half that
detective freight train coming to their

368
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,710
living room do not understand how to
respond to it that's probably the

369
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:04,890
biggest biggest so once you detect how
do you respond how do you react to that

370
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:10,179
action is taking place on your networks
critical needs are you know the three

371
00:30:10,179 --> 00:30:19,030
core pieces so we get into dealing with
this we need understanding have a plan

372
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:24,299
and I mean you have to have a serious
plan I mean really think about this one

373
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:28,650
only one of the pen test we did in this
one was hilarious and kinda makes it

374
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:33,179
kind of puts out there why there's big
deal with the plan and how you build a

375
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:38,460
plan we're actually doing a phishing
attack one organization and he hasn't

376
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:45,409
had to break in this happened to be a
police department for a moderate sized

377
00:30:45,409 --> 00:30:52,600
city so what we did was we created a
phishing attack and use the vicious

378
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:57,070
attack to gain access into the email
system once we're in the email system

379
00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:02,270
expand up the phishing attack use a real
people's emails ok once they figured out

380
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:05,780
a phishing attack was going on because
we were using internal emails actually

381
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:12,149
cinema where two people would execute
and give us shells back but that was the

382
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:17,039
goal so there I T Department what do
they do when they send out an email

383
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,400
saying don't do this

384
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:24,120
ok don't do they don't want to do this
using the same email system that we are

385
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:29,299
so what do we do we use their exact same
count send an email out saying hey that

386
00:31:29,299 --> 00:31:32,900
last emails bonus if you want to stop
this you better install this software

387
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,119
now

388
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:45,978
and of course there was an email battle
who the hell is this going to hell is

389
00:31:45,979 --> 00:31:52,449
this is really hilarious and the whole
battle with back and forth and all they

390
00:31:52,449 --> 00:31:56,659
were furious they were absolutely
furious but pointed out a really big

391
00:31:56,659 --> 00:32:02,449
issue what is your plan if you lose
control of your email system as an

392
00:32:02,449 --> 00:32:06,339
example in the attackers are using your
email system this is your forum a

393
00:32:06,339 --> 00:32:11,729
communication to your employees right
and and I assure you every time you ask

394
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:16,799
your employees do really stupid things
like click on links install software do

395
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:21,519
this do that and then the exact same
things I I was caught in a vicious

396
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:26,009
attack in our organization they send out
of fish you have a pretty good one and I

397
00:32:26,009 --> 00:32:29,899
you know I got caught in it looked
pretty legitimate so anyone can get

398
00:32:29,899 --> 00:32:33,508
caught in East phishing attacks every
time they see me an email to do

399
00:32:33,509 --> 00:32:39,479
something now I refuse and check until
he gets to the point where they want to

400
00:32:39,479 --> 00:32:45,219
threaten me and will now what they do is
they send it in email and in the email

401
00:32:45,219 --> 00:32:49,429
there's like a link you know the goes to
something that says hey this is not

402
00:32:49,429 --> 00:32:52,849
fishing or something I guess kinda funny
I probably shouldn't said and now it's

403
00:32:52,849 --> 00:33:00,658
on film they're gonna fire me but that's
life so so we have a response plan you

404
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:04,409
should have a response plan and these
are the three key pieces your your

405
00:33:04,409 --> 00:33:12,589
prevention or detection and your
response so if we all have those and we

406
00:33:12,589 --> 00:33:16,658
all make some attempt at those how come
we're still having his breach times

407
00:33:16,659 --> 00:33:22,539
their average in out two hundred days my
philosophy is you know these can always

408
00:33:22,539 --> 00:33:27,029
be improved but one of the key things
that make all this stuff important and

409
00:33:27,029 --> 00:33:32,919
make these things work for you guys the
people not to technology could you guys

410
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:37,629
make the technology work so if your
organization that decides that you know

411
00:33:37,629 --> 00:33:41,708
we're gonna buy technology but we're not
gonna bring in the people for the proper

412
00:33:41,709 --> 00:33:45,660
care and feeding of it then yes things
are not going to work for

413
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:51,360
and when the care and feeding of a dent
involves training exercises practices so

414
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,590
all these things I'm talking about you
need to do yourself you need to practice

415
00:33:54,590 --> 00:34:00,570
these things cause this is what we want
to avoid their own comes in he's the

416
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:07,120
evil hacker ok and of course we have the
internal security and they are they are

417
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:14,489
the most ferocious beast there are i
dont wanna see that anymore I literally

418
00:34:14,489 --> 00:34:23,080
don't this is what I wanna see I wanna
see somebody that has a passion is I

419
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,600
think a lot of these things are more
successful when your employees have a

420
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,650
passion

421
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:31,000
understand your environment you have the
right resources you have the right

422
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,139
technologies and you have people with
passion and so we're going to talk about

423
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:40,969
things that I helped that helped build
all of this and I think instill a

424
00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:42,770
passion in your organization

425
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:53,190
training for success so obviously you
guys do training right you're here I'm

426
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:56,720
hoping it's it's paramount within your
organization to do training

427
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:06,300
so many people here go to some the
hacker conference Wiles at all how many

428
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:13,470
people have been the DEFCON black a
former professional wow they won't let

429
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:18,100
you how much do that I figured that you
normally the audiences I speak to others

430
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:25,420
elisa's certain percentage with Mohawks
are those alleged blue-green unlike me

431
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:32,420
and some of my friends we just don't
know Mohar comin I make up for another

432
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:43,110
was so I encourage you to get your
staffing training training in some of

433
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:47,510
the hardcore stuff some of the evil
stuff some of the hockey there's a

434
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:50,780
number of great class and has a number
three classes up there on various hack

435
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,829
hack

436
00:35:52,829 --> 00:35:57,279
but it's important that we get them to
apply it and that's where we're failing

437
00:35:57,279 --> 00:36:04,279
I was at a I took a training class here
about two years ago on web hacking not

438
00:36:04,279 --> 00:36:06,950
sure why did it I was doing that for a
living

439
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:11,979
also but I thought hey you know it kinda
refresher maybe I'll pick up you know

440
00:36:11,979 --> 00:36:14,979
thirty forty percent new things that had
experienced before

441
00:36:15,619 --> 00:36:20,150
unfortunately that was not the case I
was more like five percent so 95% the

442
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:24,140
class was like boring for me but I made
a lot of new friends which to me is

443
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:29,379
probably one of the other most important
things about all these conferences so

444
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:34,959
year goes by and I'm doing up in tests
internal contested his organization hey

445
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:39,989
and here are the guys that it was in
class when I start asking him I said you

446
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:44,390
know how do you like the classes like he
was great I learned a ton so I said

447
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:49,430
you're you're actually using that stuff
around here like now he just dropped

448
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:53,339
five grand on a class you're not using
none of it no they do not allow US

449
00:36:53,339 --> 00:36:59,839
employees to act on anything your
security right yeah you're not allowed

450
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:03,578
to happen anything not even the
development environment before it goes

451
00:37:03,579 --> 00:37:05,130
into production

452
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:10,219
you know I understand the concern with
you know taken a new production

453
00:37:10,219 --> 00:37:17,180
environment you know bad things can
happen but most of the stuff over time

454
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:22,129
we integrate new stuff in technologies
so those are areas for them to actually

455
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:25,969
apply what they learn if you can spend
the money to senior employees to

456
00:37:25,969 --> 00:37:32,890
training I encourage you you have used
that treaty and not you know once every

457
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:39,288
six months if you're spending money to
train somebody on example web hakki then

458
00:37:39,289 --> 00:37:44,809
have then use that continuously on your
web environment because they're you you

459
00:37:44,809 --> 00:37:47,089
you gained his skill

460
00:37:47,089 --> 00:37:53,999
great game brain equity and you're going
to lose it for the money way we do not

461
00:37:53,999 --> 00:37:56,848
get them involved plus your employees
will love it

462
00:37:56,849 --> 00:38:02,249
gosh you know you get them excited about
that stuff is kind of cool for some the

463
00:38:02,249 --> 00:38:08,968
dude 224 staff user training you know
hey this is why I sent you to train me I

464
00:38:08,969 --> 00:38:13,390
expect you to use it this is why you're
here you're employee be part of the

465
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:14,339
process

466
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:17,469
try to learn from it share your
knowledge the other things cross

467
00:38:17,469 --> 00:38:20,660
training which is one of the things I
always love to do so when I worked at

468
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:27,160
Fortune 500 companies I used to run
training classes in the organization why

469
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:31,788
would come in but talking everything
from you know nitty-gritty 10 network

470
00:38:31,789 --> 00:38:36,969
level security all the way up to a key
or whatever and I went to a class I

471
00:38:36,969 --> 00:38:42,619
would run try to rerun that class when
possible for anyone wanted to attend you

472
00:38:42,619 --> 00:38:50,619
know what really did anyone show up it
wasn't expected of them they were a

473
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:58,759
nine-to-five employee I don't care we
need to change that to some ways to do I

474
00:38:58,759 --> 00:39:02,390
think we have something here it may be
useful changes in your employees to be

475
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:06,038
engaged is critical

476
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:11,400
you want to create a passion if you want
great security create a passion in your

477
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:17,430
security people create a passion here I
T people I always had a passion so I'm

478
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:23,089
like I'm not a normal person some crazy
normal day for me as it typically 6

479
00:39:23,089 --> 00:39:26,869
o'clock for the company and then I
proceeded from there to do other

480
00:39:26,869 --> 00:39:31,319
training exercises and learning
opportunities for myself to make myself

481
00:39:31,319 --> 00:39:34,319
a better employee and advance my career

482
00:39:34,849 --> 00:39:39,549
example typically my Friday night is I
get off work Friday I get off work at

483
00:39:39,549 --> 00:39:41,720
six o'clock I work from home

484
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:47,700
6 o'clock a dinner for wife watch TV I
go to sleep I sleep for about an hour on

485
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:53,710
the clock and then I get up more TV with
the wife and then I go to my lab I spend

486
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:57,390
my lab every Friday and Saturday night
all three in the morning doing research

487
00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:02,339
so I have like cool stuff to bring to
these conferences this is something I do

488
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:06,890
every week you're not gonna be able to
get all your employees thinking that way

489
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:12,640
but you'll be amazed when you dangle a
carrot out there to excite them on

490
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:17,299
something you can create a passion and I
see that lot more obviously than in

491
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:21,020
younger people you know this college
college college people coming out of

492
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:27,130
college have more of a passion take
advantage of that don't don't don't let

493
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:32,190
them become that that that board forty
year old forty-hour forty year old white

494
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:38,410
male employee that you know don't take
offense but that I've worked with for so

495
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:45,029
many years is like you know they're
button pusher give a passion a passion

496
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:48,410
will build a career and it's exciting
and what it what you get out of it is

497
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:55,160
cool training and you get a guy that is
so focused on what his job is that he

498
00:40:55,160 --> 00:41:00,290
detects he reacts he finds these I have
one company that I do have done work

499
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:05,680
with over the years the first day we're
supposed to be stealthy stuff first year

500
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:10,089
I did it I was domain admin before his
guy Cotten he learned from that this guy

501
00:41:10,089 --> 00:41:15,640
had this amazing passion for detection
so he said it is his command control

502
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:20,879
console with forty screens up and he
could see into tech everything you can

503
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:27,369
imagine by the third year i plug my
computer into the network before I get

504
00:41:27,369 --> 00:41:28,500
logged in

505
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,360
is detected me

506
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:36,180
because he's taken the technology he's
built upon it created a passion for

507
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:40,279
being that guy on the network that can
make a difference and detect these

508
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:44,230
things to the point where it works and
then what he does is he crossed ranges

509
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:45,190
other people

510
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:48,790
teaches then what he's doing get them
involved in it also so they can play a

511
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:51,790
part of that so that's very important
that makes sense

512
00:41:53,420 --> 00:42:01,230
self-assessments I'm a big fan of this
doing self-assessments so trainer guys

513
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:06,060
you know cinema the classes and let him
do this stuff for you there's nothing

514
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:09,620
wrong with bringing in yet another eyes
every once in a while

515
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:14,549
consultants Penn testers to do stuff but
you what you want to do is you wanna

516
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:19,600
make life hard for the pin tested you
hire on the outside to do anything you

517
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:23,319
want to make it so difficult they can
hardly find anything in a half the work

518
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:31,070
for IU engaging customer I go I asked
him you know do you run vulnerability

519
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:37,900
scanners no ok as part of the contract
with rabbit said we typically give you

520
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:41,210
30 day free trial next post do me a
favor

521
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:46,670
use it it's thirty days until the
engagement 45 days engagement I don't

522
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:50,510
want to log onto your network and find a
few machines with MSO 8067

523
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:56,910
vulnerabilities that's insane why you
hire me run your tools picture network

524
00:42:56,910 --> 00:43:00,609
and then depend testers are forced to
look deeper harder fine is more

525
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:04,760
difficult things to help improve your
security app intestines not gonna help

526
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:10,000
you improve your security if I'm finding
things from 2003 2004 vulnerabilities in

527
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:16,450
your network is no value in it just
wasting money are you doing employees

528
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:17,250
doing this

529
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:22,500
there's so much resources on internet
take one employees and say hey I want

530
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:26,830
you to find out everything you can about
wireless security wireless testy 20

531
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:30,600
resources out there they fell only sings
almost every conferences film these

532
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:35,460
things you know you can go go look at
our geek stuff a drink rinse off stuff

533
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:41,720
there's probably thirty you know thirty
films me doing like similar type stuff

534
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:45,379
there's a bunch of them out there in all
these are filmed and he uses his

535
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:48,760
training opportunities employees
collected and go hey and they can learn

536
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:53,450
how wireless security works they can
read about it give them a time frame to

537
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:54,210
do that

538
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:57,770
expect them to cross train you tell
everyone on the team what they've

539
00:43:57,770 --> 00:44:02,240
learned and then also happen to the work
haven't do an assessment against your

540
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:08,970
wireless network and if he finds a
vulnerability in you know what it's a

541
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:14,720
good thing if you find the home you know
why he's gonna get excited

542
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:19,830
other people gonna get excited and
they're gonna go that is cool you know

543
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:23,130
I'd almost be tempted to put a bogus
phone bill the up there for him to find

544
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:27,730
you know because you're gonna form that
passion and excitement and then what

545
00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:32,780
he's going to do from that now you gotta
employees excited he's committed it in

546
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:36,070
his delivering value to your
organization can help improve your

547
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:42,050
overall security by doing that you're
also increased the down time to time for

548
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:45,990
detection when this passions get in
place I mean I think it was wasn't it

549
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:49,080
target they actually noticed the breach

550
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:56,150
way back when it happened but for some
reason they were like we just look the

551
00:44:56,150 --> 00:45:00,609
other way or whatever the case may be in
my opinion that's driven because there

552
00:45:00,609 --> 00:45:03,390
was no passion for what they were doing

553
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:09,680
they were excited they were bored you
know one board security people nothing

554
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:15,149
good comes of them and this is something
I seen a company do that I thought was

555
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:21,450
absolutely brilliant they'd started in
the thing called hacker brainstorming

556
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:27,879
and what they did was each quarter they
would go in and I think they had I can't

557
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:31,640
remember how big righty department was
but they would take three to four people

558
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:35,069
at about two or three people and I T a
much bigger I T you have to gauge it

559
00:45:35,069 --> 00:45:39,349
based on size your organization and then
we go for somebody from business

560
00:45:39,349 --> 00:45:45,260
somebody from a county somebody from
operations somebody from the front desk

561
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:49,789
in a we get one person or two people
from each department based on the size

562
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:54,150
in every week for one quarter they would
have to come into a room and they would

563
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:59,549
spend four hours on Friday and what they
would do is i wud brainstorm up evil

564
00:45:59,549 --> 00:46:05,809
nasty ways to steal data from the
company that was their job they would go

565
00:46:05,809 --> 00:46:09,119
in there and and initially you have to
have the security people that kind of

566
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:15,579
lead this thing and you know pull it out
of them but after a few weeks he's

567
00:46:15,579 --> 00:46:20,210
telling me hey you know the lady up
front the taken money at the cash

568
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:29,670
register and stuff she comes up with
ways to steal money from us you know and

569
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:33,329
they are that I T guy comes up with this
ways to gain access you know that this

570
00:46:33,329 --> 00:46:38,150
isn't as secure as we think and someone
could do a B or C and then they take all

571
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:40,620
the stuff and they proved and proved it

572
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:44,910
not only do they theorize that they
proved they go through and say do this

573
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:47,520
or have so many monitor can be done

574
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:52,780
can the AHR person have effect over here
and farm data out of the people saw

575
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:54,600
system without being detected

576
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:58,720
you know large quantities of pieces of
data and then what they do is they put

577
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:04,439
processes in modern Indian place to
better improve these things and they

578
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:08,610
would do this every month and what you
get out of this is you get an employee

579
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:13,780
that of course some people want to teach
my employees the road from me are you

580
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:20,520
insane probably insane but that's far
and yes that's exactly what I'm telling

581
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:26,210
you teach them how to do this they teach
you how to do that what they do is they

582
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:32,410
go back to the department every week in
that water fountain conversation starts

583
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:38,540
we're learning that we're talking about
this type of stuff and everyone gets

584
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:43,750
excited and that she know everybody
wants to be put on that list to be in

585
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:47,540
that class or whatever you want to call
it brainstorming thing for the next

586
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:53,290
quarter in Europe start this process
rolling you improve your security you

587
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:58,050
prove your employee awareness you get
your employees excite its to me

588
00:47:58,050 --> 00:48:02,900
excitement is the most the most value
you have an excited employee you're

589
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:06,200
going to have a successful employee and
he's gonna make a big difference in your

590
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:11,439
overall security you have a sad pathetic
employee that she's dozens eight hour

591
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:16,760
day job you know gets up every morning
goes you know life sucks but I gotta go

592
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:22,080
to work anyways your life sucks for him
and it's gonna spread within your

593
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:25,799
organization so I think it's important
that she take it to that next level

594
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:29,779
exciting your employees and get him
involved so running out here so

595
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:33,990
partnership success I'm a big fan of
partnership so eventually you're gonna

596
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:39,109
reach out to a consultant to do
something whether it's a pen test or

597
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:42,880
whether it's you know a PCI test whether
she's general consulting

598
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:48,480
I challenge you to partner with them
don't don't hire somebody coming to do a

599
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:53,140
job and they give you report two weeks
later form that partnership now we have

600
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:56,240
a partnership with a number of companies
and I I'd like to have a partnership

601
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:00,269
with every company that we work with one
of the companies that we were doing

602
00:49:00,269 --> 00:49:06,129
don't have much time here quick one of
the companies were doing really good

603
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:10,279
security everything I'm talking about
their can't do it they have a really

604
00:49:10,279 --> 00:49:15,109
excited Department of security the
security operation center there really

605
00:49:15,109 --> 00:49:19,569
tough cookies really good at what they
do they have all the tools all the

606
00:49:19,569 --> 00:49:24,180
technology and all the people but did
they have all the knowledge so that was

607
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:27,230
a discussion we had with him we
partnered with we decided to do a blue

608
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:32,029
with blue red team exercised so we did
was we took our blue team guys we took

609
00:49:32,029 --> 00:49:35,880
to forensic guys we planted them in the
sock told him that they were like

610
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:41,000
auditors from some auditing company okay
and then me and another guy came in from

611
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:47,650
red team standpoint and our goal was to
do red team up operation and and have to

612
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:53,599
admit you know I didn't have my machine
setup perfect i plug my machine in and

613
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:59,039
one of my applications phone home to a
bad place and it red flags on their

614
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:03,210
system down there we can't let people
down there kinda talked him out of it

615
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:08,259
said all that was one of my machine blah
blah blah got his past that you know I

616
00:50:08,259 --> 00:50:14,279
got caught first day at the pathetic but
then we continued yeah it really really

617
00:50:14,279 --> 00:50:20,130
low and slow so we started gaining
access to various things that weren't

618
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:24,269
necessarily detected but remember lot of
times people are going to detect normal

619
00:50:24,269 --> 00:50:28,288
transactions in your organization
they're gonna start detecting win you

620
00:50:28,289 --> 00:50:34,630
start escalating things ok but the way
we were going to hide herself is we did

621
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:38,859
a little start now I told our blue team
guys that I was gonna do something a

622
00:50:38,859 --> 00:50:42,019
little special for everybody there were
like

623
00:50:42,589 --> 00:50:46,999
what are you gonna do I'm like I don't
think you've ever seen this before but I

624
00:50:46,999 --> 00:50:51,319
think it's a very practical practical
approach and you'll know it when you see

625
00:50:51,319 --> 00:50:55,569
it so when I got on their network
everyone knows I'm like a printer

626
00:50:55,569 --> 00:50:58,579
research and stuff like that so when I
got on the network

627
00:50:58,579 --> 00:51:02,890
the first thing I did was round up all
their xerox Printers like dozens of them

628
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:06,529
throughout the company and a pic 5 I'm
strategically planted throughout the

629
00:51:06,529 --> 00:51:13,259
company and I broke into everyone and
with the attack that I design and got

630
00:51:13,259 --> 00:51:19,539
rich shells on every one of them I turn
around said everyone SSH services set up

631
00:51:19,539 --> 00:51:25,219
accounts and we set up all of our tax
due Piven through the printers so if

632
00:51:25,219 --> 00:51:29,079
they detected anything we did it would
be to the printers so we started doing

633
00:51:29,079 --> 00:51:33,749
the scan East are gathered data stuff
like that and we're like the third day

634
00:51:33,749 --> 00:51:38,759
and it's going slow and I'm like oh
let's give them something to play with

635
00:51:38,759 --> 00:51:43,839
ok so I threw a full blown brute force
attack against Active Directory with

636
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:44,560
like

637
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:51,870
ten thousand names ok so instantly
everything in the cycle it up we're

638
00:51:51,870 --> 00:51:55,520
being attacked for being attacked while
an attack was going on I went over to

639
00:51:55,520 --> 00:52:01,600
another printer pivot through it with a
smaller set of accounts which I thought

640
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:06,400
I had the password for but I want to
validate where had access to and I use

641
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:10,510
that against Active Directory over here
so we're all over here scrambling trying

642
00:52:10,510 --> 00:52:14,650
to figure out where this attacks coming
from I'm over here with an attack that

643
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:20,300
does work the other ones you streak in
noisy and her friends are guys are down

644
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:24,020
there and they say are many things are
going at it and then all once everything

645
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:37,530
stops in here says it's a printer what
do we do now and everything halted they

646
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:42,770
had no clue they had no clue to you how
to use their tools to deal with pivoting

647
00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:48,920
attacks through the network remember
most times an attacker to gain access to

648
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:54,780
critical resources is gonna need to pit
so he detected here coming from this

649
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:59,590
source here it may not be that source so
literally I'm capable going into a

650
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:03,920
network and setting up an epiphany
through a dozen printers and one-time if

651
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:08,200
I need to to gain access to something
you're gonna be busy runaround shutting

652
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:11,450
off printers the funny thing is they all
ran upstairs who stood around the

653
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:14,240
printer

654
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:20,229
laughing about this and they're trying
to pull the logs off the printer and I

655
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:25,220
am on the phone with the guys I just
heard all the logs off the printer there

656
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:29,430
was nothing good on there so it was kind
of funny and then add a printer down in

657
00:53:29,430 --> 00:53:32,529
the sock and we use eventually the
access we use the printer to sock and

658
00:53:32,530 --> 00:53:37,830
send messages type things we also one of
the other things is we also compromised

659
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:42,620
all machines in the sock eventually and
in turn on all the mic so we can listen

660
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:45,290
to everything they were talking about in
stock

661
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:48,670
while they were trying to track is down
but the big thing is is what we did was

662
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:54,400
at that point of oak crap what we do we
step back he fessed up

663
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:58,760
were are blue team guys teamed up with
him in the blue team guys we have

664
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:04,069
absolutely brilliant and went through a
full day or half day training on how to

665
00:54:04,069 --> 00:54:09,538
leverage all of their tools to track us
in those type of attacks where their

666
00:54:09,539 --> 00:54:15,849
pivot attacks so the goal you know in
this you know working with the customer

667
00:54:15,849 --> 00:54:19,650
like this we're gonna create a model
that we could turn into an exercise

668
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:24,589
training exercise specifically for them
unique for them that made a difference

669
00:54:24,589 --> 00:54:30,049
now their team if I go in and I do some
weird pivot I expect him the catch me

670
00:54:30,049 --> 00:54:33,839
and hoping to go back later this year
and so we're trying to figure out some

671
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:38,940
other evil things to do have some ideas
but I'm gonna say that for them they'll

672
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:44,059
probably watch this I give away all my
good things and the other thing is

673
00:54:44,059 --> 00:54:49,670
individual consultants build a
relationship I love a customer who know

674
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:55,220
the relationship with me I wish they
would all do it unfortunately some

675
00:54:55,220 --> 00:55:00,910
customers when I had a report I discuss
how ugly the baby is they never want to

676
00:55:00,910 --> 00:55:05,598
talk to me again which is sad but a
number of more excited by it and I've

677
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:09,190
had a number of customers were at work
with them for years that follow me

678
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:13,970
across other companies have several
those I had one company that I used to

679
00:55:13,970 --> 00:55:19,049
every year to a PCI they're very big
retail company and we would set down

680
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:24,500
normally the first few years it was
really fun I never just get a pin test

681
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:30,470
PCI PCI pin test and the year I came I'm
like I'm like wait a let's talk first

682
00:55:30,470 --> 00:55:34,899
you know you're like wow we start
talking about their environment what's

683
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:38,960
important to them when they're looking
for and then I targeted the stuff I was

684
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,740
doing and we've stopped every day and I
would brief out and I we use it as a

685
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:47,308
training opportunity and I would show
them do things new ideas to since I'm a

686
00:55:47,309 --> 00:55:51,329
researcher you know I typically share if
I have some cool stuff I'm doing I

687
00:55:51,329 --> 00:55:54,349
shared with my customers before the
stuff every street so they could

688
00:55:54,349 --> 00:55:56,030
actually protect itself

689
00:55:56,030 --> 00:55:59,440
and after that it got to a point where
they wouldn't let anyone else come in

690
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:03,830
there is available not available
Wednesday gonna be available and we

691
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:07,400
would come in and we would do it and we
would do this this whole process every

692
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:11,730
year as fun as a pinch of salt contestar
find it exciting when I have a

693
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:17,940
customer's excited about the stuff so we
can actually share that stuff so as we

694
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:20,700
complete here we can talk about real
quick

695
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:24,359
over the whole thing reaches we know
breaches are taken to long you're gonna

696
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:28,320
get breached ok so I'm not so concerned
if somebody breaks into your networks

697
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:32,940
that's often quite easy in this day of
phishing attacks and stuff like that

698
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:37,300
it's very hard to be a hundred percent
securing those environments here in

699
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:41,230
various things so you can get breach if
you have somebody that is hell-bent on

700
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:45,550
breaches ok they're gonna find a way to
pull that off the thing is we need to be

701
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:50,720
able to detect this so our detection are
our prevention or detection and our

702
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:55,700
response plans we need to think about
this in my opinion we need to grow those

703
00:56:55,700 --> 00:57:02,270
in the way we grow those last few things
I talked about his practice practice

704
00:57:02,270 --> 00:57:09,759
practice and actually test your farm
actually do tests so so real test so

705
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:13,210
that you people can see what an attack
looks like and they can understand how

706
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:17,340
to respond to it just like we did on the
submarine you know we practice at Whole

707
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:22,430
jammed up so that we didn't die in this
massive implosion you know what a way to

708
00:57:22,430 --> 00:57:27,140
go the same way with your organization
do you want your security to implode

709
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:32,859
because you didn't detect a breach for
six months or eight months no you don't

710
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:38,100
so it's the train train practice change
things up don't do the same thing over

711
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:42,299
and over people will get kind of you
know tunnel vision

712
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:47,480
create some of these brainstorming
programs get people involved try to form

713
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:52,790
that a passion for relationships with
the consulting firm Xavier used don't

714
00:57:52,790 --> 00:57:56,900
just hire somebody to do a B or C take
your report don't go away

715
00:57:56,900 --> 00:58:02,190
create a relationship that's where the
most values you come from and of course

716
00:58:02,190 --> 00:58:04,920
when you encounter IT consulting that
has a passion

717
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:08,700
is working with you is excited about
what he's doing he wants to help you

718
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:13,490
improve take advantage of that create a
partnership with him to my office still

719
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:19,890
get phone calls from companies that I've
done work for years back they don't try

720
00:58:19,890 --> 00:58:24,740
to consume my time they know times money
but they often congo hey darryl what do

721
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:29,169
you think of this it's a 5 10 min and
answer I love this I love to hear from

722
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:34,810
past companies I work for that I've felt
like I've made a difference so that's

723
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:39,650
something to think about when you're
engaging consultants and no pin testers

724
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:40,860
and stuff like that

725
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:44,290
almost so I guess we are out of time any
questions

726
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:49,180
yes sir

727
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:17,250
expectations for banks to be breached
like I said with everyone else and yeah

728
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:21,810
I do think it's a high probability I've
done assessments probably at it maybe a

729
00:59:21,810 --> 00:59:28,170
dozen banks and half of them had some
fairly solid security making it very

730
00:59:28,170 --> 00:59:31,380
difficult for me to attack them from the
outside

731
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:36,070
had no exposure to the outside only
certain employees had email she knows

732
00:59:36,070 --> 00:59:41,590
really restricted and they had very good
segmentation so you they may have enough

733
00:59:41,590 --> 00:59:46,300
security that they detect prevent these
type of things but my expectations is

734
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:50,750
yes you're going to get you the chances
of getting breached her there if you're

735
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:55,890
a value target they're gonna try to do
it so your security may be great but

736
00:59:55,890 --> 00:59:59,379
somewhere along the Rhine if you drop
the ball once they're gonna be in the

737
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:03,880
door so we need to assume that they're
going to be in the door and work on the

738
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:06,140
other stuff so we can detect

739
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:11,029
Prevention's gonna stop you want to be
able to detect them so if you take all

740
01:00:11,029 --> 01:00:15,349
these breaches you take the detection
time frame down let's say eight months

741
01:00:15,349 --> 01:00:21,440
you take it down to a week chances are
they wouldn't lost data and that's what

742
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:24,019
I'm saying any other questions

743
01:00:24,019 --> 01:00:26,589
well thank you very much I enjoyed it
