1
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:28,278
perfect

2
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,420
good morning everyone

3
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:49,330
managed service and I realize the last
session preventing you lunch so I'll try

4
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:54,960
and make it quick so yes my name's
Gervais and a little background on

5
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,690
myself actually came from the mobile
security side I used to work at Citrix

6
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:04,839
for a couple years in the mobile device
management mobile application space and

7
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:10,630
at the cloud got really that's where I
am currently on the product marketing

8
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:16,399
and so today I mean talking about lots
charity and kind of the tradeoffs

9
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:24,310
between and not needing tradeoffs a
dream that and an actual place and so

10
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:29,990
it's set up the contacts in terms of the
problems and kind of risks associated

11
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:35,429
with the cloud and then move on to the
actual kind of requirement that we at

12
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:40,020
netscape like to come out in terms of
best practices for cloud security to

13
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:45,720
enable your workforce while still
keeping their privacy intact so let's

14
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,179
get started so

15
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:56,490
there around 10,000 or more enterprise
cloud up and the number is rapidly

16
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,589
growing and in fact I dot scope we
actually have a research team devoted

17
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:05,470
entirely to cut outs and our number
right now is around 22,000 in our

18
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:11,319
database that we track for the clout and
so all these include not only you know

19
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:18,208
your typical office 365 productivity
suites that also include box where r

20
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:23,850
cells or so these are out that you and
your employees use every single day

21
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,319
get their job done

22
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:35,238
and so what's the problem and so the
problem is 90% of these apps and more

23
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:41,870
are not enterprise ready so what we do
is we actually going customers and the

24
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:46,000
first step that we deal with our
customers is find out what these outs

25
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,989
what they're actually using what kind of
hot out there using and accessing and

26
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:56,799
when we walk into large organization
that will usually ask ok so how do you

27
00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:02,489
think your players are using and the
answer usually is around 40 to 50 so

28
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:08,290
they'll talk about cells or if that's
what I'm prepared for the employees 365

29
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:14,500
Google Apps for work they'll talk about
Marketo and so in their mind I'll be

30
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,579
like ok so we have these apps that we've
already sanctioned and then I guess

31
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:22,209
there might be a couple more that I'm
missing and say okay so maybe forty to

32
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:28,049
fifty ass but when we actually go in and
do the discovery process to kind of find

33
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:32,079
all that occasion that are being use the
average number of apps that will come up

34
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:37,650
with is over 900 actual asking used by
employees and so subtract that from

35
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:42,019
forty to fifty you have all the shadow I
T outs that I T doesn't actually know

36
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:47,979
employees are using and accessing and
kind of sending sensitive data sensitive

37
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:54,159
corporate information into and so I
pretty much ninety percent and for even

38
00:03:54,159 --> 00:04:00,108
larger organizations that are global
400,000 were employees are a lot of time

39
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:04,139
counting go into the thousands so we
actually have one that actually went

40
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:12,040
over 2,000 house in the company he was
completely unaware of that and so with

41
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,870
these ads because I said earlier that we
try these out some kind of determination

42
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,989
of the security capabilities excited
because we've noticed that 90% of these

43
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:24,849
outs are not enterprise right and what
that they might not encrypt data at rest

44
00:04:24,849 --> 00:04:28,780
during transit they might not have the
necessary access controls in place they

45
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:33,549
don't have the data center
certifications except through Friday

46
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:36,920
parameters you can determine that
they're not actually enterprise ready

47
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:42,000
and so when I find that at least the
ones for the CSO the chief information

48
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,480
security officer that leads to problems
for the CIO and CFO where there a lot of

49
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,460
security concerns at risk when a lot of
your business data is stored within

50
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:56,810
these at use and shared with these ads
you get a lot of risks when that's

51
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:07,030
involved and so there's actually a lot
of people so I actually get it and so

52
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:13,080
around 10% of what we call sanction out
so your box for sanction cloud storage

53
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:19,710
box work day courier expense out those
are the ones that I can actually put

54
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:24,469
years for the user and we call those
sanctions and those are the apps that

55
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:28,580
went through all the ordering process do
you like doing your due diligence on a

56
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:33,609
diner vendor insurance and major those
outs are secure access controls in place

57
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:39,240
and they have all you everything that
you want including at LA's accept our 7

58
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:45,660
and then the rest of the apps are
obviously and so we like to say our

59
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:50,400
business glad and so these include lines
of business or specific teams like your

60
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:56,250
marketing team like your sales and
they'll be using things like Marketo

61
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:00,080
where they kind of just get it
themselves or to use for the business

62
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:07,370
unit GoToMeeting obvious out separation
by themselves from a chimney use and

63
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:13,560
finally the last 20 percent our User let
us and this includes Twitter this

64
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,010
includes linked and this includes
zippyshare the story doubts that you

65
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,719
never heard of the poor but you know
your employees bring into the

66
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,200
organization they're used to using it
and use it to remain productive

67
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:32,870
and so you can see versus ninety percent
that you don't really know or have

68
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:37,310
control over and that you didn't rupture
is going to be a really big problem in

69
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:44,770
terms of business risks and the center
of operations store but then that so

70
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:50,400
what does the rest care obviously this
isn't the end of the world because you

71
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,630
want your employees stay productive
while maintaining security and so that's

72
00:06:55,630 --> 00:07:01,909
what we did we kinda divide the risks or
separate factors and so the person wine

73
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:06,920
are the apps with more than 900 outs
being used and a typical organization

74
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:12,360
you have no control over whether those
outsourced here whether their enterprise

75
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,630
ready whether they actually have the
appropriate controls that you want and

76
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:22,130
so they may not crypt at rest data at
rest they may not operate kind of

77
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:26,760
activities so you can see who is access
access editing what

78
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:34,169
number two is the user a lot of times
it's not even not even in malicious

79
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:39,270
because I don't know how many of you do
that so we're all lazy rate and so a lot

80
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:44,378
of times especially if you use them
again across all your business out even

81
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:49,389
for your personal lines and so when
whenever there's a hat or there's a data

82
00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:54,370
breach at one of these people have your
credentials and when you get across

83
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:58,599
business outside since really big risk
because you're reusing they are already

84
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:06,650
out there are known to dangerous the
next one of the activity I mean

85
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:09,830
everybody works with third-party vendors
everybody works throughout the company

86
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:15,508
and so they you use cloud storage in
sync out light sensitive information

87
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:20,840
into them and you share it and that's a
really easy activity to do and you share

88
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,919
and sometimes you just kind of shared
the link and you don't even remember and

89
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:28,799
so the link be public to everyone all
this information is out there in the

90
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,680
cloud RIT and and also about the NAM
waste which has that to the compromise

91
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:40,859
credentials what happens when you do you
have a compromise that you're using and

92
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:48,790
so so how do you identify when someone
walking into Salesforce from germany as

93
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:52,579
well as from or something like that how
do I do I do you identify these

94
00:08:52,579 --> 00:08:55,359
anomalies and prevent them from
happening

95
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:01,310
finally there's kind of the data from
our own research are hundreds of

96
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:04,479
customers who start miles in the cloud

97
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,370
whether they be H R out cloud storage
after he files in the cloud constitute a

98
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:18,829
policy violation and so is the mark of
our customers have a lappy policies and

99
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:21,829
so if you're trying to prevent protected
health information

100
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:30,240
thi aur PII or PC idea the cloud we
detect violations and we can see that

101
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:36,149
people are uploading these files and 22%
of these files are shared publicly and

102
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:40,610
so these are public links that have not
been restricted which presents an even

103
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:45,399
greater it and so when you have all
these things acting together it's kind

104
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:51,880
of like a perfect storm right at the end
user using an insecure at Joel's

105
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:56,640
downloading uploading sensitive
information all over the place

106
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:06,120
what do you do what we call this kind of
the catch 22 cloud where you do once the

107
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,399
user to be able to use all the apps that
they want to use and so that they can

108
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:17,279
remain productive but you also need for
compliance reasons for security reasons

109
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:24,970
you secure that data whether it's KHI di
i source code and so that's the

110
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:31,310
catch-twenty two between here and that's
what we like to say allows the new block

111
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:38,529
because at the end of the day you don't
know what sites are doubts are appearing

112
00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:41,790
every single time every single day
you're not going to be able to keep

113
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:45,310
track of all the plot out so you can't
block everything and we do you block

114
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:48,890
something employees are just gonna get
it but are you gonna try and find a way

115
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:53,660
around it they're going to use their
gonna go up promises mobile device to

116
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:58,410
try and get access to remain productive
and in the end even if you do try and

117
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:01,430
block as many as possible you gonna
create exceptions

118
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:06,989
executives want to use Twitter or some
random out really like

119
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,740
and so they're gonna make you do that
and different business groups are gonna

120
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,019
come to you and and say why don't have
access

121
00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:19,139
and this presents a problem especially
when you're dealing with third-party

122
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:26,709
vendors even typical conserve our when I
interact my bank for a mortgage I tried

123
00:11:26,709 --> 00:11:30,799
to send my piles and a box link to them
and they come back to me and they're

124
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:36,160
like we can't use box because it
provided by I T so what do you do you're

125
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,079
actually blocking business from
happening

126
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:44,459
your employees are not productive and so
there's a fine line to walk between you

127
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:54,349
and so are not those outside the walker
risky activities walking up the granular

128
00:11:54,350 --> 00:12:00,449
level where you have a user trying to
upload thi into Dropbox

129
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:08,100
you prevent that action happening and
actually send a message actually we have

130
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,449
standardized on box she might want to
use that it's that and that way when

131
00:12:12,449 --> 00:12:16,209
they're operating with maybe like a
design resource or an external vendor

132
00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:19,670
uses Dropbox they can still download
those files they can still collaborate

133
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:32,240
with them and so how does private a lot
of when people are accessing and using

134
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:42,029
cloud that we try to go by this privacy
by design framework and so this list

135
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:50,129
created by doctor kevorkian was actually
the Privacy Commissioner Ontario and

136
00:12:50,129 --> 00:12:53,179
tanned up the former Privacy
Commissioner and she actually has

137
00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:57,769
privacy by design framework that she
worked out we also have a white paper in

138
00:12:57,769 --> 00:13:01,059
98 but not going to bore you with the
details but

139
00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:06,499
you can read the major tenet here on the
slide and what I want to kind of

140
00:13:06,499 --> 00:13:13,839
emphasized at a meeting is that privacy
by design framework emphasizes focuses

141
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:19,709
on in putting privacy at the very
beginning and throughout all your I T

142
00:13:19,709 --> 00:13:25,409
processes and alrighty solutions so when
you get implemented process or a

143
00:13:25,409 --> 00:13:32,949
security solution you have in mind so
that you keep your users patsies intact

144
00:13:32,949 --> 00:13:34,579
and

145
00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:38,628
the second that's really important that
I like and the visibility and

146
00:13:38,629 --> 00:13:43,769
transparency part of it and that's
keeping your users informed of all your

147
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:48,819
skinny policies all be processes that
you put in place and all the

148
00:13:48,819 --> 00:13:52,889
documentation that you might put in
place with regard still specifically for

149
00:13:52,889 --> 00:13:56,980
this stock would use but this kind of
applies to everything by you actually

150
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:01,860
right and it's all about kind of
coaching the user and letting them just

151
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:06,850
by their actions and informing them of
your policy so back to the early example

152
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:11,420
of when I said you know you can put a
message out saying don't use Dropbox

153
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:17,238
box.net sanction that we use your kind
of maintaining the transparency and so

154
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:20,660
that user will have a better user
experience and watch the understand

155
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:25,569
what's going on and kind of the security
processes and security solutions that

156
00:14:25,569 --> 00:14:33,449
are being put in place for just because
he's just kind of communicated to being

157
00:14:33,449 --> 00:14:40,449
like oh they go to random financial and
they're immediately blocks and they have

158
00:14:40,449 --> 00:14:49,679
no idea why and that that when they come
back here and so now I'm

159
00:14:53,339 --> 00:15:00,339
apartments mitigating risk and all the
while maintaining privacy and so

160
00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:04,679
remember their kind of tenants but we
just went out with that in mind we're

161
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:09,970
gonna kind of going to the requirements
what we recommend as best practices to

162
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:18,059
kick off your cloud security processes
and initiatives organization so

163
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:19,560
requirement wine

164
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:27,979
fighting readiness when I go into a
customer one of the first things that we

165
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:34,640
do is doing a valuation risk assessment
risk assessment on what kind of apps are

166
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:39,000
actually running in your environment as
i said for a lot of your team's your

167
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,779
security teams are gonna know which apps
are being used and access and they're

168
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:50,480
not gonna know how safe there and so the
first step is finding all those outside

169
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,720
looking at who's using what you said
that users how many people are using

170
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:01,210
those at and seeing the actual
enterprise readiness of those are those

171
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:07,730
apps are those apps a one stop flight
did they have the datacenter

172
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:14,620
certifications that's necessary to those
access controls do they have audit

173
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:20,250
activity trails what do you do with
those outside what information does

174
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:26,960
those abs are used users so that's the
first requirement and kind of the

175
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,190
privacy by keeping in mind

176
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:35,440
user privacy is the bypass like the
class and this includes not this

177
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:42,089
includes apps that users can bring an
end are using individual a for personal

178
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:45,240
purposes or everything out so you know

179
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:49,839
you can have different versions a box
that says because you're going to have a

180
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:54,630
personal box instance that a user might
using just to send documents while at

181
00:16:54,630 --> 00:17:00,330
work to someone else and then you're
gonna have your corporate version up for

182
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:05,410
Dropbox and by differentiating between
the two and actually only focusing in on

183
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:10,980
the action what you can maintain the
user privacy and make sure that you know

184
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:16,560
you're not looking at the traffic that
you don't really need to anyways and you

185
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,659
don't kind of a ban on the privacy of
your employees

186
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,850
requirement to is

187
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:32,760
else and so as you can see but couldn't
have been compromised by an accounting

188
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:38,330
so you get all this user information
from the card out and so when you're

189
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:42,490
doing this discovery process actually
find all that plus their enterprise

190
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:47,630
readiness in your environment you find
out what people are doing with that are

191
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:51,870
they uploading thi data into this
business intelligence at are they

192
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:57,800
downloading of AHAR information from
this hrs are they

193
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:02,510
sharing it with external people are in a
sharing data or sensitive data with

194
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:06,180
external people that they aren't
supposed to be doing all these details

195
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:10,980
need to be under state so that you can
kind of crap all your I T processes and

196
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:15,950
policies around so when you realize that
are like a lot of people are accessing

197
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:24,030
office 365 webmail phone you can kind of
great policies based off of that so one

198
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:29,379
example of that would be calm say
someone's you see a lot of mobile you

199
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:37,140
say well you can do is actually lock it
down cuz you don't want people you maybe

200
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:40,560
there's a policy in place that you don't
want people accessing sensitive

201
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:45,120
corporate information source code of
site or downloading that from Gmail onto

202
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:50,370
their personal devices so what you can
do is actually limit access to your

203
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:55,959
mobile device the pair accessing the
prime minister now if it's not a

204
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:01,840
corporate managed device then we can
actually do and just lock it down and

205
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:07,020
maybe just give them access to Outlook
Web version but not let them do any

206
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,460
download activities onto the device so
that they can still you know look at

207
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,730
their emails etc

208
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:15,330
the can't do anything else about it
whereas there on promises are using a

209
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:20,210
car protection device that's corporate
issued they can have full access to that

210
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,539
location

211
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:27,559
and so what do you understand that you
can find a cracker policies in terms

212
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:34,950
that are customized to your organization
and in terms of your knees and so the

213
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:37,170
privacy best practice

214
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:44,340
the office and do it and so this applies
even on the admin side you don't

215
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:51,510
necessarily need to know what who is
doing the whites to data a lot of times

216
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:55,490
that's kind of their business right and
so but you just need to know even

217
00:19:55,490 --> 00:20:01,340
understand the usage activity and unless
there's like a major security in

218
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:06,280
incident or a major security breach but
then you just go back into the logs to

219
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:11,570
find out who specifically did you cannot
escape their personal details so that

220
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:25,020
everything remains private so 43 its you
search and this kind of goes back to

221
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:33,190
what I was saying earlier about how is
the new and so this one here is making

222
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:40,790
sure that you're kind of governing and
access with a surgical precision and so

223
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:48,000
and so what you do it as I said before a
case about the Mobile Access Outlook you

224
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,350
can make sure that using specific
parameters based on Dubai or maybe for

225
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:59,110
SOX compliance you wanna see you in a
track who's auditing and changing and

226
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:01,850
deleting data so when you do that

227
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:06,389
you can actually play sports is to say
okay maybe only the finance team can

228
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:11,260
access this one app to add information
because nobody else should be able to

229
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:15,629
and so by placing those kind of surgery

230
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:20,580
surgically precise and granular policies
you make sure that you're not hitting

231
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:26,780
any activity that helps boys remain
productive while still kind of texting

232
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:30,350
your sensitive information and so this
contextual data talking about can be

233
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:37,850
device can be user identity in terms of
user group Department email etc as well

234
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:55,658
as kind of location and network location
and so the pipes and so the example a

235
00:21:55,659 --> 00:22:00,400
hot here at differentiating between the
opposite says you don't do anything if

236
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:06,900
it's personal and since Dropbox but
corporate incense Dropbox

237
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:12,490
you can do is actually SAT parties on
that and so and this 1 I'm setting a

238
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:18,070
policy I P idea and operating and
preventing that from being done and so

239
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:24,899
that way you don't have to do anything
with in terms of the traffic says and so

240
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:36,350
then placed over their proxy number for
cable right side this is a big way

241
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:40,200
one example I care for this used to be

242
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,730
office 365 actually where if you had
admin privileges for one person does

243
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:49,830
universal global so they'd have admin
access email that have admin access to

244
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:56,149
SharePoint excited excited excited they
actually fix this recently but for our

245
00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:04,830
example this applies to all doubts
because a lot of that and so you're not

246
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:08,800
gonna be able to have kind of the right
side switches are not going to happen

247
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:13,340
silos that you need for a day and this
is especially important for people and

248
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:17,240
kind of financial services and she
actually at Uganda kind of a Sox audit

249
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:22,010
whether its formal or informal hearing
problem right there gonna have the

250
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:24,850
problem controlling unfettered access

251
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:31,010
going out went to track you actually
have access to the financial data

252
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:35,300
especially if it lives in your car
doubts that used for reporting for

253
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:38,639
finance finance and accounting upsets
you want to be able to track those

254
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,380
people and you want to be able to see
when they actually get something to eat

255
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:46,170
something change something when they
access the record because this is all

256
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:50,380
koko's in the complaint side of things
especially when you want to keep this

257
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:55,890
information to third-party auditors and
so this is doing it across its not just

258
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:58,970
say my example idk 365

259
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:17,519
and so by finding data type in an hour
and then for this white it's all about

260
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:21,970
what you you have section so our people

261
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:27,549
uploading PII bhi PCI data source code
data into the cloud when you're not

262
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:32,109
supposed to this also applies back to
support your company and what policies

263
00:24:32,109 --> 00:24:35,649
that you have surrounding sensitive data
and the corporate information that

264
00:24:35,649 --> 00:24:41,668
people are using so being able to act
like 1000 someone is uploading social

265
00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:45,239
security numbers they're not actually
allowed to do that

266
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:49,450
making sure that policies are set in
place to prevent this from happening or

267
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:58,679
to remediate it immediately and this
also applies to data already dry one

268
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:01,020
drive box Dropbox etc

269
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:04,530
you want to be able to find information
if it's already uploaded and they're

270
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:08,050
finding and actually protect it so this
includes

271
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:11,500
encrypt the information on with your own
keys

272
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:16,930
yes question okay to encrypt this
information with your own keys do you

273
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:22,800
want to put it on hold to make sure that
information is appropriate and that can

274
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,980
stand the cloud and visibility

275
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:31,440
ok so this is social that this is so
scary numbers in the cloud is it being

276
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,430
shared and be able to actually restrict
the shame because you'll actually be

277
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:38,800
surprised by the number of people who
actually upload this kind of information

278
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:49,980
that clarence haven't publicly available
for people take a question yet so this

279
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:53,940
obviously back to what to do so

280
00:25:54,570 --> 00:26:00,740
their solutions where you can actually
tax documents and target email saying

281
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:05,970
it's confidential super competent
charges public or when if you're talking

282
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:10,420
about how to identify this data it
depends on kind of the implementation so

283
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:16,680
this for us to order a proxy you can
actually identify when someone is

284
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:21,240
actually loading the data in real time
and it goes through our cloud service to

285
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,900
identify the data and make sure that ok
so this is NPR

286
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:30,630
this is PRI let's take action and with
that data stored in cloud out sorry

287
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:35,940
that's here a package and so a lot of
the sanction apps like Microsoft Office

288
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:43,390
365 for enterprise ready ones have
opened have expertise third-party

289
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:48,240
vendors to use tracks they use their
products to identify this data and

290
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,240
perform actions

291
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:55,040
yet

292
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:59,750
yeah for unsanctioned provocations would
be for proxy

293
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:10,110
and obviously you're not gonna catch up
it's just using proxies and on promises

294
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:13,928
so in the end it depends on how much
coverage you want and what you use cases

295
00:27:13,929 --> 00:27:19,289
but you're also going to roll out class
so agents for kind of the mobile devices

296
00:27:19,289 --> 00:27:33,309
for what people actually I'm out using
devices that says okay so I'm 64 spots

297
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:40,720
especially for kind of multinational
firms global organizations with a lot of

298
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,520
people this is going to be really
important in this kind of goes back to

299
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,600
the contextual and granular policies
part of things

300
00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:52,658
each region each area countries it's
gonna a different set of rules

301
00:27:52,659 --> 00:27:58,470
compliance regimens excited right elbow
I'd buy it so making sure that you can

302
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:03,369
actually take each of your policies her
regen and other documentation this part

303
00:28:03,369 --> 00:28:09,340
is really important one of the big
example that I guess this is tied into

304
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:14,350
privacy which is Europe right now the
general data protection regulation the

305
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:20,609
GDP are was just recently passed and so
for those of us who have a presence and

306
00:28:20,609 --> 00:28:25,379
that's all about data privacy and
personal data of its citizens and that's

307
00:28:25,379 --> 00:28:26,609
going to be a really big

308
00:28:26,609 --> 00:28:31,369
whatever compliance regime and security
policies are you have in place their

309
00:28:31,369 --> 00:28:37,459
rules are a lot stricter than those and
the USA and so you're going to have to

310
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:40,609
do things like ok ignore the traffic
problem

311
00:28:40,609 --> 00:28:47,559
personal to personal doubts and only do
corporate wines make sure you encrypt

312
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:52,119
the data so that you're protecting the
user and make sure you kind of sign that

313
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:56,859
we are doing your vendor train sign
those agreements with about benders and

314
00:28:56,859 --> 00:29:01,720
how those contracts in place so that you
know what they're using in terms of

315
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:07,479
employees data how they're using it and
it's and it's necessary because one of

316
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:12,889
the big girls is obviously necessary for
you to take the personal data vendors to

317
00:29:12,889 --> 00:29:18,389
take the person he said a sense and so
this is going to be a really big part of

318
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:24,090
it and besides that it's kind of just
protecting and so being able to identify

319
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:28,059
source and destination destination
country is going to be a really big deal

320
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:38,940
when you're dealing with kind of global
security policies alright parliament

321
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:46,480
garments of it as users and this goes
back to the privacy by design principles

322
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,990
of openness and transparency and making
sure your users know so allow them when

323
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:55,100
they're doing an action lock it or you
have the security in place to prevent

324
00:29:55,100 --> 00:30:02,429
that from happening he must justify
allow them to justify themselves send

325
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:07,060
them a custom message being like okay so
you're uploading something to this

326
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:15,460
application but actually the preferred
operation of this separate location and

327
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:18,190
so it's kind of just letting them know
what's going on

328
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:22,520
keeping them today and kind of keeping
the transparency and openness so that

329
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:27,530
you know they're involved in the
security policies and actually gained

330
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:34,760
their accepted and they understand
what's happening so kind of to review

331
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:38,730
the seven different things that I want
to finding out the hard apps

332
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:46,370
understanding that you say I'm granular
policies so that you know it applies the

333
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:52,330
Vickrey gender-specific heart attacks as
well as enforcing the policies by the

334
00:30:52,330 --> 00:31:01,679
destination and source country and
finally coach the users and so that's my

335
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,680
presentation like take any questions

336
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:24,280
yeah so that kind of the user end of the
process the very beginning that I look

337
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:29,450
at how many people are using it and make
your decisions based up a trade you can

338
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:33,700
see them enterprise readiness and then
see how many users are using a lot of

339
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:39,640
times we had our customers and that's
where they're kind of using US under

340
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:45,190
insurance so how are using outs in this
category which apps are they using which

341
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:49,770
are the most popular and then you can
decide on line sign agreement that's

342
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:53,500
most are you decide that you know the
most number of people are using is most

343
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,710
enterprise ready

344
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:58,970
and then we can do as I was saying at
the coach them to it and so they're

345
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:04,460
using a different you can actually when
the access log in or something you can

346
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:09,929
actually redirect them coaching message
so that they know and this kind of ties

347
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:13,140
into a lot of your security process in
place anyways with your cloud apps

348
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:17,840
making sure you know your users in
communicating to them making sure your

349
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,620
users know which apps to use in which
they had maybe they might not want to

350
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:29,149
use and a lot of this can be also have
single sign-on excited offering them

351
00:32:29,149 --> 00:32:37,100
that list of what else
