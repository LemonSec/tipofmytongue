1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,069
accuracy and I'm gonna be preserving
doesn't mean we're winning or every year

2
00:00:07,069 --> 00:00:13,670
for the last option this is the last
session but whatever hopefully get into

3
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:20,650
in this one really is what are we doing
about her life and we saw it however you

4
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:25,869
see here is individually with their own
companies we made these many are

5
00:00:25,869 --> 00:00:30,369
individual battles we might be securing
our organizations appropriately would

6
00:00:30,369 --> 00:00:36,850
like to join a good job overall what I'd
like us to look at is is security as an

7
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:42,940
industry security and all of the
functional together and ask ourselves as

8
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:49,050
a whole are we winning the battle are we
doing the right things says there are we

9
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:55,250
are doing the best job we can for our
conference so far we get started here

10
00:00:55,250 --> 00:01:03,050
thanks for waiting about 905 Christmas
lights and and then really get into it

11
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:09,298
we all thought their job and doing all
he had to do that I was just ok fine

12
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:16,549
work on the next presentations are some
of the stuff that like throwing up and

13
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:23,250
having spent a lot of time I really
don't have the right to convince you

14
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,890
that were trouble right

15
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:30,000
one of the things I like to do during my
presentation is is put up the song

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,550
halfback questions sometimes you have
questions during the event sometimes

17
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:38,979
your questions after you got certain
country are bankers folks back at the

18
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:44,610
office I believe hopefully looking at it
and no response and throughout the day

19
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:48,650
I'll check it out not respond as I can
hopefully we'll get maybe we can

20
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,170
continue this conversation around this
presentation if you find it interesting

21
00:01:52,170 --> 00:02:03,140
this one ok so when we get him to
talking about some of the solutions I

22
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,470
can almost guarantee you that the small
talk to you about today are not to

23
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:14,290
traditional hopefully they are certainly
not as the standards are not talking

24
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:20,090
about ideas tools and how to configure
those things to say about high-level

25
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,000
looking at the big picture

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,360
asking you questions hopefully asking
what is what is this really mean and

27
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:41,299
what are you talking about I wrote this
time for such his State of Union today

28
00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:48,870
we're looking at the second part is
ideas and such for improvements give you

29
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:54,360
some of my perhaps you could be
something course look at some tools if

30
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:00,000
you have ideas for improvements and
sometimes subs generally don't take home

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,280
a bottle so what can we do

32
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,510
sixes there are some things happening
out there with her friends

33
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:23,510
ransomware is is rampant as you know

34
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:34,250
and one of the things that many
interesting new trend through 2015

35
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:42,709
number of disruptive attacks I think we
all know that bridges are important for

36
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:47,430
reaches you know grab the attention of
the media for more today we're looking

37
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:51,610
at a tax or more disruptive than
anything go out there there may be close

38
00:03:51,610 --> 00:04:02,890
to disrupt our lives of those rotors CSO
magazine 736 million records expose and

39
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,970
started and based on what we're hearing
today

40
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,970
you know it's gonna be far surpassed 260

41
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:16,120
Internal Revenue Service on their
problems with protecting records so it's

42
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:21,739
just not citizens should have
corporations governments wow so this

43
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:29,620
this this phenomenon data problems and
information security problems really

44
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:39,260
permeates every facet you know what's in
the world series HP recently released

45
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:45,710
some statistics about stadium operations
security and when they realize in this

46
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:46,620
business

47
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:51,820
these research a five percent of the
organization's ourselves to the random

48
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:58,150
word for word even meeting the minimum
and some of the things that they found

49
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:07,719
were problems with documentation finance
meeting more business-oriented securing

50
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:13,690
metrics don't exist in many a few
organizations education is woefully

51
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:17,139
lacking that only at the user level but
is this

52
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:23,249
and then finally fully utilize
technology assets meaning they saw a lot

53
00:05:23,249 --> 00:05:29,849
of products and maybe going up on that
one model because that's all you have

54
00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:41,270
time they recommend him for many times
we get the most benefit usually and then

55
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:47,659
finally to steering report DNA regions
reported chaos whole buncha start the

56
00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:53,139
day right commander of the day forecasts
to 2016 so really this information to

57
00:05:53,139 --> 00:06:05,509
the same page were alright ransom
problems and what we can do so here is

58
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:15,449
what I really want to spend them on my
knees and contest for purpose I believe

59
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:19,889
that most of us again I i cant im
crunchers visual organizations your

60
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:25,800
problem with valid as the war goes I
think most of us need changes in our

61
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:32,389
corporate culture in order to ensure
that we can win the war or what do I

62
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:33,279
mean by that

63
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:40,699
it's really taking some of these four
points here that I listed out and if any

64
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:46,770
of you are familiar with some of the
resiliency frameworks out there you'll

65
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:51,430
see that a lot of these these points
here near where you might find a

66
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:56,839
resilience ukraine more resiliency
process now is no longer appropriate

67
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:02,939
earlier stand outside and say hey I
don't know if it's not my job don't show

68
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:05,420
anything I want to look at

69
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:09,840
and I don't say anything about their
about something you know we're good and

70
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,020
that really can't happen so we're gonna
go down these points in a little bit

71
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:18,049
more detail but we're going to talk
about understanding and embracing your

72
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:22,750
role whatever their own lives in the
organization and served building a

73
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:27,440
business or where security culture and
that shows a security culture business

74
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:34,440
where there's a difference being and for
more and standard for setting direction

75
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:42,040
with your security program coherence
between your program and organizational

76
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:51,470
goals and objectives developing your
organization of you who have insurance

77
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:58,100
so those are the cats up to we're going
to talk about your security program so

78
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:06,500
ideas and concepts heard from what we
understand and embrace your role is

79
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,600
really this really goes back to
understand what your responsibilities

80
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:17,300
are organization what your current job
description is I know it's basic you

81
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:26,750
know you really know your role is your
responsibility to do in order to succeed

82
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:33,860
and whether and when you're being asked
to do was your business due to succeed

83
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:52,360
that are in stable received and who are
stable no reverse takeovers are you in

84
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,790
your role as a security professionals
dealing with different people

85
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:09,650
this all has an impact really high
seating position

86
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:37,610
homes in your organization you have
influence over them having a future role

87
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:41,650
they may have a whole different thing
you know what you're responsible for

88
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:48,740
FaceTime you know it's not to really go
out and tell people that part of your

89
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:56,280
role is to really understand so that you
can be successful and I think that's one

90
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:01,540
of the things in the security
environments for profession today is

91
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:07,959
understanding why most of us in there
probably put controls and stop him from

92
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:12,500
doing things for the end of the day you
know I would challenge you to say that's

93
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:22,970
probably 90% more as a security
professional and your role is to manage

94
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:30,110
risk as well as enabling organizations
to succeed so this now our saying no its

95
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:32,860
most of the time saying yes and helping
people

96
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:42,350
yes happen so he can sell for as a whole
of you just referring to him

97
00:10:49,920 --> 00:11:01,060
we have no business culture is I've been
organizations as a consultant I had

98
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:09,829
asked where you live from me in the
program and I've asked directors of ASIO

99
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:18,819
your business do aside for me to say
something that was about how do they

100
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,820
measure their success

101
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:32,889
you know that's that's not yourself how
to succeed thats not setting yourself up

102
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:33,940
for your business

103
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:40,449
really understanding what your business
needs and building security into their

104
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:46,359
business culture we talked about knowing
where your customers are various

105
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:52,470
secondary stable I think that's very
important to know are relying on

106
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:59,130
information or for solutions and how you
can provide that information and

107
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:05,250
solutions to those individuals so they
see if you're able to succeed Gary will

108
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:11,029
succeed in their job chances are the
organization has a chance to see what

109
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:20,510
other state education that's a big part
I think and what most security

110
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:32,420
professionals need to do this because
those are two day rose throughout the

111
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:36,550
organization had probably most of the
organization who found the whole

112
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:40,660
organization and the actinide educate
people at different levels of your

113
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:51,110
physician especially what those
different levels need to know what your

114
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:59,840
shirt influence how many people do you
thing to do so

115
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:12,680
sometimes miss you no threat of fire in
a razor honest but your true test of

116
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:20,410
influence is to be able to influence
those folks to do what you do what you

117
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:23,760
think is in the best interests

118
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:35,530
think about your organizations today
what is your spirit I don't think that

119
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:49,780
was probably one of the things that you
start work so this is where security

120
00:13:49,780 --> 00:14:04,220
officer informed and stay informed so we
have to be important right we have to

121
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:11,930
know what's going on today especially
the securities industry is going on tax

122
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:22,300
and you have a stable state as you know
I'm leaving your reservation changes on

123
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:28,339
a daily basis so you're juggling
challenge to stay informed about your

124
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:35,370
own home responsibilities of your own
job you know what you have to from

125
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:40,200
security suggest a born there but you
also sustained forms larger organization

126
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:49,990
personalization don't know where they're
going to judges as you understand your

127
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:59,270
overall strategy not be about step
something that we use as far as security

128
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:08,540
and I love you wear your pants low entry
level

129
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:16,430
the CISO you have to understand really
strategy position yet to know if your

130
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:20,699
organization values and especially
security professionals we have to know

131
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:29,860
where r Davis is no one who has access
to the day

132
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:36,960
single points of failure anticipated
evaluate security trends were talking

133
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:41,730
about that song about existing risk
framework so I think that's important

134
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:46,520
defense fundamentally a security force
we talked about our role is to identify

135
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:51,350
and manage risk how do we do that there
are so many groups frameworks out there

136
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,750
so many way to find ways to do it

137
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:58,970
challenge anybody to see what's right
when I don't think there is one right

138
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:07,410
way wrong what the Jewish organizations
and being how we are drawing of an

139
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:16,740
existing borrowers to build your debt
really Fisher organization meeting in

140
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:20,410
four min staying in for something that's
come over the last few years as

141
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:25,740
understanding what your suppliers are
you have such an impact the success of

142
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:32,320
your organization go through this is cam
points well as from security breaches of

143
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:37,250
happened and all the problems we've
heard in the news lately where many of

144
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:42,540
those generally or sometimes most of the
time coming from your third party

145
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:50,060
suppliers you have your your controls
increased slightly busy your suppliers

146
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:57,099
have those controls and then finally
learning some lessons differently we

147
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:03,360
need something happens every time to fix
it and move on to the next fire on Xfire

148
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,880
and think it's very important as a
continuous improvement process so who

149
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,720
really review the lessons that we
learned review

150
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:18,150
failures experience throughout the year
and really make sure that there was some

151
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:32,789
forms and state is setting direction and
security professionals I think we have a

152
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:41,510
responsibility now gathering on an
interim position you've got people who

153
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:44,510
collect the data yesterday

154
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:54,600
spring in controls to make sure that
only those people that need today both

155
00:17:54,600 --> 00:18:00,260
internally and externally organization
so your reaction

156
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:06,640
the purpose and vision for your
information security program strategy

157
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:14,880
making sure your strategy aligns with
your organization's strategy you the

158
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,299
best opportunity succeed within your
plan your program and allow your

159
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:26,789
reservation the reeling from the valley
provide the services you've given them

160
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:34,429
through your securing the values of your
organization should be a great review

161
00:18:34,429 --> 00:18:40,210
your plans and stretch I think that's a
great idea just to make sure that you

162
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:46,970
stay alive their security priorities in
line with your organization includes

163
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:50,440
security roles and responsibilities this
whole thing about setting direction

164
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:57,549
really just making sure that you might
have your bureau security program with

165
00:18:57,549 --> 00:19:05,960
the business organizations that they are
so focused really I just performing

166
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:10,580
procedures and performing processes
based on how they have them to a

167
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:14,439
community in the afternoon service
centers that are missing the big picture

168
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,890
I really

169
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:21,200
direction are they really alive with
your presentation to the doing the right

170
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,200
things for the business

171
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:38,230
appearance and I'm going to concentrate
really unacceptable risk management

172
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:40,920
coordinator across the enterprise

173
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:46,360
this is an area that I see that many
organizations it's really really do

174
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:53,790
information security may have one way to
identify and manage risk audit might

175
00:19:53,790 --> 00:20:00,690
have a separate methods for identifying
the risks that they see your financial

176
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:05,440
folks may have a different methodology
used for identifying financial ruse

177
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:17,200
would be great if there was kind of one
mechanism that could bring coherence to

178
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:24,990
all risk management across the board I
think that was you know i mean that was

179
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:31,840
that was available that was implemented
within organizations do with your life

180
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:37,040
easier for organizations of a business
decisions based on the risk they see

181
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:44,180
from the different parents were right
about where I i believe that many of us

182
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:49,000
within the organizations we are you sort
of there are no thats one method in

183
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,060
nineteen insecurities about the
operations so you really not always

184
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:58,389
always comparing apples to apples and
you might be getting conflicting data

185
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:06,000
between different apart so how did the
business make a good decision I

186
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,500
communicate and share information is
also something also collaboration that

187
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:15,370
something traditionally that I i dont
feel personally that as a as a

188
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:20,199
collective we do well I think we're
getting better at it and I think we have

189
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:27,560
to continue especially in this whole
area are you talking about you know the

190
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:32,980
whole loud explosion was caused services
that organizations are using and I can

191
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:36,430
better manage to ruin your organizations
are probably using

192
00:21:36,999 --> 00:21:42,549
mejor con services that your where and
why

193
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:50,149
of communication and hence you got more
risk and probably a lot of risk that

194
00:21:50,149 --> 00:21:56,768
you're not even aware that's out of the
office building

195
00:21:58,299 --> 00:22:08,209
promote innovation flexibility agility
Jennifer doing security property there

196
00:22:08,209 --> 00:22:15,039
were working with the organization were
meeting a lot of these things should

197
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:22,049
automatically we should have you should
be able to respond to change because

198
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:26,099
we're keeping in touch with the rest of
your organization we understand what's

199
00:22:26,099 --> 00:22:30,849
going on we were working at the
different groups were disseminated

200
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:37,309
practice around your organization we're
sharing errors or failures on mistakes

201
00:22:37,309 --> 00:22:42,928
over they were really learn from the
lessons that experience he has a company

202
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:49,649
was seeking funds from other
organizations going out and going to

203
00:22:49,649 --> 00:22:51,889
happen to like this

204
00:22:51,889 --> 00:23:01,408
association talking with your peers hey
what's going on and i sat down and said

205
00:23:01,409 --> 00:23:12,219
don't forget about the people training
and people are really know about to be

206
00:23:12,219 --> 00:23:15,219
able to identify and respond

207
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:55,699
a lot of these securities

208
00:23:56,490 --> 00:24:05,600
everything now are probably be tested on
a regular basis because you're able to

209
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:15,399
change your business that's another
thing that I'm still see you many

210
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:23,789
organizations can a business outside
who's trapped or security or anyone who

211
00:24:23,789 --> 00:24:30,030
has to be responsible for tracking yes
but holistically across the organization

212
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:37,210
doesn't business know where all their
assets are maybe maybe you know

213
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:42,520
something that really is head of your
role going back to understand your role

214
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:48,418
as a security professionals business
protect their asss how can you do that

215
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:57,110
you don't know where ensure business
continuity plans currants encouraging

216
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:04,879
participation across all business units
I gave a presentation couple months ago

217
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:12,039
and I told people that I believe the
best security organization that somebody

218
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:22,850
in their organization they would much
like you have a CFO or see you have one

219
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:30,120
person responsible for security and they
would broaden participation security

220
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:34,110
risk management across the organization
educate those folks within the

221
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,110
organization

222
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:39,949
fake security into a lot of those
processes and procedures people through

223
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:45,169
and in fact I think they are you start
going what we talked about 40 more

224
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:50,310
business or where security culture no
longer have a team of

225
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:57,940
30 2010 5 security people are you doing
well in a sense of responsibility on the

226
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:11,840
people and their tasks for the company
and you do from the responsible for that

227
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:18,889
responsibility by ensuring the big in
some of these procedures and processes

228
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:27,960
within what they do and I did you have a
much more business software security

229
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,220
culture so really encouraging
participation

230
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:38,729
organization i think is something that
will make organizations or was it more

231
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:49,230
secure and very once we have changes or
issues that that's that's really part of

232
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:59,640
what we are talking about logging and
this is the safety audits exercises

233
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:06,300
understanding you know assessments
assessing the technology but it's really

234
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:15,610
doing something 60 people process and
technology spectrum organization as a

235
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:25,459
whole really should they're just really
regulatory obligations and you know i i

236
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:31,920
visions where they struggle to
understand what regulations they happen

237
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:37,260
because nobody's really track is
nobody's going somewhere is telling the

238
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,920
security people that here's what we have
to do because they haven't reached out

239
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,920
to the Eagle Ridge Dr Who tations

240
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:50,450
very out of these organizations there's
really a plateau collaboration

241
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:51,559
cooperation

242
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:58,730
identifying a security-based

243
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:05,940
existing levels of security so how can
you know whether you're proving your

244
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:12,190
posture or rooming with any organization
really should to get some kind of a sign

245
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:22,860
of some kind of processor to baseline as
identifying appropriate mattress and

246
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:27,610
these metrics should be business folks
not been in a lot of companies where

247
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:33,408
I've asked what kind of metrics like how
many times people call the house just

248
00:28:33,409 --> 00:28:40,139
change the password ok that's maybe some
issues around education but he's a

249
00:28:40,139 --> 00:28:49,580
really enabling businesses to succeed
because it is that a valid Metron say

250
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:53,070
maybe you know something terrifying
those mattress

251
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:59,600
your strategy with business goals and
objectives you should be able to

252
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:06,168
identify those metrics for the process
is your morning that directors really to

253
00:29:06,169 --> 00:29:10,629
business success and what you can to
find those matters that directly relate

254
00:29:10,629 --> 00:29:17,869
to business itself and collect the data
shows that is where you really do value

255
00:29:17,869 --> 00:29:26,090
your role overseas role provides to your
organization and to me that's why I

256
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:33,629
don't see much of it happened today in
many of the organization's regional

257
00:29:33,629 --> 00:29:41,969
actress and then taking action vs words
turn that a lot of people so we can get

258
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:49,149
this can take action is that really
happening so that kinda slow

259
00:29:49,149 --> 00:29:53,258
presentation that she have to do
anything with it now but hopefully you

260
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:54,330
can take it back

261
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:58,830
can ask yourself these questions may be
asked her team's crutches how are we

262
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:04,860
doing things today and hopefully make
some value of this vision insurance

263
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:09,519
organizations good practice

264
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:19,210
practices are perhaps me align yourself
with secure your risk management is

265
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:26,970
required in order to execute their
framework dance by gas hopefully you can

266
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:38,500
start to create those metrics and shows
including any questions I don't have any

267
00:30:38,500 --> 00:31:10,100
thoughts ideas concepts it was going
there because the security folks could

268
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:25,389
use of low pressure and no man oh man
step but unfortunately I think with the

269
00:31:25,389 --> 00:31:32,469
explosion of especially free services
starting was great because anybody in

270
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:39,440
your organization now if the media
service going I T I E three months and

271
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:49,250
$4,000 or they can go out on the web
it's free they learn to do you know this

272
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:54,169
is a sad state and right tackle after
its you know just tell her to forward

273
00:31:54,169 --> 00:31:58,930
but as technology advances we sometimes
a grip on that

274
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:04,790
the take three steps back literally just
really worth mccloud I mean it's gotten

275
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:12,820
we've been very successful in a security
professionals is just very difficult for

276
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:33,490
us to me this yes at a level that's a
good point is I these things you can

277
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:40,980
sort of see how they compare one over
his very first one is very first one on

278
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:54,040
Jul broker dealer organizations Health
Organization Rovers really really good

279
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:58,659
internal person right they're
responsible for managing all the cloud

280
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:03,730
services or at least identified all
called services organizations use and

281
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:11,300
recommend his services to those that
business department at Needham I'm not

282
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:16,270
sure how many organizations using a
quote unquote over within your

283
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:23,400
organization but to lead the CIA or
something you nighty should or could be

284
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:31,350
that broker I think that's where all the
next one US securities broker now so

285
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:38,350
that's really a new set of 12 liveliness
come out over the last three years and

286
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,540
what they are

287
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:47,060
their tools will help you in many cases
and automated cases and will help you

288
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:52,970
identify how many calls services your
organization is actually using not only

289
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:57,930
how many years companies using a list of
which ones are sanctioned valujet IPO

290
00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:00,610
roadshow

291
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:08,750
going out if you are that's a that's be
found in my life becomes a very valuable

292
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:16,879
for many organizations because I I think
clouds were really falling behind as

293
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:25,118
security clearance but we don't have a
flat rate communicate with your

294
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:34,840
situation so that's why I'm from
Cleveland in recent years ago he did a

295
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:40,200
number of engagements with some larger
enterprises up there one of the

296
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:45,759
high-speed went to we were starting to
him into this has been space so we ask

297
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,550
for proof of concept just to see what
this is all about

298
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:55,590
sure you can do that so we have some
services are using what do you think

299
00:34:55,590 --> 00:35:08,940
you're using me so we got our round 5670
cloud services Authorized he says those

300
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:18,210
are not people used to we can we do this
deal see such so we collected seven days

301
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:30,500
were over $100 serves in about 15 other
services storage services people were

302
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:36,390
used and a half a century and data
storage service within error prone

303
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:43,520
proved reserves so what's what's
happening we're so the 50 biggest or

304
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,630
services

305
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:50,490
why are you putting the city as we going
to any time as safeties torture

306
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:58,530
way and they realize there and that
seems to be either to a story that we

307
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:01,630
keep hearing in many companies today

308
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:07,410
he inserted into contention that's
because of these issues garber just put

309
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:13,700
up some reports on have their kids
stolen keys and certificates are getting

310
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:22,950
up to the last one was $1,000 more about
certificate or key and their art ruled

311
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:27,819
out there hustling access security
brokers tools out there that you can run

312
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:34,380
to find out how because you have your
environment and help you manage those

313
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:39,730
keys and certificates today most
everything I has no certificate or

314
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:53,210
certificate authentication so what these
20 2012 5:20 expire where they came from

315
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:57,750
and I get it all out to identify this
goes back to the sole asset management

316
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:01,970
thing to write it he inserted his ass
that if you're responsible for

317
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:08,009
protecting you don't know so there's
that

318
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:13,950
policies plans processes and procedures
you know there's a power tools are

319
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:18,169
definitely tools that I think
organizations need in order to build

320
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:27,329
this organization made a discovery tools
is another one is that we're seeing a

321
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:36,250
lot of activity so going back to this
whole thing about birthdays and file

322
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:46,490
shares and we have you know for service
and have a laptop sirs what it is we're

323
00:37:46,490 --> 00:38:00,009
you know we're not track while ago I did
a child for a company actually we did

324
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:05,670
every engagement perhaps issues

325
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:15,020
day of heavy tailed in the state of it
was a hearing procedures on how to

326
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:23,900
tailor in travel arrangements for some
young he's not as well we ran for a

327
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:30,010
sample and founder of the day

328
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:38,920
laptops Sony Corp lost 85 percent today
to Larkin was on structured a rich man

329
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:43,870
was pulled from database and data into a
spreadsheet and word document down into

330
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:48,359
a text file numeric what was and was
receiving somebody's laptop and what

331
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:55,010
happens somebody call customer service
sales since hey I mentioned in the

332
00:38:55,010 --> 00:39:04,680
database information so the first day to
day basis not there anymore it's all so

333
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:10,390
you say they've discovered tools to help
identify world's out our first asset

334
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:18,940
management can't tell you how difficult
that is good solution for identifying

335
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:24,320
and collecting the day or around your
assets across the organization

336
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:36,120
talking physical assets programs access
control during these things out there

337
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:41,279
are already here so aggressive so you
know that's a that's a difficult to face

338
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:49,350
a lot of non-animal just eat but the
experience of using a call for as much

339
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:53,620
within an organization with something
for him and what I see is most

340
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:59,270
organizations outsourcing portion to
when they actually and fireman training

341
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:04,330
training algorithm support tools we
talked about earlier so when talking

342
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:07,569
about you know what kind of schools this
certainly is not

343
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:15,030
definite list but if you don't have any
today within your organization you know

344
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:21,290
something I was just looking for also
like these concepts and ideas that we

345
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:38,090
talked about how formulate your strength
of those questions a virtual tour of

346
00:40:38,090 --> 00:41:02,990
specific organization there are some
tools out there there will do that but I

347
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:11,839
still see far too many organizations
rely freshies daily alerts survey going

348
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:15,060
into a high up in cleveland they've
asked us to a risk assessment

349
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:27,880
want to do face risks up by sending out
a hundred branches of various sizes to

350
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:36,030
sample of their voice that there are
some true that happen

351
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:47,770
risk assessments were talking GRC others
are there as well

352
00:41:50,290 --> 00:42:00,380
two points for the enterprise level and
there are even some of the smaller I'm a

353
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:04,540
lot more familiar with those in the VIP
parking small-market more about us

354
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:13,029
within a crossroads are probably weren't
rolling ASAP as a model for the markets

355
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:21,300
are so management modules for risk
assessment and many of those you can

356
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:28,740
configure based on the standards and
regulatory requirements you have this

357
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:48,959
organization so there are some very
muddy wants wants to chat with him up so

358
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:56,320
high risk and resiliency part about

359
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:07,230
surely have the right tools of their
trade cats Elson and processes whose

360
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:15,090
views just saw that holds up in
cleveland we're gonna be doing a week in

361
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:22,360
October have a whole week is going on
around this mobile Monday so one day

362

technologies another day we're going to

363
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:34,740

364
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:41,419
Cleveland Thursday and Friday chapel
reduced to two hours much like this one

365
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:47,780
but we do not include and connections
while we were a lot of cities up there

366
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:57,710
in the security space and getting more
attuned to over 200 introduced to

367
00:43:57,710 --> 00:44:03,990
professionals so the higher for that to
be higher job so

368
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:12,330
anyone send information and that global
Information Security Summit or other

369
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:17,750
should be some information posted in the
next few days and some safety soccer is

370
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:26,220
one more information once I do apologize
for the sides to this over the last

371
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:30,399
couple days based on some reason great
shot so if anybody wants the most

372
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:41,040
current presentation they go out through

373
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:51,090
papers out their experience data
recorder was out there that well so I

374
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:57,520
know it's early and are taken now thank
