1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,259
but at this point I'm our college film
director professional services and

2
00:00:05,259 --> 00:00:12,290
support for Internet content management
so in that role I spent a lot of time

3
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:18,480
traveling the country meeting with folks
like you determine what's going on

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,689
inside their enterprises where their
challenge we're having success and I try

5
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:31,189
to help them where I can I learn from
them so this presentation really is a

6
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:34,189
lot of work over about a ten year period

7
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:40,349
generally driven around information
centric security and the need for that

8
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:46,539
marketplace then we certainly develop
some strategies from that you may like

9
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:51,710
it you may not get approach so certainly
like your feedback here is pretty

10
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:57,210
interactive guys so hopefully it will
fall asleep but you have questions ask

11
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,020
them and will move through this as
quickly as we can for this playlist

12
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:09,180
reported this again so we're going to
discuss today so we're gonna walk

13
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,470
through and understand what the current
sterile environment is today as it

14
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:18,048
relates to the security landscape and
cyber defense we're winning we're we're

15
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:23,270
losing why's it occurring then we move
forward in the same trend information

16
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:28,220
but we think things are going over the
next decade some of that happening today

17
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,390
is small pieces some of its happening
today

18
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:36,490
big pieces right that it is affecting
you then we're going to look at what we

19
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:38,600
call moderate threat defense strategies

20
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:45,048
splaine you how we take our approach to
defending the enterprise both from

21
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:50,890
external threat after as well as a
malicious insider probably the two

22
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:54,590
primary things are concerned about these
days and obviously we can ask many

23
00:01:54,590 --> 00:02:02,380
questions as you are so current state so
to get to where we need to go here I

24
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:06,710
like to start back a little bit right
now how do we evolved and how do we

25
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,419
achieve we have or less

26
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:14,780
twenty-plus years so if you look at the
eighties and nineties the world of

27
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:19,830
information technology with one of
automation right result the reign of ERP

28
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:26,770
distributed network systems efficiency
operational efficiency do more with less

29
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:34,050
make more money etc etc what happened
courses you saw information technology

30
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:41,819
moves from the back room of an
enterprise or guys there may be some of

31
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:46,100
your still locked down there but used to
be I T was in the basement modded or

32
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,209
come down every once in a while

33
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:53,810
need something shelf some food some
pizza underneath the door and you crank

34
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:58,769
it out and everybody was happy when she
became integral to the to the business

35
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:02,830
to the success of the business I teamed
up right

36
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:12,200
suddenly the CIO soundboard c-level
positions it was necessary right for ITV

37
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:19,500
sit there because of the way businesses
are under day so I don't know exactly

38
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:25,079
who was that somewhere in the nineties
are so I think it was the CEO levi's was

39
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:30,940
giving interview and Forbes or CIO
magaziner one of those publications and

40
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:36,880
it was a statement there is stuck in my
mom is about 94 95 that he said if your

41
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:43,910
CEO corporation and you understand the
value of information technology to your

42
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:51,549
organization you can't be CEO anymore so
my argument to you folks is I think the

43
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:58,069
world is changing and we're all seeing
some of what current threat is doing in

44
00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:02,798
the world right both from a business
perspective target Sony

45
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:11,138
as well as nations date rape Isis
attacks north korea text China so will

46
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:15,970
changing market I think we're a
watershed moment but I think the next

47
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:22,550
decade maybe two for us is going to be
defined by security organizations will

48
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:27,949
start the value security over
operational efficiency so I'm making the

49
00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:33,270
state statement today if your CEO of a
major corporation I argue any

50
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:38,500
corporation you don't understand the
value of information security and how to

51
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:45,599
protect your primary assets at your
consumers he can't be COO so we expect I

52
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:50,180
S as a component of I T to move up as
well

53
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:56,419
separate become its own board position
etc etc right so traditional thinking

54
00:04:56,419 --> 00:05:01,729
has always been protect the network
protect the heart asks why my business

55
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:07,818
line perspective it's what makes us
money can't survive without email email

56
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:10,750
is probably the most critical business
applications in the minds of the

57
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,539
business line that we have today right
twenty years ago that was not the case

58
00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:21,340
but they can survive without it and they
value that so we defend that they

59
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:26,869
understand defending that that's what we
spend our money our time our energy are

60
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:33,669
in those areas where that what occurred
because of that and I'm as guilty as

61
00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:40,310
everybody else so not picking on you but
here last 15 years the strategy has been

62
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:46,380
defense in depth by layer security best
of breed technologies everywhere

63
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:54,860
defend defend defend don't let anything
in what we really got was expensive but

64
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,510
are manageable

65
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:01,760
proved my point is everybody does but
target target didn't fail because of a

66
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:07,570
lack of stack and a lack of technology
they knew it was tough alarm bells going

67
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:12,990
off everywhere right well a process to
determine what do we do have to the

68
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:18,500
facts so we look at the fence hybrid
funds we look at prime area is a look at

69
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:23,510
the billions of the network the ability
to detect what's happening inside a

70
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:27,450
network our ability to make a decision
or decide what's happening in the

71
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:34,490
network there are really two go two feet
something kill it for failing to fans

72
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:39,750
behind when you get into the inside it's
all over and saw management wise

73
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:44,110
unimaginable to many solutions you can't
keep up

74
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:50,530
maintenance schedules and upgrade
schedules and installation schedules if

75
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:54,979
you made a decision that i'm gonna guess
most of you would take a year to two

76
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,930
years at the place

77
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:02,490
charity technology your competition the
cybercriminal its up this morning and

78
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:10,430
decide for their bodies to crack you so
they meet at Starbucks and hungry and

79
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:15,400
they sit down and have a virtualization
expert on fire while expert fabrication

80
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:20,690
expert database expert let's go cracked
whoever

81
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:30,700
67 $10,000,000 the highly motivated they
have jobs and families defeat and highly

82
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:35,930
skilled I can get those six guys and one
of your organizations to meet for lunch

83
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,090
today

84
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:42,619
think I think with effort level is to do
that right hand lol get him to

85
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:47,460
coordinate and decide this is how we're
going to 10 today so you're losing your

86
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,870
not nimble

87
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:56,040
not motivated it's just not working
before so why are we want one of the

88
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:00,250
primary reasons we're losing is we've
having that hard asset right so we're

89
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,560
defending the network with defending our
servers

90
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,810
we're defending our desktops fight
defend stop cyber threat from invading

91
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:17,250
US reality is the thread actor could
care less about your network and that

92
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:22,370
works as a way to move piece of packet
of information from one place to another

93
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:28,300
its processing its computing why do we
have all that we have all that because

94
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:33,140
we assume data right but data is really
information you may use the term

95
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:37,729
information a lot but a little less
enthralled in the room when you're up in

96
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:44,660
the business line don't say data day is
meaningless has no value that said I T

97
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,670
problem

98
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:53,640
information or information asset has a
value right but what the cyber criminal

99
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:58,410
now is whether it's malicious insider or
external threat actor is your

100
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:05,560
information has value to it that's why
they want it let them sell it they can

101
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:11,050
make money from it they can copy your
plans for your next car for your

102
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:17,000
computer or your next window system and
make money from it and that's why they

103
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,990
wanted so you're busy defending the
network you busy defending your heart

104
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:29,800
systems they're attacking your
information how do I know this is

105
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:37,930
happening to me saying it is so my proof
right not my numbers are numbers and I'm

106
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:43,079
smart enough to read a bar chart light
blue on that's hot dark blue on the

107
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:51,800
bottom light blue is the past dark blue
is most recent the trend lines are going

108
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:58,170
up on the left the cost of cybercrime is
increasing its happening more and more

109
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:04,189
often or it's happening in greater
quantities right plus attacks but more

110
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:09,340
profitable tax for this I tractor was
trend lines aren't good

111
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:17,320
you lose it hurts that the right hand
side look at the cost of defense which

112
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,690
also is going up

113
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:23,480
expense and that right by more of a
problem from our technology at it

114
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:31,310
technologists I love technology we all
do but not always the answer more is not

115
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:37,469
always the answer that's what we do was
buy another firewall change firewall we

116
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:42,920
had to rely more on this and it
somewhere in your organization your

117
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:47,729
sister is walking into a meeting his
city now when the board and the board as

118
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:52,970
saying we spent ten million dollars on
cyber defense last year and we still got

119
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:59,960
breached fix it when your sister says
what if anymore

120
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:08,540
following a lot more than the Board says
we gave you $10

121
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:19,500
this this is the dance we're doing so
it's hard to get funding it's hard to

122
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,570
get to the pay attention when you keep
failing right and if you look at how

123
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:30,610
hard to see if I industry who spending
the most some of that laptop you would

124
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:35,990
understand but look at the bottom third
of the way up from the bottom

125
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:44,340
healthcare education through some of the
most breached industries there are and

126
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,340
they're investing the least amount of
money

127
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:58,110
hours so we're failing that's the
message we all know that I think so what

128
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:04,070
we're looking at here is looking at the
Welcome very important statistical

129
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:11,360
metric in my opinion how long does a
thread after have inside your

130
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,850
environment to do what he wants to do
right

131
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:21,790
the top number is the average number of
days attacked an external threat actor

132
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:31,130
hundred and seventy days that's the day
gets into the day you find him over on

133
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:37,050
the right in that chart is days to
resolution so you found them not to go

134
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:45,099
down and that's taken yet another on
average probably sixty days that's two

135
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:52,700
hundred and thirty days in the network
the bottom number is mostly insider the

136
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:59,750
person who has privileged access in here
and the amount of time they have before

137
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:05,270
their detect it as being a problem that
those two numbers together that's a year

138
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:10,980
so you all intelligent people who all
over and inside your networks all day

139
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:17,490
long you tell me how much damage did you
do any year undetected

140
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:28,970
concern so you can focus and understand
in this is not the right it's reality

141
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:34,540
sometimes you gotta hit people between
the eyes but in reality you're losing

142
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:42,240
why are you losing life has changed the
way we compute the way we interact with

143
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:48,500
data the way we use data the way we use
information has changed for not keeping

144
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:54,820
up right so world-changing around us and
we're still defending their way to spend

145
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,820
a decade ago

146
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:03,730
so unnecessarily hear the message will
get into it later is not wanna spend

147
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,500
more

148
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:15,360
it spent differently and the chief for
transforming arm or so back to insider

149
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:22,640
threat steps here a little soft right
now it's not a number that we've seen

150
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:27,800
people track because aspire to become
trendy or last few years right so we're

151
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,780
starting to collect more and more
information

152
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:36,449
create some metrics here but look at the
insider threat frequency of occurrence

153
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:41,150
that's happening and I believe that
number in 2013 is gonna jump I don't

154
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:47,449
think everybody's reported yet for the
hiding it for various reasons as you can

155
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:52,530
imagine lawsuits and legal actions
occurring right to expect that number to

156
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:58,030
go up the frequency is very high and
we're gonna get into why in a minute

157
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:02,280
riot more deal with that in a few
minutes and we'll show you why the

158
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:07,949
insider threat is ground it's a factor
of economics and a factor of social

159
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:15,480
culture is a really interesting stat so
may be looking at the insider threat

160
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:21,490
equation seeing it grow in the
marketplace and I sit down I say well

161
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:26,900
how does that occur in my mindset
probably like most of you is that most

162
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:32,449
insider threat activity occurs outside
of the organization being up like myself

163
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:38,970
I travel a lot of people probably here
do certainly business line does so my

164
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:46,580
assumption is like myself who ever going
to steal something but if I did I would

165
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:54,150
do it often at work right here in my
home at Hotel wherever that's not the

166
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:54,930
case

167
00:15:54,930 --> 00:16:01,020
most insider threat occurs inside the
environment in here at work

168
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:12,780
so again where we investing when are we
getting where we're spending our time

169
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:19,120
our money over on the left hand side
this chart explains the cost of a

170
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,200
lifestyle crime based on the frequency
of attacks on normalizing the number

171
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:31,900
right so certainly be docile service on
the top makes sense that's down we have

172
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:37,430
malicious insiders malicious code
web-based attacks is your top 40

173
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:43,380
probably make up the majority of threat
that you're facing today what are you

174
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:53,060
investing in network defense has some
value in the dial service side right

175
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:58,589
what are you really putting your time
and energy into into technology

176
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:05,100
resources people that are actually going
to defeat the problem i'm saying you

177
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:15,208
know those two things don't match right
why do we do that thing away budgets

178
00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:20,220
work thank the way process works inside
an organization how many of you have

179
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:25,690
antivirus solutions in your organization
will be shot in a pic that most of the

180
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:30,780
people I have every year 10 rolls around
again

181
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:39,720
antivirus solutions are actually
effective very few gotta varying stats I

182
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,500
look at a piece I'll do your own
research right there about 40 percent

183
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:49,230
effective but you could read behind
those technologies expecting it

184
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:54,740
defend his family you have to transform

185
00:17:55,350 --> 00:18:03,580
change your thinking people have IDs IPS
certain organization how many of you

186
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:09,139
boarded modern malware at the IDS IPS
level in the last two years

187
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:19,040
honest question guys and I think you
know the answer right so where we defend

188
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:26,889
today does not meet up the threat when
we get into just kind of internal

189
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:29,610
factors are 80 pulled over this

190
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:35,699
too too much depth there but basically
comes down lack of focus lack of

191
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,570
knowledge right lack of resources

192
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:45,090
anybody here work 40 hours or less a
week you do you must be doing something

193
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:55,500
right when I go right so we're
challenged right we don't have enough

194
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:00,310
people I don't know anybody in the last
few years and lost partners as I walked

195
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:04,840
into that's a shame on you know a whole
bunch of really good I ask people

196
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:09,570
because I got reps out funding
established to hire five more people

197
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:17,460
would see it happen yet might get one
usually not on right and good luck

198
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:23,160
getting that a little bit too and it
takes time and energy to fight modern

199
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:30,270
threat it's easy for me right I get paid
to determine some of the stuff and look

200
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:35,290
at roadmaps for technology and look at
providers and talk to people that are

201
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:41,590
facing challenges every day you don't
you're fighting fires all day so it's

202
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:47,720
really hard to sit down and think about
what should I be doing before so let's

203
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:52,740
look at some of the trends here any
questions on it first sex such an many

204
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:59,730
money makes sense yeah ok so let's look
at some train lines I S right now as far

205
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:05,990
as I know the only industry sector
segment that has negative on point there

206
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:09,030
are enough people so

207
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:14,580
fis professionals to meet demand today
and all the projection say we're gonna

208
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:21,909
need for AX three ATS five x the amount
of I S professionals over the next four

209
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:27,160
years so even if you did have the Rex
out and even if he were approved for

210
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:34,410
that budget we just talked about I'm in
the same boat as a consultant everyday

211
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:42,210
hard to find right so we're fighting
that though there were also facing and

212
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:46,390
some of our changes in our chances you
have to look at what's coming to you in

213
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:52,710
terms of course we're forced consumer on
the way they interact with systems and

214
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:58,190
what their expectations are and how they
were right I was the first guy in my

215
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:01,260
office in my career have an email
address

216
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:09,590
believe it or not that's a scary now she
right so life changes generations change

217
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:16,760
the digital native of the day is a
pretty big threat to you both externally

218
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:21,450
and internally these are people that
grew up with technology technology is

219
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:26,320
core component of their life don't
believe me though the average airport

220
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,780
see how many people actually are looking
up and how many people are on there

221
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:37,270
mister primary form of life without it
life ends you have fourteen year old

222
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:39,500
daughters who lost her phone

223
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:46,680
understand that statement right so they
think differently they're very adept

224
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,390
that use lots of technologies that use
technologies that are different than the

225
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:55,550
technologies we use I can't even keep up
with the latest now snapchat line

226
00:21:55,550 --> 00:22:01,030
whenever they have different
expectations while the other is doing it

227
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:06,930
trend lines with them as they have this
lack of intellectual property or privacy

228
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:15,310
concerns over their world how you become
famous in their world we all known stars

229
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:15,919
right

230
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:22,470
Kim Kardashian's famous for a lot of
things so this is what this is what they

231
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:26,560
understand so they're not real concerned
about posting naked pictures of

232
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,300
themselves on internet how concerned you
think they are about posting your

233
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:37,840
financials on internet they don't think
like we think there for us the

234
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:44,070
interactive work-life balance is
important right but i dont wanna works

235
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:47,200
like a dead right

236
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:53,050
1001 experience life so the time is
coming and already has in some cases

237
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:58,610
where your vice president sales is going
to pick up today and he's going to say

238
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:04,959
you know what this weekend I wanted to
Africa hosts his apartment up on Airbnb

239
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,300
in the connect with one of his social
bodies and Africa

240
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:15,280
gonna set up at Hoover ride about
kilimanjaro hike the mountain so post it

241
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:20,790
whatever they're using the day in terms
of social communication about how great

242
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:26,300
their life is look what I'm doing and
I'm on the mountain working and then one

243
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:31,419
of his buddies is going to contact him
and say why are you there shouldn't you

244
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,340
be working

245
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:41,330
happy well not thrilled my job for us
why you come out your client lists over

246
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:50,679
sure how are you going to defend that
this extreme example but try to make a

247
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:58,970
point this is how we operate today will
call so this is just consumerization

248
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:03,490
challenges well so yeah it's carrying
out the digital native becomes employee

249
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:08,240
and expectations of how they're gonna
work changes how to interact with your

250
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,070
information changes and whether or not
they should keep your information

251
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:16,129
private and secure changes right that's
bad enough now you have the consumer

252
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:24,510
side of it that affect you as well so on
the far left-hand side orange there even

253
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,680
though it's a woman a picture of a woman

254
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:33,400
itz example my father the father wants a
pizza he looked up a pizza parlor in the

255
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,400
yellow pages

256
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,910
drive down to the shop which the pizza's
owner buys us pizza probably pays in

257
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:43,170
cash and goes home I'm in the middle

258
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:50,399
probably should be around here but
that's me and I do like pizza so we've

259
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,300
got a middle is made right I don't do
any of that you're crazy i Google pet

260
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:59,800
shops I'm finds websites where my feet
sideline have it delivered to the house

261
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:07,169
with credit card online digital native
sons and a movie about Pete's its adult

262
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:11,500
dominoes whoever's doing that now but I
just repeats that way

263
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:19,670
lack of interaction on a social scale
right who are you buying from you and

264
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:23,240
trust the person you're buying from
where you store your credit card

265
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,240
information who has access to your
credit card information

266
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:31,960
think of the change that over that time
span between those three types of people

267
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:44,010
had actually knows who brought us pizza
from I have no idea when we throw

268
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:49,590
internet things course that's a big
buzzword right the reality here it is

269
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:55,070
growth of devices so back again twenty
years ago I too was dumb terminals a

270
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:58,879
UNIX machine it was pretty easy next
thing you know you are responsible for

271
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:04,470
the phones than anything I had a plugin
it became your responsibility and your

272
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:10,930
life change number of things you had any
given day changed number of things yet

273
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:16,990
defend any given day change we're
talking about a train line of billions

274
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:24,290
of devices the average worker that one
device 10 years ago but it moved to one

275
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:30,020
and a half hour to the phone cell phone
now up to three or four

276
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:34,830
per person and that doesn't account for
all the things that they're going to

277
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:43,149
interoperate and that she hears
refrigerators TV's cars all will have to

278
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:53,640
be defended and then of course the shift
to cloud platform so it's hard enough to

279
00:26:53,640 --> 00:27:00,170
defend what it's sitting in front of you
and you have control over now you start

280
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:05,540
to move here information assets and your
critical business applications in the

281
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:13,980
cloud data storage in the cloud you have
less control some of those companies

282
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:20,160
will be good at it and defending and
protecting your information and securing

283
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,780
our borders in their data centers some
of them all

284
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:31,879
cloud application providers your cloud
platform there's there are thousands who

285
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:38,850
do you pick where you go who can you
trust the average 22 year olds running

286
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:46,560
iCloud me or whatever they designed a
really have a good grasp on security and

287
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,560
privacy and protection

288
00:27:50,850 --> 00:28:00,889
question so we've devised a strategy
called modern threat defense going to

289
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:06,650
get the moment any questions on the
trend lines now

290
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:31,900
hopefully helpful information yes fairly
consistent right I'm just gonna be all

291
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:38,520
over the map it's fairly consistent
that's like any other thing if you if

292
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:43,540
you look at the cost of reach you can
get a number that's anywhere from $125 a

293
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:50,120
record three or four hundred you have to
kind of normalized at the best can get

294
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:55,139
good meaningful information sets and
metrics that's put it on the trains are

295
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:59,700
there right that it's not about the the
number of being right about the trend

296
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,950
being more questions good point thank
you

297
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:12,750
modern threats so methodology wise I'm
pretty simple guy try to keep things

298
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:18,790
simple for myself I use everybody's got
their terms CISSP terms are different I

299
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:25,920
like policy identification enforcement
because it spells out by so you get the

300
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,340
point

301
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:34,750
ok so in my mind went to fan the gold
offenses reduction attack surface

302
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:42,159
heard it over and over again you cannot
eliminate all risk some possible but you

303
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:50,920
can reduce your tax surface you can make
yourself less susceptible to attack you

304
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:57,020
can be a less enticing target from the
threat after so there are strategies to

305
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:02,680
do that reduce me on a policy side i
would tell you most organizations I

306
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:08,040
visit and work with a pretty good
policies sometimes they atrophy

307
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:14,129
example that of course from BYOD rolled
out a few years ago no one had a policy

308
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:19,570
for that don't know what to do so
there's times where you up or down but

309
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:24,679
for the most part I would give most
organizations and a to be plus a policy

310
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:28,630
side they know what they want to do you
know what they need to secure

311
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:35,060
got a good handle on it we skipped down
to enforcement I would say most

312
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:42,610
organizations I'm gonna give you a B
grade there you know what policy is you

313
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:46,780
know what you want to do to force it in
most cases you doing for us although

314
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:49,389
there is sometimes a breakdown in
process

315
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:55,720
target failed again because of a
breakdown internal process wasn't about

316
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:00,890
knowing they were being breached was
about what we're going to do after they

317
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:05,120
realized they couldn't move fast enough
nobody had authority to make decisions

318
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:14,000
right where everybody fails for the most
part is an identification your ability

319
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,770
to detect the threat and understand the
threat and that is changed we were

320
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:26,410
waiting for a while I got ahead of the
threat actors today we are not well I

321
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:33,720
started in this industry there was
somewhere around 25,000 ish malware

322
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:40,600
variants per year those numbers were
obviously year over year increase see

323
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,179
today

324
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:53,090
you hitting 65,000 to 70,000 malware
variants four-month low volume is

325
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:55,030
incredible

326
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:57,139
the other interesting statistic there

327
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:07,630
is out of those animals malware variants
large portion of it is one off design so

328
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:13,180
if you look at Verizon threat report and
some other areas information there I

329
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:18,270
think out of the top 250 companies in
the US companies that were breached the

330
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,360
last two years

331
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:30,870
65 or 70 percent of those were
customized one off specialize in our tax

332
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:40,209
bill for purpose so that's why you're
facing right most most solutions cannot

333
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:48,020
keep up with that today so again it's
not about spending spending more than

334
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:53,240
300 more technology the problem it's
about the realization that maybe the

335
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:58,800
technology sets we have are not doing
the job and we need transformer fire

336
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:09,270
shifters and modernize our strategies so
again I'm a simple guy like to keep

337
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:18,900
things pretty easy to understand for
myself so this is how we looking at its

338
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:25,190
not again and all the deal not saying
you don't need other forms of security

339
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:30,180
or other layers of security or other
forms of Defense I'm saying in our world

340
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:39,160
we believe this is where you should be
focused so for us there's an in-n-out to

341
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:45,040
your business and it was simplified down
we need to keep bad for coming in my own

342
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:51,830
and we need to keep our good quality
information about the ways we don't want

343
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:54,379
that so

344
00:33:54,380 --> 00:34:01,620
to me approach I think you need layers
it's important to have layers I think

345
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:08,190
the focus layers right now our internet
perimeter of ice layer and the

346
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:15,990
Information Store lawyer internet
perimeter is not firewall not a hard and

347
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:23,879
physical location internet perimeter is
anywhere your employees can access the

348
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:30,799
internet at MIT plans smartphone in room
people download apps on their

349
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:37,560
smartphones how many people read the T's
and C's on your smartphone app downloads

350
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:45,290
but I do and always your I S people who
know better

351
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:58,380
he's not look at our core group right
there

352
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:04,000
ok so again

353
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:10,900
places for exposure places for threat to
be introduced so we have to defend its

354
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:17,360
interests primer everywhere everywhere
can device layer that's obvious

355
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:22,220
Information Store layer last line of
defense because we learned earlier

356
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:28,359
presentation cyber criminal threat actor
what is he after 99% of the time

357
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:35,220
information right that's what they want
so that's our approach that's what we

358
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:40,850
think we need to focus our energy needs
the bay with your limited resources are

359
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:45,220
limited finances and your limited
ability to look at things all day long

360
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,730
for

361
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:56,609
so I'm a firm believer in layers but I'm
also a firm believer in as much

362
00:35:56,609 --> 00:36:02,930
unification as reasonably possible so I
think your environment needs to be a

363
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:10,589
brand central 100% I would never do that
when I do I think you can consolidate

364
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:18,810
and unify under a few brands have more
holistic security have brands that

365
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:25,020
integrate with each other a lot easier
management lower cost of ownership more

366
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:33,270
time to focus absolutely and that is
generally my direction so that what

367
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:37,550
we're looking at here so this is a
healthcare organization purposely op he

368
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:44,640
skated out their names brand names here
they transform their environment so

369
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:53,990
color-coded that's a brand so they have
12345 five core technology that

370
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:59,560
defendants layers for them and provide
adequate defense so we think about it

371
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:06,890
what are we looking a reduction of risk
reduction of attack surface through

372
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:13,160
layers through coordinated technology
has not 20 or 40 solutions that's five

373
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:23,750
and their particular case this bill save
them about two million dollars annually

374
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:32,100
hard costs and allow their meager staff
actually focusing on their systems that

375
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:39,089
are running around patching everything
they increased their diligence

376
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:44,590
better defense through technology
imagine that

377
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:55,870
will forward this is my favorite one
this is financial services entity a very

378
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:56,509
large one

379
00:37:56,510 --> 00:38:08,510
upwards over 30,000 sees it he went to a
very consolidators strategy three

380
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:18,450
vendors so I say effective attack
surface reduction this is a great

381
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:24,460
example on the front end of this because
of the layers they had coming down from

382
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:32,220
the perimeter they were able to detect
and defeat at the perimeter somewhere in

383
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:40,890
the order of 97% of the rebound threat
not everything can reduce already

384
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:49,330
described coming back down next layer at
the device lair they killed at all its

385
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:56,779
extreme example but plus thirty thousand
si Financial Services entity

386
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:10,060
two years they have not read imaged and
I'm point machine from our process right

387
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:17,120
so that's what we're building out this
is the kind of staff that we're looking

388
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:23,450
at so again the strategy right so way to
effectively use a limited funds you have

389
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:30,460
again become more robust in terms of
your defense provide you with more time

390
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:35,920
and allow you to defend more effectively
you have questions I'll take him that's

391
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,920
that's it

392
00:39:41,130 --> 00:40:00,680
yeah it's it's interesting so primary
technologies they're obviously from

393
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:05,359
ingestion standpoint denial of service
type things right

394
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:11,700
coming in a very robust web security
layer is probably the primary component

395
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:17,089
in that now with high high capability
there and then I M point later not

396
00:40:17,089 --> 00:40:23,569
traditional antivirus so we're moving to
lock down but now right technologies

397
00:40:23,569 --> 00:40:30,339
that you know like the battle by not
allowing things to execute locally so

398
00:40:30,339 --> 00:40:35,700
you think a modern malware when she
requested once a day featuring perimeter

399
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:39,960
it doesn't sit on a network and it
doesn't attack the device you know

400
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:43,819
traditionally right number memory that's
why antivirus

401
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:50,619
factors so locked down solutions keep
things from executing and that's that's

402
00:40:50,619 --> 00:40:57,519
how they do next layer down at the
Information Store layer were looking at

403
00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:03,529
data activity monitoring while activity
monitoring type solutions again looking

404
00:41:03,529 --> 00:41:07,819
at access rights who's touching wad
what's happening there and then coming

405
00:41:07,819 --> 00:41:13,619
back around data loss solutions coupled
with insider threat solutions for the

406
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:19,710
difference there for those who aren't
familiar data loss is event driven right

407
00:41:20,759 --> 00:41:27,019
send out a list of a hundred credit card
numbers to your Gmail account various

408
00:41:27,019 --> 00:41:35,519
events Pacific insider threat technology
is user-specific so its behavioral it's

409
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:41,598
looking at what a user does day-to-day
normalizing my activity on a network for

410
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:47,240
last 10 years and I get upset and I
decide to move on and even because I

411
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:52,038
have extreme access rates I start
accessing systems I shouldn't be there

412
00:41:52,039 --> 00:41:53,319
haven't

413
00:41:53,319 --> 00:41:57,680
for ten years so my risk scores
elevating so now I'm looking at

414
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:03,719
individual I'm not a security event
driven individual driven who's the

415
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:14,239
person who's going to cause a problem I
would guess the bold statement I know

416
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:21,339
but to me and viruses is it effective
right and I know you need it from

417
00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:25,369
another perspective that's what the
others thinking they're always behind

418
00:42:25,369 --> 00:42:33,489
right but just not working so for me and
take those dollars that you're spending

419
00:42:33,489 --> 00:42:38,920
it had a virus and this this
organization specifically took their $80

420
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:44,749
use it for lockdown solutions and any
use the free antivirus they get their

421
00:42:44,749 --> 00:42:50,430
Microsoft agreement to check the box
please always nice for a checkbox how

422
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:59,019
about you guys with CFO love that right
so that's how they're doing it and it

423
00:42:59,019 --> 00:43:02,890
all the way in the top there we go way
up to the top on the outbound side Qasmi

424
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:07,690
solutions cloud access security brokers
the light control the flow of

425
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:08,890
information

426
