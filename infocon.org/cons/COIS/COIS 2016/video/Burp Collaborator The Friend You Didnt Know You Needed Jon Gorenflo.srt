1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,970
purpose you're probably in the wrong
room or the right room hoping my name is

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,649
John going below you can follow me on
Twitter and my very erratic trading

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:16,299
talks about purple operator mostly
because when I started researching its

4
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:19,890
use it my pencil us in that patient
testing I couldn't find much information

5
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:25,920
about it other than the original blog
post from forswear when it came out to

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,939
my search I found two definitions think
one was created by management

7
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:34,940
there's some synergistic leveraging
going on in terms of gas releases and

8
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:45,339
then the other option was 24 hour been
testing so I think technical people came

9
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:51,620
up with their own interpretation of the
management definition but you know how

10
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:52,550
it goes

11
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:56,149
so what does it mean what is what is
clamoring what does it do for use and

12
00:00:56,149 --> 00:00:57,350
application tester

13
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:03,010
what can it do for your organization
suburb collaborator looks for ways to

14
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:09,960
entice an application to interact with
three services external to itself right

15
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,939
now the birch scanners going to inject
things into your web application to try

16
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:23,169
and force it to do an interaction over
DNS HTTP or HTTPS ok so what so as a

17
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:29,820
when I put this together was one point
six point 36 it's now at the dot 39 they

18
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,990
they release one what seems like every
week

19
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:38,270
console up to date there are three
findings inside burbs scanner specific

20
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:44,048
tuber collaborator the external service
interaction over DNS and external

21
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:51,040
service interaction over HTTP and out of
band resource load over HTTP HTTP ones

22
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:57,740
there can be a CPP oration ups so

23
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:03,679
the external service interaction of a
DNS classify this as a high severity but

24
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,030
what it means is the payload that went
through from the burbs scanner into your

25
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:15,349
web application on some system somewhere
forced it to do a name resolution of the

26
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:20,329
payload and so what that means is as the
application starts processing what you

27
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,780
sent it it sees something to try to
resolve the domain name in it reaches

28
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:27,220
out using recursive DNS makes it all the
way out to your book collaborators

29
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:33,609
server who then responds back to the
Internal Server so this is a service in

30
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:37,660
a secure course in your network although
some have a server deepen your network

31
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:41,420
that's reaching out to an external DNS
server is potentially bad for everybody

32
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:49,649
to the external service interaction over
HTTP goes a step further this is what

33
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,850
this means is not only did it do a name
resolution to try and find out what the

34
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:59,120
IP addresses of this hostname it also
reached out over HTTP or HTTPS and tried

35
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,340
to grab something from your book
collaborators server do you foresee an

36
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,269
internal server or web application to
try and lure grab resources from another

37
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:15,480
place that's never good to see this dig
into it causes bad what you can do with

38
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,000
his load other things in but you can
also then use it as an attack proxy to

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,680
either attack internal to other systems
on on the internal network or you can

40
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,940
use it to tack third parties or look at
potential at the loopback services that

41
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,940
are running on the host that you're
attacking

42
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:40,700
resource load very similar to if you're
familiar with remote file inclusions the

43
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,769
same type of vulnerability here except
you need to think of it in terms of a

44
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:49,070
script that's been sent back to the user
and process in the browser and said or

45
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:53,170
something that's making my car up by a
remote file inclusion for PHP where we

46
00:03:53,170 --> 00:04:02,260
run PHP shelter that kind of thing on
the server side so how does it work what

47
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:06,700
what's actually happening Burke labor so
in traditional web application scanning

48
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:12,679
and traditional birth scanning your
payloads read the book scanner

49
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,660
directly to the application server
process and then you get a response back

50
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,160
and your but at that point you're
limited to what the server will return

51
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,120
to you

52
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,130
collaborator and tools like it will turn
this testing little bit on its head

53
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,840
because you're not only going to get
that conventional testing across the top

54
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,049
here you're also gonna see what the
external interactions are you

55
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:36,710
Burke library server runs as a separate
process you send your request your

56
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,870
payload through hit that target
application that the target application

57
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:46,010
is vulnerable to something that will
execute these interactions it will reach

58
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:49,680
out contact the burp collaborator server
and over the monitoring connection to

59
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,970
your birth sweet client it's gonna get
that interaction back we'll see what the

60
00:04:54,970 --> 00:05:00,580
interaction was from the burbs sweet to
the application the application to the

61
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:06,950
collaborators are so what does that look
like for DNSSEC it looks a little bit

62
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:14,820
like this I ran these tools against the
the website program which is included on

63
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,370
the Las broken

64
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:21,150
p.m. so it's it's designed to help you
test screening tools if you look at 4:21

65
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:24,989
guaranteed to find some vulnerabilities
a great we'll help you see that and see

66
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,920
what the interactions are first tools

67
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:32,660
you see here we send it through and
highlighted in red there is the the

68
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,770
payload that sent through you see that
has my domain name listed in their

69
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:41,729
little bit easier to read from from the
right to the left my domain is fun

70
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:42,560
sector net

71
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,710
USGBC da fonseca net in front of that is
just a long string of random texts

72
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:52,280
reason as therein will cover a little
bit how to set up a collaborator serve

73
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:58,690
your own is you set up her glamorous or
it becomes a DNS server and then it will

74
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:03,830
respond to any DNS requests that it gets
with its own IP address every time no

75
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:08,969
matter what so part of what it does it
sends random strings across and then see

76
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:13,180
if its result on the other side keeps
that interaction reports that back to

77
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,910
you and in the entire that to the
specific request you made the web

78
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:24,250
application that caused the interaction
of the collaborators to continue this

79
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:29,720
information you get back from the for
the interaction on the carpet when

80
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:35,410
you're looking at the results for
SanDisk and birth notices IP address

81
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:36,810
that has listed there

82
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:41,820
the interaction that it saw was from a
DNS server not from my IP address so

83
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:45,409
that the DNS interaction here is this
from whatever DNS server actually

84
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,080
resolve the the random string

85
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:56,490
actual IP address with the a/c DEP
issued EPS interaction missing goes to

86
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:59,740
the exact same process you you probably
won't see these interactions without

87
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,740
having the DNS

88
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,990
yes

89
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:26,430
interactions

90
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:31,420
paired with a DNS interaction is well
otherwise it wouldn't make it out there

91
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:35,120
but you see that same kind of request go
through and you can see the response

92
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,930
down below

93
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:44,880
response very basic in this because I
was using to do the test but you see

94
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,100
that strength come through on on the
bottom part there that's to help you

95
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,930
identify where that comes through and
that can be an attack would eventually

96
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,930
as well

97
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,070
continue this interaction side of it
this is this is when you're looking at

98
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:06,170
this this is what it looks like to the
Burg collaborators server so the top

99
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:11,810
part there is the request that went to
work collaborator and then on the bottom

100
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:18,040
part is the response a collaborator sent
back to the original host for the web

101
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:23,230
application so all rights we've got
three findings now what

102
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:30,780
so the full potential here is that you
have the tools can help you find out of

103
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:36,490
band XSS super blind injections store
blind injections a deferred interactions

104
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:42,580
in the attack potentially other network
services as well you're really limited

105
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:50,200
only to the decree to get accurate this
point so far out of band XSS what

106
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:56,260
happened without a Nexus S is protected
it's very similar to the the resource

107
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:00,410
load so you're going to have those
interactions and that point can send a

108
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:06,469
cross-site scripting attacks in as a
response back so well you have

109
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:13,230
availability identified with Robert
collaborator server it's not necessary

110
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:16,230
in attacking you have to create your own
pilots to

111
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:34,199
America can't see the video so how to be
resource and the potential here to

112
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:40,029
deliver a stripped back and add that end
up in the user's browser as as intact

113
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:46,370
vector not mister least order and it's
not reflected its not broad-based but

114
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:49,779
it's passed in and loaded in from the
Berkeley operator or whatever you

115
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:52,620
foresee interaction with afterwards
after Burke laboratory helps you

116
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:58,230
identify it and it can be used for other
client side includes

117
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:05,800
response header injection and open
redirection so superb line injections

118
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,779
these kind of Jackson's without
something like purple a traitor you're

119
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:13,880
never gonna be able to detect because
you'll send your question to the web

120
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:18,870
server and it will respond you the exact
same way no matter what so the

121
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:22,500
traditional means of identifying sequel
injection or command injection won't

122
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,279
necessarily work for you in terms of
what you get back from from the server

123
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:30,990
however with the blind superb line
injections if you can force that serve

124
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:36,100
on the back end to interact you have
something with a burglary will be able

125
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:40,410
to identify that and then give you
specifically where that vulnerability

126
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:50,339
wasn't web application to the Taliban
injections similar superb line injection

127
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:57,320
but in this case you look at the things
that are sent to the application itself

128
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:03,529
and not necessarily the back end to run
through this I depend on how to play

129
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:06,880
some processes response it could be
vulnerable to any kind of input so

130
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,930
server-side code execution sequence
action etc but what you doing at this

131
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:17,339
point is once you've identified it with
Berkeley collaborator you do the same

132
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:21,930
type of injection attacks you do with
web application directly

133
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:25,329
you send those responses back from
whatever serve you force the back and

134
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:33,320
interact with during your test
interactions

135
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:40,260
versions of previously mentioned the tax
basis put it into a system and hopefully

136
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,010
it's going to flow through the system
and at some point something down the

137
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:49,490
line is gonna execute what we put in
there is a payload you're able to delink

138
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:56,360
entry points are points for the
application great example of this is

139
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:05,459
actually in the room so their island has
a presentation at this link here where

140
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:09,479
he's able to do cross site scripting
attacks against a wireless intrusion

141
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,760
detection system by putting cross-site
scripting into society's so the SSID is

142
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:19,459
a cross-site scripting tax goes into the
system pops up on the analyst screen and

143
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:27,810
watches cross-site scripting that's
playing dirty not good for anybody knows

144
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:31,430
of those are the ones that are probably
really fun so check that out this DVD

145
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:35,500
ideas of what you can really do with
these kinds of the possibilities once

146
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:41,620
you identify them so testing after DNS
interaction you get the DNS interaction

147
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:47,860
and collaborator and you don't get the
corresponding HTTPS HTTP interaction it

148
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,940
means that something process what you
went through as a host inning but for

149
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:55,760
some reason couldn't get out so you've
got some options as to whether News

150
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:02,000
Network filtering of some sort by Rowan
etcetera seen you trying to get around

151
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,200
that so if you've got something like him
an injection these these here are

152
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,200
options for Linux and Windows

153
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:17,990
in the back to see those who don't have
the time to write them down a little bit

154
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:20,630
the conclu-

155
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:26,689
blog the basic generic way said he
supports cans and trying to connect to

156
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:31,820
various courts at this point you can use
it to connect you different machines on

157
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:36,810
the internal network or third parties or
whatever but he also do this if you

158
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:41,819
wanna grass Buster on another hosting
you have run these commands and do that

159
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:45,650
aggress busting to try and see if any
port is allowed out so they're blocking

160
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:51,010
traditional ports of HTTP HTTPS etc but
potentially have a random hi ports open

161
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:55,120
allowed out from secured subnets you
know that that could be an issue as well

162
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:04,040
so if you've got a CPR CPS interaction
run the Metasploit service

163
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,520
authentication caches see if you can
force that system the trial indicates

164
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:12,040
you instill her credentials I could be
in a way to leverage is more about it

165
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,430
when she died in a fight him and look
into the the server questioned for jury

166
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:24,500
duty as well in testing for the other
day and resource lows what can you do

167
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,760
with that look at things like like to be
framework so great for work to help you

168
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:33,580
help demonstrate cross-site scripting
capabilities and what happened with the

169
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,750
attack that way if you do get it

170
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,060
beef to launch you'll be able to get a
little information about what kind of

171
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:45,579
system actually connected to you have a
consistent with an analyst PC etc and

172
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:51,980
look at the web browser autoplay Autocom
similar option here for looking at the

173
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:59,680
analyst PC it is a person that you end
up reaching out to you and a compromiser

174
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:05,069
machine that we get in the shower right
and then the local home services so if

175
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:09,940
you can load out of energy sources that
way

176
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:13,700
look at what's running on the local host
at certain times there's a patient's

177
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:19,720
information given to local host of other
machine I run on 27001 information

178
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,980
additional information about the machine
that might help

179
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:27,380
exploited so it's still missing from it

180
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:33,089
import figures initial announcement
collaborator they mention a few things

181
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:37,220
that they were gonna hopefully be adding
the future and I'm really looking

182
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,780
forward to when they do something
that'll make it a lot easier to to

183
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:45,589
leverage what you find with scanner and
do something more advanced attacks or so

184
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:49,360
that they really talk about the book
laboratory client and in the Burg

185
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,980
intruder immigration so the collaborator
client will be something allows you to

186
00:15:54,980 --> 00:16:00,100
configure exactly what the burbs
collaborator service going to do if

187
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:04,180
there is an HTTP or HTTPS interaction to
be able to specify what that Taylor this

188
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:10,890
putting your own cross-site scripting
attack or whatever and then it'll work

189
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:17,370
in concert with the intruder integration
so where's the intruder like very

190
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:21,640
specifically to pick certain parameters
as you're doing a test and repeat or

191
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:27,910
iterate over something very targeted in
how your scams hacking machine this will

192
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:32,480
integrate in sort of like the way the
extender works with the payload

193
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,670
generators from another extender
application and use it for generations

194
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,670
intruders

195
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:47,370
I don't they meant mentioned were out of
band versions of all the input Mesa tax

196
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:51,360
checks that they they haven't quite seen
that yet

197
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:56,000
detection of various to provide more
abilities and checks restored versions

198
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
of the relevant vulnerabilities

199
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:05,099
going to prison or actions and support
for other network services associate

200
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:13,109
payloads and manual testing tools the
manual peace i think is when you're sort

201
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:19,020
of the store but it does have is a
source IP address that initiated the

202
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,700
interaction so if it's leaving your
organization whatever your your printer

203
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:28,000
IP address that it comes from its gonna
be in the Burg collaborator server its

204
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,550
gonna have unique string that was used
to identify the request went through so

205
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:36,879
that you can type the request from your
client to what the library service sees

206
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,950
its gonna have any application specific
data that's included in the request

207
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:45,180
since you don't necessarily know what
that is it's hard to tell what the risk

208
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:51,010
is that being a republic sir
specifically what it does not have any

209
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:54,870
information about your book client for
use individuals running your license

210
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:57,870
information etc

211
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,260
appalling same same as what we talked
about before the point is that the

212
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:12,290
monitoring and control piece on the
bottom left there is doing the polling

213
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:15,330
houses in the data how is it making sure
that everything stays private when it

214
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:19,580
goes to the Berkeley operator server so
it evens in suburban you started up it

215
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:24,949
generates a security and that security
is then used with cryptographic hash and

216
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:29,860
a random identify with every request and
then when you do the polling

217
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,590
marries us to a request up to the book
laboratory services have you seen

218
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:39,080
anything that has to do with this key
collaborators server does its own

219
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:45,040
cryptographic check to match them up and
then all returns back what came from

220
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:53,670
your instance of birth and then server
takes that and turns it back so I think

221
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:59,190
it was 1629 they added the ability that
when you say your session in Berk and

222
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:03,520
actually takes that private key and puts
it in the same session so if you try to

223
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,990
restore session back you'll get that he
can check these interactions how are

224
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:14,980
they don't stay out there forever after
a period of time but when there is no

225
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:18,010
backup you do save your sessions

226
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:21,010
encrypted version of us

227
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:27,010
reporting this is what it looks like as
it goes through and see the request go

228
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:31,610
through it sends the the string is a get
perimeter and this was captured you are

229
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:37,320
short never turned back and has a JSON
list of interactions that had tracked

230
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:48,799
since the last update so what is the
collaborator do with the data the

231
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:53,080
internet the detail the interactions are
stored in general process when really

232
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,590
they're never logged two discs plus
you're doing something on the server to

233
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:06,230
log yourself packet capture something
like that it's never recorded it all in

234
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:10,940
the details the interactions once there
retrieved from work from the

235
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:14,260
collaborative server are deleted and if
they're not picked up that after a

236
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:18,529
specified time they're deleted as well
however the documentation doesn't

237
00:20:18,529 --> 00:20:27,789
specify how long that is good through
and look at this interaction see what

238
00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:33,429
they are however if you control the
server you can do a memory dump and see

239
00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:42,970
where things are so if you want to set
up a private server and I recommend that

240
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:49,679
you do if you in your environment really
not all that difficult few things you

241
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:56,020
have to do it so I got three options and
first if you're a bird user don't know

242
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:56,370
it

243
00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:02,110
average is on by default and using ports
wicker's public server so something to

244
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:05,110
know if you're a nap test and use birth

245
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:13,750
turned off and then that is when you set
up your own server servername and the

246
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:18,880
poor indication reasons set up yourself
as one you can test and then how come

247
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,779
you and you have to be less worried
about something compromising information

248
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:27,909
and see more potentially in the Brooklyn
Bridge shoot uterus your invasion but

249
00:21:27,909 --> 00:21:28,890
parents

250
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:32,850
sensitivity of the data for the
application that you're testing you know

251
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:34,719
you may or may not want that going up to

252
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:41,240
serviceable controls and the other
reason you want to do it is that when

253
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:46,130
you when you're testing instrument work
you may have filters on your printer

254
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:50,390
firewall that would prevent interactions
to the outside world but would allow the

255
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:54,270
interactions happen within your own
network so again you would see more

256
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:56,110
without internal server

257
00:21:56,110 --> 00:22:01,010
out sir external sir but it's something
you should probably think about running

258
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:05,520
a scan were connected to both you can
see which way it goes it goes both

259
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:10,150
directions it cheap if it will make it
entertaining and also make it external

260
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:28,980
so it's included with you have it

261
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:35,530
yes

262
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:43,580
java file as berth since launching bird
watching from the command line and I've

263
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:48,480
got some examples that moment you just
give a dash dashboard dash collaborator

264
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:56,090
and and we're up and running this
requirement doesn't take much I ran on a

265
00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:01,000
cloud instances like a $5 a month cloud
in summer with one CPU and 512 RAM and

266
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,570
it did just not a lot to run it probably
run in parallel on your machine

267
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:09,720
however and he's the commander was
missing just normal go scurrying about

268
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:18,800
contagion so you will need to setup DNS
so we're gonna talk briefly about that

269
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:24,780
they're so DNS if you're not familiar
with DNS and recursion makes you

270
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,930
understand how that works because if
your gonna set up your own collaborators

271
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:32,510
survey you gotta set up your own domain
or subdomain to work with with birth

272
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,269
without that

273
00:23:34,269 --> 00:23:47,389
you're not going to get a whole lot of
their actions so according to records

274
00:23:47,389 --> 00:23:52,369
are creating in s record that point to
its warmed up BC . font and I created a

275
00:23:52,369 --> 00:24:01,820
record that point my penis it bc don't
let the DNS perspective and once you're

276
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:07,639
running on for clarity gonna go see here
you just do the nslookup on the left I

277
00:24:07,639 --> 00:24:14,178
just did it for my domain be seen on the
right now you can see the bottom right

278
00:24:14,179 --> 00:24:22,099
there just a random txt.att.net always
respond back with its own IP address the

279
00:24:22,099 --> 00:24:28,968
matter what you say is a config file an
example out on the site has a lot more

280
00:24:28,969 --> 00:24:33,709
information to give more examples but
this is a simple as you can do it in

281
00:24:33,709 --> 00:24:39,779
with your domain is and then the metrics
information so the metrics path as well

282
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:44,479
as it's somewhat of a secret key in
terms of plz the metrics of having

283
00:24:44,479 --> 00:24:48,929
interactions you had with with your
application and then the address

284
00:24:48,929 --> 00:24:52,669
whitelist if you want to restrict people
can see the point information you can

285
00:24:52,669 --> 00:24:56,079
specify what IP addresses can actually
get to your point information

286
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,700
put into the configuration file seems he
get a little bit more specific see their

287
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:09,800
specific courts for the different
services that Iran etcetera

288
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,950
if you want this to be non-standard you
find she got a weird port running a lot

289
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:16,950
out somewhere you can have that setup
that way as well

290
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:24,700
notice in the clock here in the example
the site they give an example of what

291
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:31,440
the path is for the metrics you don't
have to use that but don't use that it's

292
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,330
here examples and find a burglar bars
service somewhere you can find some

293
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:42,610
point that has that is the the secret
configured for metrics path as a basic

294
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:47,149
information given the metrics it's
really not all that interesting to see

295
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:56,630
how many interactions were per hour and
then lots of different options to get

296
00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:02,740
more granular configuration details but
if you need those advanced options are

297
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:13,850
there additional information for the
polling and more more ways to run DNS

298
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:16,669
give you a bunch of different ways
especially he got a service that is

299
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:20,660
behind a firewall public IP address is
different than the IP address on

300
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:27,200
localhost take a little bit more in
these details how do you spot one like

301
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,080
if you think you may be found or just
hit on http or whatever Port Authority

302
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:37,020
non-christian this is the page you get
so testing out during the test think you

303
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:43,470
might have found one that's one way to
see it and then I thought well what's it

304
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:48,550
look like somebody nursery contours on
it so it basically all the tools give up

305
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:51,399
pretty quick they figure out that it's
getting

306
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:55,540
given a junk request when it gets a
response is that it's just gonna respond

307
00:26:55,540 --> 00:27:03,180
anything so both DNS DNS recon but just
as I can tell that it's it's responding

308
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:06,180
to everything at same IP address

309
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:23,100
the references questions since April
last year just about a year they keep

310
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:26,980
adding to it they've been adding bits
and pieces for quite a while I think it

311
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:32,280
was october when they added the ability
to senior session and have the bikini be

312
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:47,080
saved a part of that this will work
against the machine because when you

313
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:52,570
when you submit the request in the
system you're attacking you that system

314
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:57,200
or a system of the back end somewhere is
going to get that Halo and is going to

315
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:08,050
try and do a lookup on that domain name
so we go back i guess i I did can skip

316
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:27,129
over that the DNS area so when we're
doing DNS resolution it always starts at

317
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:31,120
the right we we think of it from left to
right but it's doing a resolution from

318
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,399
the right to the resolving name server
is going to be not the system I was

319
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:40,900
attacking the DNS server that that
system is configured to use oK so it's

320
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:46,570
gonna get for me it was fun second
thought that it's gonna start at the far

321
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:50,950
right and there's an imaginary dot on
the far right it does DNS records and

322
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:54,700
from there so it gets that dot and goes
up to the root name servers person says

323
00:28:54,700 --> 00:29:01,440
hey who has met gives an IP address does
recursion ounces ok top-level domain

324
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,260
which is the the dotnet says who has fun
SEC and that would respond back say okay

325
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:12,290
go to the authoritative name server
which is you host your own or its it

326
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:16,790
the company were you register your
domain name into respond back with ok

327
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:48,670
this is authoritative DNS server for one
sec dotnet yes yes yes your own up

328
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:52,370
internally you could do that but you
still gotta have that authoritative name

329
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:55,370
server

330
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:17,860
potential talks with this first three
talk about you have to do the research

331
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:21,159
to find out if they're actually
vulnerabilities there's there's a

332
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,890
potential that its intended purpose of
the application now then it's a matter

333
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:30,010
of what can I do with it as an attacker
can I make it do what I want to send it

334
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:34,680
what it was designed to do and if you
have systems that are taking input from

335
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:38,920
users via web application and doing
things on the back end and reaching out

336
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,500
to other systems we've got a lot of
potential they're wrong

337
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:48,870
be a good way to check that but this is
more to help people identify

338
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:53,629
applications that are doing that or can
do that the intended to do that

339
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:28,649
services that are listed on the back
only so that you have to be in theory on

340
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:34,860
that box to access it so maybe an
administrative console so as to get the

341
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:40,990
SH to it and then use that as a as like
a SOCKS proxy connection or something

342
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:43,990
like that

343
00:31:53,370 --> 00:32:00,309
if you can hear what he said there is a
recent attack with one password that

344
00:32:00,309 --> 00:32:23,639
have the password gonna clear text
across the back at risk for side not be

345
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,760
able to use it in a live tests that I
started doing this I was hoping had that

346
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:35,000
done before I had to give a presentation
but mostly because a lot of our nation's

347
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,860
don't want to use it internally where
you had to go through processes to get

348
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:43,100
it is not your average fortune five
hundred's gonna throw supplied he say

349
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:48,409
hey I wanna created my own DNS server
over here you know it's not an easy

350
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:53,580
thing to get done in the average big
corporation and then on the other side

351
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:57,919
of that being able to use it should be
interesting with clients and I kind of

352
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:02,970
think it depends on the Sun Studio test
right so just not had that option yet

353
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:08,620
since I started looking into it but
again that part of the presentation of

354
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:12,080
certain researchers cause I couldn't
find much information about it and

355
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:19,350
hopefully more people start using it I
try to themselves and sharing your

356
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:22,350
questions

357
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:33,639
yeah I mean I guess you could say I
wouldn't call it a trust relationship I

358
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:40,290
would just I would say forced
interaction

359
00:33:52,040 --> 00:34:13,440
authorized to test the cloud so that's
it'll get better when there was a piece

360
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,649
of a song about when they were finally
get the book liberator client build

361
00:34:18,649 --> 00:34:23,138
penetrated in to this point that doesn't
exist

362
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,750
thanks for coming
