1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
rearm the co-founder and chief
technology officer for fish me what that

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,570
means is I'm in charge of our product
technology roadmap I'm in charge of our

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:13,070
R&D efforts and our engineering teams as
well as the operations teams needed to

4
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:18,680
pull off millions upon millions of
fishing simulations what you're in for a

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,970
lot of flights don't worry if you see
URLs or stats your statistics that you

6
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,720
want to capture the slides are going to
be on the portal for this event as well

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,419
as I'm going to be uploading them to
SlideShare I hate it when I go into a

8
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,420
presentation and the presenter doesn't
cock cover what's in the abstract

9
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,328
that's not this presentation at all I'm
pretty much going to cover the abstract

10
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:44,270
we're going to examine is fishing easy I
hear a lot of information security

11
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:49,180
practitioners claim that it is a weird
look at multiple data points highlights

12
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:53,000
from our enterprise security reports
we're gonna look at popular fishing

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,620
beings ones that our customers tend to
use and they like to use we're going to

14
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:02,919
look at some statistics on how much time
people spend on the education material

15
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,720
once they fall prey to a phishing attack
and then we're going to try to export

16
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,890
the topic of why do people continue to
fall for fishing so first we're gonna

17
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:15,920
start with a telework the Office of
Personnel Management this was probably

18
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,619
in my opinion one of the most impactful
data breaches that we had to deal with

19
00:01:20,619 --> 00:01:26,380
last year and anytime I hear about a
breach I'm always curious to know was

20
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:30,520
officially involved was fishing involves
so I watched the C span testimony on the

21
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,929
hill and made him say anything about
fishing but chances are in this day and

22
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:39,170
age appears a breach fishing were
somehow our fault so I got my hands on

23
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:43,840
the search for a certain report it
didn't say this was the cert report for

24
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,320
the OPM breach but the opening of the
cert reports that hey here's a search

25
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,908
report about indicators about a breach
that caused a large data loss that's

26
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:58,360
that's all it said in the headers so the
idea behind a lot of research reports

27
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,670
and see if we can get indicators to
other business units other parts of the

28
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,149
government they can look at their
networks to find out if they were

29
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:09,429
compromised well like I said the report
didn't say this was about her p.m.

30
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:14,500
but inside of the indicators listeners
in the back one that was interesting to

31
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:19,530
me some of the domains listed OPM
security dot org and opium test learning

32
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:24,129
that or that the attackers registered
chances are this probably is the search

33
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:28,540
report related to that breach another
thing that was interesting as I was

34
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:33,048
going through the indicators that stood
out to me was one of the indicators was

35
00:02:33,049 --> 00:02:39,879
a file an executable e-zpass Highland
ill when a number and then invoice fish

36
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:44,989
dash malicious that PDF so that analysts
when they put that in this may rename

37
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:50,269
that file probably just organize their
tasks so what that says to me is this is

38
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:53,939
probably the surf report about the
European breach these are indicators

39
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:58,980
probably related to that drinks and most
likely it was fishing that was the

40
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:05,760
initial attack vector that caused that
breach so the verbiage around this

41
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,099
breach wears these were advanced
attackers they got in it was a nation

42
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:15,599
state but when I C E ZPass as one of the
indicators one of the things that

43
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,940
immediately I think about is if you live
on the east coast are familiar with the

44
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:25,250
e-zpass toll system is it was this fish
this theme has been around and it's been

45
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:30,699
plaguing consumers for three to four
years so these advanced actors military

46
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:34,250
state sponsored actors they didn't
necessarily put a whole lot of effort

47
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:38,159
into the phishing email needed to
compromise those employees they went

48
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,608
with what works which was carrying those
employees that they think that they may

49
00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:49,659
have received a Gold Pass violation so
the DA chance response to this was

50
00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:52,828
interesting again there was no admission
publicly that this was a fishing

51
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:58,379
incident at all in fact the congressman
grill opium about not encrypting the

52
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:04,649
data but a few weeks later the DA says
started to put out a response to this

53
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,769
and basically one of the heads of the
DHS has said that we're gonna pull my

54
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:13,519
credentials of anyone that fails a
fishing test and another message from

55
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,490
the government was

56
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:18,810
what we're gonna do a security awareness
fishing campaign and it's going to

57
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,980
feature short videos and posters and
literature on the do's and don'ts for

58
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:27,930
better security hygiene and as a citizen
who had been his biggest win in this

59
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:34,060
breach in like 10 this this is really
not going to to help out and we're gonna

60
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:40,640
look at reasons why so the testimony on
this was frustrating to say the least

61
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:47,190
but yet we definitely got some more
information from the DoD I mean people

62
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:52,650
that run received copies about their
data being breached and what ways the

63
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:57,969
government plan to address this was a
thirty-minute fishing awareness video

64
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:03,720
and computer based training program so
I'm like the dude says down there you

65
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,660
have that's that's not going to work

66
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,830
jump back into my background I've been
doing information security for a long

67
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,710
time

68
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:16,729
want to write a most memorable positions
when I started as a consultant for found

69
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:21,380
stone in 2002 which was later acquired
by McAfee and I did a lot of incident

70
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:24,790
response and penetration testing in
there is here but also a thing that we

71
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:29,910
did as part of that found stone was
delivered this ultimate hacking class to

72
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:34,710
hundreds and hundreds of information
security professionals over damir and it

73
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:38,330
was based on methodologies we would
publish and are hacking exposed books

74
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:41,740
and the idea was you become a better
network the standard by learn how the

75
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:46,550
way that people break into networks so
throughout that time I met a lot of

76
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:50,070
information security engineer and I
begin to understand how they think about

77
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:55,020
network attack in the stands and most of
the time they're really thinking about

78
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,940
configuration management patch
management and that sort of thing in

79
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:05,840
their rarely thinking about the user's
impact on a security ecosystem one of

80
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,010
the classic debates and I get into with
my colleagues when I suggest that trying

81
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:13,400
to make our human were resilient against
phishing is actually worthwhile endeavor

82
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,539
is this little report but it only takes
one fish to compromise a network so why

83
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:23,550
even put any effort into making me so
that's something that I encounter quite

84
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:23,840
off

85
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,260
so I want to examine that thought is
fishing he is fishing easy for an

86
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,419
attacker

87
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:34,409
look at all the things that they need to
pull off in order to successfully

88
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:39,000
mission organization they have to start
with recon have to find email addresses

89
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,260
I have to find relationships inside of
that organization oftentimes remaining

90
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:49,490
social networks in order to get that you
get weaponization of some sort of

91
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:53,960
payload to work so they have to figure
out the operating systems but their

92
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,510
target victims have they have to tune
something that will get past filters and

93
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:03,789
firewalls in URL analysis sandbox so
they had quite a bit to do you usually

94
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:08,550
need to obfuscate that code so they can
bypass traditional wavy I'm so there are

95
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:12,669
a lot of their effort goes into the
Recon in the weaponization to prepare

96
00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:15,549
for phishing attack but they're not done
yet

97
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:21,210
now we have to deliver it so that means
sending an email campaign to deliver the

98
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:25,789
work that they've prepared for that fish
so they have an entire infrastructure

99
00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:30,770
ready to receive outbound connection
with their physician successful but now

100
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:34,219
they still have to get that email and
that is actually getting more difficult

101
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:39,090
for those attackers it used to be that
they would register random domains news

102
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:43,900
differently hosts in order to use and
phishing emails the trend that were

103
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:48,590
observing as many of them are choosing
to send phishing emails from gmail from

104
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:53,200
hotmail from Yahoo and the reason why is
they know that that smell infrastructure

105
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,320
that is difficult for you to block and
those mail providers are all have proper

106
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,349
spf they'll have property again so they
increase the chances of getting that

107
00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:05,539
fishing to that organization so that's
something that they have to consider

108
00:08:05,539 --> 00:08:09,760
another thing that Fisher Fisher has to
consider is the time of day the most

109
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,190
exploitable platform is a Windows
platform with tons of plugins installed

110
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:17,789
one of the most Brazilian platforms is a
mobile platform so if you're doing all

111
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:22,030
of that reconnaissance and preparing up
a road you need that phishing email to

112
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:25,500
hit an office worker when they're likely
sitting in front of your Windows

113
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,360
computer you don't want that fish

114
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,070
to hit them at night when they're more
likely to use a mobile phones are you ok

115
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:37,510
so now we have to get that exploit to
land so there's a number of different

116
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:41,890
defenses and things that an organization
might have to detect that stop that

117
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:46,660
breached survey have to worry now even
if they are successful in breaking in

118
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,370
now they have limited time to explain

119
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:53,620
expand influence on the network flat
black doors and hopefully begin to

120
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:57,649
export trade data out which is even
difficult for them know that they can

121
00:08:57,649 --> 00:09:02,200
have their breach discovered if they're
not careful about the data exfiltration

122
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:07,250
so there's a lot that they need to
consider in order to be successful at a

123
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:13,950
fish so when they're put all of that
together they really put a lot of effort

124
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:18,579
into the phishing email for instance has
officially email that advance the

125
00:09:18,579 --> 00:09:23,019
attackers are sending to your employees
at work here let employees know that hey

126
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:26,550
we had a problem during the Halloween
season was wearing inappropriate

127
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:31,670
costumes at work and so we want everyone
to have fun this Halloween and in order

128
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:35,149
to make sure that we're having fun is
still within the acceptable guidelines

129
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:41,089
click this gallery of acceptable
Halloween costumes at work something

130
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:44,410
that we would all want to click on right
wing but what is acceptable what's not

131
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:44,959
acceptable

132
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:51,040
here's another one that advanced actors
are using all the time we have a lunch

133
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,579
in the break room in order to combat
this we're doing is we put a webcam and

134
00:09:56,579 --> 00:10:01,769
allow any employee to connect either
from a home office a remote office to

135
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:05,050
monitor the webcam to see if their
lunches are getting slaughtered what

136
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:08,870
employees Creek this yet maybe they're
the ones the languages may be the ones

137
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:12,040
having their lunches thought maybe
they're just voyeurs may want to see

138
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:17,219
someone's the Uni Watch maybe they're
connected to a remote office these two

139
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,990
examples they're actually not made by
advanced attackers at all these are

140
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:26,279
fishman simulations because we like to
have a little fun and try to think about

141
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:31,019
emotional triggers that would get an
office worker to click the reality is

142
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:35,540
what advanced attackers are really using
are examples like that OPM breach just

143
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:38,510
tired reuse content over and over again

144
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:43,330
or here's an example of a crime where
reaches an incoming fax report but your

145
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:48,160
to open up the attachment the reason why
not pretty wide effort into the content

146
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:53,839
of the emails is because their operation
is complexed they have a lot to do and

147
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,500
support they do it's kind of a numbers
game for them they just pulled fishing

148
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,680
template off the shelf and they give it
a go and they sendin and suspicions are

149
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:07,650
now following the emails so they get
somebody to click and this is this is

150
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:11,709
really the state of things that the
clever scenarios about refrigerator

151
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:15,580
webcams and Halloween costumes at work
that's that's what companies are doing

152
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:19,990
simulations or are worried about the
reality is most attackers are rooms and

153
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:24,220
content will look at a recent examples
of ransomware is hot again

154
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,590
lockheed we I thought trip to Wal Mart
where things are the past but there's

155
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:35,560
been a huge uptake in ransomware encrypt
crypto where over the past two to three

156
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,589
months and we've done a lot of analysis
and here's an example of a very recent

157
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:44,110
face March 10 that was distributing
locking and it's using some of the same

158
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:48,590
tired and true tried-and-true methods
again it's about an invoice overtaxed

159
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:52,980
increased 32 reviewed your pick up the
invoice you click it and unfortunately

160
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,980
it starts encrypting files on your
computer

161
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:01,160
one of the things that was interesting
to us as we were observing this campaign

162
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:07,850
is they are getting more sophistication
and randomized any portions and content

163
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:12,320
of the phishing emails so we're gonna
look at rocky briefly as well as a dire

164
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,170
campaign so this is an I know this is
impossible to read in the back so just

165
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:20,780
explain it quickly this is an example
where to fish is that we caught in a

166
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:24,930
while that was directed at us and our
employees reported and it was the same

167
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:29,030
exact campaign one of the things that
really stood out to us is it was highly

168
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,640
varied in the body

169
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,780
the file names were changed the sender
names were changed different numbers a

170
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:39,699
sport in which numbers customers order
dates they were all different or miss

171
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,220
trying to show that uptick in the
sophistication of crime where actors

172
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,620
that are sending station

173
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:50,370
Nelson mass they're doing this to avoid
different detection that you might have

174
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:55,530
and really to have a different antispam
technologies might have in place but

175
00:12:55,530 --> 00:13:00,150
this one was a bit of a surprise to us
the same campaigned same day had so many

176
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:07,920
different variations embedded into the
fishing body itself so we looked at this

177
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,680
campaign we had twelve hundred different
samples and we noticed that all those

178
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,599
100 samples it came from seven hundred
different IP addresses the attackers to

179
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:24,270
deliver those 1,200 samples had six or
seven hundred VIPs under control he had

180
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:29,710
over 1,100 different domains to send
these from and they definitely did a lot

181
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:35,610
of randomization this really speaks to
wide waukee and ransomware is

182
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:40,060
particularly damaging right now the
network that these guys are using to

183
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:45,069
deliver beans n bass is impressed that
they have thousands of compromised hosts

184
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:50,470
in order to pull this off I will get
another campaign dire so most of these

185
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:55,320
are being delivered by its cyber crying
game out of ukraine dyer was a banking

186
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,810
Trojan that is installed it would
attempt to get credentials from your

187
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:03,619
your browser with man in the middle of
your browser what we've observed is that

188
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:07,440
same cyber gang is just moved to answer
we're so what they're doing what they're

189
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,840
doing is they're using the same network
and hosts that they have reduced

190
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:15,170
delivering a different attack right now
it was alarming about this is we looked

191
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:22,780
at 218 campaigns from dire we had 30,000
unique samples and elbows 30,000 unique

192
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:27,470
samples a single subject was used nor
more than a dozen times so they

193
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:30,980
definitely are rotating and random
rising their campaigns in order to

194
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:34,230
maximize efficiency for them

195
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:37,870
all right we're switching gears a little
bit here and we're getting out of crime

196
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:43,070
where and current fashion trends and I'm
gonna share with you some highlights

197
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:47,430
from our enterprise fishing
susceptibility report there is an entire

198
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:51,599
presentation about this on bright talk
it's free to view and you can you can

199
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,760
get this report from mars I just really
want to cover some of the highlights

200
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,270
because we get we have a lot of data and
we're getting a lot of questions about

201
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:02,290
this this might be useful to you if
you're in charge of doing fishing

202
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:06,589
simulation program at your job we've had
some some some somewhere questions or

203
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:10,650
want to learn from some reports that our
customers are doing so we we really

204
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:15,890
wanted to whittle down the sample size
we have a vast diversity into our

205
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:20,819
customers are if you dont know about
fish meal and fish me simulations it's a

206
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:24,170
platform in order to send simulated
efficient you know the people at work

207
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,510
seventy percent of our customers they do
this completely on their own so we just

208
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,980
kept them in the account and may have an
idea of how we're going to use

209
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:37,530
simulations in order to reduce the
official comment the organization about

210
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:41,850
30% of our customers use our Managed
Services in order to let us drive the

211
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:47,050
entire experience and prescribe their
next steps while they're using it so in

212
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:51,599
order to try to make this enterprising
reporter or enterprise broke is what we

213
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,690
did is we we limited our our analysis to
organizations that we're training at

214
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:02,350
least 3,000 employees are more we want a
larger enterprises and that have been

215
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:07,390
using fish me for for quite some time
I'm so weak that so we we focused on

216
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:12,260
after this study we asked several
questions we wanted to know if different

217
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:16,430
beings are levels of complexities more
difficult for some employees to

218
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:21,630
recognize what were some of the
motivational emotional motivators that

219
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:25,860
got people to click on a difference
people that are on the job as people

220
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:31,190
ride home and attacked officials might
interact with this time of day influence

221
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:35,110
that users vulnerabilities we wanted to
work at some of our customers that were

222
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:38,790
running simulations in the morning
versus the afternoon and so on and so on

223
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:44,140
this report has all of that data is one
of the key findings it's the store quite

224
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,050
a bit to cover

225
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:50,079
eighty-seven percent of employees open
the fishing simulation the same day and

226
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:54,910
this is what I snore murder our
customers reports there's a huge spike

227
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:59,680
in the first day but the first few hours
that fishing simulation going out which

228
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,800
makes sense you know a lot of people are
on the spot where their email me do try

229
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,760
to keep it clean

230
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:10,869
inbox most employees are responding to
emails during the morning hours so that

231
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:13,948
might mean when maybe when they're
little word rocky or they have a lot to

232
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:18,579
email to go through so they're trying to
do it and no more rapid fire that method

233
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:23,329
instead of mathematical method this next
step was interesting to me

234
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:27,399
sixty-seven percent of people who fall
prey to the fishing simulation are more

235
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,960
likely to fall for another efficient it
sounds so when we observe this and we

236
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:37,200
saw our customers like that makes sense
you know you tailor your program around

237
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,090
the people that have demonstrated that
they do have a vulnerability that they

238
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:45,240
need extra help here and increase the
frequency of simulations to that

239
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:50,040
population and export Co Inc wasn't
really surprised the most effective

240
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,010
efficient emails for our simulations
weird names that contain business

241
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:58,070
communication so you're at work trying
to get you got done getting a business

242
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:02,200
communication oriented fish you're more
likely to fall for that then one that's

243
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:07,030
trying to give you an Amazon gift card
or give you a discount to home keeper or

244
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:13,540
something to that effect in the last one
we observe is that population is

245
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:19,690
demonstrating susceptibility that it
took about four simulations for them to

246
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:23,940
follow along with the rest their their
peers so yes they were susceptible they

247
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:28,850
were 67 percent more likely to fall for
the next fish that metric kind of hang

248
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:32,790
on about that same level until they
received their third and fourth place

249
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:38,730
where there was a dramatic decrease in
that users except to go with what about

250
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:42,820
teams and complexities so we tried to
organize our things because there's

251
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:47,360
quite a different templates inside of me
that can use and we wanted to see which

252
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,540
ones people were more likely to fall for
so what we did is we organize them by

253
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:55,000
office communication type emails

254
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,030
things about computer updates employee
well lesson so on and then some of the

255
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:05,389
things that we consider we're trying to
evaluate our what is the contact person

256
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:09,710
or persons home what are the emotional
motivators to get someone to click she

257
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:14,150
reward curiosity entertainment
burdensome and then technical

258
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:19,320
difficulties are very erotic lose that
this was a fish in the body of the email

259
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:26,679
or just one or two so he averages and
benchmarks so like I mentioned office

260
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:31,400
communications had the highest
susceptibility ranked by average and if

261
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:36,210
we looked at a specific room the one
that was really giving people trouble

262
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:41,280
where's files sent from scanner on that
is something that might received when I

263
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,110
didn't scan something or maybe someone
is trying to send something to me it

264
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:50,199
feels right in the context of your work
day what probably is no surprises

265
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:55,000
fishing teams about computer updates
they had the recent African seen as far

266
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,600
as getting someone to fall for a fish
but if you look at the sample size and

267
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,620
demographics of the study we did try to
limited to organizations were more than

268
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,780
a thousand employees that's highly
unlikely and organization at that level

269
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:14,030
has their employees manually installing
patches were flash or Adobe Reader any

270
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:19,170
of those things are the databases we
show that too is that those employees

271
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:23,790
were more suspicious that type phishing
email than the standard office

272
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:29,600
communications one of the questions that
we wanted to do we have enough customers

273
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,560
that we can do this now is there anyone
market for vertical that's particularly

274
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:39,940
more vulnerable to another so we looked
at package delivery type of scenario our

275
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:43,790
customers like to send out lots of
packing delivery scenarios and there was

276
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:49,370
a wide variance we couldn't conclusively
say finances are more vulnerable to

277
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:55,030
package delivery or energy and probably
really has to do with the likelihood of

278
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:59,280
you to receive a package at work so
education is that out is one that was a

279
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:04,250
little bit more vulnerable to package
delivery some barriers and maybe it is

280
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:07,740
that the people on education they do
receive a lot of packages very exciting

281
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:13,010
to get a package whereas manufacturing
was pretty low is highly unlikely that

282
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:18,830
arrived workers someone is receiving a
package of work not sure on that lets

283
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:25,010
move into top emotional motivators so as
other data that we analyze what's

284
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:29,179
getting people to want to click a
connection is going to I know this

285
00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:32,480
person is someone trying to make a
personal connection with me was your

286
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,820
name dropped in the body of the email
was one reward was another one curiosity

287
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:43,399
urgency and cheer against to trail off
so you know an email that's faking to

288
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:48,080
look like it's coming from your CEO your
boss and your VP that might be one of

289
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:53,360
the motivations that get people to click
on average another thing I did as I want

290
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,770
to our content and I said show me the
most popular scenarios are the ones

291
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:03,940
especially customers really like to use
that kind of does show us which threats

292
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:08,080
that they're worried about insider
organization and so what they did is

293
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,280
they organized for me the average
susceptibility

294
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,649
the percentage of people that are on
average were falling for this type of

295
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:20,410
simulation and then the popularity
amongst our customers so likewise like I

296
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:21,190
mentioned here

297
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:28,600
package delivery is very very popular
works and unauthorized access I want to

298
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:34,530
highlight that one will look at that it
has a high percentage of people clicking

299
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:40,110
on it and it's it is very popular
amongst our customers then I asked our

300
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:44,439
content team I said I want to look at
our most susceptible themes are not

301
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:48,000
necessarily the ones that our customers
are gravitating towards and they want to

302
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,860
do but the ones that have demonstrated a
high percentage of susceptibility but

303
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:58,309
also show me how popular they are
amongst our our customers manager

304
00:22:58,309 --> 00:23:04,620
evaluation is the highest percentage as
far as susceptibility but it is not

305
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:08,729
popular more efficiently customers and
that's probably why there that might be

306
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:12,210
just too much of an emotional trigger
for someone to rescue the fishing

307
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:17,340
simulation of phishing email about a
performance evaluation even though it is

308
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,449
shown that it is

309
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:23,620
employees are susceptible to rate it
might be the people that are running

310
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:28,110
simulations they don't necessarily want
to risk your job making some sort of a

311
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:30,449
chart type of process

312
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:39,190
similarly though we're gonna look at two
different unauthorized access teams one

313
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:41,529
of them is unauthorized access or don't
care

314
00:23:41,529 --> 00:23:46,950
oriented its 30% or people are falling
for that but it's a low popularity would

315
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:51,639
get why and then unauthorized access
just regular it's right up there it's

316
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:57,269
nearly 30% as well but it is slightly
more popular with our customers so

317
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:01,510
unauthorized access 29 percent of people
on average applying for this it is

318
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,519
popular

319
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:05,960
the way that this fish works is it
basically says hey we think your

320
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,220
computer when sites that wasn't supposed
to you but we understand that sometimes

321
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:13,110
these systems are incorrect if you want
to log in and review the logs we

322
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:17,168
captured granddaughter this portal and
login with your credentials and we can

323
00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:25,070
see what triggered this alert another
one that is very popular and has a high

324
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:29,918
success rate is hard alerts you have a
secret admirer at work why does he

325
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,370
retired worker who is it I marry why
would someone be my secret admirer all

326
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:37,059
this is where I want to click this and
find out who this person is or yes I

327
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:41,070
have a secret admirer work I want to
click this and find out who is this one

328
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:46,139
is a popular scenario used by customers
and it does have a a significant impact

329
00:24:46,139 --> 00:24:52,949
we do see this being sent out around
down times they another holiday inns the

330
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:59,429
one that I mentioned that is low popular
low popularity but high rate is manager

331
00:24:59,429 --> 00:25:03,250
evaluation and if you look at this
temperature is a little hard to see a

332
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:07,760
lot of different mail merge type of
features and so dear in certain names or

333
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,899
personal connection here at our
companies in the field it's

334
00:25:10,899 --> 00:25:15,110
automatically populated Department these
are all things that I

335
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:19,189
attacker could glean about your
organization just by browsing LinkedIn

336
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:24,529
your supervisor's name and company name
so it's no wonder why something like

337
00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:28,780
this really does get someone's attention
it looks like official communication

338
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:33,580
and it's something that makes that
connection with someone who makes them

339
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:39,860
want to click and interact with that
email more unauthorized web use low

340
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:44,990
popularity so this one is kind of up in
the bar on the first one which is a we

341
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:48,640
went to some sites that were categorized
as adult material what we understand

342
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,200
that we can make some mistakes if you
want to review that's I go ahead and log

343
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,860
into this portal to check out the
reviews again not surprising that a lot

344
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:02,540
of our customers avoid this they don't
want to necessarily create a situation

345
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:08,270
inside of her organization I just want
people to be less vulnerable so shifting

346
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:12,510
gears here we're gonna get into creating
fishing awareness like I said I've done

347
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:17,410
a lot of information security
professionals and often times especially

348
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:21,560
in the engineering and technical sides
their battle that why why do people fall

349
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:28,040
for phishing emails obviously this isn't
correct and so we charge them with

350
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:32,840
trying to do an awareness type of
campaign and most of them take us down

351
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,990
this path well in order to figure out
phishing emails what you gotta do what

352
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:38,810
you gotta have your mouse over the lake
and then gotta read the rain from right

353
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:43,889
to left slow and then you're gonna have
one clue and that's a lot of Engineers

354
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:48,930
think that they're going to teach people
how to sing and this is what our

355
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:53,480
customers want us to build so we build
these templates and education templates

356
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:59,290
are we color coat them for them and we
say ok we'll make them for you and we go

357
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:03,139
to a rather different awareness type of
events and one of the things that I hear

358
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:07,700
a lot of awareness professionals is if
you just make the content more engaging

359
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:13,100
if you don't use Times New Roman and you
use word I don't use red and you hired

360
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:17,399
artist that's the key that is the key to
getting people to look at your awareness

361
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:22,010
material and stop overfishing so I see a
lot of security professionals just kind

362
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:26,160
of whipping themselves thinking up I was
just better at heart I would get people

363
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:31,310
to really look at my education and stop
calling for fishing so we get tons of

364
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:36,590
requests from our content team because
most of our customers have some sort of

365
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:38,060
security awareness rollins'

366
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:42,159
side of the organization our customers
want videos they want infographics that

367
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:46,530
one static HTML they want translated
content we do it all

368
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:51,940
that's what they want and then we get
feedback based on this content and were

369
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,990
spending quite a bit of money we
probably spent a million and a half

370
00:27:54,990 --> 00:28:00,420
dollars a year on content creation
translation service and video animation

371
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:05,190
you name it we put a lot of effort into
this so our customers told us that the

372
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:11,260
bad guy in our training videos to
Chinese look so we had to go and we do

373
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:16,550
that and make him work less Chinese so
that was expensive but we got it not

374
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:22,010
have a super woman in our and our videos
they're like hey you did it you found

375
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:31,180
the fishing this is how you reported
Lori did you make her less alluring Mike

376
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:37,420
really means it was at the Cape is what
is it with just two alluring just toner

377
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:42,630
downright ok we're gonna go ahead
remaster that video and then get reach

378
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:49,700
translated into other languages to make
her West or worrying gold your scenarios

379
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:57,010
of two American cheese me what ya we
don't like the double room so you want

380
00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:02,620
us to read all the narrations in our
videos with a British accent please do

381
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:08,030
that ok you think this is the key to
getting people to stop calling for

382
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:13,290
official we're gonna go ahead and do
that are short video was 27 seconds

383
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:17,690
our longest videos about three minutes
and these things are tailored to teach

384
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:20,450
during that just occurred so it was an
attachment base fish

385
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:27,580
videos about attachment issues and so on
time spent on education so we're on a

386
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:30,659
piece of JavaScript to count how many
seconds

387
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:35,320
people spend consuming this video this
content we spend a lot of money on its

388
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:43,760
not too sexy not to Chinese not tutoring
and not to american and mass majority of

389
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:50,100
people are spending less than nine
seconds so they just built for sin area

390
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:59,070
and they're spending between 0 and nine
seconds to review this content whereas

391
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:06,360
concerning especially if your job as a
security awareness but is it there so

392
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:11,389
one of the things that we observe across
our data is doesn't matter for

393
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:15,740
susceptibility to susceptibility rates
are going down doesn't matter nine

394
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:19,480
seconds on the video its evidence is
right there in that susceptibility

395
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:25,770
report but why why is it that it's going
down not only is a susceptibility rates

396
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:27,450
improving

397
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:32,950
berated user reporting accuracy and
speed of reporting simulations is going

398
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:38,770
up our customers really tend to focus on
the susceptibility data are not

399
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:42,800
necessarily they will be really want to
drive that down so there are little

400
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,320
disheartened when they're doing their
campaigns and things are driving down

401
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:51,679
and then also there's a spike in April
gonna happen when we look at their

402
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:55,290
content more like well you chose a more
advanced scenario you send it to a

403
00:30:55,290 --> 00:31:00,690
population that hasn't had as much
exposure to it and you've been

404
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:03,530
traditionally doing clinical reason this
was an attachment

405
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:08,350
case scenario so that's that's to be
expected one of the trends our customers

406
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:14,189
don't always notice but we do try to
help pointed out to them is this is a

407
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:18,000
hard thing to measure you if you want to
be David Rabin you can just send the

408
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,590
same type of scenario over the course of
the year and you're gonna have a

409
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:25,990
beautiful general trend lying down we
recommend up in the sophistication every

410
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:30,970
single time in order to get them to
prepare to ward off early gains tax but

411
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:35,740
what even earlier scenarios are a little
bit old will replace the green trend

412
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:39,930
line is your rate of user reports so
these are people that have been

413
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:44,960
conditioned to spot suspicious email
that are reporting it to your writing

414
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,640
organizations is quick and a quicker
than they're falling for that so that is

415
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,240
absolutely a wintry

416
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:56,530
so what we want to do is show that hey
you you you you build an army of people

417
00:31:56,530 --> 00:32:00,520
that are a rare fishing they've
demonstrated they can try it and they

418
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:04,629
can tell you about it quickly that is
gold that is a new source of

419
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:09,880
intelligence that we didn't have before
inside of your own network and the story

420
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,610
repeats itself over and over again if
you look at customers that have reporter

421
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:19,669
install their ratings user reports far
outpaces the people that are falling for

422
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:27,780
that so is officially awareness the
problem I have a hard time believing

423
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:32,750
that it is especially in the modern era
we're hearing about hospitals falling

424
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:37,500
victim to phishing attacks Home Depot
sorry it's just in the news constantly

425
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:42,809
but I live in a bubble i living reef
fishing so there's a possibility that

426
00:32:42,809 --> 00:32:47,230
awareness isn't a problem so I said no
we're just gonna do a study we're gonna

427
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:53,240
commissioned a study and we're going to
targeted at people that work in email

428
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:57,750
days office workers who are not inside
the idea organization and are not in the

429
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:00,910
security department and we're going to
ask them one question are you where

430
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:04,590
fishing and depending on how they
respond we're gonna ask followup

431
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:10,980
questions to that so you know the study
goes on fishing is a term described to

432
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,690
describe this up to email designed to
infect your computer store your

433
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:19,950
passwords were you aware that poor
reading mister 15% 6.0% they said they

434
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:23,910
were not aware of that so you know we do
have some work to do

435
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:30,270
seventy-six percent said that they were
aware of repetition is at least 30

436
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:33,820
people are being honest I mean it's an
anonymous survey hopefully people were

437
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:39,780
able to admit when they don't do or
don't but this is just a small survey we

438
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:44,330
are going to a much larger warned it was
interesting to me is what I assumed to

439
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:49,960
be doing this was the vast majority of
office workers are aware of fishing

440
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:53,720
how could they not mean you're getting
so many communications about it not only

441
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:58,440
at work but it home from every credit
card vendor and bank that you work with

442
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:07,049
getting warnings about fishing right I
know we got started a little bit later

443
00:34:07,049 --> 00:34:11,300
running up 11 ch there will be no time
for questions at the end of this

444
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:17,310
presentation but I will be at our booth
you want to talk to you later so we ask

445
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:21,589
followup questions and the results were
a little bit mixed phishing emails

446
00:34:21,589 --> 00:34:26,060
contain attachments most believe that's
true they can take you to links to

447
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:28,529
websites again most believe that's true

448
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:32,450
phishing emails asking for information
on our website most believe that's true

449
00:34:32,449 --> 00:34:36,049
this one was a bit of you know do we
have a real human on the end of this

450
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:39,889
phishing emails come from people my
company thirty percent of them said

451
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:43,580
that's true that's a bit of a
head-scratcher unless they actually

452
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:48,848
doing fishing simulations at work that
one was interesting to me we also got

453
00:34:48,849 --> 00:34:52,490
some statistics on whether or not
employees are told how to report vision

454
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:57,009
mostar but the vast majority of
organizations are telling their

455
00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:03,930
employers for 290 department or order to
the spam alias at the organization and

456
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:07,990
which which usually doesn't you human
eyes are so the key findings were

457
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:12,580
seventy percent of people were aware of
fishing and most employees have

458
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:17,830
instructions on how to report suspicious
e-mail this doesn't really add up with

459
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:21,130
the other statistic that we hear over
time which is nine percent of breaches

460
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:26,190
start with fishing so people are more
Jordi Roura where fishing what ninety

461
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:29,580
percent of beaches are starting with
fishing maybe awareness isn't the

462
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:34,960
problem this is where I get a lot of
size from my colleagues cause I'm

463
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:40,030
actually suggesting something to them
that is very hard to do which is change

464
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:43,630
human behavior is one of the most
difficult things to do in so when I

465
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:46,730
suggest that they should have put any
effort into it

466
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:51,710
it's like I don't even want to hear that
I don't even want to hear that and it is

467
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:55,270
difficult to change human behavior I
know I have a history of cardiovascular

468
00:35:55,270 --> 00:36:00,180
disease my family yet I still want to
take us last night even though I

469
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:05,149
shouldn't have changing human behavior
is the rising data breach report came

470
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:09,960
out and there was some discussion about
it on read it so I got on reddit night I

471
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:14,880
joined in and because the rise of data
breach report basically said yeah

472
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,010
fishing the problem is gonna likely
remain the top problem and there were

473
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:24,130
some information security engineers
beatings like chimed in like a duck like

474
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:28,350
just a puppy just completely out of my
element my city if you think

475
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:30,640
conditioning humans to avoid fishin

476
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:35,190
shouldn't part of every organizations
hygiene overall braised beer and toast

477
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:40,750
year and this was what troops response
to me was I absolutely do not agree you

478
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:44,430
should be designing systems and networks
that cannot be compromised via phishing

479
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:49,430
attacks trying to train a bunch of
useless meet tubes to become to become

480
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:54,970
competent so I unfortunately I heard
this sentiment from a lot of information

481
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:59,270
security engineers and they desperately
want to engineer the fishing problem

482
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:02,710
away and a lot of them are just
frustrated angry that we're still have

483
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:07,160
fishing is a problem in 2006 and within
that you have to understand about

484
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:11,190
security engineers as they want to
engineer and they don't really care

485
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:15,670
about the human input into any system
they believe that this is an

486
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:19,290
intellectual challenge that they can
create something that can't be defeated

487
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:24,220
order seeing new official tactic in the
linear very specific solution to defend

488
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:29,470
against that really the fact that humans
interact with data system was the

489
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:33,660
complete inconvenience to their personal
security engineering model and topia

490
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:38,118
that they'd like to build put the genome
fortunate reality is data systems are

491
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:42,570
for us to use and it's not just an
intellectual exercise this evening

492
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:47,250
continued near Kirkuk system to keep bad
guys out there now I'm sorry look at

493
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,270
history

494
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:52,920
history shows that most the time when we
try to engineer a perfect system and we

495
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:58,340
ignore the human human is clever and
then figure out a way around the first

496
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:01,920
slot machines were defeated with a coin
and a strength

497
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,140
all right we're gonna fix that we're
gonna put optical sensors in the slot

498
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:09,000
machines and we're gonna start the way
these coins and this will be a

499
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,940
bulletproof system in a way that slot
machines actually payout is this

500
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:17,450
coins are going through a hopper and
depending on the amount of coins are

501
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:23,720
passed through knows what the panties
minutes tops out sounds like a pretty

502
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:29,290
foolproof system while this guy made a
device called might wander among keep

503
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:33,290
that was basically a LED on the
endeavour true but he would go up

504
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:39,200
through the coin dispenser hopper and it
would blind the optical sensor making it

505
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,899
say that it wasn't done risk the payout
to work this didn't happen then attend a

506
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:47,760
result of dumping all of the money out
of the system and if you look at

507
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:53,100
information security we are a road
littered with examples in our own domain

508
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:57,620
and its but it's not just our own domain
it's it's everywhere you look at email

509
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:01,589
has evolved it used to be able to say
and executables as attachments

510
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:05,590
well we figured out that was a bad idea
so what attackers do they sent screen

511
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:09,290
share files are files guess what thats
XQ by your computer

512
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:13,620
oh ok we're gonna walk that would
attackers do or innocence zip files

513
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,720
know what we're gonna blog zip files
what actors do next

514
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:21,600
they included password for the zip file
and they put the password in the body of

515
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:27,520
the email in order to to get past those
types of filters oh no what are we gonna

516
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:31,040
do about that when attackers started
sending cab files which is also an

517
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:36,080
archive system Windows know so there's
always this cat-and-mouse evolution I

518
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:39,990
wish that we can engineer the perfect
system but I accept the fact that we

519
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:45,200
can't show that guy on reddit he clearly
designed miss you didn't see any

520
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:51,089
problems with his his gate here in the
middle of the road from our sandboxes

521
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:52,220
the same thing

522
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:57,279
if you work at the evolution of the tax
and malware this work pretty good idea

523
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,720
is an attachment would analyze and it
reached out to something bad or did

524
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:05,649
something nefarious on the computer
reboots stopping however the attackers

525
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:10,390
figured out roll with your mouse for the
user to go to a website that the system

526
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:16,450
date how many cores are on that system
is a core i7 work only one core

527
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:21,109
processor to devote devoted to it maybe
it's a sandbox so there has been

528
00:40:21,109 --> 00:40:26,470
constant evolution of sandbox evasion
techniques for people that would love to

529
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:31,868
solve the haitian problem with complete
automated analysis and I just accept the

530
00:40:31,869 --> 00:40:35,500
fact from my information security
careers that the attacker were always

531
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,200
involves

532
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,480
around this so when I hear vendors
telling me that they stop fishing my

533
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:47,369
reaction is sure you do yesterday sesh
but what we gonna do about tomorrow /

534
00:40:47,369 --> 00:40:54,520
here's one that really angered them to
business email compromise and basically

535
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,470
it's an email

536
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:59,868
impersonating executive management to a
finance lease in handy you to wire money

537
00:40:59,869 --> 00:41:06,369
to this account please go do that and
increasing security where is the URL to

538
00:41:06,369 --> 00:41:11,150
analyze where's the attachment there
isn't one but there's no domains that

539
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:14,390
could have been a whitelisted no
application whitelisting no sandbox and

540
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:18,440
would have helped here and this is
caused billions of dollars in losses in

541
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:23,530
fact one company Ubiquiti Networks wired
out forty million dollars because of

542
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:29,599
this I'm so the security sandbox isn't
going to stop this or how about this one

543
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:31,260
this one is very fresh

544
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:35,260
this one's hitting lots of a chart
apartments right now just an email to

545
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:38,810
PHR department saying hey I need your W
two's for compliance rooms and suites

546
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:42,420
Melbourne Sydney and what RHR
departments all across the United States

547
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,310
doing right now

548
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:49,859
copy and paste thing plz W two's and
sending them to the attacker again

549
00:41:49,859 --> 00:41:54,040
there's this is very low tack and
there's really nothing that information

550
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:58,180
security engineering to stop this this
is playing multiple companies right now

551
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:04,940
I get a I get a lobster pritchard rates
are predictable response from the bottom

552
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:09,510
my colleagues lets the human it's the
dummy to there's nothing we could do to

553
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:10,810
fix that

554
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:18,270
so what do simulations do people say you
know sooner awareness but better this is

555
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:23,490
not a picture of our Bernie Sanders

556
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:30,080
this case and I credit the system for
Akamai kind of turning me on this he did

557
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:35,470
a lot of work in behavioral analysis
mostly to help marketing campaigns and

558
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:39,379
he was trying to figure out how humans
make decisions and what he did after

559
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:45,930
going through countless studies is he
realize you know what I'm going to

560
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:50,669
characterize the brain and how we make
decisions into two distinct ways system

561
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:55,270
one is defined as our intuitive brain
process and it operates automatically

562
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:59,410
and it's designed to help you avoid
decision to teach because every time you

563
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:03,549
use a congress function and have to do
in our asses it wears you out and so

564
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:06,930
your brain tries to protect you from
that it tries to help you identify

565
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:11,819
patterns and once it does identify a
pattern it tries to help you get through

566
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:16,250
that is quickly and painlessly as
possible the other part of our brain

567
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:22,320
that we used for a deliberate thinking
process he characterizes as system to me

568
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:26,270
and he said anytime that something
requires after a cognitive effort to

569
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:29,450
bring switching to another murder
process in order to deal with the

570
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:33,299
challenging task to get multiple
examples in his book

571
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:38,830
intuitive brain quick quick pattern
matching and then our system to

572
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:44,560
deliberate so how many emails do we
receive and have to deal with the day

573
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:48,970
radically did this study may do it every
year and unfortunately the amount of

574
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:54,000
emails that we have to cope with this
going up but on average we receive 171

575
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,700
rejecting emails a day we have to send
about 41 emails a day you must mentally

576
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:01,689
discard 14 emails Jonker is not

577
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:06,860
assuming that we have a lunch break in a
couple meetings that we have to attend

578
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:12,680
we performed 33 email related tasks per
hour that's a lot i mean how many of you

579
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:16,069
are supposed to be in a meeting painful
tension dial in but you're really

580
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:20,720
looking at email trying to make sure you
don't have much to deal with it at the

581
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:25,359
end of that meeting so we are distracted
we do have to do a lot of related tasks

582
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:29,220
during the day so I want you guys to
consider the following we're gonna do

583
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:34,220
some exercises in intuitive thinking and
then deliberate thinking the system one

584
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:51,129
vs system to so here we go out I can
deal with this paper supply as soon as

585
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:55,730
that member pumped up we had to make the
switch from system 12 system to a more

586
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:58,730
deliberate thinking process we're gonna
do it again

587
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:12,650
write your brain detector that pattern
knew what to do it went into full system

588
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:17,820
wondering that jolted out of system and
what we're gonna do is we're gonna

589
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:32,960
jolted into system to pop up on the
right side the grain to say wait a

590
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,410
minute this is not a pattern I can deal
with I need to use a different mode of

591
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:41,529
thinking in order to cope with this and
so that transition was the transition

592
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:49,900
that we needed to make to get into
system to process so our system ones and

593
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:53,359
twos are always active and this is how
we're trying to get through 33 email

594
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:59,500
related tasks per hour and we have to be
prepared to make the finals indicators

595
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:02,900
that jolt us out of system warning
system and that's really what

596
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:08,130
simulations do they expose people to
these concepts and these emotions and

597
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:11,630
these events that attackers are using to
get your employees to click on things

598
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:16,880
and to give them practice in making that
switch system one system to so this

599
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:21,150
image right here it should not trigger
system to nothing really out of the

600
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:25,040
ordinary met here there's nothing
dangerous this one should trigger system

601
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:29,390
to this guy is running with scissors
that is dangerous we should use a

602
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:32,400
different mode of thinking when
evaluating this picture is this picture

603
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:38,430
saying with emails that were interfacing
in her inbox so system 12 system to

604
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:42,919
success I was talking about that
business email copper mines and there

605
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:47,740
was something this went to our VP of
Finance impersonating our CEO is there a

606
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:51,399
couple things about this one row it
never is encouraging finance to send

607
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:56,619
money especially before bill is there a
number to the attacker would not have

608
00:46:56,619 --> 00:47:01,790
known is our our CEO just hate site I
don't he's crazy he was an injury and

609
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:07,770
this was my from my iPhone so our VP of
Finance he has a Samsung phone to use

610
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:09,240
like something's not right

611
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:13,859
it was that thing that was not read
those two pieces of information that

612
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:20,150
change this murder thinking from system
to system to that report so what you're

613
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:23,780
saying is simulations create experiences
using tactics similar to real phishing

614
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:27,970
email to Joel repetitively easy
intuitive cognitive functions into a

615
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:31,189
deliberate thinking process that
requires after this is why they don't

616
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:35,080
allow me to do our marketing campaigns
because this is what I would put in the

617
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:40,860
banner in our booth but apparently that
just doesn't roll off the tongue so when

618
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:45,260
I tell you a quick story we're gonna and
let guys let's watch system warning

619
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:49,800
system to switch over it doesn't always
work that's why I think it's crazy to

620
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:53,750
the DHS actually suggested that they
fire people are falling frustration

621
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:58,850
simulation specially on smeeting on the
mountain of evidence that I have so I

622
00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:04,480
was at the Derby Conn Louisville
Kentucky this past fall they're staying

623
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:10,700
in a modern hotel it was Embassy Suites
just built and it was very modern and

624
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:14,450
contemporary and i was just need to get
to the airport that morning I was

625
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:19,960
running a little bit behind and I was
run down the hallway and I decided that

626
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:25,420
I really should go to bathroom for a
head over and go through security so I'm

627
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:32,100
sitting there and I'm like wow very
clean bathrooms bathroom that's good for

628
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:37,830
them so I'm washing my hands and I am
rising know your nose in this bathroom

629
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:41,630
mats I guess that's just one of those
modern bathrooms and they're doing away

630
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:47,020
with urinals new design element and then
I started looking around that bathroom

631
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:50,450
and I saw this contraption on the wall

632
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:56,089
is bad and it was at that point when I
realized that I had made a critical

633
00:48:56,089 --> 00:49:01,259
mistake that my system one was in effect
that warning and it didn't know

634
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:05,619
deliberate or cognitive higher cognitive
functions and then I was definitely in

635
00:49:05,619 --> 00:49:09,400
the women's bathroom and I needed to
figure out a way to get out of there

636
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:15,310
quickly so yeah we we can't expect that
system run the system to transition to

637
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:16,200
happen

638
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:21,460
flawlessly every time but we definitely
need exercise the security curmudgeon

639
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:28,250
will say looking to get some people fail
summertime and I'm like it will work it

640
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:32,190
the reporting metric the vast majority
of your people are accurately

641
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:36,849
identifying and reporting phishing
emails and now you can do something

642
00:49:36,849 --> 00:49:39,970
about that so that's it

643
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:46,770
if you guys want to talk about this more
lbs please go get some lunch good news

644
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:51,280
you go tell everyone out there that
fishing awareness assault as I promise

645
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,740
you your employees are where fishing I
can't promise you that they've been

646
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:55,680
conditioned to avoid it
