6
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:57,718
and alright so this morning stock
putting the intelligence back and

7
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,500
threatened tell how many of you have
been hearing this this thread Intel buzz

8
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,660
word going around the industry lately

9
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,240
couple of us how many of you have had
vendor swoop in and the like by my list

10
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:14,369
of bad and there are there passing that
officer I didn't tell anybody that's

11
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:17,150
what we're going to talk about today is
putting the intelligence back and

12
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:25,030
threatened tell us a little bit about
myself and co-founder and one of the

13
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:29,630
principal consultants a tradition
information security we put the think

14
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:35,548
back into our we change we think too we
know I'm also a veteran of the United

15
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:41,350
States Navy are there any other veterans
and German ladies thank you very much

16
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,350
for your service is greatly appreciated

17
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:53,619
am also certified and stuff I'm a
certified Information Security Manager

18
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:58,040
and certified in the governance of
enterprise I T risk and information

19
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:05,690
systems control and the ever fun-filled
ISO 27001 information security

20
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:12,310
management Li I'm also an instructor in
mint or both with Aisaka and within the

21
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:15,060
industry

22
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,560
enough about me technical difficulty
here

23
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:38,620
intelligent analysis this does not come
from this comes from people behind the

24
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,380
keyboards monitoring looking at
reviewing assessing and making a

25
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:48,660
determination the primary purpose is to
provide information back to the business

26
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:56,250
so they can make a decision on course of
action that they can take some when we

27
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,440
talk about threat intelligence it means
a lot of things to a lot of different

28
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,320
people you've got the business
executives

29
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,650
the core folks that are looking from
security operations are looking for

30
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:20,890
IOC's risk managers ways to address
threats vulnerability management the

31
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:25,390
actual business units anybody in here
that they have business unit I travel

32
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:31,290
overseas are they talking to us about
what threats are in that we're seeing

33
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:35,900
when more overseas should they be yes
absolutely

34
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,640
are external partner so we're working
west

35
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:47,769
means something a little bit something
different everybody else some of the

36
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:55,440
common use cases for threat intelligence
early-warning we can use it for

37
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:01,620
strategic planning how we're going to
leverage that information during forming

38
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:06,660
a new business partnership during a
merger and acquisition capital

39
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:11,230
expenditures things that the business is
normally considered concerned about

40
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:19,488
using threat intelligence for
competitive operations anybody in here

41
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:23,330
and have a competitor in their industry
nobody

42
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:29,419
wow do you think that your business
units are watching what your competitors

43
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:32,740
are doing and adjusting for fire as a
court accordingly

44
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:41,590
absolutely finally security and
counterintelligence getting more into

45
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:46,900
the technical side so not only knowing
what our competitors are doing but also

46
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,280
looking out what our adversaries are
doing protecting our information and our

47
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,070
intellectual property protecting our
systems so we deal with a lot of the

48
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:02,040
fact that a lot of vendors are pushing
out these lists of bad we've got a list

49
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:07,270
of indicators a compromise we have list
of bad IP addresses we have bad known

50
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:13,440
bad domains but what does that actually
conveyed to the business doesn't bring

51
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:20,200
any additional value so part of this
talk and presentation came out the fact

52
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:27,349
that my frustrations list of bad
Wireless the bad lot of vendors taking

53
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:35,080
the cookie-cutter approach fit inside
this mold some of that came from folks

54
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,409
not actually understanding the full
capabilities of how threat intelligence

55
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:41,729
to be applied within their organization

56
00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:45,449
not understanding that the threats that
are out there are actually legitimate

57
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:51,279
and real and we'll talk about those
little bit later again this attempt for

58
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:57,308
one size fits all when it comes to
threat intelligence and the fact that a

59
00:05:57,309 --> 00:06:01,129
lot of people things that it takes a lot
of money to be able to do threat

60
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:05,400
intelligence and there's some quick and
easy wins that you can take within your

61
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:11,159
organization so what exactly a threat
intelligence threat intelligence

62
00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:17,270
analysis like ultimately that's like
having a puzzle with all the different

63
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:22,419
pieces light out without a puzzle box to
actually give you the direction that you

64
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:30,058
need power with strong analysis you can
put together the pictures so before we

65
00:06:30,059 --> 00:06:32,919
get into the details on how to succeed
let's talk about some common pitfalls

66
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:37,979
and ways to fail at present tell you not
understanding what threat intelligence

67
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:43,210
is and how can be leveraged within your
organization not understanding the

68
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,520
threat actors

69
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,430
not understanding what motivates a sweat
actor to initiate a campaign against

70
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:54,500
your organization why an organization
might be targeted understanding the

71
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,770
difference between being a target of
opportunity and being the direct and

72
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:03,770
target automatically jumping to
conclusions when you find the first

73
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:06,830
piece of evidence you see that IP
address that comes out of Shanghai

74
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:19,250
automatically we think what adversaries
and where China not having the basic

75
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:23,810
information security hygiene and
practices in place so before we start

76
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,949
talking about doing threat intelligence
are we doing the basics of blocking and

77
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:32,229
tackling do we have that basic common
foundation to build on and be able to

78
00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:40,770
leverage just like other scary practices
there is no silver bullet when it comes

79
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:44,060
to threat intelligence there are no
turnkey solutions

80
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:48,819
there are no magic unicorns so if
anybody was coming here hoping for that

81
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:51,080
answer today I do apologize

82
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:56,770
there are none threat intelligence like
anything else is comprised of people

83
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:03,139
processes and technology on the
personnel side you have a wide gamut who

84
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:07,139
you can actually be engaging with it can
be folks within a security operation

85
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:15,569
center network operations center
executives business unit leaders folks

86
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:20,960
that have come from both a technical or
non-technical background that's key when

87
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,419
it comes to dealing with foreign
intelligence because it presents how you

88
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:29,198
present the data to your audience is how
they're going to consume it so if you're

89
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,849
talking a bunch of jargon to the
Executive c-suite are do you think

90
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:36,659
they're going to understand that
probably not right

91
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:45,209
doesn't go over well from the process
side one of the key things to understand

92
00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:48,619
when we start talking about threat
intelligence and this is where we spend

93
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:53,339
a lot of our time a tradition helping
executives understand is the necessity

94
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:59,939
for planning we're talk a little bit
about this later on the need for being

95
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:04,089
able to define what the intelligence
requirements are what is it as an

96
00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:10,269
executive or business unit leader should
I be concerned about that I need to know

97
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:15,999
answers to in order to be able to make
those business decisions that will allow

98
00:09:15,999 --> 00:09:20,870
the analyst to go out and collect the
information processing analyzed that

99
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:25,639
specific information does me no good to
go out and analyze something that my

100
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:33,589
executives are not concerned about
technology there are a lot of different

101
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:38,689
technologies that can be applied for
threat intelligence finding the one that

102
00:09:38,689 --> 00:09:41,730
best suits your organization and what I
tell a lot of organizations that are

103
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:46,350
just stepping into threat intelligence
you don't need to spend millions of

104
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:50,600
dollars doing the US there are a number
of capabilities that you already have

105
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,959
in-house that if you just start applying
some some basic processes and techniques

106
00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:01,250
you can get that same information from
your local systems or you can go out

107
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:07,779
make the capital expense and spend the
money doesn't matter dad understanding

108
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:12,120
the threat actors when it comes to
working with Android intelligencia

109
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,759
multiple threat actors ranging from the
the nation state all the way down to

110
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:22,399
Long gunmen these reactors have a
mission they have an objective and more

111
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,449
importantly they understand they also
have consumers and customers are on

112
00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:30,889
their end and they are sufficiently
motivated to find a way to get what they

113
00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:32,520
want

114
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:37,180
on the other side of that one of the key
things that we like to drive home is you

115
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:42,349
have zero influence over an adversary
choosing to select in target you as an

116
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:54,890
organization not a recall on the left we
see a pair of high-heeled shoes does he

117
00:10:54,890 --> 00:11:00,400
may see that as a threat and on the
right does anybody know who that is

118
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,060
still too early in the morning

119
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:14,810
Anakin Skywalker is that a threat not
yet so I heeled shoes were actually

120
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:19,689
created using a 3d printer to hide
components used for a pen tossed

121
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:28,330
corporate espionage held a ATP laying
hold external hard drives could use to

122
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:34,160
access the network wirelessly and gain
in of course everybody knows what

123
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,010
happened with Darth Vader not all
threats are equal

124
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:47,260
is this a thread the Ashley Madison

125
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:54,210
so last year we were working multiple
investigations and one of things that we

126
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:58,220
do is we we look out for a number of our
our business partners we look out for

127
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:03,570
and help them when we see something like
this because what happens normally

128
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:19,460
following a high profile data breach
anyone we found your data on the Ashland

129
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:24,260
Madison data base pay us some Bitcoin
and we'll we'll keep it from getting

130
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:31,030
public so when this happened we actually
reached out to a number of our our folks

131
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:37,560
that had I was approximately 17
organizations that had over eighty email

132
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:42,369
addresses that were tied to their domain
now from a technical aspect Ashley

133
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:46,540
Madison did not do any verification on
that email address you signed up with

134
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,500
that email address

135
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:52,260
it automatically was tied to that
account I can go up and set it up as

136
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:57,530
Obama whitehouse.gov and I would be
Obama whitehouse.gov for my login there

137
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:04,890
was no verification 12 organizations had
reached back out to us once we alerted

138
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:10,470
them to this and this was a small subset
that not only do they see the folks that

139
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:15,550
we had identified but they started
seeing folks that were not in that that

140
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:21,050
original Dom senior leadership within
our organization chart getting similar

141
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,050
emails

142
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,609
something that once they had the
information they could take action on so

143
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:35,440
they started blocking those those emails
before they even hit the the desktop so

144
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,040
again

145
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,900
combination of identifying threats in
organizations and mining that data

146
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:45,180
getting that information to start
putting together that that puzzle

147
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:48,910
together information from public and
open sources

148
00:13:50,020 --> 00:14:00,490
bulletins / reports from the FBI alerts
and more importantly your own logs for

149
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:05,940
successful threatened now says you need
to have those requirements they have to

150
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,960
be defined what is it that i'm looking
for to be able to provide you

151
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:16,580
information on you have to have
definitive focus you can't get pulled

152
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:23,839
into a tangent and things start down a
rabbit hole you need support and this is

153
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:31,750
gonna come in the ways of staffing
training and education is gonna come in

154
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:39,460
the ways of management's reinforcement
of what they want done by supporting him

155
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:45,260
making it a priority understanding what
threat intelligence says and how it's

156
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:51,779
going to be applied within your
organization and most

157
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:57,370
importantly objectivity you have to
remain objective you have to start with

158
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:01,040
a blank slate just because the ip
address says it's from China doesn't

159
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:08,379
mean your adversaries in China developed
and developing and defining the

160
00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:11,920
requirements and I like to use this this
letter in this is the letter from George

161
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:18,309
Washington to colonel Dayton during the
Revolutionary War and Marquis things to

162
00:15:18,309 --> 00:15:23,420
to pull out from it is general
washington is asking for very specific

163
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:30,180
information what kind of troops do they
have what kind of car do they have are

164
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:35,120
they focused are they 24 by seven or are
they working eight to five what is our

165
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,879
strength do they have tended their
fifteen do they have a thousand again

166
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:47,160
very specific information that's being
requested this hasn't changed when it

167
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:54,329
comes to threat intelligence because
once you start having that you can start

168
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:58,859
framing out the picture you can start
putting together those pieces of the

169
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:09,100
puzzle focus finding those answers you
have to be able to focus in on those

170
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:13,660
threats both at a high level and
granular being able to move between the

171
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:21,649
two being able to answer the who the
where the why the what and how from the

172
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:29,319
defined intelligence requirements now we
talk about aggregating a lot of

173
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:35,069
different information processing it
based upon your operating environment

174
00:16:35,069 --> 00:16:41,589
the key point being the analysts once we
get the information in short funneling

175
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:47,569
that down to what we call the actionable
intelligence being able to take action

176
00:16:47,569 --> 00:16:51,229
being able to make decisions and how
that's applied across tactical

177
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:55,829
operational and strategic methods again

178
00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:03,940
building out the the the rest of the
puzzle focus starts bringing things

179
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,190
interview

180
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:11,690
the support aspect we had on this little
bit earlier you're going to need

181
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:19,230
different types of support you need
staffing threat intelligence just

182
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:25,780
doesn't happen you're gonna need staff
here I need training education and sadly

183
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,260
when it comes to threat intelligence
there's only about four different

184
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:32,520
organizations that offer training
traditional be offering training

185
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:37,840
following the summit on threat
intelligence fundamentals you can also

186
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,760
sign up for a Sams course or crest
there's not very many of us out there

187
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:52,100
you're gonna absolutely need budget
infrastructure doesn't just become

188
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:57,090
available while you're in New Jersey it
comes off the back of a truck but you're

189
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:01,600
going to need money and funding for
training for infrastructure for staffs

190
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:09,290
resources to be able to accomplish your
mission now you're not going to fully

191
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:12,330
dedicated data center forthright
intelligence but you're in need some

192
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:19,800
definitive processing power getting into
the understanding being able to answer

193
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,280
those questions for the executive so
that way you are

194
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:30,520
state staying on target so threat actors
had to use a stock image because this is

195
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:34,430
what all three actors look like right
now we're going to get a little bit

196
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:42,430
deeper into this so we'll talk about
their motivations you have the Hollywood

197
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:46,930
romanticized hacker that doesn't
actually exist they're the ones that

198
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:51,320
have the f5 McCarron their keyboard that
hacks into whatever agency they need to

199
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,439
break into at the push of a button

200
00:18:53,440 --> 00:19:00,010
script kiddies these are folks driven by
curiosity their ego

201
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:08,020
along gunmen typically driven and
motivated by financial gain

202
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:17,520
give your hacktivists they want to draw
attention they want recognition for

203
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:25,940
their cause what they're doing criminal
syndicates typically motivated for

204
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:32,840
financial gain no big surprise they want
money and then your nation states

205
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:39,399
typically they want to geopolitical edge
they want to gain a way to to leverage

206
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,410
that information for their own agenda
whether that's through cutting their

207
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:48,740
research and development time on a
product that's competing or getting the

208
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:55,170
latest and greatest dirt to negotiate
and in their strength during a talk with

209
00:19:55,170 --> 00:20:04,100
a competitor or a nation's day their
capabilities will differ so script

210
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:12,280
kiddies may have a homemade lab some
extra time on YouTube Metasploit social

211
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:19,350
media lone gunman they abused they tend
to abuse their level of trust that's

212
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:24,610
provided in brand to them they'll have
access to sensitive information and as a

213
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:31,469
result of using that that trust they're
able to execute their their goals again

214
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:36,530
typically for financial gain activists

215
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:42,559
sheer volume in numbers associated with
some of these groups is what allows them

216
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:50,920
to their their crowdsourcing their
efforts criminal syndicates they're

217
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:56,280
motivated they had access to resources
they're investing in their

218
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:01,600
infrastructure in fact if if if you want
to go as far as if they were on if they

219
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,570
were legitimate business they would be
on the Fortune 500 lest they run very

220
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:07,470
much so

221
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:15,059
like a business nation states again

222
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:19,690
motivated they're developing resources
internally externally there pulling from

223
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:29,610
different areas and they have skilled
staff and then we'll get into Hollywood

224
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:35,360
romanticize hackers these are the folks
that when you watch him on TV than the

225
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,770
combination of Yoda Sheldon Cooper
Einstein Isaac Newton Stephen Hawking

226
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:42,840
which gladly give a CSI cyber

227
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:52,429
activity and threat intelligence
analysis stop jumping to conclusions

228
00:21:52,429 --> 00:22:00,850
looking at what information what
artifacts what evidence the facts that

229
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:09,980
are available and understanding that we
have biases where we try to make sense

230
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:17,779
out of chaos which can take us down some
pretty deep rabbit holes so up here

231
00:22:17,779 --> 00:22:29,360
we've got eight pictures anybody up here
see a fog Yes No

232
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:41,700
now we have the skull where we have the
two girls sitting and playing which has

233
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:55,830
it again we attempt to put order to
chaos and it causes us to see things

234
00:22:55,830 --> 00:23:04,449
that may not necessarily be there or
miss things that are there so when we

235
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:09,340
talk about intelligence analysis general
powell set up bass tell me what you know

236
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:16,330
tell me what you don't tell me the
difference between the two are as I like

237
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:22,269
to say it why analysis really matters
not that we would ever be put in that

238
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:23,690
position

239
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:29,620
correct the way we do it is by
leveraging some fundamental scientific

240
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:35,469
theories and practices running through
the scientific process to be able to

241
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:41,879
ensure our objectivity ensure that we're
considering all the possible backs

242
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:46,870
considering different ways that things
could be so that way we make the best

243
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:50,928
informed decision and provide that
information up to our executives in our

244
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:56,129
leadership so we'll talk real quickly
about three different types but there's

245
00:23:56,129 --> 00:23:59,879
multiple different types of analysis
methods when it comes to assessing data

246
00:23:59,879 --> 00:24:04,580
and information today we'll talk about
the analysis competing hypotheses

247
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:08,710
hypotheses the diamond model for
intrusion the social network analysis

248
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:23,179
the ACH model ensures that we focus on
disapproving any potential additional

249
00:24:23,179 --> 00:24:30,500
hypotheses was originally developed back
in the seventies it was designed for the

250
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:34,039
purpose of addressing problems with
intuitive intelligence analysis

251
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:37,789
predominate driven by human psychology

252
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:47,830
so again pushing those those personal
cognitive biases those way we in france

253
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:52,850
things just because of the fact the IP
address China the adversary must be from

254
00:24:52,850 --> 00:25:00,230
China were forcing to relook at the
information were forcing our analyst to

255
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:05,880
go back and come up with other ways of
what might be instead of just going off

256
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:11,720
at face value because of the fact that
reasoning is subjective

257
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,639
forces psychology in order for rent both

258
00:25:16,639 --> 00:25:22,240
and confirmation biases don't find a
solution to the problem find out what

259
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:36,419
the problem is so based upon evidence
that you may get within an investigation

260
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:41,169
being able to compare those hypotheses
of what may be driving and finding the

261
00:25:41,169 --> 00:25:44,950
one that has the least amount of
inconsistencies based upon the

262
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:54,659
hypothesis these will run from very
inconsistent with a situation to very

263
00:25:54,659 --> 00:26:00,889
consistent with the situation but as you
can see very limited evidence based on

264
00:26:00,889 --> 00:26:06,100
multiple hypotheses you can see what the
number of least inconsistencies it's

265
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:13,820
probably in that that one category over
here on the left by a model for

266
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:22,029
intrusion analysis can be leveraged
during and post intrusions however one

267
00:26:22,029 --> 00:26:25,620
of the key things to remember with the
diamond model is it means you're pretty

268
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:30,350
much been owned that means you're
working off of artifacts within your

269
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:34,379
environment and unless you're sharing
information with other organizations to

270
00:26:34,379 --> 00:26:38,750
be able to pick up on some of those
IOC's or some of those behaviors are

271
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,340
tactics and techniques

272
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:53,689
may not be of great benefit to the way
the diamond model works relationship

273
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:57,330
between the victim the adversary
infrastructure in their case the

274
00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:04,799
adversaries capability victim identified
some malware that identifies the

275
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:09,789
capability of the adversary malware
contains a command-and-control domain

276
00:27:09,789 --> 00:27:14,850
which ties back to the adversaries
infrastructure the main resolves to the

277
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:23,189
IP address again this is going back to
infrastructure this provides information

278
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:27,990
on how we can take action so now we know
we have bad domains and IP addresses can

279
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:34,750
take action on that and ultimately that
provides information back onto the

280
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:44,210
adversary social network analysis being
able to identify clusters and networks

281
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:49,520
of groups within an organization within
a a subset of users that way we can

282
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,649
identify what some of the commonalities
are who's communicating to who

283
00:27:53,649 --> 00:28:01,178
how they're communicating how many of us
have ever seen this before but you know

284
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:10,440
what this is the raw TCP network traffic
within an organization we can pull

285
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:14,080
information out of that as far as who's
communicating if you have the proper

286
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,000
instrumentation sensors placement whose
communicating but this right here

287
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,570
doesn't buy a lot of value doesn't a
social network analysis can take this

288
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:30,029
information and quickly visualize it and
as you can see there's a number of

289
00:28:30,029 --> 00:28:36,830
systems internally and this is within a
a user workspace that are communicating

290
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:42,149
internally now should there ever be a
necessity for a user's workstation to

291
00:28:42,149 --> 00:28:46,979
communicate with another user's
workstation directly now that that's bad

292
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:53,919
right so based on some information that
we collect from a centralized logging

293
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:58,610
system we were able to identify the
existence of a botnet that had started

294
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:06,250
operating within the user's environment
analysis by the information back to be

295
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:10,130
able to take a decision we need to
remove these systems offline reimage I'm

296
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:22,570
we don't clean so we we wipe the drives
trained staff threat intelligence

297
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:28,678
analysts don't grow on trees in fact as
it turns

298
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:37,220
doubt intelligence analyst develop their
skills over years of time not days and

299
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:40,759
if your commercial sector you're
probably gonna be best with finding

300
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:44,999
somebody that's got two to three years
experience in the threat intelligence

301
00:29:44,999 --> 00:29:47,999
area as a domain a profession

302
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:57,809
intelligence analyst have to be able to
focus on technical and non-technical

303
00:29:57,809 --> 00:30:03,600
threats because not all threats that
come in are going to be and I hate to

304
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:11,369
use the term cyber a change in
legislation is that going to be a threat

305
00:30:11,369 --> 00:30:14,809
to an organization

306
00:30:14,809 --> 00:30:28,350
absolutely absolutely it is analyst can
quickly become overwhelmed especially in

307
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:32,309
the technical space were pulling data
from local sources were getting

308
00:30:32,309 --> 00:30:35,129
inundated with information all the time

309
00:30:35,129 --> 00:30:39,039
anybody in here have an inbox that
doesn't have at least 200 unread email

310
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:51,270
messages right now one we get quickly
inundated with information so leveraging

311
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:57,780
challenges then were overloaded we have
to address the quality of work what's

312
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:03,950
the quality of the information that
we're going to get is it reliable is it

313
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:08,550
relevant organisation is it relevant to
our intelligence requirements are

314
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:13,360
executives have given us or is it
something that we can discard for the

315
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,250
moment

316
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:21,230
trust can we trust the information that
we're getting what it

317
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:27,730
adversary ever provide a false flag red
herring or attempt to deceive you and

318
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:36,220
your process of trying to track them
down maybe and again the necessity to

319
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:41,350
keep that focus by having these in
overcoming overcoming the challenges and

320
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:48,100
having the core skill sets you can start
to build out that additional picture of

321
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:55,110
what you're trying to gee you're putting
the pieces of the puzzle together and

322
00:31:55,110 --> 00:32:00,389
you're being able to make a more
well-informed decision instead of just

323
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:05,880
making one in shooting from the hip when
it comes to threat intelligence products

324
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:13,310
can we talked about the operational the
tactical and strategic application we

325
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:20,320
can talk to the executive level
strategic planning what campaigns were

326
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:25,550
seen as irinnews fam campaigners are a
new ransomware campaign that's going on

327
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:33,919
has anybody had to deal with ransomware
nobody 12 ok we're going to get more

328
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:38,580
people if we can identify these
campaigns early on and get out and

329
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:43,520
prevent them from getting into
organizations we reduce the impact

330
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,520
organizations yes

331
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:54,110
that intelligence from the tactical side
we can put those access control lists

332
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:59,590
and play we can block domains we can
block that adversary infrastructure we

333
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:05,189
can keep that information and leverage
it to you again

334
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:09,840
protecting reduce the risk of the
organization from an operational side

335
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:14,540
once we get that information we can
start actively hunting for threats and

336
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:21,430
side of our environment has already
entered into our organization what we've

337
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:24,760
got the right information we can
actively seek and heart and find them

338
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:38,320
again continuing as a threatened analyst
to build up that picture that I can

339
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:45,939
not stressed the necessity of remaining
objective when you're conducting your

340
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:53,710
analysis challenge your initial thoughts
your initial theories don't just

341
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:58,200
arbitrarily believe that just because
you see this information that that's

342
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:10,940
going to be the end all be all
ultimately can always blame these guys

343
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:15,450
in fact is anybody in here never

344
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:18,578
been asked to attribute an attack for
the organization

345
00:34:20,609 --> 00:34:29,879
12 so if you have issues and you need
somebody to blame go out to who hacked

346
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:36,848
us dot com and it will provide you the
information on who actually know this is

347
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:42,950
a little tongue-in-cheek but this goes
back to the necessity for having

348
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:50,540
intelligent analysis being able to focus
in being able to line up all the

349
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:57,520
information again to make the best and
most well-informed decision for the

350
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,520
executives to be able to execute

351
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:16,609
is just because you think you have the
answers

352
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:24,430
doesn't mean it's always going to be
exactly what you think so in closing how

353
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:34,600
to succeed again sharing information
being able to drive out those

354
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:41,279
requirements early on the ability to
remain objective based on the evidence

355
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,340
that you were seeing and you're
witnessing being able to understand what

356
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:51,660
the motivations are about the relevant
fractures are you target of opportunity

357
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:58,020
for you to direct target being able to
get that level support from your

358
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:01,759
organization's these are going to be
things that will help you succeed and

359
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:09,920
threat intelligence analysis is
ultimately get a vendor who just pushing

360
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:20,130
a list of bad they're really just the
honey boo boo threatened to kill list of

361
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:23,099
bad indicators

362
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:31,200
remise high sets are not threat
intelligence they just aren't if a

363
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:36,279
vendor is trying to push this on to you
I challenge you to ask them one question

364
00:36:36,279 --> 00:36:42,400
one question alone why is this a threat
to me why is a threat to my organization

365
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,509
the vendor can answer that question

366
00:36:45,509 --> 00:36:48,819
chances are the quality of their
information while it might look nice and

367
00:36:48,819 --> 00:36:54,410
the glossy report lots bye bye charts
and and bar graphs if they can't answer

368
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:58,999
why it's a threat to your organization
you have to question the quality of

369
00:36:58,999 --> 00:37:05,118
their analysis if they're trying to put
you in you and your organization into a

370
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:11,420
cookie-cutter mold it's not going to
benefit you greatly as you can you

371
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:21,039
actually do the analysis so and that has
any questions comments

372
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:28,569
rotten eggs made us know now that

373
00:37:29,329 --> 00:37:40,049
that is what the show alright well enjoy
the rest of the conference make sure you

374
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:46,940
swing by and thank connie for all her
work this year's done here and have a

375
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:47,119
good day
