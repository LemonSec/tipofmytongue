1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,319
when I was over Sherman I'm Juniper
Networks I run all be systems engineer

2
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:12,110
so yes commercial space and I'm also a
skilled advocate for software automation

3
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:16,410
whatever that means right will cover
that today but I kinda want to talk to

4
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:21,310
is software-defined secure network which
sounds like a great architecture but

5
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:25,119
hopefully walk you through kind of what
that means my goal in life is not to get

6
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,519
through slides I realize I'm between you
guys and lunch so I'll try to keep it

7
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:31,880
somewhat entertaining and hopefully
informative but we are going to talk

8
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,210
about a bunch of different stuff so kind
of sit back relax and start off with

9
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:40,239
something that has absolutely nothing to
do with what I'm gonna talk about as

10
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:47,519
much attention and focus in the year
2000 Microsoft surveyed 2,000 Canadians

11
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,670
and found out the average attention span
of a human being with about 12 seconds

12
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:57,570
fast forward 2013 we've actually dropped
four seconds to attention span of eight

13
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:03,489
seconds and this is really due to a weak
all weapons of mass distraction but

14
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:07,679
thats Twitter whatever hear your voices
on your phone accessories and that's

15
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,710
really caused cause us to drop focus
there's actually an animal out there

16
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:19,210
that has an attention span longer than
the average human being and that's a

17
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:24,979
goldfish attention span engineer
technically it's their memory but let's

18
00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:30,908
go with that for a minute but the next
23 years at current pace will finally

19
00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:34,840
thanks to our wonderful devices which
were Buddhist monks have wanted us to do

20
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:41,659
for years which is live in the moment so
really how often do you check your phone

21
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:53,000
per day or per per hour so he's kind of
a survey we did of India's and it says

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,860
you check your phone an average time for
you three times four day I found out

23
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:01,790
millennia are I don't fall in that
category and hopefully this doesn't fall

24
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:05,409
into what we have today but the meetings
boring enough I can check it for you

25
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:10,039
three times per meeting here is kind of
how many times you look at your phone

26
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:16,069
per week they say fifteen hundred times
you do the math that works out to 214

27
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:17,250
times per day

28
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:21,900
12.6 times an hour for every four point
eight minutes so kind of the point here

29
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:27,090
is that we've kind of society as
networks have grown and changed have

30
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:33,060
utilize these devices and how we look at
things its are its are XO brain if you

31
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:38,090
will that we we we look at we depend on
these devices and hopefully will miss

32
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:43,019
the mark on his presentation but here's
some statistics the last minute and a

33
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:50,410
half words about what those flights take
Tappan 204 million emails have been sent

34
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:55,340
it over YouTube downloads etcetera and
these are stats that we're pretty

35
00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:01,980
comfortable with what's scary is if you
look at how many new malware infections

36
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:07,299
were put out per day what the cost for
breaches and all these things this is

37
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:14,209
becoming normal think about a week ago
we had a report on the health care died

38
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:19,599
gov website was hacked and there was
record stolen nobody would react to that

39
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:25,000
was becoming commonplace and it's an
interesting world we're living in now to

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:33,150
where we don't really expect that so
it's not really a if it's a win for the

41
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:38,190
complexities are that as a c-level
executive in a nightie firm you have a

42
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:42,109
very short period of time to determine
whether you're on attack and how to

43
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:47,129
react and here with says every seven
minutes but you know this is some of the

44
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:51,010
some countries in Europe and I'm a big
proponent of sixty-five percent of

45
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:56,750
statistics are made up on the fly but
it's a very short period of time the

46
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:01,720
challenge is what we call
signal-to-noise ratio the more things we

47
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,540
put into the network to more data we get
the more logs we have more things we

48
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:10,048
have to make a decision off of and it's
exponentially challenging

49
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:17,940
how I react what's my business impact
it's becoming increasingly difficult to

50
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,029
virtualization we've had virtualization
on servers and things for a long time

51
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:24,039
and other networks trying to follow suit

52
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,790
we have satellite TV eating all the
different cloud services that are out

53
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:33,660
there if I don't like what's in my
network over by something else we're

54
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,900
looking at you know what increases as
far as cost wise but it's not really the

55
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:42,138
cost of increasing it's also a business
now used to be back in the night script

56
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:45,580
kiddies gotta go to face a website but
now there's actually a business

57
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:50,900
development there's project timelines
all in the hacking community and it's

58
00:04:50,900 --> 00:05:00,310
quite interesting what what's happening
these days we as a community think the

59
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,199
fastest way to solve the problem is to
keep doing what we've always been doing

60
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,699
add more services at more of you know
the the security component days you're

61
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:13,970
and not change the paradigm of how we're
looking at things and the way we address

62
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:19,210
that is we keep pouring more money into
security meaning that we had something

63
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:23,260
else in the perimeter we had another you
know service we had another detection

64
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:30,389
mechanism we had another another
component and it's like it's like home

65
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:34,470
security we know that all the true all
the things are already inside your

66
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:38,250
network but we're adding more cameras
Morlock's more sensors in the front door

67
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:47,580
if I think back ten years ago and I've
been would you prefer long time we were

68
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:54,090
saying SSL VPN product and the key there
was we assume that when somebody was on

69
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,190
premise they could be trusted

70
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:02,800
they had a laptop they had in proximity
but when they left proximity went to a

71
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,470
Starbucks perhaps like the medical
profession they had different access or

72
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:12,060
if they weren't in compliance with what
we're doing we're able to cut the month

73
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,210
single user but now we look at things in
the perimeter we assume that's an alarm

74
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:20,159
system that's good enough when you look
at where attacks recovering from there

75
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,260
insider networked what's happened
between the time we issue in corporate

76
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:30,440
laptops are now and I know it's not a
surprise to anyone is BYO D but we never

77
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,680
thought about what that means are we
have we assume that we can't deal with

78
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:42,420
it and we can also we look at risk as
far as what will cost us to mitigate as

79
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:47,100
opposed to the cost of the business
outcome I spent twenty six months and

80
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:51,610
the education vertical and if you look
at what business outcomes mean there in

81
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:57,660
k-12 for instance it means Common
Criteria requires that you bring some

82
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:02,910
kind of learning experience but what
most CSO's a look at it from an attack

83
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:08,130
perspective is it my network isn't
active I guess it's going to cost me you

84
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:11,610
know I'm average of fifteen to twenty
million dollars because I have to now

85
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:15,750
get everybody credit protection if I'm
gonna PCI compliant environment I have

86
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:19,410
to make sure all those records get
pulled back and eccentric southerners

87
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:25,870
costs and fine but when I don't look at
his eyes shut down that learning per day

88
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:29,800
maybe I have to cut myself off the
internet and now I'm essentially having

89
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:35,790
an Internet snow day but I'm not
delivering the services I want retail is

90
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:39,740
a great example as well especially I
could I can eat Taylor if your network

91
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,169
goes down you can count by the second
how much money or losing right those are

92
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:51,919
the things we look at and do this is
fact attackers are always gaining so we

93
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,340
continue to do the trust model and we
think it's inside is it secure

94
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,690
everything its upside is not so we keep
winning perimeter firewall in place or

95
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:03,040
with command control traffic on the way
with things are being hacked will look

96
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:08,150
at it from a prospective somebody went
out and tried to push them they doubt

97
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:12,739
may we stop today we did maybe IPS
picked it up and this is becoming more

98
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,740
complex

99
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:25,390
now server-side folks use orchestration
and automation and have been for a long

100
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,130
time

101
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:31,380
set up systems to build systems attacker
certainly do it because the cost of an

102
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:36,370
attack we will look at them and we're
all security guys I think here and we

103
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:40,240
can look at the way the TAC is built
right from scripting defining

104
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,420
vulnerabilities to then executing cetera
but shouldn't your network automation to

105
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:51,569
release or to tax and I'm gonna take a
step back had to use that I couldn't

106
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:58,010
resist putting the Back to the Future
DeLorean in a slide but i wanna talk

107
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:04,080
about the network from the ground up
meaning not just from a how can I use it

108
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,570
to help better detect what are the
problems that we have today that we

109
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:11,100
haven't really addressed yet talked
about deployments and I'll talk about

110
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,670
integration this whole thing we call
DevOps and then kind of some

111
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:18,939
architectures that kind of a window open
software stack and I'll definitely try

112
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:24,380
to keep that from a Juniper commercial
although I will have to put a little bit

113
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:29,189
this is a really old slide if you notice
Thursday nights on there from two

114
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:36,080
thousand and one problem is the old
slide you'll statistics these things

115
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,700
haven't been addressed the talks about
consistency and human error in networks

116
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:47,420
or in software even that downtime is
caused by this configurations

117
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:52,040
vulnerabilities are caused by this
configuration in fact we did a study in

118
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,040
2013

119
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:03,350
academic institutions think they have
the abilities due to this configurations

120
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:07,930
and it was 75% noting that number varies
depending industry depending on what you

121
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:13,390
do but if you look at what those things
are their simple things

122
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:21,390
SNMP strings inconsistent meal and
inconsistent passwords and it's

123
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:25,470
interesting how much this still exist
and now it's becoming even more and more

124
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:32,130
critical if I can get hijacked your
switch or router and put a VPN tunnel go

125
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:36,390
wherever and start to suck up all your
traffic and put it into my into my

126
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:40,340
system and start to analyze that that's
a big problem and it's really not that

127
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:47,520
hard to do we do have an hour

128
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:52,140
opportunity to look at this and look at
it from a templating point of view

129
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,120
actually put up the tool that we must
use for templating with just the

130
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,449
high-tech tool called notepad windows or
whatever system you happen to use RBI

131
00:11:03,449 --> 00:11:09,508
for Linux BSD guy but I intentionally
put the curly bracket replacement

132
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:15,300
earbuds a program programa way to solve
this problem we have heard of a language

133
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:21,508
called price on it works with a template
language culture into two and I won't go

134
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:25,100
down too far into the weeds but we can
use these two files putting together

135
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:31,980
programmatically and were able to build
consistent configurations not that the

136
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:37,189
things of the past of notepad and Excel
haven't worked for us but end of the day

137
00:11:37,189 --> 00:11:42,839
you step into this before you can
control C Ctrl V Ctrl C Ctrl V at about

138
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:47,480
ten times a loser brain in the human
body kicks and then we go okay now

139
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,860
starting to listen to the song over here
to the phone rang and get distracted and

140
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:55,050
I'm now ten lines into it now have made
their this is how these things happen

141
00:11:55,050 --> 00:12:00,529
programmatically we can put those in the
database and this is not charged not

142
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:07,850
meant to be read happy slides but we can
actually take these and deposit bees and

143
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:15,550
actually use them for deployment the old
way we used to deploy equipment or in

144
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:19,660
some cases still do it somewhere you
receive equipment this is where you

145
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:24,060
can't tell I'm not a marketing to the
slide animation is terrible but we pull

146
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:28,119
equipment out of the we received the
equipment we look at it and figure out

147
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:34,089
what it is we put a configuration on it
we put it back in the package and then

148
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:39,130
we ship it off a racket problem with
that is that cost time and usually I'm

149
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:43,899
up here pitching ry on what it would
cost you from a time perspective it is

150
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:49,569
easy math is this much time times cost
of labor but also from the consistency

151
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:53,449
perspective we missed the mark a lot of
time these configurations are challenged

152
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:06,700
and if we use as your touch provisioning
which is not new or used to call you

153
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,970
back in the eighties pixie boots and how
long you been in the industry we can put

154
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:15,210
files on devices just putting up with it
was flown reduce the POS terminals all

155
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:21,170
kinds of different things this is not
new then you can save a significant

156
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:26,130
amount of air those that do not a
financial dist deploying this way where

157
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,600
this started work related to security

158
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:36,430
bring it back on the face of the movie
clerks that could we started off with a

159
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:40,329
retail establishment that wanted to
deploy 7,000 firewalls to their

160
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:47,170
locations didn't want to stay tuned
didn't want to do truck roll and one of

161
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:53,349
their store managers to figure and
install these devices in a PCI compliant

162
00:13:53,350 --> 00:14:00,470
environment scary right utilizing this
and some of the things that are

163
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:06,370
available now as we get more integrated
with Dev up some programming and such as

164
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:09,280
intelligent provisioning where I can do
things like figure out where I am

165
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:14,120
perhaps would sprint and IP address what
have you and do intelligent things so

166
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,830
that's how we were able to deploy these
devices

167
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:25,600
mishandled by three network technicians
the past just a point equipment the next

168
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,800
challenge we talked about virtualization
why is securities so hard today but we

169
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:36,969
fall under the services shadow paradigm
she will which means that perhaps my

170
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:40,950
network or Maya security policies don't
follow me around as I might write things

171
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:47,100
between data centers between racks
integrating with these tools we can do

172
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:53,960
that but sometimes like we talked about
earlier it's a challenge to kind of

173
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,780
break the habit to teacher just to go to
manually configure stuff and then spend

174
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:02,870
the time to solve these problems and
really what you want to look for is is

175
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:06,720
an operating system or a vendor that can
support all these different things

176
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,690
there's a lot of a lot of DevOps vendors
are our network vendors are moving to a

177
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:19,300
DevOps model and it really comes down to
you know how flexible am i how many

178
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,780
things can I integrate with here's an
example of a whole bunch of programming

179
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:26,880
languages which is good news which is
you know we have a lot of things that we

180
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,770
can configure we can do can build an
integrated into various system things

181
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:35,060
that tend to gravitate towards
networking folks this python there seems

182
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:39,300
to be a common language there there's
lots of open source libraries exist at

183
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:47,199
the port juniper another vendor ads for
ease of integration ballistic quick walk

184
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:52,940
into the weeds a little bit because I
double click an icon to talk about what

185
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:58,660
an open network stack should look like
and the reason I bring this up is we

186
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:03,469
started off talking about provisioning
we talked about automation and those

187
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:08,800
kinds of things but how does that tie
into the title of this thing which was

188
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,490
offered to find secure networks and what
I'm trying to illustrate is that there's

189
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:17,380
a certain integration you can do in a
certain benefit you can get from an open

190
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:21,650
operating system from reopen vendor that
integrating with things today that allow

191
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:25,990
you to make us makes us stronger
security stance and just looking at the

192
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:26,540
perimeter

193
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:33,980
ur but I took a lot of the Juniper stuff
out of his status is modeled on our

194
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:40,170
software stack but the point is this
from bottom to top you have the ability

195
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:49,819
to program open architectures for things
like an XML RPC or even industry

196
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:55,250
standard things like that come to work
and control devices which are better ABC

197
00:16:55,250 --> 00:17:03,010
RJ and make configuration changes on the
fly so I can react moving a little

198
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:07,690
further up the stack have also that
integration would've up schools we

199
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:13,550
talked out talked about earlier against
evil puppet chef and this helps in the

200
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:19,550
in the main maintenance process me when
I moved things around or when I know

201
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:23,220
when I start to change configurations
etcetera I can have my politics and

202
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:23,710
things

203
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:28,630
orchestrate to follow that this helps me
create consistency has helped me move

204
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:35,280
services around as there was in my
network and you also have to makers

205
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,280
right you want to be able to either

206
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,990
things you have today or you want to be
able to have other vendors that can

207
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:48,790
easily integrate with that that's if you
look at the whole I hate to use the

208
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:51,790
three actors to use its acronym STN

209
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:59,000
but that's really where everything is
going well kind of abstracting what it

210
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:06,280
means from a management platform
allowing to create customizable kind of

211
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:10,540
Lego board together solutions that will
help us and develop these things

212
00:18:14,179 --> 00:18:17,379
software stacks the further you leave
the chip level which is at the bottom of

213
00:18:17,379 --> 00:18:23,580
the more more complexity you add to the
simplicity goes away the further on you

214
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:36,789
go down well add flexibility slide that
has our CEO in a promise but one of the

215
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:41,419
biggest things it's changing no matter
where you look at what you what you read

216
00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:46,679
and it's not only applies to networking
is automation the things are changing

217
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:53,499
tour were able to take tasks are
overwhelming at this point and were able

218
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:56,499
to reduces think about the log records I
talked about earlier

219
00:18:57,869 --> 00:19:01,490
it's not really a lot of folks when he
talked about automation I think back and

220
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:07,110
they say it's you know it's about cost
reductions about eliminating components

221
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:11,330
out of the networks untrue the biggest
thing we're trying to do is keep up with

222
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:14,610
things into their blog Generation
explosion of devices

223
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:17,678
the explosion two things in your network
has been increasing complexity

224
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:24,549
exponentially every day so I double
click on the More orchestration

225
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:31,080
automation is automatically single task
for dramatically using a programming

226
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,379
language looking at a workflow
orchestration is to be able to look at

227
00:19:34,379 --> 00:19:39,279
this as a holistic level and make things
on a larger scale and it should be

228
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:43,619
vendor agnostic it shouldn't matter
whether it's you know how to use the

229
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:47,499
server side because I don't work for
server company but whether it's Linux

230
00:19:47,499 --> 00:19:51,950
Microsoft Apple shouldn't matter right
when I'm making a change to the software

231
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,710
side that's what it's been like three
years I don't care I want to set up a

232
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:58,880
LAMP server that's how orchestration
function network

233
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:05,710
we also need change your mindset about
security threats are everywhere we know

234
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,530
that we don't react to that

235
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:12,180
quite as well as we should I don't think
we still look at things from a perimeter

236
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:16,450
level which we talked about earlier
detection enforcement should be

237
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:21,700
everywhere and we should be able to use
every component the network as sensors

238
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:26,820
you think about 32 were doing with all
the different things are plugging into

239
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:34,620
Walton card and everything else watching
the network with the same way good

240
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:42,060
example of IOT like this example is it
really makes you think it really really

241
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:47,399
use your great example of the quantity
of things were going to see we talk

242
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,160
about the Internet of Things all the
time and we never really take a step

243
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:54,690
back to see you think about what that is
but the BYOD was a huge thing for us

244
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:58,330
know if you got Internet of Things but
if you think about what those things are

245
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:04,250
how simple that could be a light bulb
light bulbs have chipped on another run

246
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:08,570
Linux that do things like turning cell
phone off within the ones that your

247
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:12,580
favorite hardware store that change
color can be to music

248
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:20,899
those are wirelessly connected and I bet
you the vendors that creates those don't

249
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:24,790
really think of it from let's make sure
this is really secure the ring doorbells

250
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:28,370
a great example records pull it off
somebody's house and their wifi pastor

251
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,149
was clear text on the chip

252
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:37,720
a lot of the total area could pull it
off but in this room and think about

253
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:43,320
building an exponentially talk about
thermostats and those components you

254
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:47,580
need to be able to look at those and I
don't think that we're gonna be manually

255
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:52,949
writing policies it's a ok with Phillips
light bulb that I plugged into this

256
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:56,210
entire floor

257
00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:00,280
has this type of traffic behavior should
only do you know finally turned on and

258
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:06,740
off in 10 sadistic on a honest low-level
it should be able to be dynamic and if

259
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:09,220
that starts to be out a characteristic
of what it normally how it normally

260
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:13,660
behaves we should be able to detect that
and shut down the port level now the

261
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:20,320
perimeter and I still think it's
interesting paradigm that I can hack a

262
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,470
light bulb to get the information but
its

263
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:29,510
I don't think it's in the realm of
possibilities and if you look at normal

264
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:34,560
firewalls we have the first generation
firewalls and then we have what we call

265
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,770
the next-generation firewall which is
not so next generation is more than

266
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:44,550
route since 2011 so but we have these
services that we look at you know stable

267
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:50,780
layer layer 3 type services we look at
intrusion prevention user base firewalls

268
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:54,820
to see who's doing what we use anti
virus we use troops and Prevention

269
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:59,060
weasel the signature basis to take a
look at the stuff we look at it again on

270
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:07,020
a premier level also something you take
in consideration is that when you look

271
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:11,780
at this look at things in a paradigm
perspective for instance your campus

272
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:17,000
network has users those users do things
and they get information from outside

273
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,920
your datacenter is quite the opposite it
has users on the outside

274
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:26,010
theory they're getting information the
inside unless you have a bigger problem

275
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:30,170
but that's another conversation and of
course branches and service providers

276
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:33,210
are all different paradigm so how do you
take that into consideration when

277
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:43,560
creating the policy for the light bulb
so policy creation should be simple if

278
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:49,300
you think about that earlier example
about location it's about risk level

279
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,530
it's about what equipment should be
there how it should be reacting but

280
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:56,520
actually the right one policy that
covers everything to find that data

281
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:02,490
definition language we talked about that
that we talked about that we should make

282
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:06,300
it simple to use on the server side to
say newest Apple apps techno care what

283
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:06,820
it is

284
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:13,330
detection I should be able to detect
from multiple sources it shouldn't be

285
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:18,490
pinned into a vendor much as it pains me
to say that I should be able to take

286
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:21,860
things like I think about a year and a
half ago Facebook came out with a free

287
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:25,209
fishing feed I should be able to look at
things from a vertical market

288
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:31,540
perspective meaning that like for
instance vendor look at things in a

289
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:34,889
vertical market and say ok mobile
messaging for education for retail for

290
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:39,700
whatever attackers look because it's a
business look at things the same way

291
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:44,810
they're gonna say they're open the phone
book whatever those are right but

292
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:50,550
they're going to categorize things by by
a vertical say it's safe banking and

293
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:53,120
they're going to try the same thing over
and over again to lift the path of least

294
00:24:53,120 --> 00:25:02,620
resistance in 10 starts stack ranking
rare attack points but what if you share

295
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:06,300
information among steer your industry
whatever that is

296
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:12,780
through a third party like a partner or
perhaps even internal like that

297
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:16,649
academia spent a lot of time sharing
information retail not so much but they

298
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:21,610
have secret sauce is my hope that French
CAC but if you have a shared amongst the

299
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:26,080
community you're able to install that
and hopefully it's all that without any

300
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,760
feet to your security solution and of
course his third party feat you can buy

301
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:37,179
as well and also need to be able to
enforce that and not just enforce that

302
00:25:37,179 --> 00:25:42,929
because as pervasive as things are
getting if I'm able to get root on your

303
00:25:42,929 --> 00:25:47,860
device server laptop light bulb I'm
gonna try to get information out of your

304
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:52,260
network and I'm gonna go for the first
path first but as we know there's

305
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:55,929
multiple exit points out of a network
especially as folks big ring road toys

306
00:25:55,929 --> 00:26:01,919
to the class if you will so I kinda
sanitizers but misses some of the stuff

307
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:06,890
that we do but I think other vendors do
as well but I think we do better and if

308
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:11,580
you learn more to stop by the booth
today but one thing is looking at it

309
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:14,899
from the entire network perspective
being able to look at and leverage your

310
00:26:14,899 --> 00:26:21,299
entire network for detection and for
enforcement the paradigm of any attack

311
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:25,580
requires it to go over a network at some
point in time so the network logically

312
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:32,020
is in the best position to defend for
that attack can detect it also from a

313
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:37,570
computer perspective some of the things
that we do and security particularly as

314
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:45,200
we remember the days when we started to
implement IDS and IPS the processing

315
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,649
power required to do some of that
sometimes is challenging so getting the

316
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:55,860
newer paradigms we should use cloud
resources to offload from that

317
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:59,340
processing and things that aren't quite
a sensitive you think about the paradigm

318
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:06,649
of just a step up security for a second
from reprocessing perspective you think

319
00:27:06,649 --> 00:27:11,010
about the new Xboxes architected all the
things that aren't so time-sensitive

320
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:14,679
from the game in perspective roughly to
the cloud movement stuff like that right

321
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:15,700
so why would you

322
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:20,980
security and with the way networks have
evolved today the way processing of the

323
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:25,690
vote today the differences not as big as
it used to be so being able to process

324
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:30,059
that is interesting and then however the
manic and adaptive policy engine meaning

325
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:34,770
something that can interpret what I'm
trying to do and interpret a larger

326
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:38,020
layer be able to talk to devices that
are

327
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:46,920
perhaps one vendors or perhaps multi
matters so there's a cloud built itself

328
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:53,530
off I talked about looking at it from a
firewall from a routing from the

329
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:57,629
switching perspective which are all
three products we happen to sell but

330
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:01,030
also looking at a third party element
perspective in the case in point earlier

331
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:06,060
the light bulb is connected to an access
point if that access point doesn't speak

332
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:11,590
the language of that vendor or that open
architecture that I can to shut down a

333
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:16,020
single user now she doesn't allow access
point they might not be as good as my

334
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:21,590
turn off or whatever but we want to look
for defenders to make sure they're using

335
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:25,770
an open architecture to where we can
talk to two different components that's

336
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:29,600
what will make this that's what I make
this work otherwise you're still kind of

337
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:34,510
stuck in the same place you were before
then of course the secure security

338
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:39,490
policy controller if you look at the
paradigm of STN and what we can do with

339
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:42,540
my car segment station in all the
different things that we're creating

340
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:46,950
there were now have the ability to
utilize those controllers in a security

341
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:55,440
paradigm from the OpenStack perspective
jennifer is just named the number one or

342
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,660
number one friend Sdn friendly vendor
whatever that means right but it means

343
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:03,460
we're have an open architecture that'll
work with everybody else to look at some

344
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:08,440
of the competition they have proprietary
controllers are proprietary protocols a

345
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:13,840
used Wii U's bleeding edge protocols
like GRE BGP to do a controlling to move

346
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,909
things around network so we'll play with
any equipment that's important to

347
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:20,940
consider this but otherwise you're
locking yourself back into some paradigm

348
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:25,380
some stories somebody else told you this
will let you go in a direction

349
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:37,800
but moving to the previous slide a lot
of work I'm going back to the paradigm

350
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:42,600
earlier that it's easier to continue
doing what you're doing making it

351
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:49,790
changed and we're going to that model
you have to look at this and steps so

352
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:53,500
what do you do first you look at look at
your perimeter to look it refreshes you

353
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,530
consider things that we talked about
today from an open standards respective

354
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:01,770
you look at that from a virtual systems
are virtual firewall perspective for

355
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:06,280
services you look at what kind of cloud
security doin to look at and there's a

356
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:10,730
lot of choices out there a lot of
vendors have those products and how

357
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:13,940
those integrate all the open standard
linear with other vendors I make other

358
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:19,070
choices and converse with your network
be sure that you can use a network

359
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:24,450
elements of gather data to have those
conversations and then also make sure

360
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:26,640
that Bolton with other network elements

361
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,640
access points load balancers etcetera

362
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:39,390
going back to the light bulb model by
light bulbs now gone rogue I can correct

363
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:44,710
this behavior by shutting down the
switchport it's plugged into I can

364
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:48,250
mitigate the behavior of putting in a
quarantine I can examine it I can take

365
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:51,810
those payloads and put them into the
cloud process see what they do there's

366
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:58,280
lots of different things I can handle
but worse the compromise which have now

367
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:03,149
created a simple IP secretary tunnel
down to my lab later my evil whatever

368
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:08,830
and I'm now spanning important getting
all the information offered networking

369
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:11,370
something useful sometimes not

370
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:16,709
but in the paradigm we're in today we'd
probably end up cutting access off that

371
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:21,650
tire switch you can talk to that switch
with some kind of control protocol I can

372
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:32,630
shut down that port or I can just shut
down that tunnel simple so here's what I

373
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:39,020
think you should look for in a vendor
scale is obviously important right a

374
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:45,550
thing from the small campus networks to
branch networks to high-end networks it

375
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:51,220
should have the same paradigm should be
easy to configure scales a challenge a

376
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:56,410
lot of vendors started the SMB market
and work their way up into the carrier

377
00:31:56,410 --> 00:32:01,590
market opposite of how we do things but
the challenges there is it's creating

378
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:05,678
that scale you solve a hard problem and
solve it one's easier to create that

379
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:12,790
scaled-down open standards are important
if you look at the market today a lot of

380
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:19,470
vendors can't give it to open models
because it breaks them from a financial

381
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:22,410
perspective if you think about it from a
business side

382
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:26,210
some vendors don't want to somebody to
talk about hardware hardware Defined

383
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:31,810
Networking holdings decided its offer
these are all things to think about and

384
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:36,500
the automation side how truly open is
that you have to pay to automate do you

385
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:41,570
have to buy their SDK or is it just
opened as everybody work with it how

386
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:49,030
much open source exists in israel things
to think about as I was told the back

387
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:53,340
and under four minutes till the time
I've had today through my twitter handle

388
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:56,189
up there if anybody wants to follow me
on Twitter occasional say something

389
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:59,930
witty or something intelligent really
depends on the day but I certainly thank

390
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:04,210
you for your time I'll be around at
lunch and also be in the booth any

391
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:07,220
questions I'll be up here for humans as
well thank you very much
