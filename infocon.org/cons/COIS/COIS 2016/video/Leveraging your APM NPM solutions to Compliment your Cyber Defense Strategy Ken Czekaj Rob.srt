1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,750
large room with four people in itself
you feel like scooping up that's

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:06,220
absolutely fine if not we'll just make
via thank you thank you people the back

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:11,129
thanks so much as I can check I am a
problem solver NetScout

4
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:15,790
that's got about eighteen years but in
the industry for 25 and with me as my

5
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:20,270
colleague robert wright who's assistant
0 NetScout systems we're here to talk

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,669
about leveraging your application
performance management and your network

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,510
performance management solutions to
complement your cyber strategy the first

8
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,039
thing you need to know is we're not here
to talk about all the things that Scott

9
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,510
doesn't that Scotland were really here
to talk about how you can leverage your

10
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:39,269
any of your 8 p.m. or NTM tool sets that
you can leverage into your cyber

11
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,430
strategy I will say is a disclaimer we
are not suggesting that any of the APM

12
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,219
Eryngium solution should be your cyber
strategy what we're saying is they

13
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:52,760
should be an input to your cyber
strategy so just one quick slide just a

14
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,219
little about us obviously we've been
around a little while we have these

15
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:59,940
types of discussions quite frequent with
our customers right now mainly because

16
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,649
I'm sure you're all well aware the
Republican National Convention is coming

17
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:07,729
to Cleveland for July so we're having a
lot of discussions where basically

18
00:01:07,729 --> 00:01:11,610
companies are just scared to death
because from hacktivism perspective you

19
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,450
really don't know what to expect you
know it's gonna be bad it's gonna be

20
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,990
awful we just don't know what a lot of
discussions about this which was part

21
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:23,929
part of the brain child 44 this topic we
will go through our our our past but we

22
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:27,700
will talk about one she was ploy you'll
notice that the bottom we have a blog

23
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,280
this is not a NetScout sales pitch blog
this is a blog about how to solve

24
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,579
problems that covers health care costs
cyber recovers applications voice video

25
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:40,329
you name it we probably have covered it
with that will get into what we're gonna

26
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:44,559
talk about today and that specifically
is again from an application in a

27
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,649
network perspective you know if if
that's your role that sure that your

28
00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:53,600
bailiwick if you well your role does it
change that much you get application

29
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,969
upgrades you got core infrastructure
upgrades you can surprise yeah yeah

30
00:01:56,969 --> 00:01:57,880
that's great

31
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,479
from eight if you compared that that
world of change compared to what cyber

32
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:07,289
security has to deal with its literally
its ninth day and that being said fibers

33
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,580
everyone's problem because your world
changes literally every single day

34
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,800
the bad guys do now

35
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,730
new tactics thread actors trying new
approaches and they're pretty good at it

36
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:20,459
so our philosophy is such a triage
triage I don't care if your network

37
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:24,660
person an application person or cyber
person the harsh reality is how you

38
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,470
triage what we say triage you know some
people might say troubleshooting but how

39
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:32,630
you triage to get to the meantime to
know is really the key you want to get

40
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:36,019
to that get to the bottom of what you're
investigating as quickly as possible so

41
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:39,360
the process doesn't change all that much
the metrics that you look at obviously

42
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,250
all different but the what you actually
focus on the process doesn't change that

43
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,860
much as that is where with vendors
obviously there's lots of vendors here

44
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,960
there are a ton of good security tools
out there and we're not suggesting any

45
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:56,310
of them they're all very good R focuses
they typically will have a niche type of

46
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:00,380
the media endpoint security maybe a
firewall maybe a load balancer but when

47
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,810
you start looking at other solutions
that most cyber folks are a little

48
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:07,980
surprised that they don't know that they
have access to so our focus is if you

49
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,510
got application performance management
tools or network performance major tools

50
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:16,140
and you're not leveraging in your cyber
strategy you should the first thing I

51
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,769
would recommend anyone is to go to your
application to Murray network team and

52
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:24,500
find out what they're using because you
can leverage that is an input into

53
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,730
europe process our focus is because you
can you can leverage advanced visibility

54
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:35,290
there's areas the networking meetup your
cover cyber why's that you can if you

55
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:39,019
lovers the AP MNT inside you can
leverage that into your strategy the

56
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,410
overall effect on the cyber side you
want to reduce your triage time if this

57
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:47,329
is a cyber vent great help me get there
faster if it's not a cyber event helped

58
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:50,620
me not spend my time on it which is a
key thing because you're all very busy

59
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:54,760
people are focuses you got available
intelligence analytics and evidence that

60
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:00,350
you can leverage in your strategy why
not use it so we're gonna go over Robert

61
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:03,810
are gonna tag team this one a different
topics the first we're gonna hit anybody

62
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:08,450
the room never heard of a denial of
service because you should leave Kelly

63
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:12,829
ok good thanks for coming yes so denial
of service we typically think into a

64
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:16,690
couple different ways the first maybe
what about lear 2 I'm thinking about a

65
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,228
brute-force attack from the outside and
that's you know every there's tools out

66
00:04:20,228 --> 00:04:21,979
there for that week totally get that

67
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,640
but take step back for a second and
think about what are they going after

68
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,740
just trying to take down your internet
link pls like your server farms or are

69
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,580
they going after your critical services
one of the key things that we usually

70
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:38,390
tells her focuses DNS DHCP nada are the
three things that come out right I might

71
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:41,760
your network can be up your applications
coming up your service but if those

72
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,990
don't work which has put it mildly you
ain't gonna get nowhere because it won't

73
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:49,010
work your network won't officially work
because they either can't get on the

74
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:52,450
network they can't get to where they
want to get or they can authenticate so

75
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:56,710
if the bad guys are attacking those
critical services that's bad is that

76
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:00,669
network is an application that cyber
don't know don't care the key thing is

77
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:05,760
you want a triage as quickly as possible
application targeted attacks will see

78
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,300
these go after ERP systems email systems
which are typically now multi tier

79
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,450
application so that's not just you put
up an Email Spam Filter you gotta go a

80
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:18,530
little deeper because you can see how
those impact your services in today's

81
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:23,010
world cloud has become critical so when
you start looking at hybrid private or

82
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:27,340
public cloud if the if the threat actor
wants to go after your internet links

83
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:32,669
link from high bandwidth perspective or
just put trash traffic out there they

84
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,980
can effectively take down your cloud and
we'll get to that in a couple of slides

85
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:40,570
they can take down your your your users
cloud access because typically most of

86
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,599
you have single sign-on it goes back to
your datacenter dot indicates if they

87
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,130
take down your link they've effectively
taken part of what you can use levers to

88
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:50,800
authenticate obviously call centers
they're going to go after things that

89
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,150
never begin impact so when you start
looking at where the attackers are gonna

90
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:57,890
come from if they know that your company
actually does a million dollars of

91
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,870
revenue and a through the call centers
while they can really have a pretty

92
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:04,120
dramatic impact if they take down your
call center IT application voice video

93
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,060
whatever that whatever delivered the
services are leveraging they can

94
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:10,900
actually take it down in floods which we
don't anybody can probably skip that

95
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:15,030
we're getting everybody knows so the
first point wanna make it again we're

96
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,700
just using the screenshot that we have
available to us

97
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:21,200
the first thing again from a
complementary strategy most cyber tools

98
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,490
especially for looking at traffic are
gonna be flow-based and again we're not

99
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:29,070
picking on that but you're gonna splode
J Flo that's great that's good traffic

100
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:33,320
it gives you access and supports IP
addresses interfaces cue us that's good

101
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:33,980
stuff

102
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:37,510
the challenge with it is as if you're
getting a denial of service and NetFlow

103
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:41,590
typically best case is going to be a
slow pace solutions typically typically

104
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:46,090
gonna be about 11 granularity when
you're going denial of service sometimes

105
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:50,390
need a little bit tighter granularity a
lot of your end p.m. 8 p.m. type

106
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:54,270
solutions will leverage green solutions
from an employee's perspective that you

107
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:58,599
can get tighter granularity that's much
less than one minute here you can see up

108
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,020
in the corner I realize it's a bit of an
eye chart so the slides will be

109
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:01,909
available

110
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:05,300
you've got a hundred 900 millisecond
granularity you can get down to a

111
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,760
nanosecond that's probably a little too
tight but the bottom line is if you're

112
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,409
in the scary side you're trying to
determine quickly this denial of service

113
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:15,700
or not I want one second granularity
because that get anybody measures their

114
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:21,590
networks and feet per minute or bytes
per per minute or if that doesn't work

115
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:26,250
gets its megabits gigabits per second so
I want granularity that I can see in it

116
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:30,870
in and out from their perspective the
second thing and this is actually an

117
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:36,190
example case for leveraging DHCP which a
great you it's not the sexiest protocol

118
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,880
out there but also tell you if it
doesn't work

119
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,110
your networks not gonna be real happy
and things will work out well this is

120
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:45,270
actually example from a customer where
this was actually a self-inflicted

121
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:50,719
denial of service on their DHCP server
and I don't say that to cause grief or

122
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,760
or make fun of anyone but the reality is
sometimes you stumble upon these things

123
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,659
where this could be misconstrued as a
cyber that the first thing is is it

124
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:02,430
really sorry but I don't know but all we
know is nice my DHCP is not working so

125
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:06,000
the devices I need to get on a network
are working this happen to be a pretty

126
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,340
critical infrastructure where these
little devices need to get on it could

127
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:13,299
not so what we found it and bottom
bottom left corner I'm sorry bottom

128
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,870
right corner you can see that their
error codes where we were getting

129
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:20,810
requests being basically rejected
because they're being declined and what

130
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:24,130
we see is after the end of that that's a
denial service specifically on DHCP

131
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:27,710
self-inflicted mind you but it doesn't
really matter it now serves to no

132
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:31,510
service I don't care if I did it robert
teeter you did I wanna stop it so when

133
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:34,929
you can you can leverage these type the
solutions get a p.m. 10 p.m. where you

134
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:38,319
can have that type of visibility it will
help you in your in your cyber triage

135
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:45,180
thanks to the next thing we talked about
as anomalous behavior we hear about that

136
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:50,680
quite a bit and part of the APM and p.m.
solution set typically offers the

137
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:55,529
ability to detect anomalies anomalies
can be ranging from performance space

138
00:08:55,529 --> 00:09:02,000
but they can also be such as bitrate
jericho's and volumetric so when we look

139
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,199
at a anomaly that's perfect for the
performance man from folks who are

140
00:09:06,199 --> 00:09:09,410
worried about their applications keeping
that service up there from the

141
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:14,089
information security perspective
investigative perspective now we can

142
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:15,310
look at it from a different angle

143
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:22,050
well if also my flagship website is
doing three times as much bandwidth or

144
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:27,160
it's a switch to into more of a FTP role
well now I would I care about that

145
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,620
anomalous behavior is impacting
performance with some folks care about

146
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:35,160
that I care about from a high
perspective because now maybe have a

147
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,899
data breach maybe there's a leak coming
out or maybe we're being attacked so

148
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:45,930
also we have different views sets the
MPN APM tools that we see across the

149
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,258
marketplace

150
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:50,490
typically see that maybe the network
side of the house are you see it

151
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:55,040
patients and those network engineers are
thinking well I see all these resets ok

152
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,639
it happens not necessarily my issue per
se but then if we say from a patient's

153
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:06,559
perspective has things but then you look
at from a security perspective and also

154
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:10,969
resets went skyrocketed and he picked up
as an anomaly now you may be thinking

155
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:14,529
well maybe there's a there's a lot
there's a lot of different scenarios

156
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:20,529
that can be run through your mind when
we look at anomalous behavior so we look

157
00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:26,279
at a bar in this case examples here
we're looking at indication so in this

158
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:32,019
particular case what we see is that the
authentication the LDAP Active Directory

159
00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:33,050
and so forth

160
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:37,008
has all the Sun started throwing
additional shares and with that

161
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:48,620
so it that excitement at the moving
picture so that baseline baseline we

162
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,840
understand with 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. tools
can actually not that hard thresholds

163
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,610
have you ever talk to you folks about
how they're a bronze or how it actually

164
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:02,390
works most people say I think I know or
I might know I think this works this way

165
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,680
things of that nature

166
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:10,189
behavior through analytics families do
is learn them and say hey also me it

167
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:13,830
started having an uptick in
authentication failures through Active

168
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,080
Directory this one part of our
environment

169
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,940
switches over to the wireless side of
the house and now the sudden here now

170
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,590
looking at maybe somebody trying to
break into your wireless someone trying

171
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:27,660
to force a password things of that
nature but you're now leveraging the

172
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:33,100
same tool sets and you're able to convey
your ideas that have an intact to

173
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:40,050
someone else to the same exact screen
this is a real popular topic alot of our

174
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:44,319
cyber folks because typically anybody
not doing virtualization and you're in

175
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,650
your networks come on now don't be shy
you're gonna be shy area no nobody's ok

176
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:52,470
so nobody's everybody's doing virtually
virtualized networks obviously data

177
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,980
centers are cleaner data centers are
greener you're making total total

178
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,620
utility of your computing power the
reality though is typically what we see

179
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,700
from most cyber type solutions are gonna
go from a north-south perspective if

180
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:07,040
you're looking at traffic and it's
obviously a bit different but if traffic

181
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,469
you're gonna typically look at north
south and what I mean by that is your

182
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:15,940
typical gonna look at you go through DMZ
your load balancers ideas IPS data loss

183
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:19,120
prevention you know I know we're hitting
the right topics here but typically

184
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,220
attend a north-south type of viewpoint
in today's world when everybody's moving

185
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,780
towards VMware Citrix UCS chessie's each
people ate sorry I'm just naming a few

186
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:31,790
of them the virtualized infrastructure
becomes in if anybody's gonna disagree

187
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:36,640
we can talk outside if you becomes a
blind spot on your virtualized servers

188
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,340
so you've got a whole area lot of times
of the network a whole perimeter that

189
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:44,080
you really can't see much into other
obviously the syslog which is completely

190
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,340
fine but again from a traffic
perspective and you leveraging all of

191
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:51,000
your tool solutions that you know spend
good money companies good money on

192
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,200
you want to take that even extended into
the virtualized architecture so what we

193
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,710
typically would see is the part that's
in yellow that's a typical area for what

194
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:04,820
I would call cyber instrumentation so
taps bands DMC's firewalls load El Cid

195
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:09,020
again I'm hitting the same topics but
what's interesting about that is that

196
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,939
straight from a north-south perspective
but now that we're going virtualized

197
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,990
data centers in a lot of virtualized
servers there's a lot of east-west

198
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:19,360
traffic so if I'm on a particular we
just imagine are staging were inside of

199
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,870
one individual server hardware server
and Robert are two different

200
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:26,760
applications are talking to one another
i five hey whats up a high five years

201
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,130
there we are that's ok don't laugh it's
it's not supposed to be funny

202
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:34,460
excellent good crowd good crowd here
thanks for coming everybody so you gotta

203
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:38,230
eat less traffic if your tools are are
centered at your cyber tools for

204
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:41,740
instrumentation are centered at the
north south part of the network and

205
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,970
we're doing all this traffic here what
if what if you get compromised through

206
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:49,710
through the architecture who knows how
they get in but they started to text

207
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:52,580
from your virtualized infrastructure
start doing it to the service in between

208
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:57,320
where you don't have this ability that
is a pop-up Aimpoint in a blind spot a

209
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,190
lot of your 8 p.m. 10 p.m. solutions
will have access to your east-west

210
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:05,160
traffic either through an agent but a
lot of the servers of that area they

211
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,660
actually have an export port so it's
almost like having it would use a mere

212
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:12,120
replicator span sometimes people call it
out the back of that server

213
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,550
infrastructure into your tool set there
are ways that Yuri p.m. 10 p.m.

214
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:18,790
solutions can do that there's also
agents were not big enough funding

215
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:22,349
agency obviously in some cases because
it impacts the servers but again the key

216
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:25,770
thing the cyber side as you get
visibility that opens up that you

217
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:33,400
normally would not have so then we take
a deeper dive into the authentication

218
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:39,199
services and so forth and we look at the
actual service it's so we can then get

219
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:44,220
into and looking around as mentioned
earlier the cloud services so if I'm

220
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:50,220
able to if my organization relies on say
sales force for office 365 there's a

221
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:56,160
come back to my data center that is rely
on that office 365 is rely on ourselves

222
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,450
directory that single sign-on capability

223
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:02,770
its passing all that traffic back to the
data center so at this point

224
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:09,050
utilizing and leveraging the 8 p.m. and
10 p.m. solution sets those metrics and

225
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:09,959
so forth

226
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,970
now we're able to leverage information
to help protect this cloud-based

227
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:20,820
services through authentication and I
talked a little bit on the previous

228
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:26,040
slide around radius and the actual
wireless traffic so from the Royal aside

229
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:31,599
how those wireless LAN controllers
coming back to tax the server and it's

230
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:37,000
performing a vacation mechanism if we
leverage the APM capability and then

231
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,170
make sure that that services are always
available if we look at particular use

232
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:49,740
case example and we look at and when we
talk to our clients and we tell them how

233
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:55,230
to leverage the APM tools is that I'm
able to do is very quickly a very high

234
00:15:55,230 --> 00:16:01,140
level look across my entire service for
authentication for it well that's all

235
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:05,939
that our Active Directory or the RADIUS
authentication for wireless now I'm able

236
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,340
to view that formation of very high
level so that when I do get a report

237
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:14,160
saying hey we think this might be trying
to break in the workforce or they're

238
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:20,120
just a normal behavior as it relates to
say Active Directory now able to view

239
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,570
that data in most of these solutions
also have the capability of going back a

240
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:29,180
long period of time it was great to say
hey I have alarm through my sent Mar 31

241
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:35,219
not that I've seen the havelis I think
Asian players visit new is that normal

242
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:41,579
how how can you tell well oftentimes
these solutions give you that capability

243
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:48,310
to see large range is a time where you
can do so otherwise because of the sheer

244
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:57,020
volume of data sets no popular topic in
terms of 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. Solutions is

245
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:00,319
a lot of times again from the cyber site
from a complimentary use case

246
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,400
perspective you've got you've got a
large that you can leverage that I would

247
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,400
say we're really developed a lot of
times for cyber use cases but that

248
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,339
doesn't mean you can't use them that way
for example a lot of times customers

249
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:12,639
will

250
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,730
interment there DMZ not only with cyber
type solutions but also with their end

251
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:19,420
p.m. and 8 p.m. type solutions because
they want to be able to determine

252
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:24,410
performance issues lately that's so
inside of solutions like this you have

253
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:28,089
the ability to look this up with
policy-based alarms were you should say

254
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:31,470
you know what I should ever see this
type of traffic and if I do I want to

255
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:32,420
know about it

256
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:36,610
our general recommendation for customers
is if you see an alarm where you set up

257
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:40,250
a policy and we've got a couple examples
here for example you've got a hosted web

258
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:44,400
server inside your DMZ and also to start
doing a boatload of outbound FTP that's

259
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,250
probably bad so you can actually set up
a policy for the traffic visibility for

260
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,560
the traffic's been what that word
actually will say okay I'm only looking

261
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,429
for these protocols and if I see a
deviation of a protocol that wasn't

262
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:58,710
running before and all the sudden it's
running now that's a bad thing

263
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:02,020
our guidance is you've got access to
that information you may not know each

264
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,139
access information push it to your sim

265
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:09,320
correlation engine because again from
the whole cyber strategy perspective

266
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,450
bring it all to the table this is more
intelligence more alerting now it may be

267
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:17,450
there may be overlap with other
solutions already do that's okay you've

268
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:20,480
got good correlation engine you want
that you want to have eyes and ears out

269
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:26,010
that this is just giving another input
to it is an example where again if

270
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:29,980
you've got a cardholder data environment
for PCI you wouldn't want any

271
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:33,000
unencrypted protocols because you
officially would lose your PCI

272
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,630
compliance but even if you've got this
is an example where a lot of our custom

273
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:41,810
our customers and will set up this kind
of a different mindset change but if you

274
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:45,360
think about it the services that
cybersecurity offers to your

275
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,290
organization is actually a service that
you offer so you're doing data loss

276
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:53,129
prevention you're doing prevention
you're doing intrusion detection you're

277
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:55,720
doing employee protection you're doing
any virus

278
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,360
well it's it's kind of a different
mindset but you can actually configured

279
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,659
those inside of an APM in p.m. solution
where you can actually levers that

280
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:07,570
define it as a service to see how it's
performing not so much from G how much

281
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:11,210
bit rate although you know sometimes AV
can take a hit on the network that's one

282
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:14,840
use case but really when you start
looking at that type of information what

283
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:20,030
you're looking for is things that we
think that will that will afford some

284
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:24,658
complementary information into your
cyber strategy so specifically

285
00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:29,759
if I've got if I get my back to my FTP
example if I've got a service that I've

286
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:33,419
got set up on a dashboard that I can
quickly put in my sock and/or my knock

287
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:37,340
that shows me that some of my cyber
services are are being impacted that

288
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,289
could be a hit if I'm a bad guy and I
can actually take down your cyber

289
00:19:40,289 --> 00:19:43,269
services that you're using to protect
yourself well that would be a bad thing

290
00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:47,559
again it's another set of eyes on it but
what you can afford alarms like this

291
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:52,249
into your sim again it's just another
view of information that you are me

292
00:19:52,249 --> 00:19:59,289
capability that you can use to kind of
defense effects so most common use cases

293
00:19:59,289 --> 00:20:04,849
we see in the ATM and then p.m. market
is packet capture and pack captured

294
00:20:04,849 --> 00:20:07,939
being leveraged multiple different ways
and everybody in this room probably is

295
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:11,539
very familiar with the various different
tools that you can use in most of the

296
00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:16,460
most likely have an open source capture
utility on a laptop today so when we

297
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:20,779
look at the packet capture and ECOWAS
how can that be leveraged and the

298
00:20:20,779 --> 00:20:23,009
biggest one is attack reconstruction

299
00:20:23,009 --> 00:20:28,940
who did Miller added you got done
something bad and you're trying to

300
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:33,399
reconstruct that event where did he go
what did he do and things of that nature

301
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:39,349
8 p.m. and 10 p.m. solutions offer and
have offer for many years now the

302
00:20:39,349 --> 00:20:43,309
capability of doing pack Depot but this
isn't the same package eco that we've

303
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:48,239
had in the past because now 8 p.m. and
10 p.m. solutions we've shown various

304
00:20:48,239 --> 00:20:52,080
different screenshots and error codes
and things of that nature so rather than

305
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,658
going to the wide-open packets to do
this attack reconstruction now you're

306
00:20:56,659 --> 00:21:02,830
looking at exactly the facts related to
the failure for that wireless example

307
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:08,720
there are issues around PCI also there's
HTTP traffic traversing it now we're

308
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,720
able to isolate and very quickly get
down to the package if we need to

309
00:21:12,269 --> 00:21:18,099
is no longer a requirement the Nexus
obviously around evidence the what we're

310
00:21:18,099 --> 00:21:21,999
able to do is pull those packets out and
we can leverage that for this

311
00:21:21,999 --> 00:21:26,029
perspective or we can also leverage that
tip into a different tool set which may

312
00:21:26,029 --> 00:21:32,019
be doing additional damn I may be a DLP
solution are things of that nature we

313
00:21:32,019 --> 00:21:36,549
look at this particular case what we're
seeing is we're looking at the packets

314
00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:37,650
but we're not looking at

315
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:41,720
hours where the package we bought them a
capture we've all done these various

316
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:48,320
different trying this the we've done
these large packages before we say pull

317
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,560
back at 10 minutes and I'll send us a
gig with the traffic is taking a large

318
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,220
amount of time to actually be able to
hold back this nation but we're now

319
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:59,910
seeing as additional intelligence come
to packet capture where is that we're

320
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:04,140
able to keep people out the packets
unless they need for the reconstruction

321
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:09,520
or evidence say and when we do go to the
package we're going to the package for a

322
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:14,160
very particular reason for a very
particular session are low so it means

323
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:18,410
to you is that I'm doing this
reconstruction or the satisfaction I'm

324
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:24,980
getting the evidence I need not
everything says really gets you to that

325
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:33,290
reduces that amount information and puts
probability on their side so do we get a

326
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:36,879
couple of topics here for services and I
know it is pretty hard but one of the

327
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,950
use cases we see a lot from the cyber
folks and it's not it's not a bad thing

328
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:45,590
but a lot of times as soon as DNS goes
hokey those weird applications don't

329
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:50,340
work immediately throw your hands up the
sky is falling we're getting attacked oh

330
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,810
my goodness we're getting attack and
sometimes you are we've seen it where

331
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:57,610
that actually the case but more often
than not feel free to raise your hand if

332
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:00,100
we're gonna make fun of the people later
we find that you but that the

333
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:04,060
application people ever actually had
something that was diagnosed as it were

334
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:07,220
being attacked their DNS servers are
getting killed and then find out that

335
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:13,470
are failing but that's because the
whoever was administrated DNS couldn't

336
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:17,840
type and put a bunch of fat fingers in
war-weary routed servers so they're

337
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,189
actually now functioning but we're
really not being attacked we do this to

338
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:25,660
ourselves and it's that team that's ever
happened cuz I wanna shake your hand or

339
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:30,520
be fined ok good crowd thank you thank
you thank you we gotta get him a Fitbit

340
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:34,840
yeah we're gonna find you later get you
fit for participation thank you really

341
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,790
appreciate that now there are times
obviously I'm gonna make into the unique

342
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:42,310
use case here but I we have seen that
happen where DNS because it's such a

343
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:46,379
critical service to the city
infrastructure and the applications if

344
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:49,760
it doesn't work everybody notices right
away and a lot of times we just a

345
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,429
Symbian

346
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:56,129
however we have also seen the use case
where DNS has been attacked and one in

347
00:23:56,129 --> 00:24:00,519
what will happen a lot of times is
obviously were hijacked poison one of

348
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:05,990
the things that we found it a customer
was a use case specifically where we can

349
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:09,940
bring up the views but effectively what
would happen if you're expecting a

350
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:13,350
reverse our or a you know somebody
trying to access W W dot net scout.com

351
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:17,820
or our blog probably you know I was and
then they find it when you actually look

352
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:23,389
at the identity feel about what was the
DNS query what you find is XP 924 it

353
00:24:23,389 --> 00:24:28,229
doesn't look normal and a lot of times
people that write up so when you see

354
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:31,730
that is a while that looks really funny
not not only would you probably get an

355
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:33,950
alarm which in this case would happen

356
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:37,419
customer get alarmed and happened to
notice it you would want to shift that

357
00:24:37,419 --> 00:24:41,210
over to your sim but then trauma triage
perspective on what's going on here I

358
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:44,100
wanna look at what DNS requests your
feeling is it you know the traditional

359
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:49,240
hey somebody fat finger DNS server or is
it that we have been compromised by

360
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:54,549
malware and it's actually trying to do a
call back to the home servers and what

361
00:24:54,549 --> 00:24:58,418
we found in this particular case was
this was a company that was really

362
00:24:58,419 --> 00:25:02,460
protecting their intellectual capital as
everyone is and should be and that's

363
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:06,110
exactly the use case so when they saw
this identity being called back he was

364
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:10,110
actually what we do good that we could
see the DNS query google it was actually

365
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:14,379
the Zeus 32 Trojan virus it's a
keylogger so imagine yourself in the

366
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:18,459
perspective of alright I'm charged with
protecting the company jewels behind me

367
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,899
you can hear about their door behind me
and all the sudden I got a keylogger

368
00:25:21,899 --> 00:25:24,570
does now call home

369
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:28,600
great great career development probably
in that game so when you start seeing

370
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,149
those types of things again from a
use-case perspective bottom right if I

371
00:25:32,149 --> 00:25:36,258
see server failures or name server airs
that's great that tells me that I

372
00:25:36,259 --> 00:25:40,590
probably haven't issue I did more than
likely it's on the internal site however

373
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:45,059
in this case if they if you could
probably see mall where where that is

374
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:46,820
actually starting to call home

375
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:50,759
likely that we'll also pop areas as well
and again our guidance from the use case

376
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:54,470
perspective is if you've got 8 p.m. and
10 p.m. tools that you can leverage for

377
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:57,669
even views in these critical
applications or call centers as well as

378
00:25:57,669 --> 00:26:00,160
your critical services like DNS DHCP
know that

379
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,700
shoot it to yourself it's just an extra
set of eyes on things it's extra things

380
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:09,330
for you to triage environment so here is
a PCI

381
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:22,690
with mine so who here has to comply with
PCI is it so when we think of PCI 8 p.m.

382
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:23,620
and 10 p.m.

383
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:30,969
people's minds and really important so i
plug here I large series of PCI and

384
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:34,670
leveraging and p.m. and 8 p.m. tools on
our blog I definitely worth checking out

385
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:40,840
you know that point so with that in mind
so there's a couple things that we can

386
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:45,810
do in leverage and p.m. and 8 p.m. por
the idea of PCI so when we look at our

387
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:51,620
CDR cardholder data environment as ken
mentioned before we can leverage those

388
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:57,110
this policy based on lines to say these
are the traffic I know should be in my

389
00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:03,189
CD I know that this particular web
server belongs there if anything else

390
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:09,340
pops up Jimmy alarms in the elements who
threw myself so with them I now we can

391
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:14,500
have a little bit level of automation
and ok you did your compliance once and

392
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:20,000
then if we move forward with that we
have helped me gain comprise we're not

393
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,030
suggesting a p.m. 10 p.m. as a PCI tool
is just as we say throughout this

394
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:27,070
presentation is complementary to your
existing toolsets

395
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:35,360
look at from the the recent changes with
PC version 3 and most recently 3130

396
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,770
introduced the requirement for an
application diagram so many of these

397
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:43,290
tool sets they have all the packets they
have all this data all those many

398
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:48,440
information so if we leverage it to
create these dynamic diagrams of how the

399
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:53,370
application works well guess what
everybody wins that guys now know how

400
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:58,010
their application words the cyber
security team now knows how that works

401
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:03,140
and if it if they become compromised
even outside of PCI now you have a

402
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:07,480
checklist that you can print out to say
okay we know that this particular

403
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,240
application was compromised or this
workstation was compromised what did

404
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,740
they touch

405
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:17,570
map of how how and where it went and
what protocols and went to this case we

406
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:22,889
see that went through a shaky servers
and so forth but when we have this type

407
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:28,220
of information now we can easily more
articulate our information to our end

408
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:33,740
user are our counterparts to say this is
what this application looks like and

409
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:38,730
dynamically look like this two weeks ago
before it into FTP now and how these

410
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:44,120
dynamic graphics to present to them all
averaging 8 p.m. the network guys are

411
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:48,010
now able to see very supreme at rates
that they love so now we have this whole

412
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:53,250
is no longer throwing the ball across
the wall if you will pass not my problem

413
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:57,290
is your problem is about us being a team
in solving business problems together

414
00:28:57,290 --> 00:29:01,659
and that's the kind of cool thing about
8 p.m. 9 p.m. session cyberspace is

415
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:06,809
bring everybody together so raw look at
the same data set and we'll touch on the

416
00:29:06,809 --> 00:29:14,559
31 earlier in the show they SL item on
here as well and that is we are now able

417
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:18,870
to pull metadata and why should have a
side and second that gets into actually

418
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:26,489
that 300 reporting an evidence anybody
ever been to report on hey we think we

419
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:30,750
got compromise any general reporting to
go to me I have to defend the flag to

420
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:33,130
our management to their management in
their management sometimes our

421
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:36,780
stockholders well that's sometimes a
manual process and it's very time

422
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:41,510
intensive so a lot of your AP MNT until
sites will will provide information that

423
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:44,550
you could generate very quickly 'cause
they're geared for performance their

424
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:48,178
gear for reporting in real-time
dashboards typically so you can leverage

425
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:51,510
on the cyber side if you know what
you're looking for so specifically

426
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:56,530
things Lake get rid of a nice chart top
talkers I want to see what was the link

427
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:59,830
utilization I want to see who were they
talking to what applications that things

428
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:04,189
changed we see on an unidentified ports
again you can go mining yourself and

429
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:06,780
there's nothing wrong with a good pull
to syslog you can pull it through your

430
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:09,889
own tool sets and that's fine there's
nothing wrong with that but if you've

431
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:14,179
got a way again we can shrink time it
takes for you to do these efforts then

432
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:17,990
you're leveraging your EPM p.m.
solutions to their fullest extent but

433
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:20,720
you can use this and more of an
automated fashion could generate click

434
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,290
report email PDF usually right from it
it's one of the things you like yeah

435
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:26,370
that's great I don't even care but if
you

436
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:29,370
can use it in your cyber were closed as
you as you're doing to your triage

437
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:33,770
process or through your post event
reporting process again you get a win

438
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:41,150
for the for the effort so let's talk
about the certificate and this falls

439
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:46,010
into the version 3.1 requirement so for
anyone who may I know it so you don't

440
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:52,390
want to change the rules a little bit
because of some bomb abilities that were

441
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:59,000
released that were released around sl
earlier version will tell us so in it

442
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,330
but we're talking about around that
issue as well as just generically as we

443
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:14,330
deploy PKI and everybody in the room and
look at the guy that is so we're trying

444
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:18,960
to drive governments were trying to go
and drive adoption so how do we know

445
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:25,100
that everybody is adopting the peak out
who these people are rolling out their

446
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,719
switch to this matter the brand the
switch manufacture

447
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,240
most likely comes with a self-signed
certificate when you first boot up and

448
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:38,980
how many times do those people actually
get to actually leveraging their PKI

449
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:43,190
that you work so hard to implement very
few so how do you actually detect that

450
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:49,360
formation you say now surveyed everybody
and say hey maybe people will just

451
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:55,590
become complacent so with a 10 p.m. as I
mentioned previously play out that

452
00:31:55,590 --> 00:32:00,470
medicare from that live traffic we're
not able to detect that hate these

453
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:05,920
people are leveraging incorrect ciphers
and so forth but also their certificates

454
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,630
are invalid

455
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:13,370
so the problem gets everybody's click on
the link here people become conditioned

456
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:17,979
that this is okay so switching out of
certificates and no reaction ever

457
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:22,280
notices and now they've compromised
passwords and so on and so forth and see

458
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:27,220
where that goes from there not to
mention it's a brand risk if we look at

459
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:33,000
certificates and he think of your your
your main key applications most likely

460
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,560
encrypted most likely its flagship
website its flagship website the end

461
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,750
user goes to your webpage

462
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:45,330
and its comes up as invalid you think of
Amazon did that will they be able to

463
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:49,350
sell products could you sell your
product it comes across in says it's

464
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:55,659
invalid most likely know and you can see
most recent and sense where this happens

465
00:32:55,660 --> 00:33:00,050
and no longer if you leverage in him and
8 p.m. people are managing certificates

466
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:05,870
by either Excel spreadsheets or email
addresses where people leave and then

467
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:09,129
also going to email address that doesn't
exist anymore

468
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:14,260
leverage a permanent solution can now
give you that capability that find out

469
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:23,310
this particular server works so this
this particular servers running kill us

470
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:28,159
one auto or its raining SSL version 3
now as it relates to PCI and three that

471
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:34,580
one if that's within their CD in my
immediate that with that in mind now you

472
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:38,790
have who you need to go talk to the has
invalid certificates or expired

473
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:43,090
certificates are particularly utilizing
version which is not within your

474
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:51,490
guidelines within the organization so
medidata p.m. and 8 p.m. solution to

475
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:54,830
have metadata and you're like I'm cyber
I need the actual packets

476
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:59,720
that's probably true however during your
cyber triage process metadata is a much

477
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:03,520
more efficient workflow because you can
give flows utilization late see error

478
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:07,330
codes things that TCP reset things that
you would be looking for that whilst

479
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:11,360
they can actually speed up your cyber
triage process again to complement what

480
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:15,399
you already have in your solutions so
pack is obviously they don't like they

481
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:18,710
have all the evidence but if you can
leverage the metadata to kind of surf

482
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:22,230
through what you're looking for and then
drill into those packets that's a much

483
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:26,159
more efficient workflow that saying okay
I need packets go get me a hundred

484
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,639
thousand billion packets fullback for an
hour knowing going to download it now I

485
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:33,610
want to filter it takes forever to go
through that process if you leverage the

486
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:37,429
metadata you can get there a lot faster
and then that metadata lot of times and

487
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:41,020
in most solutions will act as a kind of
a filter so that if you're just looking

488
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:44,668
for example for FTP traffic or something
silly like that you can right-click on

489
00:34:44,668 --> 00:34:47,569
it give me those packets that's what I
want to see it we think we got

490
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:49,240
compromise who came in

491
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:53,908
what did they get I want to see the file
they just took from us again depending

492
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:58,010
on that on the use case we have brought
this one up earlier so when you're

493
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:02,300
looking at something this is kind of a
PC server resets retransmissions a lot

494
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,670
of times depending on the situation that
you're faced with on a cyber triage kind

495
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:10,170
of methodology if you're looking for a I
need to see all the TCP reset it just

496
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:14,520
happens last name because we think they
think it's a bot or or potentially

497
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:18,100
something called the server but we think
we may have a bot here again you can go

498
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:22,670
get all that type of information
strictly for packets or possibly but if

499
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:25,750
you can leverage the meditative surf
through that information faster again

500
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:28,960
you just get to the meantime to know a
lot faster than just going through

501
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,930
packet by pakka pakka torso those were
closer fine but if you can do it faster

502
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:45,720
again you get a complimentary use case
that actually speeds up your process so

503
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:51,430
we talk about attack reconstruction now
what we in particular attackers and we

504
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:55,330
see that information we need to be able
to reconstruct what that person did and

505
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:59,630
we can leverage that med and data we can
leverage those packets but if we

506
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:03,720
certainly take a step back of what are
you trying to do when you do a

507
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:10,399
reconstruction of China understand well
how they get in what do they look at the

508
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,480
whatever information has been
compromised

509
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:17,250
are we actively being compromised and
leveraging your APN and nvm solutions

510
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:22,670
that are now able to give you into them
formation of well ok this is how my and

511
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:27,670
my CD and I'm it looks today this is how
much information going across as well as

512
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:28,890
these protocols

513
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:35,600
additionally we can go back in time and
you that metadata from there is one of

514
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:40,029
the more popular clothes that a lot of
our cyber use cases in groups will look

515
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:43,990
for is a you know I don't you guys have
all this functionality and the Baba we

516
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:47,490
heard it all I want is information about
a host get me to that hosts give me the

517
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:50,700
information about that also soon as
possible that sound familiar

518
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:54,529
I see a bunch of you smiling / sleeping
so that's fantastic so one of the use

519
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:57,730
cases obviously your EPM solutions are
looking at servers are looking to

520
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:58,369
clients

521
00:36:58,369 --> 00:37:01,680
they've got a lot of that information
even on the virtualized servers so

522
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:05,580
on your lips so if you want to just have
something where you can just pop in here

523
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:10,529
just need something quick dirty boom
here's an IP address 192 168 11 and

524
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:13,680
giving everybody is talking to you right
now or the last hour or the last day

525
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,640
again

526
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,359
leveraging that metadata from those
types of solutions can shorten your

527
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:22,310
cyber triage you can also leverage its
who you think you're going this way

528
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:25,710
cyber triage you step back and go well I
thought it was this IP address now I

529
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:29,060
need to look at number two and number
three number four again you can do that

530
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:33,240
with packets it'll take I'm gonna call
this a technical term freaking for ever

531
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:36,970
but you can do it so if you're
leveraging solutions from European 10

532
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:40,209
p.m. solution obviously got a host
search most of them will have some type

533
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:46,410
of posters give me the IP address the
last hour who is this guy talking to the

534
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:50,339
perpetrator of this IP address talking
to one other other applications a lot of

535
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:54,300
times because the Arabian p.m. solutions
are a little more protocol focus you

536
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:58,250
actually pull out application pieces
it's not just rate DNS it's not just

537
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:02,430
read all that they're actually he went
right into my Oracle server room that's

538
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:05,720
probably not good for the company jewels
are other prominent be happy about that

539
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:09,640
again it may open up the door you're
going thru Cyber investigation without

540
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:13,319
having to go through individual packet
by packet that leverage those were

541
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:18,820
closed from the metadata perspective so
that if we look at the integration

542
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:23,500
points this is a key item here is that
take a look and how many of you are

543
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:28,840
aware of what AP mandem p.m. solution
here at your actual corporation utilizes

544
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:34,390
if he does then you probably know what
integrations are available to your

545
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:39,370
existing tools so we're saying here is
what tools you have today and how can I

546
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:43,710
integrate with your other tools that you
have today and increasing that value of

547
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:49,220
what your leveraging and you can put
that into either big daily your sim but

548
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:55,120
got some sound effects gone on too so
with that we have also have our API side

549
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:58,630
of the house as well for 8 p.m. and 9
p.m. so that we now we can if we do have

550
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:59,020
it

551
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:04,500
investigation or something to that
effect now we can leverage the API to

552
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:09,270
pull out particular dataset say that's a
particular type or something to that

553
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:12,700
effect to build the attack
reconstruction that we mentioned earlier

554
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:18,370
now just a quick slide anybody wants it
more information was to talk to us

555
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:20,130
further our booth is in the back

556

it politically don't want to do it

561
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:44,850
tactically don't want to spend the time
to do it if you do there are beneficial

562
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:49,210
workflows there are complimentary use

do that we didn't know that the question
you should go asked III my high

565
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:02,290
recommendation for Robert I both of us
would be go ask your network team in

566
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:06,250
your application team what solutions are
you guys using get a list of them find

567
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:10,260
out what things they are what data is
available number to have them do train

568
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,020
for it you know that's a good thing

569
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:15,840
number to find out who their integrating
with because if you can integrate their

570
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:20,040
solutions and your cyber solutions you
may get a double workload use case and I

571

572
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:27,180
return on investment for this particular
project because we found some synergies

573
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:31,270
we can leverage on the APM p.m. solution
that actually reduce overall costs means

574
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:34,690
