1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,950
here with this but my focus is a little
bit different than most of the employees

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:11,139
work force members out I'm focused on
protecting operative as a corporation so

3
00:00:11,139 --> 00:00:15,290
I'm the director of information security
adoptive I get to play with all the fun

4
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:20,220
technology and tools and a great in
people process and technology and a

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,919
couple of the areas I'm focused on his
identity access management but also a

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,220
cyber security incident response so
we're going to talk a little bit about

7
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:32,969
how those typically two different silos
start two intertwined and the importance

8
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:35,860
of each one of them and instead of
treating them as two separate things

9
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:40,230
let's treat him as one so if you think
about it

10
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:49,030
our problem right or threats landscape
continues to change every day and part

11
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:53,940
of that is the factor that our security
programs still keep those and treat them

12
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,489
as completely separate and we've got
common challenges that are part of that

13
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:03,120
right now and you have to understand the
clear understanding of threats gotta

14
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,380
understand defenses can lag behind your
different threat models that are there

15
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:14,530
and you've got to be able as a business
unit balance risk and the first section

16
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:18,210
you really have to be able to focus on
is what are your threat mappings how to

17
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:21,309
analyze that how do you look at that
data differently than what you do today

18
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:26,310
because when you look at programs firm a
identity access management silo or an

19
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,380
incident response silo people are
looking at different types of data but

20
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,070
actually a reality your sake analysts
are looking at something that's very

21
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:40,309
similar now from a defense from the
defense's that lag behind an attack

22
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:43,439
think about it from the dwell time side
of things

23
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,409
the number of days between somebody's
breached and the amount of time that's

24
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:48,720
detected

25
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,700
the number of companies that learn about
a breach from Krebs on security right

26
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:59,670
from Ms in other media outlets and where
those are actually coming from him after

27
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:05,500
customers identities internal work force
members you know commercial products

28
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:13,420
devices that maybe interjected into your
landscaping and portfolio so for my

29
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:18,480
information security perspective and
what we've realized just like he hasn't

30
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,679
heard from many of the presentations are
boundaries itself or actually

31
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,050
disappearing more and more corporations
are going towards a cloud computing

32
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:29,280
environment infrastructure as a Service
platform-as-a-service software as a

33
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,520
service and why are they doing that
they're getting better service out of

34
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,410
those providers than they are the key
function but what they do to us as

35
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:39,440
information security team now

36
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:45,070
actors that are rotated in around the
world don't care really where your

37
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:48,989
infrastructure for your platform your
software is actually maintained there

38
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:53,739
looking at you as a conglomerate
organization has data in which they want

39
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:55,190
they can use for financial gain

40
00:02:55,190 --> 00:03:03,570
now the risk adjusted returns associated
with watching those attacks have

41
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:08,260
actually drastically decreased rate you
got sovereign nations you've got Eric

42
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:16,260
snowden he went to russia and and has a
silent right so there's a pattern in

43
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,399
which they can actually get by with this
right in healthcare space today you know

44
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,480
how many times has a organization came
forward here recently and they've had

45
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,970
some type of crypto blocker her brain
somewhere that's actually been put on

46
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:35,950
now on devices that's basically left
that business to be unusable and the

47
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,399
organizations are pain

48
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:43,709
that amount of firms to reduce the risk
to their business shooting and they

49
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:47,400
believe it's a victimless crime at that
point that's why they're going after

50
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,599
they don't understand what the business
impact is so we're here intruders and

51
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:56,540
your threats are actually going after I
know there's more to a different methods

52
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:02,250
of attack and those attack mechanisms
investors continue to change those are

53
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:07,879
our realities in the cyber security
space and it's been that way for quite

54
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:13,578
some period of time and if you look at
what we have to protect every security

55
00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:19,108
problems out there there's advanced
threats there's cloud infrastructure

56
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:24,400
services and mobility there's
third-party risk evolving technology

57
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,659
landscapes you've got your insider
threats and behavior and analysis that

58
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:35,340
continues to come up but think about it
in the future right some of the top 2016

59
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:40,030
security trends have you thought about
3d printing as a risk your intellectual

60
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,280
property walking out the door about this
new pacemaker maybe that you're creating

61
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,099
have you thought about the what
information security risk and concerns

62
00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:50,180
are to your data when you start to worry

63
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:56,159
look at Big Data technology to maybe do
financial transactions look at

64
00:04:56,159 --> 00:05:00,030
healthcare data differently if you
remove that personally identifiable

65
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:04,650
information or that payment card
industry information away from that you

66
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:08,099
looked at the aspect of your mobile
applications in the Internet of Things

67
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:14,380
more and more cars are being connected
to the cloud you've got sales force that

68
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:19,430
becomes a platform of actually sending
health checks into words out into the

69
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:23,150
cloud that's right behind your your
firewall that's not behind your

70
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:27,370
perimeter and we as an organization in
industry from a security perspective

71
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,470
have always focused on building that
outer shell

72
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:35,520
and focused on the outer shell but we
haven't been as focused on the cloud

73
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:42,630
computing aspect if you look at the
information that's out there about 90

74
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:45,969
different cloud providers are being
leveraged inside your environment at any

75
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,260
time

76
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,370
know how much visibility do you actually
haven't done that and what does that

77
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:54,470
mean to the dataset that you're trying
to protect are you aware of it and how

78
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:58,170
does that work at it from the incident
response and are you aware of it from

79
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:03,010
that asset classification and knowing
the inventory of where those where that

80
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:07,000
data lips are you sent me from identity
access management perspective

81
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,390
authentication authorization privilege
management the identity that has access

82
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:15,280
to that data and it really starts to
bring in a lot of different questions

83
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:22,010
and that security landscape as
practitioners who always focus on people

84
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:27,650
process and technology but people
process and technology by itself starts

85
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:32,200
to break down the barriers in between
each one with sailors you have your

86
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:37,140
typical management to planning solutions
that are out there he's got typically

87
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:41,560
today you're monitoring operations are
strict security operations teams we've

88
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,230
got the teams that are focused on
architecture engineering your security

89
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:50,140
solutions and coming up with what is
that next best generation in point

90
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:53,800
solution that may be out there and then
you've got all your different defensive

91
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,690
controls that are out there own servers
workstations your network perimeter

92
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:03,350
inside your app store data but how often
do they actually collaborate about

93
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:07,540
identity access management and response
because the very first thing that

94
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:12,390
typically gets asked as you're going to
an instant responses to who had access

95
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:18,719
to that where did that start from but
today we're more like early met medicine

96
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,250
we have a whole team of people that are
sitting around the patient at the moment

97
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:27,980
the data breach that is occurring and
we're all taking different shots at what

98
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,169
actually occurred

99
00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:36,289
and it's tough to actually get and
understand what the diagnosis is for

100
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:40,080
that patient by doing that yes we're
collaborating but we don't have a lot of

101
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,580
anecdotal and scientific data that's
behind the scenes to understand what's

102
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,498
actually occurring because we're not
sharing information from the threat

103
00:07:47,499 --> 00:07:54,439
intelligence base around so access
management so if we look at dwell time

104
00:07:54,439 --> 00:08:04,830
as an example recently in February 7
17th came out with a report that said an

105
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:13,089
apt actually maintained access for 356
days inside of environment but the

106
00:08:13,089 --> 00:08:17,039
attackers actually had two hundred and
five days worth the time and which they

107
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:22,409
had free rein inside the security team
never was aware I think about the amount

108
00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:27,169
of damage that could occur and that
amount of time you think if you were a

109
00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:32,598
patient 12 times dwell time I was linked
back to the healthcare environment or

110
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:36,490
financial system if you were able to
have some type of virus that was in your

111
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:41,099
in your body for a long period of time
205 days with how you going to the

112
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:45,029
doctor right and get checked on your
inner checkups that's pretty significant

113
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:53,010
really caused major harm your body for
that's why are these organizations are

114
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:57,069
actually getting in trouble right it's
been mounted well time that was there

115
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:01,449
that's why all the GRC controls are
actually being put in place for risk and

116
00:09:01,449 --> 00:09:04,800
compliance perspective is people are
doing the right things from the

117
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:10,839
detective perspective so that brings up
the strategy and innovation right how do

118
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:14,750
we start to think differently share
information that goes back and forth and

119
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,810
how is we

120
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:20,339
how can we from a consumer perspective
in a in a business perspective actually

121
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:22,649
provide information into

122
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:29,499
so some people are probably aware of
this from a military background but the

123
00:09:29,499 --> 00:09:37,110
loop right observe orient decide act and
if you can do that faster than what your

124
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:43,089
attacker does that you'll win think
about it from a military background you

125
00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:46,420
can observe what the what is going on
the employee you're gonna orient

126
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,569
yourself what is going on here in a
decide what to do i mean you're gonna

127
00:09:49,569 --> 00:09:54,149
take an action with the attackers are
doing the same thing except when they

128
00:09:54,149 --> 00:09:58,470
observe orient themselves about your
network here environment the IP address

129
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:03,600
space what privileges you have a matte
box don't have enough box what

130
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,399
authorization you have on that machine
access to data you have never seen and

131
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,290
then they decide which is actually
fitted right they're deciding what to do

132
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:18,679
next and then they take that next action
now that pivot maybe taking data that's

133
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:22,220
on the system that you have in front of
you that pivot may be compromising

134
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:30,319
another host but if we look at things to
from today's perspective what majority

135
00:10:30,319 --> 00:10:35,878
of the organizations are doing the
security guys go oh no I believe we have

136
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:37,439
an issue

137
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:42,360
starts off with an email almost the
majority of the corporations are

138
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:50,230
probably working in this fashion today
and then you get asked well what do we

139
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:55,040
know about that what we do about that
environment to be scanned it to even

140
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:04,790
know we have that we know what date is
on that I T many times goes home no it's

141
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:08,389
compromised its unsuccessful we can't
clean it we can't get rid of it

142
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:13,999
whatever it may be aware something
that's never been seen by antivirus

143
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:15,620
software companies that are there

144
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:25,390
finally figure out who the owner of the
hostess identity first first letter who

145
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:34,439
owns who has access has access to
financial data from 190 to collect it

146
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:43,140
and we've got an inventory problem we've
gotta maintain custody of that device I

147
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:47,100
T support goes out and collects it to
get a copy of the image that now also

148
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,980
becomes another piece artifact that
you've got to collect and maintain

149
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:55,960
compliance wants to know what's a
sensitivity of the financial data that

150
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:00,970
was lost it was the CFO's laptop at PC I
information was the next quarter

151
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,390
earnings was it some new intellectual
property is it was gonna get police to

152
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,640
bur publicly traded company

153
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:13,630
something Sox related is going to impact
our stock price of course is worried

154
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:18,939
about you know the need to know the
exact nature of the stolen information

155
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:25,390
so you're starting to rate the aspect of
identity back to the data associate with

156
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:32,160
the incident response it's actually
occurring and then depending on the

157
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,640
nature of the incident you've got an FBI
case that you may be actually consulting

158
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:42,350
with and they of course are going to
want to know you know the specific data

159
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:48,839
that was stolen and what do you need
from them and they didn't know what to

160
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:51,370
know exactly the data

161
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:56,350
in most cases for incident response
today a lot of people are just or that

162
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,890
an Excel spreadsheet that's a lot of
communication go back and forth right

163
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:05,080
think about all the different email
messages that are going forward and he's

164
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,680
gotta maintain chain of custody for
every aspect of that which means you

165
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,589
have to know the identity of the person
that you're sending it to you gotta make

166
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:15,750
sure that that message can't be
compromised as it's been since you've

167
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,690
got to your right authorization you've
got the right cryptography that's built

168
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:26,360
into place which really causes a lot of
issues now if we pick it for a second

169
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:32,130
and we look at this from a threat
perspective threats are there to

170
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:37,689
basically the definition is the
intention of inflicting injury or damage

171
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:43,010
or other hostile action someone in
retribution that can be a person

172
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:48,670
individually that could be a company but
those threats that we're aware of

173
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:57,660
continued to change so if we look at who
actually typically causes these types of

174
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:02,140
threats and in who's actually out there
think about the type of person that

175
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:08,880
typically is working at this for my from
an insider perspective he's got threats

176
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,250
that are insiders are people who want to
look at from a competition perspective

177
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:20,270
here hacktivists your reputation people
but each one of these groups they're

178
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:25,040
looking at it from a curiosity curiosity
perspective that's why they're doing it

179
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:31,339
right and general that's the mindset of
the typical hacker an attacker that's

180
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:34,339
out there

181
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:42,690
we talked about dwell time for a little
bit all of these were publicly public

182
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:47,470
acts that actually got introduced but
there's many many more acts that are

183
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:51,380
current every day but they're not under
some type of regulation actually get

184
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:59,380
disclosed and what the estimate is at
this point is there's fifty times more

185
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:02,500
incidents that actually occurred that
never get disclosed down into the

186
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,910
environment than ever get released on
crips than ever get released back up

187
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:11,480
into the federal government because it
doesn't contain the right record levels

188
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,730
regulations that our environment

189
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:19,650
know what are the threats what are some
of the major areas that you've got to be

190
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:23,270
concerned with low course there's
organized criminals that are out there

191
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:29,160
are guys who are accepting bitcoins and
things you've got your hacktivist groups

192
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,670
anonymous that want to make a name for
themselves

193
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:37,510
you've got nation states right that
actually want to cause some type of

194
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,420
definition it

195
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:43,540
defamation of character to maybe it's a
political party have a military

196
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:47,990
advantage gained some type of
competitive intellectual property you

197
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:52,160
know the new Boeing jet engines are the
new fighter jets that the government is

198
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,880
going to release you've got competitors
that are more and more hiring

199
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,180
individuals especially for other nation
states where they're actually planting

200
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:05,609
them inside of organizations they pay
them to be in your organization has an

201
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:09,800
insider where they gain information that
in the game you're in Garner trust over

202
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:14,459
a period of time and then you've got the
aspect of internal and external people

203
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:19,690
that are good-natured but they pivoted
some point right they decide to take

204
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:23,420
another opportunity a new job and their
intentions change

205
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:33,670
so if you think about Eric's as an
example right he was a contractor for

206
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:39,599
Dell for a period of time he was asked
to leave as a contractor for Dell

207
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,810
because they saw actually suspicious
activity from the behavior analysis

208
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:47,890
perspective but they didn't have the
right third-party risk controls in place

209
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:52,640
to keep them from joining other
redesignation that's where he actually

210
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:59,100
gained access to the information and
then eventually went to ensure it in his

211
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:04,380
parents were also part of different
three-letter agencies working for them

212
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:08,130
course a period of time so it really
started if you think about it starts to

213
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:12,660
change we consider insider and what are
the actual threat patterns that are part

214
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:17,270
of that insider when is the turning
point that person no longer becomes

215
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:22,020
somebody that is a trusted work force
member and now become somebody that you

216
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,639
have to worry about what are the key
indicators that are that you should look

217
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:30,070
at what type of reconnaissance they
gonna be doing what's the packaging the

218
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:33,350
data that they're going to take how are
they going to take that data and then

219
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,620
how are they going to raise it

220
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,929
resurrect that later on so that's an
insider threat pattern how do you start

221
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:42,290
to look at that from an incident
response perspective then you've got

222
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:45,409
your typical DDoS threat patterns that
are out there where you do

223
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:52,970
reconnaissance botnet you test the
attack you try to flood do you have the

224
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:58,840
external network of the internal network
advanced threats Frank reconnaissance

225
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:04,699
lower somebody to go to website maybe
you're doing phishing attempts against

226
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:09,200
them he create an exploit one of the
most recent ones I've seen is

227
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,909
there were actually two a phishing
attempt two segments of organizations

228
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:24,120
hundred people out of time every 10
minutes actually test hundred emails it

229
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:28,570
will send them to open up a web page
that ends with start i HTA which is a

230
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:34,149
help file for Internet Explorer and
watch a JavaScript JavaScript will open

231
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:39,010
up a PowerShell command to end dump me
cats so you actually have all the past

232
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:44,670
the hash information to help out to
community college but that's an advanced

233
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:48,980
threat and how do you actually detect
that with your mouth where in advanced

234
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:52,550
malware solutions that are out there our
share something that you want most your

235
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:56,760
I T professionals to use because that's
something that's available on all

236
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,670
workstations it's available in Windows
it helps you are to me so how do you

237
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:04,180
take a different tack with that and how
do you know that that power shows trust

238
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:13,660
and then something that's new that's
coming up the crowd is cyber stalking if

239
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:18,190
I wanted to find out more information
about an individual and I actually

240
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:23,800
wanted to threaten them as an individual
who want to be able to do reconnaissance

241
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:29,659
on that as somebody who's looking at
this threat many times those individuals

242
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:34,850
really aren't they're oblivious to their
surroundings they're focused on a device

243
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:39,370
how many of us have cell phones walk
around with their head down how many of

244
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:42,770
us actually know who's looking around at
other devices were doing

245
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:48,749
not many but what does that cell phone
actually provide information to I know

246
00:19:48,749 --> 00:19:52,570
mine when I look it up right I forgot my
two kids that are on there they

247
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:58,309
immediately know I have two kids ranqe
it may have your name may have a device

248
00:19:58,309 --> 00:20:01,590
what happens if you leaves Bluetooth
honor their beacons that are on that

249
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:07,959
device typically people that are doing
cyber stalking there in observation for

250
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,710
a period of time they're looking at
things like your company badge right or

251
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:17,399
the Ranger then maybe around your neck
this is Joe Greene think about that from

252
00:20:17,399 --> 00:20:26,428
how many of our email addresses are Joe
dot green at whatever domain.com and how

253
00:20:26,429 --> 00:20:33,799
much information given away for about
your identity from that information

254
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:37,929
mining now the information mining could
occur from things like WhitePages

255
00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:47,609
LinkedIn but those are many times
they're exploiting just to have fun or

256
00:20:47,609 --> 00:20:50,980
to have some type of physical harm with
the individual right there wanna make

257
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:55,460
them upset about something that's where
you get into the cyber stalking aspect

258
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:55,919
of it

259
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,940
him many times today more and more CEOs
are actually falling victims to this

260
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:04,149
because they're out in the community but
they're also doing business you have to

261
00:21:04,149 --> 00:21:07,149
worry about those aspects from from a
security perspective

262
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:17,020
from the top 10 security threats from a
prior to the haitian perspective you've

263
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:20,879
got a look at the aspect of what are
these different categories what are the

264
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:26,700
different threats factors that may be
looking at this information and what's

265
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,580
the likelihood that that actually going
to occur

266
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:35,429
these are just an example those from a
third-party assessment based but every

267
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:38,350
organizations gonna be a little bit
different but these are good category

268
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:41,550
suit least start with and then start to
think about

269
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:50,830
Data Expo Expo tration malware virus
outbreaks exploiting on security issues

270
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:56,870
those are all different ways in a
different way to look at those different

271
00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:02,659
inside those different threats that we
mentioned earlier but when we look at it

272
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:08,020
overall you can't stop it right how
often can we stop this at the speed of a

273
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:12,410
network her speed of a wire that's
pretty tough to do so but if we can't

274
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:18,380
stop it doesn't mean that we stop trying
we have to continue to try but we also

275
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:21,840
have to implement all the detective
controls in nature so we could find it

276
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:27,139
later on an identity perspective

277
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:37,060
just like we're talking about from
threats you've got different users we

278
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:40,540
started bridging the gap where to bed
about what are some of the types of

279
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:44,780
information that you care about what the
different types of threats that you

280
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:51,220
should worry about but from an identity
access management perspective you've got

281
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:55,640
different types of users that are their
internal external vendors students

282
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,150
interns residents other right

283
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:03,560
different classes of people that may
need access to your data or need access

284
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:08,610
to systems different relationships of
those individuals to your organization

285
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:14,899
then you've got different levels of
infrastructure applications databases

286
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:19,970
servers those applications may be
hosting different environments we talked

287
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:24,780
about infrastructure-as-a-service cloud
as a service software as a service right

288
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:31,850
but also broke one side of your data
centers the other key components today

289
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:36,280
user directories are completely separate
your H R systems maintain work force

290
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:40,200
members but are your contractors in that
same environment most likely not because

291
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,810
one is for sourcing procurement the
other ones for here hrt write your full

292
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:49,480
time employees one of those actual those
identities actually start to emerge and

293
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,950
cross intersect each other so that you
can actually aid your incident response

294
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:56,480
team

295
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,290
he's got my identity people create an
identity as a service which basically

296
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:05,520
means taking that information on both
sides and collapsing that so that she

297
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,418
had one clean data repository and a lot
of the vendors that are out there were

298
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:14,140
actually so you services of completing
that you've got identity management

299
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:18,760
that's a component which really deals
with access management sure access

300
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:23,299
request what type of authorization that
they have that in count was created

301
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:29,370
removed update disabled you got your
access governance services that are out

302
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:33,809
there in general with I am certain which
is certifications world's governments

303
00:24:33,809 --> 00:24:39,559
segregation of duties logging auditing
reporting remember incident response

304
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:43,799
shift to know exactly who has access to
what and why they have access to that

305
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:48,840
becomes a key component of that and then
your authentic practice management

306
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:54,340
services and if we which is
authentication authorization password

307
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:59,090
manager but if we take a look at how
does the stuff together you have

308
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:02,620
identity that gets created whenever
you're you're created inside of an

309
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:07,229
environment typically have some type of
request an event that gets generated

310
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:12,450
maybe hr's hired you at that point

311
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:15,960
get some type of access that it's
created which provides you

312
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:21,190
authentication you get roles that are
added to you that provide you some type

313
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:26,370
of authorization and then depending on
what level of entitlement that you have

314
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:33,469
that account may need to be locked up in
a privilege management solution and then

315
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:37,169
a part of the overall control and
governance Beijing to have an extract of

316
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:42,220
all the entitlements to your
certification transfer mechanisms and

317
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:48,780
then access evaluation of reconciliation
so that eventually you know exactly what

318
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:53,480
access to remove into who do you need to
remove it from when somebody leaves the

319
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,460
organization

320
00:25:54,460 --> 00:26:00,900
but from an instant response perspective
but gotta make sure that we defend

321
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:05,600
against every adversary that all the
time and if they continue to know more

322
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,070
about your environment they had a longer
period of dwell time inside your

323
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:13,260
environment in which you have the
ability to actually spend time on it and

324
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:16,629
they're always going to win so how do
you start to gather that information

325
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:25,190
most the time least what we've seen from
a 2015 Verizon report was the case of

326
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:28,590
sixty percent of cases the attackers
were able to compromise organizations

327
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,189
within minutes

328
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:35,010
think about it your cell phone is
connected to a wireless network at work

329
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:39,260
your computer is connected to those same
environments

330
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:44,980
how are they getting in a lot of times
it's from fishing right what's it's in

331
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:49,810
point is your device which is on the
wireless network which has some type of

332
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:54,690
identity of you which has some type of
authorization which may or may not have

333
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:59,300
privileged into your workstation or may
or may not have privilege other devices

334
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:04,600
and server infrastructure space what
even makes it more complex as many times

335
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:08,780
that taxes may be what you have in a
cloud environment and maybe what you

336
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:16,970
have an office 365 and Amazon azure and
is a part of that what that typically

337
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:23,090
also means is a pivotal point of their
upsurge their little loop is actually

338
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:24,800
within 24 hours

339
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:30,010
first victim gets affected her gets
compromised and within 24 hours the next

340
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:36,490
boxes so how do you stay up to date fast
enough

341
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:40,730
whenever you know that the access and
where they have access to its gonna

342
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:44,980
change within 24 hours you're going to
continuing be chasing your tail if

343
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:49,890
you're only looking up tents on a
periodic basis and if you don't

344
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:52,490
understand what the privileges are that

345
00:27:52,490 --> 00:28:00,429
the attacker may have your path so in
this case you know especially from a

346
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:05,020
fishing perspective no time isn't really
on our side fifty percent of users open

347
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:08,350
email click on fishing leaks within the
first hour that you receive it

348
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:11,639
that's industry standard that's been out
there

349
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:19,179
median time to actually click as a
minute 22 seconds with me in a minute 22

350
00:28:19,179 --> 00:28:23,740
seconds fifty percent of the people that
you get out of that hundred person burst

351
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:26,740
was actually gonna click on the link

352
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:32,450
majority of those don't have CDs that
her published at this point which means

353
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:36,330
they're going to own your host before
you're aware of it because the scenes

354
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:39,490
are one of the things that for
durability scanners and other things

355
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:44,179
actually pick up on so how are you going
to actually continue to monitor that and

356
00:28:44,179 --> 00:28:57,890
understand it so we've typically seen in
again the time isn't really on your side

357
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:03,720
from this perspective right amount of
time that organizations go through is a

358
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:09,270
continuous loop but if you haven't
haven't detected some type of compromise

359
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:13,990
the last six months it's not because
it's not happening it's because you're

360
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:16,929
not looking in the right areas you don't
have to write log files you don't have

361
00:29:16,929 --> 00:29:21,620
the right to text in place many
organizations are falling short on

362
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:27,340
the aspect of actually having network
traffic as an example going into their

363
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:33,289
system of having sticks do steak and
taxi thread Intel have actually going

364
00:29:33,289 --> 00:29:36,649
back and you're simply provide
additional threat intelligence and that

365
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:41,629
space but every one of us platforms that
we've been deploying overtime typically

366
00:29:41,629 --> 00:29:44,969
have some type of API's and controls
that are in place and that's the only

367
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:50,940
way we're going to start as a industry
start to bridge the gap get him for help

368
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:56,289
from a threatened incident analysis
perspective this is for the most part

369
00:29:56,289 --> 00:30:01,999
the approach that we take right we have
a threat or an incident that occurs some

370
00:30:01,999 --> 00:30:06,590
type of threat analyst starts to look at
it acknowledges it to reach you in your

371
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:08,590
sock

372
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:14,470
determines that a word is something that
we need to investigate and depending on

373
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:19,649
that level 2 it changes from have been
to an incident and then you start

374
00:30:19,649 --> 00:30:25,100
looking at your threat intelligence feed
crosscut Klein in-house analysis and

375
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:28,689
then look at your partner and industry
that's out there to see if that's

376
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:34,960
actually something that's been known for
in the past you look at investigation

377
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:41,269
results root cause but think about how
it's time this is taken right they're

378
00:30:41,269 --> 00:30:44,830
going to continue the attacker and the
person is causing a threat against your

379
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:48,918
organization is going to continue to
push it through your environment so how

380
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:52,799
do you start to bridge that and the only
way you really can do is start to have

381
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:57,549
more towards an automated response that
actually leveraging those same data

382
00:30:57,549 --> 00:31:01,399
structures that we talked about earlier
to pull that information together into

383
00:31:01,399 --> 00:31:05,340
consolidated platforms for your sake
analyst can make educated decisions

384
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:13,218
so this is actually a scenario that
we've seen a couple different times with

385
00:31:13,219 --> 00:31:21,359
different alliance to think about and
you will build out but in a very first

386
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:27,710
thing that they do is they compromise
some type of captured credentials now

387
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:36,419
think about that for a second right
after capturing those credentials they

388
00:31:36,419 --> 00:31:43,239
now have identity of somebody they know
most likely your login IDs pattern of

389
00:31:43,239 --> 00:31:47,679
how your user IDs actually constructed
they have authorization inside your

390
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:52,619
environment from clicking have to sing
like right they have some type of

391
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:57,699
authentication to the host and depending
if you actually walk down the

392
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:04,729
workstation they may actually have an
entire data dump your credentials now if

393
00:32:04,729 --> 00:32:09,379
they don't have access to the time they
still can run things like meet at Stax

394
00:32:09,379 --> 00:32:16,478
when you do a pass the hash exercise
against it then leverage those same

395
00:32:16,479 --> 00:32:20,659
credentials that they just compromise
that hosts with to get inside they can

396
00:32:20,659 --> 00:32:26,029
look at external facing applications and
then they construct escalate privileges

397
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:29,029
and start to move a dollar in early

398
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:35,539
that point how many organizations
actually have the ability to look at or

399
00:32:35,539 --> 00:32:40,370
decrypt SSL traffic going up Mount
majority organizations even today when

400
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:41,969
the technology exists

401
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:45,250
they're not actually looking at that
because they fear some other regulatory

402
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:52,000
compliance issue no matter its PCI HIPAA
and what happens if that cryptographic a

403
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,690
cell search is then used for armed
forces good and what that is allowing

404
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:01,710
them to do then attacked her attackers
and protectors are then able to take

405
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:08,149
advantage of that concern that
information out about Steve from a data

406
00:33:08,149 --> 00:33:15,209
loss prevention perspective so when you
think about this every component that

407
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:20,029
deals with identity access management
for capturing the credentials when

408
00:33:20,029 --> 00:33:23,960
there's your access there's your
identity you have the credentials to

409
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:29,039
consign well now you have the
authorization escalate privileges oh

410
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:32,039
well there's a privilege management
solution

411
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:35,980
you have some type of lateral movement
that's in there so that means there's

412
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:39,169
not the right separation of duty of your
infrastructure inside that environment

413
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:48,230
from that same scenario we were able to
run a few things that her pretty

414
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:57,800
enticing and interesting people think
that they can compromise and environment

415
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:02,210
by leveraging badges game physical
access to it but it's not just about

416
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:07,410
gaining physical access you can do
remotely over the wire you can do it the

417
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:12,550
firewire was traffic but here are a few
examples of different reckons recon

418
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:16,590
utilities that you can actually leverage
and what we're seeing inside of the

419
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:20,770
incident response base so we're seeing
people run command I exe spot Michelle

420
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:25,770
right from PowerShell scripts to
actually do to run many cats RWC

421
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:31,929
schedule that as a task to talk helped
found through command-and-control top

422
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:42,820
and then leverage WMI to validate the
post is up and running or not everyone

423
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:50,360
can I sit back and you have to know
who's the authentication aspect of it

424
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:54,160
who owns that service account who owns
that individual account to actually be

425
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:59,029
able to track down and validate that
there is no additional dwell time inside

426
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:06,290
the organization of the things that may
be leveraged during a recon stage is my

427
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:14,490
understanding nephew and the domain for
users looking in open ports net files

428
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:19,439
net sessions primarily if you look at
crypto Walker and ran somewhere they're

429
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,710
using nets session in that file they're
wanting to understand what file shares

430
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:29,010
are actually actively available and then
they're locking those behind where why

431
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:32,950
because then they can make you pay a bit
more than the sum of our industry

432
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:42,549
you don't have any reviews repercussions
the same tools that are used for remote

433
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:47,839
execution and that that environment for
the same things that RIT teams are going

434
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:49,259
to leverage right

435
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:54,760
think about scheduled task is eighty exe
are you gonna be able to determine that

436
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:59,930
from a simmering perspective a lot of
your server per server personnel 90% are

437
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:05,270
gonna be leveraging that they're gonna
be starting task scheduling those WMI

438
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:10,960
again they're gonna want to know if your
servers are up or down operational power

439
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:17,130
show they typically import users create
mailboxes check diagnostic machines

440
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:23,380
patchwork stations are emerging power
show RTP same thing your your service

441
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:29,130
desk is probably lie between now and
then there's third-party tools which

442
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:33,270
Sysinternals I guess you could consider
that third party but it's really

443
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:37,440
Microsoft right where you've got Pierce
exactly you can spawn of the processes

444
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:44,010
and services but our phones gonna take
some type of privilege inside of the

445
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:49,089
environment from a sim perspective some
of the things that you should

446
00:36:49,089 --> 00:36:53,470
potentially look for from an incident
response look at the number of these

447
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:56,220
that our actual identity access
management related that you had one

448
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:00,759
actually validate and verify insiders
seem to be able to detect some type of

449
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,210
twelve times give it the compromise if
you're looking for these you at least

450
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:07,900
have good indicators that something is
going wrong inside of your environment

451
00:37:08,619 --> 00:37:16,200
identifying alerts around account
lockouts establishing event ideas around

452
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,689
adding users to privileged groups right
to domain admins group for built-in

453
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:24,329
Administrators group other things those
are great ways to actually be able to

454
00:37:24,329 --> 00:37:29,329
pick that up without having a preventive
control in place you can have that

455
00:37:29,329 --> 00:37:35,750
detective their security group
enablement modification changing the

456
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:40,230
purpose of group successful user account
login if your domain had been

457
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:46,280
administrators password for scheme admin
password user rating in all the Sun is

458
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,369
used and that's not something I normally
used in your environment

459
00:37:49,369 --> 00:37:55,790
publisher or log that wax regular key to
that old user login attempt account

460
00:37:55,790 --> 00:38:01,970
login with explicit credentials those
are different account usages and I am

461
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:06,169
framework right things that could simply
due to the indicator a compromise that

462
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:11,270
allowed you start looking at things for
me it's a response perspective there's

463
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:13,590
other items there as well

464
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:19,810
interactive logins network logons back
service and I'm rocks again

465
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:25,380
other other event types that you can
consider from interactive logon

466
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:30,420
prospective in most cases organizations
are at least encrypting some type of

467
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:36,890
information as it goes across the wire
but you probably want to be aware of the

468
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:41,140
fact if there's an event to the
interactive logon where it's sending the

469
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:44,500
network credentials in cleartext across
the wire that's probably something you

470
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,070
should look at it again

471
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:51,970
indicator that something's gone wrong
network logins to printers her voters

472
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:54,970
depending on what has

473
00:38:58,789 --> 00:39:03,989
so when you get this from an overall
perspective and you get sure I am team

474
00:39:03,989 --> 00:39:08,749
communicating across the different silos
with your incident response you can

475
00:39:08,749 --> 00:39:11,939
actually start to pick up some of those
key characteristics of events that you

476
00:39:11,939 --> 00:39:15,368
need to worry about you can start
looking at the threats and the actors

477
00:39:15,369 --> 00:39:18,819
that are out there and you can reduce
your overall risk posture in that

478
00:39:18,819 --> 00:39:26,019
environment because your reputation loss
of intellectual property and operations

479
00:39:26,019 --> 00:39:30,589
area what the impacts of a breach our
and you've got to be concerned with that

480
00:39:30,589 --> 00:39:35,788
information security and compliance
regulatory and other perspective and it

481
00:39:35,789 --> 00:39:40,239
doesn't matter what industry and
vertical that your end we're here to

482
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:44,749
establish make the business world right
if the business doesn't continue to grow

483
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:48,839
they're not going to continue investing
in information security risk management

484
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:57,779
so what have we learned right and how do
we actually apply some of this number

485
00:39:57,779 --> 00:40:03,269
one if you're worried about cyberspace
stalking and cyber bullying right for

486
00:40:03,269 --> 00:40:11,879
you individually personally go to the
DMA . or at least remove your personal

487
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:16,799
information out from the from the web
now going to be temporary

488
00:40:16,799 --> 00:40:20,959
everyday people are actually posting
them and harvesting more information but

489
00:40:20,959 --> 00:40:25,249
that at least gets your name out of the
public like I'd encourage you to do it

490
00:40:25,249 --> 00:40:30,968
not for you just yourself but also for
your children right that's one way to

491
00:40:30,969 --> 00:40:37,150
the to start knocking down that threat
vector enable efficient logging

492
00:40:37,859 --> 00:40:42,799
we talked about some of the Event Viewer
logs that we need to consider if we do

493
00:40:42,799 --> 00:40:47,019
that we'll have a better indicators of
pellets and indicators a compromise

494
00:40:47,019 --> 00:40:51,769
understand really what your threat model
is what does the threat to your business

495
00:40:51,769 --> 00:40:56,508
what is the threat to the processes of
your organization or they were the

496
00:40:56,509 --> 00:40:57,950
people themselves

497
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:04,828
in the first three months right perform
some type of indicator indicator of

498
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:11,040
pivot hunting on your actual him points
look at it from a enterprise disaster

499
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,400
recovery perspective in solution

500
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:18,089
everybody has Microsoft event viewer
logs and many many of us have some type

501
00:41:18,089 --> 00:41:22,630
of sim solution everything that was
shown here was in Microsoft your locks

502
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:25,930
he should be able to start delivered
some of those pretty easily

503
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:31,589
will play three different scenarios rain
it's a way that you can actually start

504
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:36,220
to harvest information about your
organization lack of process lack of

505
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:40,410
understanding for the people perspective
it start to understand your technology

506
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:42,868
more than you do today

507
00:41:42,869 --> 00:41:48,910
implement some type of virtual directory
and may ask why why why is that

508
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:53,029
important we talked a little bit about
them beginning of about identity access

509
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:57,130
management and the fact of the fact is
that you've got people who are doing

510
00:41:57,130 --> 00:42:01,490
business on your behalf that you aren't
aware of and how do you actually

511
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:06,180
continue to maintain and know about that
how do you look at that from a behavior

512
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:11,240
analysis perspective to know that they
are no longer a friendly insider but now

513
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:14,629
they're an insider that I need to worry
because they're going to another

514
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:19,819
organization they're going to another
company in that case those virtual

515
00:42:19,819 --> 00:42:23,329
directories typically your career also
storing information about social media

516
00:42:23,329 --> 00:42:30,069
presence LinkedIn Facebook Twitter why
all the sudden you've got a higher value

517
00:42:30,069 --> 00:42:34,329
trusted employee in your organization
and they are connecting help to a lot of

518
00:42:34,329 --> 00:42:39,170
recruiters or other H R personnel that
may be a reason that you need to take

519
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:44,190
additional monetary steps on their
actual work station in their device he

520
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:47,670
may have additional auditing and logging
that of alerts that you want to look at

521
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:52,480
you may be wanting to look at patterns
of exfiltration of data

522
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:59,080
our date that all terminated users are
actually removed from your environment

523
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:03,620
we talked about that from the GRC
perspective and certification

524
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:08,120
perspective but I would guarantee you
that you've got individuals inside your

525
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:11,390
environment that either don't know what
the service of the functional karen is

526
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:16,230
that that person had that is now roughly
organization and there's no owner of

527
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:20,810
that or that there is an individual that
has access to your environment still

528
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:26,450
after they've left and if you look at
their last login date and if it's after

529
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:33,049
their term day be worried right start to
look at that as another key indicator if

530
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:38,120
you think about it from your perspective
there's a last login date event type

531
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:43,770
that's their match that together within
six months

532
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:50,480
implement enhanced authentication for
domain accounts some type of pass the

533
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:59,850
hash mitigating controls in place those
typically can be a bit fewer steps right

534
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:04,870
there are specific vents that tell you
if passed the hash has been successful

535
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:10,250
or failed those are things that you
actually want to look at knowing that it

536
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:16,920
failed is just as important as knowing
if it was successful design enhancer

537
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:21,380
incident response capabilities the email
flow back and forth and chain of custody

538
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:25,890
in the court of law that's horrible your
entire email systems gonna get caught up

539
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:31,420
make sure that on every one of your
emails if you are using the email or any

540
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:34,420
reports that you put that its client
privileged information

541
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:39,319
attorney-client privileged information
and that you're doing it on behalf of

542
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:47,470
the attorney otherwise they can continue
to subpoena that information and

543
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:52,609
certifying users access not just to the
infrastructure environments but actually

544
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:55,720
hear applications and the access that
that has

545
00:44:56,530 --> 00:45:02,420
many individuals transfer within sight
organizations hospital system's

546
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:09,210
financial institutions other
environments and one of the things that

547
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:14,190
continue to go onto is the board of
authorization across the board and where

548
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:18,500
one of those users get compromised now
they have a blowout of authorization

549
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:22,340
that they now have access to and it's a
way that you can continue to ratchet

550
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:30,010
down the amount of damage that can occur
from her reputation perspective what

551
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:33,170
you're really trying to do is get these
different tools get the process is

552
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:38,060
actually integrating together this is
more of a modern day right

553
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:41,700
er room where you've got different
components and systems that are working

554
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:45,640
together you're limiting the number of
positions that are actually the room the

555
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:49,759
part of its because the sharing
information integration in between the

556
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,460
different technologies and solutions
that are there

557
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:57,270
the medical devices equipment directly
sending information back and forth you

558
00:45:57,270 --> 00:46:00,490
want to be able to get to that same
state from your information security

559
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:04,220
risk management to your thread analytics
and your incident response and I am

560
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:09,730
perspective and it does take time but
every one of those solutions inventors

561
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:15,430
have some type of API that are available
out to it so records those leveraged

562
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:19,419
there's actually two ought to automate
that incident response by birds those to

563
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:22,830
gain additional information about those
indicators the compromise of those

564
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:27,580
indicators of some type it in your
environment and if you start to do that

565
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:32,020
you're going to gain better visibility
about that environment and you're

566
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:36,050
actually understand the house it estate
about your environment better than

567
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:40,180
ninety to us which actually makes you
the first person that they call when

568
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:43,669
something happens versus being afraid to
make the phone call

569
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:49,490
questions

570
00:46:49,490 --> 00:47:09,250
references but I believe so it's been a
