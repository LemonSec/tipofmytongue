1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:45,020
challenges are a little out of the
University's Wexner Medical I'm just so

2
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:50,129
proud of the ship back in for a little
bit between where men and women vs

3
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:59,959
governance structure than this
recommends not a silver government

4
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,530
structure in your environment or the one
that we follow the obstacles that

5
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,490
top-down decision-making perspective to
the actual implementation it isn't

6
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:12,350
tactics that you can try but when you
think about it is removed from decisions

7
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:18,630
to implementation and its moment you'll
have to wait until the question section

8
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:27,050
so we lost our roles here we're looking
at risk and controls to manage the risk

9
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:32,570
is going for at least it there's a gap
in our environment our governor tools

10
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:37,679
that and we want folks in either our
server environments the technology in

11
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:45,190
place our readers to comment over a
glass doors over environmental controls

12
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:53,250
and dates so he fired the risk
management process control and the right

13
00:01:53,250 --> 00:02:00,190
control is not always easy to go that
route but first we actually tell you

14
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:08,740
there's a typical governance structure
has a executive at the top of the

15
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:15,860
steering committee you for managers
middle management in a stadium as we

16
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:20,620
have but they control the resources that
you were supposed to do the work to

17
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:25,360
track down a decision going to resources
next might do something but there's so

18
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,830
many breakdowns in between the risk of
severe

19
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:38,489
senior leadership for your project
management risk decision makers make a

20
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:52,400
decision tree to raise the money to do
it happens here as well but that's

21
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,680
really typical but its side and minds of
those leaders leaders here with a

22
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:02,090
theorem told them has to go through
security control doesn't always work

23
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:08,300
with people looking to rebound as it is
but a minority communities we talked to

24
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:13,130
go to have a conversation with you would
like to go away

25
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:20,790
barriers that prevent us from going from
that decision to actual implementation a

26
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:25,030
lot of times it's going to be taken to a
more senior leadership and built a stop

27
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:29,510
at all all the bad stuff to stop not
realistic can prevent everything but

28
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:58,489
that message to her yet because they're
afraid that some of the engineers me if

29
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:07,400
you were me to support environment has
no about everything and leadership will

30
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:14,180
make a change your policy perspective so
this is where every potential risk

31
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:20,009
realest decentralized so you made your
decision

32
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:25,979
organization structure with you go to a
person is not your conventional loan of

33
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:31,380
his role as they have a different though

34
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:38,190
explanations they were easier things on
for a little bit more difficult because

35
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:49,699
we are talking to him at that moment
when speaking this is a

36
00:04:52,180 --> 00:05:16,180
usually implemented the operators of the
business calls about reports that

37
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:26,300
everyday stuff to do more with less
distance / improve that process

38
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:35,930
5 organization functions just like my
current organization

39
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,340
first yesterday

40
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:54,020
challenges

41
00:06:45,740 --> 00:07:08,870
manager

42
00:08:51,670 --> 00:10:48,180
something so so hard to think about the
fact that they are in the news trying to

43
00:10:48,180 --> 00:11:09,969
transform the way they did when he
returns the favor don't do something but

44
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:19,040
still have not foolproof selling what it
is you're asking for you can come back

45
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:26,449
and say we don't like using more
sophisticated attacks they need for

46
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:42,960
their attorneys are what you need is
allocating resources to get things done

47
00:11:42,960 --> 00:12:06,120
you don't have a very specific things
the leading edge behind the next level

48
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:21,440
was taken from the words it doesn't
exactly know what their happiness do you

49
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:31,550
have they come back until the weather
not submit their expectations so grow

50
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:35,329
grow more

51
00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:45,679
which was a happy aside with your
decision

52
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:54,600
a person I can speak to that can bring
that that's your check so I thought to

53
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:12,040
be taken back to these colors don't like
to work with the guy who were the first

54
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:16,799
and probably the most so you know that

55
00:19:36,530 --> 00:20:12,960
so companies are having security
incidents doesn't show on the surface

56
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:19,700
but I for my organization research
projects do you think can trust you with

57
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:25,110
the day that they were charged with
protecting so we saved some rest not be

58
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:31,080
awarded to the language wasn't in there
that made me feel good about it so many

59
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:37,510
security chief chip advantage as opposed
to just that first period as soon as is

60
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:41,830
practicable were responsible for this is
a competitive advantage for you because

61
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:45,570
you saw me what happened at Hollywood
Presbyterian you don't have to be us

62
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:50,620
you don't want patients coming here
saying open-mindedness poses as things

63
00:20:50,620 --> 00:21:24,239
without california law that long day for
something else in the trumpet that's the

64
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,220
target

65
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:30,670
Research UK show up with your platform
saying understand me he's going to be a

66
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:33,990
no you don't talk to you about what it
is that you want to hear

67
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:46,220
things to keep you up at night Mr
grandma house

68
00:21:53,830 --> 00:22:05,240
to be honest it is it is a realistic
expectations that my team somehow

69
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,190
stopping every credit check out there
and I'm gonna show up on your sleep at

70
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:14,640
the wheel to get that thing happened
that's not checks figuring out long

71
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:20,330
continuum of where we are in reducing
the risk to get better excuse me right

72
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:24,250
here right now so badly to fix my also
so that we can talk about this or can it

73
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:28,370
wait until tomorrow the other one is
just that every day of it right

74
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:34,250
team where if tomorrow I read somewhere
in all the systems are done then we're

75
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:40,950
off and running it helps to cure but it
truly is more talk about right now

76
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:43,909
everybody to be talking to the thing
that sort of keep some yeltsin next day

77
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:48,860
I can watch the office and excellence
and my conversations for that and I'm

78
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:53,139
just not Lauren Boden maize and blue to
work

79
00:23:13,270 --> 00:24:01,650
to have a lot of quantitative and
qualitative mapping so i cant save

80
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:05,720
dollar for dollar that it reduces risk
by point nine billion dollars produced

81
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:14,400
by the way we are approaching that is
map incidents to control areas such a

82
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,210
threat scenarios never got controller
controls to get into it so in theory the

83
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:24,000
incidents that occur in that direction
area by investing in a control you'll

84
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,840
see lessens the impact of his it hasn't
been less than that rose up and soon I

85
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:53,070
mean so yesterday's incident management
management so for me when you're going

86
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:58,909
in there with the metric to send a
picture that a pretty long continuum

87
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:03,050
you're somewhere in this gradient here
and we're gonna move a little bit don't

88
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,800
have a ps3

89
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:12,210
very continue we're continuing to watch
over them I'm asking for the board's

90
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:18,340
more about it's a race pace here we
haven't done anything that we are we're

91
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:23,260
trending towards a green safer place and
I'll come back to you on so he made

92
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:29,070
progress was not so that progress over
the continuum is the MetroCard proposing

93
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:35,070
qualitative because their their their
tolerance for risk will come out of the

94
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:39,040
discussion I don't want to find their
tolerance for risk I don't walk away but

95
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:44,920
were forced to walk away with all this
scale way over here is good

96
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:49,920
we've got to work to get asking you to
invest in move us and we'll come back to

97
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:54,940
you explain what we've made progress and
why he said still for preserving fall

98
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:59,430
back because of other factors that have
occurred how we do that i'm satisfied to

99
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:05,080
show what it says were heat mat so risk
is the larger the riskier assets on the

100
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:12,330
scale shows the risk in an area for the
picture it gets smaller overtime doesn't

101
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:18,730
necessarily move down just one too long
so I think way they're going to want to

102
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:22,650
risk tolerance is showing them the big
bowl if you get a little bit smaller

103
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:27,330
than my skating smaller vs was not
getting floor and if I need more or less

104
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:30,330
or less investment in that area

105
00:26:30,960 --> 00:27:18,480
no no it has to be attached to a visual

106
00:27:19,149 --> 00:27:24,399
able to overtime be repaired ever
consistent

107
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:28,229
consistency from the bubbles not moving
then I'm not doing something with the

108
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:33,460
controls are just in the fact I don't
need I don't want to dig into the wheels

109
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:37,470
and how they were with them just the
bubble still the same size wasn't the

110
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:42,080
same size only have enough resources to
work on need this bubble over here that

111
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:48,230
this was not going to talk like that
will get you more to do more

112
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:57,140
proposal to you actually do more cynical
someone selling the tour a metric that

113
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:03,539
truly maps and what your organizational
culture that exists and security real

114
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:07,960
lot of these senior Tories have not
really been exposed to it beyond major

115
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:13,169
incident exposed as a major incident so
many shows a CEO or CIO gonna go in and

116
00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:18,559
say we had a major incident is not an
expectation that it never happens again

117
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:22,879
but there's nothing in there is built
into their risk tolerance thank you

118
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,649
don't have to think about security and
all representations and let me have a

119
00:28:26,649 --> 00:28:30,100
big incident that's not what I'm trying
to sell I want to sell it this is a

120
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:34,469
program over time that will make a
material dead and certainly are

121
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:35,539
investing

122
00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:39,509
others will just sit there if we see the
latest a change and shift are thinking

123
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:44,499
the model control that his will so we
can customize it to our organization I'm

124
00:28:44,499 --> 00:28:47,499
happy to share I mean this is not a
silver bullet

125
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,379
we're still developing it but it is more
up there will move your organization

126
00:28:52,379 --> 00:28:58,629
that is embedded or woven sort of
cultural understanding of security

127
00:28:58,629 --> 00:29:02,779
nothing new just pops up from time to
time and the whack-a-mole he's moving

128
00:29:02,779 --> 00:29:12,889
but not successfully saying GRC tool or
other metric always here to talk about

129
00:29:12,889 --> 00:29:15,889
helpless marble or discuss

130
00:30:02,640 --> 00:31:36,100
at all

131
00:31:51,480 --> 00:33:11,250
so

132
00:33:35,210 --> 00:34:01,120
so sure
