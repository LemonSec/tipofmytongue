1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,630
many of the regular schedule meetings
with your chief compliance officers

2
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:13,490
how many how regularly scheduled
meetings with legal counsel or general

3
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:24,810
counsel for your organization's that's
great how bout with you chief operating

4
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:33,260
officer or the equivalent chief
administrative officers and how many of

5
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:40,250
you subscribe to industry publications
for the industry which you are very good

6
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:47,430
last but not least how many of you brief
your board of directors on cybersecurity

7
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:57,170
risk issues again get a good showing up
hands for all these questions so spoiler

8
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:01,899
alert I usually tell everyone what they
should take away from this prior to

9
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:09,189
going into it we'll talk and talk to
each of these points so you know first

10
00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:13,350
as chief information security officer
officers are cheaper for me to risk

11
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:19,399
officers you're going to be required to
understand and articulate the business

12
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:25,380
impacts of cybersecurity risks I mean
there's no getting around it but you

13
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,380
have to do it in a way that people will
resonate but the people in your audience

14
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:43,890
balance compliance and security and I i
put exhausted mediocrity and you see

15
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:49,509
this a lot of organizations where nobody
wants to prioritize so you work on

16
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:54,039
twenty different things and even though
it ended a you're you're you're dead

17
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:58,740
tired really haven't gotten anything
done so you do that every day and every

18
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,869
day and every day and while you're
getting exhaustive you're not doing

19
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:07,679
anything very well so as executive is
whether you're the chief information

20
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:12,709
security officer or the cheaper for me
to risk officer or even in my role is

21
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:18,220
what they call the CSIRO is getting
those who think it is to understand that

22
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,030
we had to have a priority

23
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,810
there's things that we are going to
realize our risk but we still need to be

24
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:28,760
able to keep that focus and on those
things that are key press organization

25
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:36,940
number three is cyber security controls
have to be embedded in the business

26
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:41,680
processes and I think that you know
while you know from a technology

27
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,040
standpoint you know we we can build
things and we can put technology a place

28
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,510
for the business to use if it doesn't
actually getting to the point where it's

29
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:58,519
embedded into that business process then
really is like building a baseball

30
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:02,730
stadium in the middle of nowhere it's
it's great it's a great facility but

31
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:07,280
nobody playing baseball there they can
get to it so you still end up having the

32
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:14,419
risk because if the business isn't
involved in the execution the that

33
00:03:14,419 --> 00:03:25,120
program then it is really not doing
anyone any good the last thing is you

34
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,709
really gonna have to understand where
you are relative to your peers when the

35
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:35,849
first quest to that I received in just
about every forum that I have an

36
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:40,970
executive level is well how are we
stacking relative to our peer group

37
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,010
because

38
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:48,859
something occurs as an executive and
they're looking at fiduciary

39
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:54,670
responsibility and they find out that
their peers are at one level in there at

40
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:59,140
a different level then they understand
that they have an issue that they need

41
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:04,309
to resolve so understanding your posture
maturity level relative to your peer

42
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:13,790
group is going to be very important and
how do you respond to an incident and I

43
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:18,620
think that this is something that's
really interesting allowed the

44
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:23,860
regulators are starting to look at this
because what they find is that you know

45
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,930
from a technology aspect technology has
very strong processes about how they

46
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:33,210
would actually bring systems back online
but what they find out on the business

47
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:37,979
side is that from a communication
standpoint you know who I do you

48
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:42,789
communicate the clients communicate to
regulators when do you engage law

49
00:04:42,789 --> 00:04:47,909
enforcement when do you engage external
counsel all of the things that need to

50
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:54,419
do have to do with the outward facing
image of the organization are lacking

51
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:59,590
are not existed and that's going to be
equally as important as some of the

52
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:03,210
preventive measures and reactive
measures that are in technology

53
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,680
so there's a lot of different
definitions of cybersecurity risk

54
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,949
management I try to be flying when I'm
talking about seven security bits made

55
00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:24,379
me so that everybody is we're all on the
same page here so if the management of

56
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:30,560
the business is legal regulatory
operational and client risk that may

57
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,680
result from its use of air for me said
or technology in order to bring it

58
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:42,039
within its businesses risk appetite and
no that's a lot but basically it's how

59
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:47,849
that business the business as you know
whether it's legal regulatory and the

60
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:54,430
impact that those legal regulatory
climate impacts would have relative to

61
00:05:54,430 --> 00:06:00,509
how they use information about how our
businesses use information technology

62
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:05,130
and they will always talk to you about
you know their risk appetite you know

63
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:11,650
what is their risk appetite statement
are we within our risk appetite and

64
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:17,849
again so the cyber security processes we
have to extend beyond technology and

65
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:23,780
they had to be in embedded into the
business processes again I can't stress

66
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:28,888
this enough that you know whether its
vendor management so people though you

67
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:33,080
have to risk your vendors well
businesses are at risk breaking their

68
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,969
vendors appropriately and you thinking
you're managing the risk relative to the

69
00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:42,930
critical vendors only to find out that
the business didn't understand the

70
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:47,289
questions they gonna still have an issue
if incident response is great of

71
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:51,729
technology can bring systems online but
if I don't manage the communications and

72
00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:59,130
media relations you know engagement of
law enforcement engagement of external

73
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:04,550
counsel on the outside is great that
everyone's put together and brought the

74
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:08,449
system back online but I still have an
image problem that's going to cause a

75
00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:16,490
reputational impact if I put systems in
place floor for access control but the

76
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:21,060
business doesn't tell you how to build
the role or what people should be able

77
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,150
to do within application you still

78
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:29,109
about how a cybersecurity risk out so
the business has to take ownership they

79
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:33,280
need to understand where their
demarcation between kuwait technology

80
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:40,690
will provide and what the business
responsibilities so the reason I put

81
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:47,330
this site here is you know I think that
when you're you're in the grass roots a

82
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:51,659
lot of my background is actually in
technology and I remember people come up

83
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:57,180
and they would say we had to do this
because it told us to or because the

84
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:06,890
regulator told us to or no answer so
very vague statement here so in general

85
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:12,310
the regulators aren't there to try to
tell you how to do your job they are

86
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:19,630
looking at things from a very principled
base so I put some common guidance that

87
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:24,710
you see within the financial role but I
think you're really extends out into

88
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:29,890
other areas as well you know they're
looking at the size and complexity of

89
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:35,949
your business operations the makeup of
your customers a counterparty your

90
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:40,330
products your markets traded or just the
product that you provide to your

91
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:46,580
customer base and your access to know
your access when you get access to other

92
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:53,300
organizations and companies and you call
it the market interconnected it so you

93
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:58,430
should be managing those risks relative
to your place in any manner that would

94
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:03,050
be consistent with an organization that
meet the same criteria that you are

95
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:09,859
again your period or what is your peer
group how they maintain their risk and

96
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:13,920
then depending on your sector regional
presidents you'll have more stringent

97
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:22,140
controls our control requirements good
example is you know the OCC they have

98
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:27,710
very specific guidance around how thirty
third parties should be managed from

99
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:33,610
contractual to due diligence before hand
to ongoing

100
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:40,860
risk assessments and documentation and
reporting up to the board they're very

101
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:46,399
specific about the controls they expect
and then I know we always talk about the

102
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:53,190
new spraying worked in this framework we
talked to the regulators this framework

103
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:58,870
is something you can use not a silver
bullet it does do a good job of pulling

104
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:08,230
from other guidance documents and
framework so that you can build your

105
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:14,200
policies and standards and minimum
controls but what they really want to

106
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:25,019
see is that you're using some type of
work so either just a few of the

107
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:33,870
questions I remember December 2014 I was
at my holiday party and I was probably

108
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:39,920
my second drink in and CEO of investment
management comes up to me to put his arm

109
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:48,899
around me and goes so what happened
that's only happened here and you know I

110
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:59,570
was like happy holidays to you too but
again it shows that these are bored as

111
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:03,750
far as he was concerned that can they
really still is the email you know did

112
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:08,579
they really take that information and
make a visible to the public and how

113
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:13,810
would that happen and then his second
question follow up that question was at

114
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:20,550
how do we know we haven't been hacked
yet but i i i that with that was my

115
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:25,399
intro to my holiday party at my second
drink now of course I was able to give

116
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:29,430
him a very generic nondescript answer
given the the

117
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:35,649
the exact timing of those questions but
again it shows that these things that

118
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:41,860
are the border if you say sweeter
thinking and then they look at Cyber

119
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:49,549
Security differently so you know 44 I
work here consider critical

120
00:11:49,549 --> 00:11:56,739
infrastructure BNY Mellon custody youth
about forty two trillion dollars worth

121
00:11:56,739 --> 00:12:02,649
their assets so there is a cyber event
there and those assets became

122
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:10,949
unavailable somebody would notice but
not all of the areas for which a woman

123
00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:18,118
does business are part of critical
infrastructure so it because the money

124
00:12:18,119 --> 00:12:24,350
becomes a money game so for example you
have critical infrastructure has to have

125
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:29,350
all these minimum controls in place but
I have another part of my business thats

126
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:32,709
not critical infrastructure and maybe
they don't have those same stringent

127
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:38,170
controls so if I participate in this
business over here and I have 10

128
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:45,160
competitors and I had to spend a million
dollars on controls because I'm

129
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:52,670
connected to the surface structure but
they only had to pay $100,000 the

130
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:58,529
searcher what is that you know what is
my selling point for the extra 900 K

131
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:08,129
that had to speed so that can be
competitive this is the way executives

132
00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:13,379
and boards are looking at at Cyber they
understand that needs to be done they

133
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:17,730
understand that they have an obligation
to protect her but they want to be very

134
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,730
careful and pragmatic about how they
actually do it

135
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:35,810
are we speaking the same language as
those we need to employers so I would I

136
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:42,430
was working in the UK and I decide I
want to come up with a new look so I

137
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:45,520
went to this big department store they
are called chariots I don't know if

138
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:52,100
you've ever been to London but heritage
knew I have never seen such a large

139
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:57,080
department store my life or you can buy
anything from chocolates to jewelry to

140
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:02,150
clothing so I went there because I
wanted to get so a pair of suspenders

141
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:08,959
for my pants so I go and going to miss
department and there's a young man

142
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:14,540
standing there so I went over to him and
that's it gives me I want to buy some

143
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,540
suspenders for my pants

144
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:24,680
looks at me a little critically he takes
me take me out the midsection and he

145
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:33,560
walked me over to the women's lingerie
section like say there won't be any

146
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:39,229
suspenders here but you know i you know
i browse around for a little bit because

147
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:44,100
they figured he dropped me off here and
see what I needed I left and go to the

148
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:51,410
office so I explaining to my colleagues
there like you know do you know where I

149
00:14:51,410 --> 00:15:01,579
can get suspenders for my parents they
start laughing turns out bad pants in

150
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:11,050
the UK our underwear and suspenders
connect to your pants so it while it was

151
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:18,430
it did make things to him very much
women's lingerie but I had a score as

152
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:24,329
that of saying I need braces for my
trousers braces for your team

153
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:29,650
prices for your trousers needless to say
we both spoke English he understood

154
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:37,449
exactly what I said but I did not be the
failing with him because

155
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:43,980
and UK UK British English is just
different enough to cause those types of

156
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:53,460
confusion so that I will always remember
from now on that briefly on my teeth

157
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:58,860
braces on my trousers the ingrained in
my head I am very clear on the

158
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:08,710
differences now so that would explain me
before I see in the in the intersection

159
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:16,610
between the bid in this are legal and
regulatory compliance groups I work a

160
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:22,110
lot with our operational risk teams I
work a lot with our our client

161
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:30,270
engagement so when things that I always
try to do before I go into any type of

162
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:35,490
board or if they could get committee
meeting in order to get any type of

163
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:40,000
resourcing and that is I want to make
sure that when I go in that room and all

164
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,880
of them are sitting around the table
they're doing this

165
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:50,939
yeah we need to do we need to do that
and in order to do that I learned very

166
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:56,690
quickly that I had to talk to them about
things that they actually care about so

167
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:04,040
every every almost every regulator
regulator that I regulatory authority

168
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:13,040
that I know has a rule relative to
internal controls saying that the

169
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:17,659
adoption and implementation of Britain
policies and procedures reasonably

170
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,530
designed

171
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:26,240
violation whatever federal securities
laws if you actually look at a lot of

172
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,370
the new regulations or anything else
they're not really cyber specific

173
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:39,419
regulatory rules with regulators are
doing is they're saying disagree part of

174
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:45,380
internal controls just like you have
internal controls her credit how you

175
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:50,610
manage market risk cybersecurity is just
another risk that you need

176
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:55,809
too many aids in your organization and
if you do not have policies and

177
00:17:55,809 --> 00:18:02,240
procedures reasonably designed to manage
that risk being you're violating that

178
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:12,030
rule or regulation for your organization
so when I talk to regulatory or legal

179
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:17,110
individuals I talked to them about the
rules

180
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:23,699
relative to our organization around
internal controls and you know and they

181
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:29,720
put whatever I'm trying to get
accomplished in proper context for the

182
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:36,460
rules and the brakes but it's not just
enough to do that because there could be

183
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:42,400
raised or rules out there that are
really being in force so to understand

184
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,590
you know how they're actually being in
force working together with legal and

185
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:54,879
understanding somebody important actors
around how that rules actually be a poor

186
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:00,690
so give an example of the SEC if you
read a lot of air force main actions

187
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:07,260
it's because a company has created
policies and standards and they're not

188
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:14,950
following them and and you'll see that I
mean it's a constant thing you know and

189
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:19,260
what ends up happening is some
organization took a template they said

190
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:25,220
these are policies and standards and
that's all they did so there is no line

191
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:28,070
of demarcation about who is responsible
for what

192
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:31,168
but if somebody ask them if we have
policies and standards they could turn

193
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:37,720
around but we sure do they are well
that's great but if you're not doing it

194
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,450
and you have a violation because you
weren't doing it and I see that you have

195
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:45,990
policies and standards that you're not
following guess what you violated the

196
00:19:45,990 --> 00:20:12,679
rule client contracts and then sorry yes
so so this is where you had to balancing

197
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:19,720
act so if you're working with the board
the board really wants to know you know

198
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,960
how they stack up against you know
what's our peer group then how do we

199
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,260
stack up against their peer groups
whether we go out we get a third-party

200
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:33,330
audit team to come in and and help us
with that evaluation or if we try to use

201
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:36,820
our connections with the Indian within
the industry to figure out how we stack

202
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:42,620
up they want they want something that
shows them that they're they're alive

203
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:49,928
but that can also hope you say hey we're
reasonable because they are peer groups

204
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:56,260
are here what we're doing is a line with
our peer groups are doing so that can

205
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:59,260
help us you know what reasonable

206
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:21,500
so the question is how I seen the ship
between best practices and what are our

207
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:28,950
peers are doing I i've seen a shift that
says that all of our peers are doing

208
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:34,410
press practices and in that context yes
but I don't think that the best

209
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:41,410
practices are necessarily driving you
know you know the best practices aren't

210
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:46,560
alone driving where the industry is
going and that's and I'll say that

211
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:50,340
because most of the regulators that
regulate so you'll you'll have a

212
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:55,500
regulator let's say they they regulate
all medium-sized organizations financial

213
00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:01,410
organizations are financial assets a
bank's medium-sized banks and that

214
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:06,840
regulator will go and they will see how
you know numerous banks within that

215
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:12,330
within the sector are doing their
controls and they will come in and say

216
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:18,300
well yeah you're doing this but we
looked at other banks that your same

217
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:25,669
size and they're also doing this so then
by you know and it may not be at finding

218
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:30,800
per se it may be something that they're
looking for you to do which ultimately

219
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:35,440
means you need to find a way to do it
but again it's really being driven by

220
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,280
what they see our peer groups doing what
they where they see our peer groups and

221
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:47,300
implementation of specific programs so
there's a new guidance document out so

222
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:54,419
for example for third-party vendors that
raises that bar was like ok well the bar

223
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:57,350
has been raised all your peers are here

224
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:01,620
relative to how close they're coming to
meeting its implementation in place

225
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:07,570
either you're here you're here but again
they're still looking at you relative to

226
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:12,169
your peer group and driving it to your
peer group now all your peers have to

227
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:17,370
meet that same requirement that's true
but I don't think that from a regulatory

228
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:23,300
standpoint that that require me to drive
being whether you're going to be looked

229
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,320
at doing something reasonable

230
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,850
which the rest of your peer group is
doing even though they are driving to a

231
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:31,850
minimal controls

232
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:41,389
a couple of other things that just want
to point out on this slide but its

233
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:48,110
client contract I don't know you know
outside of your third party vendors you

234
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:54,340
know how you'll have client contracts
maybe you know investment management

235
00:23:54,340 --> 00:24:00,220
standpoint you hear your investment
management agreements so they're not

236
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:04,270
really they're not really third-party
there there's an agreement of the

237
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:10,529
services that your gonna provide an
organization what is contained in those

238
00:24:10,529 --> 00:24:16,820
in those client contracts you know
indemnification I've seen in cases where

239
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:23,649
they want to indemnify the client wants
to indemnify for all losses relative to

240
00:24:23,649 --> 00:24:30,320
cyber so anything and and of course the
businesses are looking at the end there

241
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,029
the same standard agreement that they
usually sign and they don't know that

242
00:24:34,029 --> 00:24:41,350
well we've just been defined the client
any cyber losses we can't do that but I

243
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:45,250
bet you if you have these types of
contract that people have been signing

244
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,260
over and over and over and over again
they don't pay attention

245
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:54,908
the client contracts are changing reps
and warranties changing rights to audit

246
00:24:54,909 --> 00:25:02,210
changing so do you understand within
these kind contract addendum that your

247
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:08,590
business is signing notification for
incidents those are being added to the

248
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:14,299
client contracts again if the business
doesn't understand their

249
00:25:14,299 --> 00:25:21,460
responsibilities relative to ensuring
that we have the you know the right word

250
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:26,169
or agreements with any kind contract
they didn't if they don't realize that

251
00:25:26,169 --> 00:25:30,419
they have a part and maintaining the
cybersecurity risk relative to our

252
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:36,779
organization that these types of being
an upcoming inviting you and then

253
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:44,860
regulatory focus so wow you know their
cybersecurity programs their babies have

254
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,719
a cybersecurity program

255
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,950
do you understand where your your your
primary regulator is really focusing in

256
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:59,659
on so for example Dec they're really
focusing in on your investment advisers

257
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:06,039
third-party vendors access controls in
its name and so you know why you are

258
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:11,100
doing other things you really need to
focus on managing and developing a

259
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:18,760
program that needs to be areas so that
helps you solidify and prioritize what

260
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:23,679
you need as they have done and again all
of these things help when you're having

261
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,880
a conversation whether legal or
regulatory individual around

262
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:34,710
cybersecurity putting year are you in
the same context as with a look at it

263
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:47,539
becomes very helpful operational impacts
and this is you know I talk to our our

264
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:55,360
COO actually my my my boss is the 300
demands made so we have these types of

265
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:01,399
talks all the time around where does
technology and technologies

266
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:10,830
responsibility and and our business
responsibilities began so and then if

267
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:15,500
we're not doing what we need on the
business and how will that impact our

268
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:24,380
operations like what can happen so you
know one of the things that I always

269
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:29,760
talk to you know where there's
technologists are risk assessors is do

270
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,390
you understand the business process as
well enough to understand what's real

271
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:37,929
risk of us not you know what

272
00:27:37,929 --> 00:27:45,280
from a financial standpoint they do it
risked all the time we I mean they're

273
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:49,250
their whole business is brisk day except
a certain amount of risk in order to be

274
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:54,280
able to make a specific amount of profit
so it's not that they don't understand

275
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,379
risk

276
00:27:55,380 --> 00:28:00,840
and that they're not local to taking
risk but they need to have be clear on

277
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,480
what those risk are and what risks they
may actually be managing within their

278
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:11,320
business processes so what ends up
happening if you don't understand that

279
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:18,820
is you in the building some type of
technology whether it's solution or some

280
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:23,800
type of technology crosses only to find
out that there's a supporting business

281
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:29,330
association process or some type of
business process that's already managing

282
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:36,010
that risk for you and what the business
nancy is arduous processes like why are

283
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:41,610
we doing this we're also doing this why
do we need bill and suspenders why can't

284
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:46,169
we just do this and it's a value and
it's a valid argument if they are

285
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:50,790
demanding that risk through business
process that is been shown to be

286
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:57,190
adequate and effective and then
understanding the materiality of your

287
00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:07,430
your peers cybersecurity risk management
per where if I go into executive board

288
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:12,580
meeting and I say you know what we
really need to concentrate on access

289
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:22,629
control access control this all out of
whack we need certain amount of money a

290
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:29,250
certain amount of funding to do so then
and at the same time you go but relative

291
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:34,840
to our peers we're right where peers are
they going to look and say well with

292
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:40,100
that money be better service somewhere
else or why can't I then take this money

293
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:47,330
and funds business revenue generating
project or why can I take this this

294
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:53,730
finding and you know whatever I have to
also bring up to par why do I spend my

295
00:29:53,730 --> 00:30:00,460
money there again so understanding your
the materiality and where your peers are

296
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:05,580
because very important because but the
board is looking at it its due share

297
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,740
responsibility to protect

298
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:17,309
that organization so how does it look as
a board member I align with my peers I

299
00:30:17,309 --> 00:30:22,660
took the head take money that money
resources time effort and I put it to

300
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:29,750
even further enhance this control but I
can around to find out I had a control

301
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:36,730
over here that with below our industry
standard and that's where I got bit not

302
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:40,679
saying that what we did with an
important but from a board members

303
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:45,690
perspective and looking at it from a
fiduciary responsibility that's going to

304
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:53,370
be a problem for them so you know when
the first things that I I recommend

305
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:58,889
people to do is to understand you know
where does my cyber security risk

306
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:07,970
management program stack up relative to
my peers and I know he brought this up

307
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:13,200
in the key point so much I'm here
because he points with the spoiler alert

308
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:19,020
was around the incident management plans
I think that this is going to be

309
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:23,050
something that it's becoming more and
more pervasive as the shift from

310
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:28,970
prevention to detection and response
becomes greater and greater is how do

311
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:35,150
you actually respond in a crisis and I
think a very good example of that is

312
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:40,760
target and ask them to think about the
target breeze and the anthem breached

313
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:45,900
its about the same size of amount of
records that were sold in Target there

314
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:52,530
were credit card numbers and credit no
credit card information on the other

315
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:59,059
hand in the anthem you had a whole
identity your social security number

316
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:06,110
independence that you have it's very the
equivalent of your tax return they have

317
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:10,320
everything they need to know to
continuously recreate your identity over

318
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:17,750
and over and target it yeah ok I had to
have a lot of credit cards are issued

319
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:23,670
to people who were affected and that has
some type of cost to it on the other

320
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:29,470
hand i have somebody who can perpetually
take my and then be four years to come

321
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:37,130
and and you know do damage to me
personally but everybody talks about

322
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:38,420
target

323
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:41,770
everybody talks about target you can go
to a conference on security without

324
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:46,970
somebody mentioning about target but
very very few people actually talk about

325
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:52,530
their Greek and when the things that
you'll know if you go back and look at

326
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:58,610
how anthem actually did there is no
response they got out what they they

327
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:04,149
were apologetic they got in front of the
communications they they their media

328
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:11,550
relations they use social media to to
keep people in more and they very much

329
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:18,020
control the message so when people look
at them they don't feel the same light

330
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:21,990
as target if you look at the target they
have missed them for me seeing it was

331
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:26,270
very disorganized you could tell that
you didn't get it really good level of

332
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:35,360
comfort that they had the situation
under control but again and then breach

333
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:40,080
the information they lost much much
worse than what they lost the target by

334
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:47,610
target negatively impact in the news
that goes back to crisis communication

335
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:53,340
and being able to have the business know
what they need to do in order to manage

336
00:33:53,340 --> 00:34:01,350
an answer on the outward facing outward
face and this is not lost on love that

337
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:05,679
regulators which is why they're starting
to spend more time on understanding how

338
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:14,960
the business will respond in the event
of an it's so communicating

339
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:20,110
cybersecurity risks associated impacts
through a common vernacular at the

340
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:23,960
individuals who are trying to influence
will increase your success in gaining

341
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:28,909
support that thing is that as a as an
executive

342
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:35,940
we have two days people are coming in to
see these are our priority this is what

343
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:39,289
we need to advance our priorities for
our business

344
00:34:40,309 --> 00:34:47,589
sitting there and I can only imagine I
i'm only a piece of that but everybody

345
00:34:47,589 --> 00:34:51,239
is going in time the same thing about
how they need time they need resources

346
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:54,839
they need money they need something in
order to be able to accomplish their

347
00:34:54,839 --> 00:35:02,308
goal so and at the same time you'll hear
your views and you're bored saying that

348
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:08,309
cybersecurity is their number one risk
relative to their operations and that's

349
00:35:08,309 --> 00:35:16,539
true too but I don't understand how the
dollar that I'm going to give you are

350
00:35:16,539 --> 00:35:19,960
the individual that I'm going to give
you or the time that I'm going to give

351
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:26,940
you to get something done is going to
manage that risk in a way that is

352
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:32,470
improving it better than this business
or revenue generating project or

353
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:36,479
managing the strategic risk that I may
have here are filling out my portfolio

354
00:35:36,479 --> 00:35:44,328
of products that I'm able to offer to a
client or customer if I don't understand

355
00:35:44,329 --> 00:35:50,339
how you know that impacted gonna be
greater than the revenue I'm going to

356
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:57,769
generate on this side then of course I'm
going to spend my money where I think

357
00:35:57,769 --> 00:36:01,508
I'm going to get the biggest bang for my
buck because as a fiduciary or for that

358
00:36:01,509 --> 00:36:06,589
company I'm here to the board member I
i'm looking out for the interests of the

359
00:36:06,589 --> 00:36:13,009
shareholder so I want to make sure that
I greet shareholder value and if I get

360
00:36:13,009 --> 00:36:17,969
greater shareholder value for getting
this business revenue generating project

361
00:36:17,969 --> 00:36:18,700
going

362
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:22,109
are filling out my product and that's
what we're going to do and I'm not doing

363
00:36:22,109 --> 00:36:28,569
that to be mean or vindictive is that I
don't understand the impact that not

364
00:36:28,569 --> 00:36:32,229
doing this cyber program our cyber think
it's going to rain

365
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:43,850
so some important points I think it just
touched on this morning that you're

366
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:48,690
competing for a limited pool of
resources they can't do everything as a

367
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:53,510
as an executive on the executive
management committee or the board

368
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:57,910
directors they realize they can't do
everything everything that needs to get

369
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:01,810
done everything that's a risk everything
that's a product they can't do that's

370
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:06,450
why they have no business acceptance
committees you know they make decisions

371
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:13,140
on what they are going to do so you're
competing for their limited resources in

372
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:17,460
order to get your program so you want to
be able to put together and put forth an

373
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:22,890
argument and get those people in the
room nodding say that this is a very

374
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:31,600
important prior to you actually going
and sitting in a tree you can't fix

375
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:37,339
everything and you know i i know you
know we have a tendency of looking at

376
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:41,180
things that's a risk this is a risk we
need to fix that we need to fix this

377
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:46,549
when you to fix that but you but you end
up happy what ends up happening is you

378
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:53,380
get that I called exhausted mediocrity
where you are working on a whole bunch

379
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:58,230
of different things but you're not doing
anything well so as the sea so are the

380
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:03,010
chief risk officer is your job to level
set the expectation and ensure that

381
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:11,860
you're focusing on those risks that are
are keep your TV organization technology

382
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:17,300
controls without the associated business
processes again if those controls are

383
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:23,250
embedded into your business processes
then they're not going to be effective

384
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:27,100
and you still had that risk so you need
to be clear on the businesses

385
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,319
requirements for managing that route

386
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:38,050
you need to understand where your
program is relative to your peer group

387
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:46,090
if if if you're behind your peer group I
can tell you at the board level as they

388
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,390
could have committee level

389
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:51,519
that's not a position that they want to
be so the clearing you are aware your

390
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:56,279
peers are it will help you get that
executive support that you need because

391
00:38:56,279 --> 00:39:04,059
they're looking at it again from their
fiduciary responsibility and then I i

392
00:39:04,059 --> 00:39:07,880
believe they'll be making this
presentation available but at this time

393
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:55,539
that there any questions I am relative
to our peer groups I said that you know

394
00:39:55,539 --> 00:40:04,519
for the areas that we're so anyways
attack you know we're doing no XYZ we

395
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:08,919
have a slight the controls the same
controls that we the rest of our peers

396
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:15,319
have in order to manage or detect these
types of breaches we are looking to do

397
00:40:15,319 --> 00:40:22,200
more things in this area to see if we
can have a greater visibility to win

398
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:26,759
things occur but you know right now we
are in line with our peer group and

399
00:40:26,759 --> 00:40:34,029
we're looking to do more and that was my
just off the cuff response to him but i

400
00:40:34,029 --> 00:40:37,240
i guess i went back to what our peer
groups are doing because ultimately

401
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:42,950
that's what I think he's on the board as
well as on the executive committee so he

402
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:46,848
wants to know that he's not in breach of
fiduciary responsibilities

403
00:40:46,849 --> 00:40:50,640
he's also concerned about of course
making sure that the company's

404
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,450
protective but again there is some type
of

405
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:57,379
you know you know self-protection there
it might do it we're not supposed to be

406
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:11,660
the only question I could see that I'm
holding up everybody outside so I want

407
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:12,660
to thank everyone again
