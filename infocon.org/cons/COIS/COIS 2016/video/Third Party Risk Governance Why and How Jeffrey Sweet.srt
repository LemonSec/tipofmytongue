1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:11,040
good afternoon my name is Jeffrey sweet
I work at American Electric Power and

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,440
I'm gonna talk today about third-party
risk governance some of you may have

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,289
been a presentation I did a couple of
years ago I will tell you this is not

4
00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:22,669
the same presentation it has been
matured greatly over the past couple of

5
00:00:22,669 --> 00:00:27,630
years and I hope to help many people who
are struggling with dealing with

6
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,769
third-party vendors for party
relationships and help you find a way to

7
00:00:32,769 --> 00:00:36,010
make your environment more secure by
having it secure relationship with your

8
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:45,780
third-party relationships your third
party vendors so let me see it at hand

9
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:51,129
how many of you think that commercial
off-the-shelf software provides a risk

10
00:00:51,129 --> 00:00:57,670
to your company and how many of you
assess that commercial off-the-shelf

11
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:04,090
software by D compiling it in tearing
into the code and looking at it you know

12
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:11,520
kind of illegal so how do you deal with
that and about the commercially produced

13
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,340
hardware products you buy servers you
buy appliances you buy all kinds of

14
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:20,730
equipment but how many of you actually
assess those and look at them deeply and

15
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:23,100
look at the software that's running on
those to make sure they're not bringing

16
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:30,890
rescue organization not easy course what
about the security culture the company

17
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:35,610
you're dealing with you know what they
do how they do it to make sure that

18
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,380
they're providing a secure product you
know anything about them

19
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,949
typically we signed a contract with
somebody we bring our product and we

20
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:47,450
install it we go to work that's as far
as we go there's a great deal of

21
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:51,650
security risk out there that we're not
even looking at and then well what about

22
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:55,840
the fourth party relationships was a
fourth party relationship you've got a

23
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,010
third party vendor that has a third
party vendor that has a third party

24
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,840
vendor that has a third party vendor

25
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,899
how deeply are you looking at those and
making sure that those are bringing

26
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:10,399
riskier company where they located what
are they doing what kind of security

27
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:17,069
practices do they have in place so the
first

28
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:21,810
thing when when we're when we're doing
an assessment of a company we want to

29
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:27,109
look at the culture of security within
that organization what I mean by that

30
00:02:27,109 --> 00:02:34,060
securities not a point in time point and
click get it done

31
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:38,939
type thing it's something that has to be
in bread into the organization that has

32
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:43,790
to be a part of their day-to-day lives
because if it's not there not been a

33
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:48,260
practicing consistently and they're not
going to provide the type of product

34
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:53,388
that you need you gotta look at the
culture security and I just put a couple

35
00:02:53,389 --> 00:02:56,750
of definitions up here cultures of
quality in a person or society that

36
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:01,019
arises for a concern for what is
regarded as excellent in the arts

37
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:06,469
literature and so on and so forth so
it's not just it's not just to sing or

38
00:03:06,469 --> 00:03:12,439
act as a way of life and culture
security drives the practices of our

39
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:17,599
organization it's deeper than antivirus
and I D S IPS we all talk about those

40
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,448
tools are what time we talked about the
tools not being good enough anymore

41
00:03:20,449 --> 00:03:24,069
right for what about the organizations
that you're doing business where are

42
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:30,879
they doing the right things today have
something more than just tools products

43
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:31,340
service

44
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:35,790
every product or service that you bring
into your company introduces risk to

45
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:40,030
your company to some degree some of the
more than others

46
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:47,209
network interfaces do you know what
ports and services they're running what

47
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:50,879
network interfaces they have how they
how they communicate outside your

48
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,518
environment using secure coding
practices when the developing the code

49
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,519
that runs all the products you're
putting in your environment

50
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,959
vendor systems themselves when they come
in and plug into your environment to

51
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:08,390
help you install it had those been
secured property they have hips they

52
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:14,078
have any virus they have the right
products in place and even the personnel

53
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:18,269
sometimes we don't even have let them
plugin we just have people come in and

54
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:22,430
they work on our systems but they're
using our systems are they

55
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:27,410
rocking the desktop when they walk away
are they trying to access data that they

56
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:31,330
shouldn't be accessing in your
environment using your systems so what

57
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:34,820
are their practices what is the
knowledge they have and what the risk is

58
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,659
in your organization that they might
introduced by interacting with your

59
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:41,729
systems and then again for 30
participation in any contract that you

60
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:49,180
have with a vendor will talk a lot more
deeply about that dream once those 4:30

61
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,820
relationships where are they how many of
you have a policy that you don't allow

62
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:59,020
your data to leave the continental
United States for you control that data

63
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:03,539
very significantly when it does leave
the continental United States so you

64
00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:06,840
might have that relationship with third
party and tell them that what are they

65
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,138
doing their cloud hosting service they
may be transported your date outside the

66
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:15,110
continental United States for backup
purposes have you assessed at if you

67
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:18,110
look at that you know what they're doing
that or not

68
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:23,030
that fourth party have the same culture
security that the third party has that

69
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:27,719
you're trying to assess and then do the
third party providers have a contractor

70
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,000
and understanding with their providers
that arise what you're trying to

71
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,410
accomplish and security contract
language or put in place in your in your

72
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:44,150
environment or in your relationships so
every like I said every relationship you

73
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:49,840
have with someone outside your
organization brings risk so how do you

74
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,250
go about trying to evaluate their risk
and determine and tried to reduce the

75
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:59,700
risk your organization or at least let
somebody know that the risk exists and

76
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,599
make let them make the decision whether
they want to accept it or not so you

77
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,050
gotta you gotta done a fire framework
methodology and we were just in a

78
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:11,900
session just a few moments ago with with
Helen pattern in here and one of the key

79
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:17,049
themes that kept coming up is there's
nothing common everybody does something

80
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,600
do everything differently

81
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,340
there's no standard and there's right
now that's right there is no standard

82
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:28,679
today that everybody subscribes to do
this there are some standards out there

83
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,620
that you can subscribe to

84
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,310
but unfortunately as I as I've gone
through and top two different companies

85
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,910
even those standards are being used
people are writing their own

86
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:41,830
questionnaires and doing their own thing
and they're not really looking at the

87
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:45,469
standards that are out there and I'll
talk about a couple things that we've

88
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:48,550
looked at some of the things that we're
doing as I go through the presentation

89
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,569
today

90
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:55,659
you have to determine whether it's even
worse the time to do the assessment what

91
00:06:55,659 --> 00:06:59,669
is the relationship that they're
providing you and do you even need to

92
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:05,258
know or even need to worry about how
much risk of breaking word electric

93
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:10,349
utility if I guess somebody mowing the
grass outside of my substation how much

94
00:07:10,349 --> 00:07:15,360
risk they gonna bring to me if they're
going to grass outside your building

95
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,770
they're not coming inside they're not
touching your I T environment how much

96
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:25,589
risk exposing you to very little you
probably don't need to assess them but I

97
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:30,339
got somebody comes into my substation
and started doing work inside now good

98
00:07:30,339 --> 00:07:34,709
risk rises just like if you have
somebody walk into your building a new

99
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:38,180
business inside your facilities your
risk writers you have to determine

100
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:42,019
whether that risk level is sufficient
actually even have to do an assessment

101
00:07:42,019 --> 00:07:48,709
then you have to write that risk and
determine what an acceptable level of

102
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:55,580
risk for your organization is and that
can also tell you the frequency and the

103
00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:00,498
depth at which you're going to assess
these vendors you might say if it's a

104
00:08:00,499 --> 00:08:03,490
low-risk offender all we're gonna do is
we're trying to get a contract

105
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:07,659
supplement in place we're not gonna do
anything further than that but if there

106
00:08:07,659 --> 00:08:10,569
are critical vendor we're gonna go in
and we're gonna do a full in-depth

107
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:15,759
assessment we're gonna do on-site
evaluations on its whatever you want to

108
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,099
call them we're gonna make them sign a
contract supplement working to restrict

109
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:24,628
how they access to our environment what
they do stuff of that nature he had to

110
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:29,569
determine how deep how frequently you
want to do these things and then you

111
00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:36,909
wanna put contract agreements in place
and there was a comment by a guess as a

112
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:41,208
provider vendor in here or in the
previous session so well we've had

113
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:46,399
contracts where they tried to make us
subscribe to their security policies

114
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,079
that's not the kind of contract
supplement you want to talk about that

115
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:56,060
little bit more as well so there's a lot
of different frameworks course you got

116
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:01,380
NIST SP 18 800 161 which supply chain
management designed for the federal

117
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:07,089
government it will not fit everybody's
knees but you can adapt it is a national

118
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:11,730
strategy for global supply chain scary
there's the Cloud Security Alliance

119
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:15,100
their shared assessments standard
information gathering and agreed upon

120
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:20,040
procedures there's a bunch of different
ones that you can use you can use a

121
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:25,160
combination of those that's all you have
asked loud relationships may be the

122
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:30,709
Cloud Security Alliance is all you need
but if you're doing hardware and

123
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:33,920
software you might want to look at the
shared assessments for the next eight

124
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:42,349
hundred 161 so talk about the German a
questionnaire termination question

125
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:45,150
you're not all relationships were
intense scrutiny you must determine

126
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:50,400
which doing what's known as short
questionnaire typically five to 10

127
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:56,150
questions is all you need to determine
the level of scrutiny so I guess that

128
00:09:56,150 --> 00:10:01,050
high-level risk or were you might have
something like groundskeepers cleaning

129
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:06,180
teams different things you have to look
at him differently and figure out what

130
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:10,949
the risk level is some of the questions
that we use for that I used to determine

131
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:18,350
this doesn't vendor store process
transmitter access systems for data says

132
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:21,350
offender have logical or physical access
to your facilities

133
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:30,020
canada entered directly or indirectly
impact your business availability let me

134
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:34,410
stop on that when resetting how many of
you have a cleaning team that goes in

135
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:40,319
your data center cleans your datacenter
force and how many of you haven't hit

136
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,030
that little red button right outside the
doors overhead now thinking that was the

137
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:48,610
door recent was actually the emergency
power shut off probably most your data

138
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:52,250
centers now been adapted because that's
happened way too many times those little

139
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:56,050
red buttons but it used to be that the
cleaning crew would hit that little red

140
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,939
button under way up endorsing in there
are releasing the security lock on the

141
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:03,230
door and it was actually the emergency
power shut off the data center but even

142
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:08,960
worse maybe they come in here and I got
a bucket full of water and tomorrow they

143
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,440
splashed water on short-circuit
something in the dataset is that a risk

144
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,600
to your organization maybe you need to
assess them and maybe you need to put

145
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,980
special restrictions on how and what
they do with in your facility does the

146
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:28,500
engagement create modify or purchase
software hardware probably about 80% of

147
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,420
your relationships do

148
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:36,519
and then the last criteria that we look
at is are any of the above criteria met

149
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:42,339
before during or after before during or
after implementation of the products or

150
00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:46,889
services don't look at just what they're
gonna do before don't just look what

151
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:49,630
they're going to do while they're
implementing it but look at this

152
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:53,810
relationship going to continue on after
work and does that increase your risk

153
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:57,680
level because it does go beyond the
scope the original implementation

154
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:06,800
because the longer the relationship the
higher the risk low then we have the

155
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,479
risk

156
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,519
here and I'm not gonna read all these
slides to you because there's there's 25

157
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,260
different questions that we go through
for the risk questionnaire but some of

158
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,240
the key things that you want to look at
when you go through a risk questionnaire

159
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,720
and you cannot have these slides 30
gonna be publicly posted so you can have

160
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,769
a slight but some of the things that you
want to look into your a trick question

161
00:12:25,769 --> 00:12:30,290
here is what is the sensitivity of the
information that they're gonna have

162
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:34,920
access to and don't just look at what's
on that specific system that they're

163
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,910
working on but look at where that system
might allow them to reach within your

164
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:43,079
organization within your in with you in
your data center that they could

165
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:49,339
potentially access from that system how
frequently are they going to do the

166
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:54,050
service for you said once a year as it
once every five years as daily is it

167
00:12:54,050 --> 00:13:00,920
weekly is at Markley are gonna be
sharing data with anybody I'm gonna be

168
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:08,370
taking data off your site into a cloud
service like AWS our Google or or or one

169
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:12,319
of the other cloud providers or any data
center might not even be a cloud

170
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:15,319
provider they might be just posting your
data for you

171
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:25,660
does the engagement include offshore
services some companies it doesn't

172
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:29,969
matter what your data does offshore but
how many have you ever heard of the

173
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:37,360
Export Administration regulation to
federal regulation that says that there

174
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,900
are certain data that cannot be
transported to certain countries outside

175
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:50,900
the united states and its pretty broad
and probably many companies are

176
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:55,760
violating it on a day-to-day basis
because most companies are not even

177
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:03,380
aware of these deregulation exists I
don't see any chance but how many of you

178
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:11,240
use a cryptographic communications
device secure communications SSH or ask

179
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,630
your phone and send those outside the
continental United States you realize

180
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:20,210
that that is restricted under the Export
Administration regulation

181
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:26,290
and that wow you can transport outside
the united states that has to be

182
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:29,110
licensed licensed by the federal
government

183
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:32,570
there's actually a theater process you
have to go through to export that

184
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:38,120
outside the country how many of you
travel outside the continental United

185
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:44,460
States and take an encrypted laptop with
you in some countries that's illegal and

186
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:50,790
can cause your laptop to be ceased and
Lee the process to get it back in some

187
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:54,310
countries it's not worth the effort so
many times it just ends up being

188
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:59,689
abandoned in that country and god knows
what they're doing to it after they've

189
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:04,390
got all of that because we know that
there is no encryption that is

190
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:09,689
unbreakable none it takes time but it's
all breakable

191
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:23,450
inbound outbound connectivity remote
access does the vendor have unrestricted

192
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:29,090
remote access to your environment where
somebody watching what they do or is

193
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:33,550
there a restriction to what they can get
to buy by specific IP address or port

194
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:38,170
and that's the only place they can go so
the things you gotta think of is your

195
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:41,930
risk ranking how many fourth party
vendors are going to be involved is it

196
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:51,640
just one is that multiple disaster
recovery we probably most of us have a

197
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:55,380
disaster recovery program within our
organizations but how many of us look at

198
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:59,290
the disaster recovery programs of our
third-party providers to ensure that

199
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:04,150
they are going to meet our needs when
when they go now especially in a closer

200
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:11,800
relationship did they do it

201
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:19,800
analysis see it as street vendors are
somebody's gonna do business with

202
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:26,439
repeatedly if it is then maybe you do a
high-level a deep dive assessment on

203
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,150
them making sure that they have all the
evaluation completed and then you only

204
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:34,579
do that assessment one time every three
or four years as opposed to repeating it

205
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:38,820
on an annual basis where you have just a
short-term or maybe a two-year through

206
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:45,890
three year relationship and you want to
look at it repeatedly and then what's

207
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:50,260
the how long does utilization what
what's the time period you're actually

208
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:55,880
we use this third party to provide the
services that you're looking to receive

209
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:00,600
because again the longer the
relationship more risk it introduces

210
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:06,680
environment the potential risk she got
three

211
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,360
thank you determine whether the
assessments needed the level of scrutiny

212
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:16,729
what you need to do an honest and the
frequency interview I mention that

213
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:21,000
critical if you have a critical risk
thank you might want to consider doing

214
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,800
an annual assessment and an on-site
assessment of that meander was mentioned

215
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,970
earlier in the previous presentation I
keep referencing back to that because

216
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:32,650
she said wait so nicely into what i was
gonna presented a but she talked about

217
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:41,070
the sSAE 16 and a sock Tues don't trust
a sock to explicitly to determine

218
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:46,070
whether a company has enough security
first of all it's a point in time

219
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:52,409
second of all is only a representative
set of systems and three half the time

220
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:55,760
the auditors that do those don't
understand cybersecurity to begin with

221
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:02,360
there are some there are some that are
very good but the vast majority of them

222
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,689
don't fully understand cybersecurity
especially in your environment because

223
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:09,590
this may be the very first time they
were touched your environment

224
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:14,800
late understand how you practice and so
they're going to collect evidence and oh

225
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,919
by the way every individual interprets
the evidence differently as well how

226
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,060
many of you had two artists by two
different orders come back with

227
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:25,659
different results will be almost every
one of you could raise your hand to say

228
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:32,910
that right how many of you have federal
requirements such as Singapore hip our

229
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:40,090
PCI and PCI quite a few retail people
are here had to PCI assessment come back

230
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:44,899
same environment same exact set of
systems but the interpretation was

231
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,900
different I wanted you met clients or
not

232
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:56,640
just depend on an essay 16 you know and
ISO certification ISO 27001

233
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,840
certification is great glad they got it
but that doesn't mean that they're

234
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,010
consistently practicing that way
throughout that time period between the

235
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:08,720
evaluation periods

236
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,929
making sure all kinds of evidence
they're doing it a point in time but

237
00:19:11,929 --> 00:19:16,770
doesn't mean there continuously doing it
and even when you do your own it doesn't

238
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:20,460
necessarily mean they're gonna keep
practicing it every day but at least you

239
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,890
got a good sense was that they are not
because when you go in when you're

240
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:31,740
talking to the people ask questions find
out how easily they agree to certain

241
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:36,909
things go sometimes easily agreed to
something means that they're not doing

242
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:44,750
it they're just agreeing to get you out
the door and then you risk

243
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:48,320
was once you've done that you risk
ranking you going to the in-depth risk

244
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,830
assessments not talk about some of the
assessments that we use in a few moments

245
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:58,919
but use the framework you choose Create
a scoring model maintain maintain a

246
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:05,230
record of the results don't dispose of
the results as soon as you get done

247
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:09,330
during the assessment to maintain them
so that when you do the assessment the

248
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:12,780
next year you can compare them to the
previous year's assessment or the

249
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:17,190
previous two years whatever it is you're
doing better or worse

250
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:22,570
if they change their practices in
accordance with what you've asked them

251
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:28,000
to do or if they just kept doing the
same thing and not made any changes in

252
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,200
their environment because maybe they
just said well we're gonna do this one

253
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,690
time they're never gonna come back
doctors against when I gotta change

254
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:39,360
anything you come back into another
recession to find out that's exactly

255
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:45,939
what they did absolutely nothing to
reduce the risk your company and its

256
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:50,630
follow-up on the findings we have a
process where we document everything

257
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:55,990
that didn't meet our expectations and we
actually put that back to the business

258
00:20:55,990 --> 00:21:00,990
that's making the engagement with a
vendor to follow up on those findings to

259
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:04,130
make sure that they're doing the things
that we've asked him to do where there

260
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:08,720
are gaps things like having
vulnerability assessments conducted of

261
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,140
error of their application code and the
reporting the assessment results back to

262
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:17,530
you might be something you put in your
your contract so they say well we can't

263
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:20,050
do that right now we'll do that next
quarter

264
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:26,809
follow up on that develop a remediation
plan if you need to always provide a

265
00:21:26,809 --> 00:21:34,270
path for don't don't want something you
tell them you absolutely have to do this

266
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:39,210
without a Paris forward sometimes you
can be a little flexible work with your

267
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:44,220
business find out what the business is
willing to accept and then give up power

268
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:49,520
forward for the vendor especially for
the smaller vendors that have very small

269
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,100
shops don't have a lot of money to focus
on cybersecurity help them develop a

270
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:58,750
security program we spent a lot of time
talking to smaller vendors and helping

271
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:02,660
them develop their programs giving the
guides we don't tell them how to do it

272
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:06,020
we provide them guidance and what they
might want to consider in developing a

273
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:10,010
program that could be beneficial to you
and to their other customers in the long

274
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:10,770
run

275
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:15,900
the types

276
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:20,630
investments in some cases may be a
contract supplement is all you need

277
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:25,250
other cases you might want to do a light
assessment we use the standard

278
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:29,570
information gathering questionnaire for
the sig develop my shirt assessments

279
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:33,560
which actually came out of the financial
industry kalb it's something we heard

280
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:39,870
bits shared assessments as the ride from
bits and created a standardized

281
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:43,889
information gathering questionnaire now
what's next numbers gonna scare the crap

282
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:51,570
out of you guaranteed there's 2650
questions in the full assessment but it

283
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:56,879
is an adaptive assessment what happens
is that they answered yes to some

284
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,360
questions and expand and ask some
additional questions if they say no

285
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:04,680
collapse were even if they say yes it
might collapse the assessment as well

286
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:10,300
just depending on what the question is
typically a vendor does not have to

287
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:16,230
answer all 2650 questions on the floor
assessment the light assessments about a

288
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:21,300
hundred and twenty five questions it is
not adaptive 825 question but it gives

289
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:26,290
you a basic idea of the controls that
are a vendor says that they have in

290
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:32,360
place and that's what it is it's a
controlled assessment the only way to

291
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,360
validate what they're saying

292
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:39,149
they're doing what they're saying
they're doing is to do an on-site

293
00:23:39,149 --> 00:23:43,820
assessment which is the deepest level
assessment because of course that

294
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:48,678
requires commitment here time and money
to go to the vendor site and evaluate

295
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:51,250
that they have a security policy

296
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:55,889
make them show it i didnt assessment a
number of years ago I walked into a

297
00:23:55,889 --> 00:24:00,508
company and I asked him to see their
acceptable use policy and their

298
00:24:00,509 --> 00:24:03,250
information security policy

299
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:05,720
you guys what I don't have it right here
he says I'll send it to you the next

300
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,279
couple days I said that's fine I'm gonna
be about a week in this all put together

301
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:16,549
anyway and the next day I get an
information security policy and

302
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:24,629
acceptable use policy and I mean the
investigator that I am I'd looked at the

303
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:29,049
properties of the documents and both are
created the day prior to be receiving

304
00:24:29,049 --> 00:24:38,690
them so I took an extract out of the
document I popped it into a plagiarism

305
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:44,960
website and I'll be darned it was the
exact copy the policy was an exact copy

306
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:50,649
of a major university on the east coast
in fact in some places they did even

307
00:24:50,649 --> 00:24:55,959
change the name of the organization in
the policy before they sent it to me in

308
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:04,519
the Acceptable Use Policy was a direct
copy from Wikipedia work

309
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:14,100
getting someone else US policy to help
guide you in creating a policy is great

310
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:18,500
copying someone else's policy and
putting it as your own just doesn't work

311
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:25,020
because that university is not same as
the struggling company it's just not the

312
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:31,690
same so when you do an on-site
assessment to validate the information

313
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:35,140
given you the evidence representing make
sure that they didn't just copy and

314
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:45,320
paste something from that from the
internet so typically we use the signal

315
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:51,159
light by what we do is when we send out
an RFP to a vendor would typically send

316
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,720
the signal a questionnaire out to get a
general assessment of their security

317
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:01,410
controls for more asking for vendors to
submit bids back for product and then

318
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:06,809
once we get that we evaluate that we
evaluate the risk of the product and

319
00:26:06,809 --> 00:26:10,678
everything that we determine whether we
need to do a further assessment and we

320
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:16,860
also always and every art piece on a
copy of our security contracts are

321
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:24,159
security contracts supplement is 18
pages of negotiable document it does not

322
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:30,650
state that you will use our policy does
not state that you will use this

323
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:36,240
particular IPS for this particular ideas
for this particular firewall against

324
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,700
guides and says you must have a policy

325
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:44,480
you must evaluate your products and
assessment for vulnerability you must

326
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:50,280
use secure coding practices such as a
wasp where science and sore or whatever

327
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,570
the case might be

328
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:56,700
we give recommendations we give guidance
but we don't prescribe exactly what they

329
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,890
do in in the vast majority of the
document there are some restrictions

330
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:05,800
that we put very prescriptive language
in such as our information cannot leave

331
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:14,500
the continental United States for you
must have a strong password policy that

332
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:19,990
includes a minimum of this many
characters to level of complexity for

333
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:24,920
your remote administrative access you
must have a multi-factor authentication

334
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:29,540
methodology but even that we don't
prescribe what multi-factor

335
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:32,620
authentication methodology we just say
you must have a multi-factor

336
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:39,870
authentication and we used for on-site
assessments we use what's called the

337
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:44,100
standard mission gathering for shared
assessments agreed-upon procedures it's

338
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:48,090
actually a checklist of items that you
should look for when you do an on-site

339
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:53,419
assessment it's very very good program

340
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,700
yes it does cost some money it's not
expensive also say that it's probably

341
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,110
gonna be less than $10,000

342
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:06,389
to get the questionnaires and the
agreed-upon procedures and they come out

343
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:11,429
annually they update them we derive our
security contracts supplements from the

344
00:28:11,429 --> 00:28:17,140
agreed-upon procedures checklist and we
just put language in there and according

345
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:21,420
to what's an agreed-upon procedures and
then there are some areas for example

346
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:27,980
the right to audit but we do put a right
to audit clause in our security so we do

347
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:33,090
have some special because we're a power
utility we have no except requirements

348
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:35,939
the sense that we have to have a certain
level of background investigation of

349
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:39,710
people have access to certain assets
within our environment so we put that I

350
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:43,390
would you never specifically above and
beyond what side of the agreed-upon

351
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:47,940
procedures so it's a depth of you can
change it to your environment to your

352
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:52,299
particular needs there is no framework
anywhere on the face of this earth

353
00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:58,240
that's going to be 100% good for your
environment you're going to have to make

354
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,280
adaptations you may have to take
multiple frameworks and Adam together to

355
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:11,440
make them work for you every industry is
different every industry is different I

356
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:17,290
couldn't use my supplement for somebody
in the education industry because it

357
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:22,399
wouldn't be the same requirements but we
could adapt and use it to make it

358
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:29,370
modifies the one thing also with the
contracts supplement use we always

359
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:37,590
negotiate the document we give them the
vendor the opportunity to market up and

360
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:41,559
make recommendations because while we
might have certain language in there

361
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:45,790
that might give some guidance in a
certain area they may have better

362
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:50,520
practices the what we're recommending
and we will allow them to be accountable

363
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,520
for maintaining our practices

364
00:29:55,779 --> 00:29:59,929
so the areas that we have in this the
single light a cig fall and also the

365
00:29:59,929 --> 00:30:04,599
same categories for our supplement our
risk management security policy

366
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:09,408
organizational security asset management
human resource security physical

367
00:30:09,409 --> 00:30:14,440
environmental security communications
operations management access control

368
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:19,239
information systems acquisition
development and that's very important

369
00:30:19,239 --> 00:30:22,239
how they maintain their systems within
their environment

370
00:30:23,969 --> 00:30:29,489
do they have an asset inventory today
maintain access controls do they

371
00:30:29,489 --> 00:30:35,559
maintain antivirus host Intrusion
Prevention all that with their own

372
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:38,609
systems within their environment I don't
know how many times I gotta understand

373
00:30:38,609 --> 00:30:45,019
what you're telling me how to run my
environment yes I am because everything

374
00:30:45,019 --> 00:30:48,999
you do in your environment impacts my
environment but we're just selling your

375
00:30:48,999 --> 00:30:53,609
software yes you are and your software
is going to be installed in my

376
00:30:53,609 --> 00:30:59,359
environment and everyone ability every
risk that is part of that application is

377
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:02,359
at risk to me

378
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:09,120
incident Vantage communications
management what if they have a breaching

379
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,979
their environment how soon do you want
to know about it depends on what to

380
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:17,380
providing this is

381
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:22,900
time to disaster recovery compliance
mobile how they manage former

382
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:29,080
environment privacy software security
cloud security and then you can always

383
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,340
add Section there's a section and
actually in the same question here for

384
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,870
additional questions that you put in for
your cell

385
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:39,429
that might be something that wasn't
covered in any other sections that you

386
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:42,850
want to know about the vendor could be
financial information could be any

387
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:46,020
number of things that you might want to
know about the vendor and might be for a

388
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:54,470
specific engagement but rational human
being in every contract to some degree

389
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:58,400
there should be some security mine which
every contract you sign even if it's a

390
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:04,670
non-disclosure agreement NDA privacy
agreement for daily use agreement where

391
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:10,480
data destruction agreement there should
be some contract language that's

392
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,080
applicable to the engagement that you
have in nearly every contract again if

393
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,649
somebody's morning grass outside your
facility obviously you're not going to

394
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:25,940
necessarily need a contract offers deep
security contract supplements should be

395
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:34,010
negotiable don't try to 100% dictate to
a vendor led to do their business

396
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:37,010
because you're never gonna be successful
ever

397
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:45,408
hard to be soft and give them guidance
and guidelines and suggestions and make

398
00:32:45,409 --> 00:32:49,789
them accountable for things let alone
try to prescribing be very explicit how

399
00:32:49,789 --> 00:32:55,110
they should do their business should be
general enough to allow flexibility

400
00:32:55,110 --> 00:33:01,080
specific enough to ensure security and
then of course always ensure

401
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:08,090
accountability and the way we do that he
is that we use shall statements and not

402
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:12,110
should statements should

403
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:17,760
allows them away out some areas you may
need to use a short statement but

404
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:25,049
generally if you want to be accountable
for it it's either shower or will that's

405
00:33:25,049 --> 00:33:25,879
the only way you can make

406
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:31,250
accountable when I'm ready

407
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:38,680
yet but the other thing that that we
have as we have developed our program we

408
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:44,730
put a contract supplement and we use it
as a supplement to the contract we also

409
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:49,000
wrote it a point in time where it could
be a stand-alone document so that

410
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,000
require signatures from both parties
what we're doing today is because we're

411
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,410
adding it as a supplement to the master
agreements within our organization

412
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:02,750
there's an app rural section and it's
for cybersecurity to prove it and

413
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:06,560
basically what happens as it comes to my
desk after my people have looked at it

414
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,850
yet we're good with this and I'll sign
it and send it back up to procurement to

415
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:15,719
be added to the general contract you can
change that however you feel necessary

416
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:18,770
if you want to make it a stand-alone
document you want to add it into your

417
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:22,050
master services agreement we're actually
getting ready to take portions of our

418
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:26,110
security document because it applies in
every circumstance and put it in the

419
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:30,490
general services agreements and we'll
take it out of the security supplements

420
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:35,509
it'll be in every contract signed by
every person that provide services to us

421
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:44,220
one of the cab if you start a program
like this do not take on the world and

422
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:50,889
once we started this program we started
looking at our relationships and

423
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:58,250
realized that we have total count over
16,000 benders and 64,000 contracts

424
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:02,960
you will be amazed when you start
talking your procurement divisions and

425
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:08,310
how many contracts and vendors you have
in your environment especially for a

426
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:13,130
large corporation so

427
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:18,440
so what we have done initially as we
look at the new contracts and the

428
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:23,410
renewal that were in the process of
performing as well as starting to risk

429
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:27,328
rank all the rest of the contracts to
determine what our risk level is and it

430
00:35:27,329 --> 00:35:31,349
will go back to the Chronicles and start
working our way down and going back on

431
00:35:31,349 --> 00:35:37,769
the others don't try to boil the ocean
was it won't work was not flushing bring

432
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:40,868
the Sun to the earth you're never gonna
worry ocean and then there's the

433
00:35:40,869 --> 00:35:46,769
consequences of that site so I won't
open it up for questions I think I've

434
00:35:46,769 --> 00:36:04,839
got about 10 minutes or ten minutes so
many questions yes sir so that

435
00:36:04,839 --> 00:36:08,119
determination questionnaire is done by
our business and the risk rankings

436
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:13,119
dunbar business and that we do the
actual the risk assessment so the

437
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,920
business actually helps us with the
determination questionnaire in the risk

438
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:33,359
rank so good question what we do is we
always let the business know that they

439
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:38,029
can contact our team we have a team to
specifically set up for third-party risk

440
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:41,640
governance then contact any member of
the team to ask any questions we had

441
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:46,058
additionally we've also trained our
procurement division and I did fail to

442
00:36:46,059 --> 00:36:49,380
mention that we have a very tight
relationship with our division and we

443
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:53,559
train them and let them help help them
understand what those questions mean and

444
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:57,029
how they should be answered and so they
can help give guidance as well so it

445
00:36:57,029 --> 00:37:02,999
doesn't for 100% back on us every time
but many times through after one or two

446
00:37:02,999 --> 00:37:05,819
times doing it they understand that
they're able to answer without our

447
00:37:05,819 --> 00:37:08,819
yessir

448
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:30,660
they have 100% on that is evidence that
their client we still do testing when we

449
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:34,790
can and ask them for evidence of testing
as well so while they may have a

450
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:38,290
certificate of compliance we want to see
the evidence of the testing performed as

451
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:42,690
well as see what the because no one not
necessarily looking to see that the test

452
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:46,020
was valid but also looking to see what
they tested and make sure they covered

453
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:50,300
all the areas that we would consider
security risk to us especially in for

454
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:54,420
example and operational technology very
new space a lot of assessment hasn't

455
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:58,050
been done on operational technology
because it wasn't networks in the past

456
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:02,200
it was always see realized and
internalized it really didn't

457
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:06,460
communicate across the network so the
risk is very low for now that stuff is

458
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:10,230
starting to be connected to the network
connected to the internet so we gotta do

459
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:12,920
a deeper assessment of those
technologies to make sure they're not in

460
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:29,230
adding additional rescue us know because
we won't sign a contract with them until

461
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:33,950
they give us the information for the
business chooses to accept the risk and

462
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:38,200
that's one thing that we make sure that
if we identify for example we had

463
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,580
vendors that have absolutely said we
will not sign your contract supplement

464
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:47,060
period there's no way we take that back
to the business we write it up as a risk

465
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,250
we write up is a critical risk

466
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:53,420
and they evaluate whether they were
willing to accept that risk we have had

467
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:57,440
businesses that have severed
relationships with vendors big vendors

468
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,530
because they were not willing to
negotiate a contract with us so we have

469
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:06,310
it it's not up to us at that point it's
up to the business whether they're

470
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:11,380
willing to accept the risk with one
stipulation our chief operating officer

471
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:17,050
has told the managing director
cybersecurity that if he feels that the

472
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:20,210
risk is too great for the business to
accept it he has allowed to escalate

473
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:24,260
that up to the risk Executive Committee
on a risk executive committee to review

474
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:48,410
that risk and determine whether they are
willing to accept it or not we treat our

475
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:52,600
vendor information is confidential
information or competence what we call

476
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:57,410
competition especially which is our
highest classification weekly class file

477
00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:01,500
that confidential and maintain it where
we need to if we don't need to maintain

478
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:05,950
it then we destroyed it with a tarp our
secure our information classification

479
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:08,950
guidelines

480
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:38,020
so as I stated we work very closely with
our procurement vendor and we actually

481
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:43,670
extract every relationship that
determine holds with every vendor and

482
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:47,530
put it into our centralized system so
that we know what relationships we have

483
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:51,210
and we can go through and evaluate those
internal what level of scrutiny we need

484
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:15,970
we do is if if the vendor will not
respond to our questionnaire will not

485
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:20,569
sign our documents than what we do is is
we we basically give them a cannot be

486
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:24,130
evaluated was not evaluated ranking
which is the same as our critical

487
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:28,440
ranking said that the business itself
down this vendor was unwilling to answer

488
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:32,920
any of your questions we feel a great
degree of risk are you willing to accept

489
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:37,220
it or not and that's where I where we've
had some significant size benders much

490
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:40,850
bigger than us that we've severed
relationships with were playing every

491
00:41:40,850 --> 00:42:02,450
bit of their product out of our
environment and replacing also we have

492
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:06,009
some general data retention requirements
in the contract supplement but we also

493
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:09,740
allow the business to dictate what the
retention requirements are because as we

494
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:13,069
all know different data has different
retention requirements we allow the

495
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:16,800
business to drive that we just reference
that as a part of this agreement that

496
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,890
it's within the compliance requirements
of that particular data classification

497
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:45,710
works with the business in in the
specific requirements for that business

498
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:49,730
we just drive the cyber security
requirements and if there is a specific

499
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:54,120
requirement for the business that is not
in our settlement we can have that added

500
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:57,700
either the general contractor the
supplement as necessary will not run

501
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:01,990
into that too much because we tried to
cover just about anything that we could

502
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:05,310
possibly think up i mean obviously we're
not going to cover everything but we try

503
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:05,930
to make it

504
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:17,169
broad enough to cover just about
everything we need to thank you

505
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:19,349
your time that's all I have for today
