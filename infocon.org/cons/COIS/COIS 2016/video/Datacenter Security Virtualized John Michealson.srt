1
00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:15,510
we'll see how this works

2
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:20,720
everybody my name is John michaelson
architect at work or Check Point

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:28,270
Software when they were doing calls for
30 this year we were kinda thinking what

4
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:34,050
what what can we do that would be very
relevant and you know also kind of mine

5
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:41,040
springs so what I put together here is
more about thought leadership there

6
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,460
should be no product relation in here at
the end if you're interested I'll be

7
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:51,510
around for a while we can talk about
products specifically but it says

8
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,620
checkpoint on here but the majority of
what I got going on in here is more

9
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:01,059
about what's going on as far as the STN
landscape and where we are we you know

10
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:07,229
should be thinking about moving forward
so really hit it off

11
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:14,460
checkpoints better on a really long time
and there's only really only one kind of

12
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:19,240
thing that I wanna mention about
SharePoint before you can move on and

13
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,440
that is we are Check Point Software
wouldn't even selling appliances until

14
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,890
2008 so

15
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:31,260
when it if your existing checkpoint
const customers you're gonna see a

16
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:36,010
little bit of a kind of Art Design in
this whole thing in the first place and

17
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:40,390
how we do things and how we've always
done things and how s tienes kinda just

18
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:44,630
moving forward kind of the ideas that
we've always had which is kinda nice so

19
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:50,890
really support why are we here why is
STN matter

20
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:57,619
well we used to not care I didn't the
nineties when I was building talkin ring

21
00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:00,310
networks and working on mainframes I
didn't care

22
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:03,800
my network guys did not care at all

23
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,530
give us a perimeter

24
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:10,119
and they're just kinda over here you
know trying to pit not pay attention

25
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:14,240
I've got a perimeter I got this internet
thing that's kind of knew whatever

26
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:23,090
doesn't matter but as we build our data
centers we've got all these different

27
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:31,830
pieces and we just protected the outside
now was it and in fact there's even a

28
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:40,420
methodology to that when I get the
little backwards moved almost drowned

29
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:46,100
last night trying to desensitize
checkpoint from this whole thing but

30
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,930
anyhow purity really got confusing we
had a perimeter

31
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,170
but then had all these apps that started
coming in there and what would we do

32
00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:00,799
about those who got Facebook is used
whether we want to acknowledge it or not

33
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,830
the stops here

34
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:07,450
office 365 something that's really knew
although there's been other things like

35
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,540
Dropbox and all these other tools that
have been around for a very long time

36
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:15,540
that are all of our customers internally
for organizations are using whether you

37
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:20,440
want to acknowledge or not it's there
and as they come in they're just more

38
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,270
and more and more and there's nothing we
can do

39
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:30,190
can't stop the flow of the stuff this is
modern so

40
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:36,630
what do we do about this we need
encryption between sites and internally

41
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:41,840
at some points depending on your work or
URL filtering control and I mean all of

42
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,700
these different technologies and that's
how we and when we're talking about that

43
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:53,519
rumor perimeter design can we do that
inside so more difficult

44
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,550
little bit of background this is kind of
what I was doing in the nineties

45
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,940
things in just moving forward trucking
along not really thinking about it but

46
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:09,970
what if we at well first thing he did
was fire walls they sell just weren't

47
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:16,089
good enough and we had an occasion
service because now I can't just have

48
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,268
machines all over the place

49
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:21,280
remember when those 31 no indication
things just came up and work

50
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,110
so we moved on we had a happy p.m.
gateways in this weird thing called

51
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:31,780
wireless came on and we have wireless
gateway into context my wireless gateway

52
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:38,758
about 2001 I had seven thousand wireless
clients all over the Twin Cities because

53
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:42,449
I worked for the transportation
organization and everybody that several

54
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:48,009
wireless networks and it was a lot of
fun but kind of indication what kind of

55
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:56,969
security was around not not a we had all
of the assessment tools Martin Brodeur's

56
00:04:56,969 --> 00:05:02,900
which is then you know network intrusion
detection all of these different things

57
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:09,049
and if I respond well now there's a lot
of stuff how do we handle this there's

58
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:13,039
no overarching theme here is that this
is a whole bunch of stuff that used to

59
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,930
be not too bad when there is one or two
or stock them but now it's everywhere

60
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:25,030
when it comes to things like treatment
facilities whether it's clean launder

61
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,859
dirty water doesn't matter

62
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:33,010
things that are on the list at the
federal level that need to be protected

63
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:42,670
all of this stuff has to be there in
generally speaking it's complicated one

64
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:46,870
of the organizations I used to work for
ran all the way treatment plans for the

65
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,340
Twin Cities

66
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:53,140
that doesn't sound so bad right however
what happens if somebody what's the

67
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:58,780
effluent into the river with I don't
know half a tank of chlorine or any of

68
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:03,760
the other nasty chemicals could use now
clean waters what we all think about

69
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,539
when we think about things that are
important right because that's open the

70
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:12,870
taps if it's poisonous 3040 thought you
know maybe a thousand people heard of

71
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:18,220
whatever if you poison a river you're
killin counties an entire states where

72
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:23,670
the people so needless to say it was
really really really scary to me when I

73
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:27,650
went to one of our treatment plants one
time because we have this routing loop

74
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:30,359
and I couldn't figure it out I ended up
having to drive 10 miles on the middle

75
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:36,220
of nowhere me get there I ordered this
thing so I can get to it from home while

76
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:40,800
the Sun our entire network was
completely run over because the person

77
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,060
in charge of those two plants and added
this line there's nothing we could do

78
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:47,650
about it so we need all these types of
tools

79
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:54,698
here and we should even we even get into
the encryption back and forth nowadays

80
00:06:54,699 --> 00:07:01,020
to you know more and more and more and
more in the analyzers that's the really

81
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,250
big thing I personally have had to deal
with every one of these technologies and

82
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:13,190
it sucks that a scale just flat and
simple so what foresters has been

83
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:18,020
telling us for a number of years now is
that there's no more chewy so we're

84
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:22,409
talking about that old mentality the
older design mentality from the early

85
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:25,349
nineties when we didn't care what was on
the inside

86
00:07:25,349 --> 00:07:31,830
well now we do and the only way to
really deal with this is not trust

87
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:39,758
anything complicated how do we handle
and realistically what it comes down to

88
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:45,360
is that all of these little pieces every
single one of them has to be

89
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,680
authenticated and verified have
encrypted channel absolutely all of

90
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,569
these types of things in order to get to
where we need to be really what it comes

91
00:07:54,569 --> 00:07:59,520
down to is this massive management
overhead there's technologies that have

92
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,659
been able to do this for years and years
and years and a sax is not the first

93
00:08:03,659 --> 00:08:07,690
thing to come to market that can handle
this however unless you work for the

94
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:12,599
federal government or dealt with banks
10 years ago didn't care that's really

95
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:18,779
what it comes down to the markets
changing in STN is really enabling all

96
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:20,580
of this paper sauce

97
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:26,050
enabling security in a much easier
fashion than what we used to do what we

98
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:29,199
used to have to do some moving forward

99
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:35,969
segmentations nuclear matter how many
people have heard that the last two

100
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:38,870
three four years I worker checkpoint
have been here about five years

101
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:42,229
everybody's been pushing this try it

102
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:48,220
what's true until you have things are
good have and then you have things like

103
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:52,339
Home Depot happen and then you have you
know and on and on and on I know I

104
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:56,910
personally I handle target for a number
of years I'm tired tired of hearing

105
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:01,850
about it but they were over hiroshima
that's what happened that's why we're

106
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:08,029
all still talking about it what needs to
change his visibility needs to go up

107
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:18,480
Micra segment stations and yes that's
actually not something as security

108
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,400
community has been pushing this is
something that specific vendors have

109
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:27,520
been pushing with newer technologies and
I have come to believe that those newer

110
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:35,150
technologies can become security enable
us for everybody so if we think about

111
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:40,110
the evolution of the data center pretty
simple physical right here right now the

112
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:46,640
boxes the second here is a virtual data
center while that's that's like 15 years

113
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:52,930
anybody remember GSX about el parque

114
00:09:54,899 --> 00:10:02,670
virtualization and been around home on
quite a while I mentioned mainframes in

115
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:09,490
the beginning what was that same thing
not the stuff is not new just got a new

116
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:14,529
label on it because it's become
commodities so as we're having

117
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:19,069
conversations with customers I prefer
architectural high-level discussions I

118
00:10:19,069 --> 00:10:23,410
don't like waiting in the weeds about
this that whatever just because it's not

119
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:28,839
really constructive from my personal
perspective what I try to do is have a

120
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:34,279
conversation with the folks table for
this table are disabled and try to raise

121
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:39,699
that so these different groups within
organizations are actually talk well

122
00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:46,740
private cloud has force that and I'm
single somebody out here so what what's

123
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:51,809
your opinion of what private cloud
what's the definition of private cloud

124
00:10:51,809 --> 00:11:02,249
you're finished well sure sure that the
public but what pride

125
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:18,880
hey that's a great idea anybody else so
the definition for private cloud really

126
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,920
is the same as column to accept now
we've added API's to its automate things

127
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,969
that's really the only difference I am I
using VMware here

128
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:34,660
sure am I using KVM percent sure
whatever sure doesn't matter over here

129
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:40,530
it's the same thing except perhaps from
somebody and there's a bunch of API

130
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:44,920
sanatorium doin API's in my own
datacenter that's it I'm automating

131
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:51,949
things and that's the only difference so
when your executives or maybe your exact

132
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:57,210
yourself when they're talking to other
sea levels we just got this wonderful

133
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:01,890
private cloud thing and I don't know we
cannot and will not you know that's all

134
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:07,230
we're talking about it is upgraded their
data center to 1.2 wasn't a big thing

135
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:12,820
was not a big job the big jump really is
a hybrid when we have private cloud

136
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:22,490
public cloud public cloud is your things
like Azure HP EWS things that you can

137
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:28,920
get to and operate from home right well
what's aborted AWS really do wish the

138
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:36,280
market with AWS regulated market where
they established a really great codebase

139
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:40,839
it wasn't that they had this wonderful
virtualization tak what they did is they

140
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,510
wrapped all their API is around its you
can write shell scripts that a fire up

141
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:48,330
entire data centers and never actually
got a couple of things that we have time

142
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:52,950
at the end that if you wanna see I can
show you some of the stuff was one line

143
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,670
is long

144
00:12:55,670 --> 00:13:02,000
and the private side of things that
hybrid all that is is the merging of the

145
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,880
two so now I've got my private data
center with API and I've got the public

146
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,250
data center with epi is it emerged those
two and thats hybrid that's it

147
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,019
it's not super complicated in you know
there's vendors out there that are

148
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:20,070
spilling just piles of acronyms
everybody and that's all they're really

149
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:26,630
saying so one really big part of this
while I'm getting ahead of myself start

150
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:36,350
home alone so there's a datacenter
weather or smaller one rack you know

151
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:40,019
everybody's Adam and kind of the common
theme here

152
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:47,980
companies very large companies have gone
in the place is called what it is they

153
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:52,699
lay people often outsource lot of
companies have done this so what I'm

154
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:56,990
seeing is that folks run from
Minneapolis so there's a lot of big

155
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:01,620
companies that outsource to like TCS
many guys you used Tata consulting

156
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:07,050
they've even one of the larger ones in
town they even are using the market I

157
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:11,349
know so the people we deal with our
senior architect and there's four of

158
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:16,470
them and they run a multi-billion dollar
companies network because they outsource

159
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:22,390
everything else that's just one aspect
and what I'm seeing her on this that

160
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:26,050
this happened in a lot of my friends
that work there they all had to find

161
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:31,329
jobs three years later these architects
architecture teams but they're having to

162
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:34,229
deal with is the fact that these people
don't exist anymore

163
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:39,430
yeah they got TCS or whatever other
company but it takes nine months to roll

164
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:45,649
a server 200 is average no really
ridiculous than the other thing it out

165
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:51,740
is that when you have people in the data
center make changes you're incurring

166
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,240
additional risk

167
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,740
so what these large companies that have
outsourced are finding is that they're

168
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:01,690
having to turn to for companies are
going we need automation I don't have

169
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:05,820
people to do this anymore even when I
had people that took a hundred days to

170
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:14,980
get something done and now the time is
double triple horrible so this one given

171
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:21,450
the chance I would encourage everybody
to go watch this 2012 in this is my

172
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:28,089
entire summary of what we should be
doing in terms of STN landscape and if

173
00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:33,740
there are theirs at people in the room
if the sea level people don't care what

174
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:37,740
you do but if your application
developers are not thinking this way

175
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:42,580
they're doing it wrong that is my
opinion in a bunch of people on my team

176
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:45,580
cuz you know what

177
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:50,959
turned it is they had to change the
mentality entirely with their new data

178
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,060
centers

179
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:59,609
because they want to check out this
Google the datacenter evolution there

180
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:05,670
was a webcast in 2012 really kind of
opened my eyes to what's going on he had

181
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:09,689
to change their service model you know
if you don't know who served as certain

182
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:16,240
as the creatures research facility there
the largest and most heavily funded

183
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,889
research facility in in pretty much the
world

184
00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:22,140
they run the supercollider

185
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:25,319
that big ranked matches Adams graydon
Europe

186
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:32,029
lots and lots of computing power miss
you seen any of the charts about how

187
00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:37,470
much processing Walmart uses over
Thanksgiving believe it or not these

188
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:41,700
guys use half of the entire get his
attempt to rate this has actually more

189
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,700
processing power and dynamic content
management

190
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:51,990
some major retailers because of the data
that there anyhow they had to change

191
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:59,730
their tire service model for the next 10
days what we used to do is we had with

192
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:03,840
servers and we all know man we love them
and we fed them and we took care of them

193
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,940
and we patch them we are created

194
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:12,839
well that's fine they're unique lovingly
hand raised in care for it

195
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:22,260
something gets sick there's affect
health that's what we did was server now

196
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:29,049
in a landscape we have the automation
and baked in that allows us to treat

197
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:34,360
them like cattle and the server people
don't want to hear this because that

198
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:40,908
means learning new things that's that's
really what it comes down too but we've

199
00:17:40,909 --> 00:17:45,909
got and cattle and in STN landscape in
an automated environment whether it's

200
00:17:45,909 --> 00:17:49,200
and I don't care what it is

201
00:17:50,179 --> 00:17:57,830
if you're patching something you're
wasting time if you were not dynamic

202
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:06,189
your competitors in here that's all
there this entire model realize around

203
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:11,889
the fact that your cattle your VMs your
service machines can be shot at any

204
00:18:11,889 --> 00:18:18,639
point in time and replace and it does it
takes a little thing gonna get around

205
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:23,469
this but this isn't just a WS not just
add this is the modern data center where

206
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:29,610
I built things and pull up but specific
doctor stream live as a new banking

207
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:35,299
connection comes in in that specific
instance gets torn down and thrown away

208
00:18:35,299 --> 00:18:39,279
after the connection goes away I know
banks that are already doing us some

209
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:45,999
very very cool stuff I thought we were
ahead of the curve last year and then I

210
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:50,590
saw that I was in Toronto in one of our
customers that happens to be very good

211
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:53,559
friends with my boss showed us some of
the really cool stuff there are about to

212
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:58,710
launch in they actually unfortunately
they were able to lay off about 1,800

213
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:01,639
people there at 10:30 now

214
00:19:01,639 --> 00:19:04,269
but because of all this automation and

215
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:11,429
yes absolutely ridiculous that number
went down to about a hundred and twenty

216
00:19:11,429 --> 00:19:14,859
for the first year as they built all the
new automation and then that number went

217
00:19:14,859 --> 00:19:17,399
down even further as they went in the
status

218
00:19:17,399 --> 00:19:25,708
mode now point is it's because if I
bring a machine and I don't like what's

219
00:19:25,709 --> 00:19:29,789
going on she cared about starting a new
one done

220
00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:36,989
total different mentality change
hopefully you've seen this before the

221
00:19:36,989 --> 00:19:42,570
specific slide is actually give credit
where credit's due a stall this

222
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:46,668
infographic from EMC a couple years ago
but it's really really informative it's

223
00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:53,959
got a lot of data in his stand out here
sorry the transformation factory really

224
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:57,999
we're going from the old way of doing
things were making model is not easy one

225
00:19:57,999 --> 00:19:59,580
server at a time

226
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:03,389
whole teams of people building routers
and switches and shipping them out and

227
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:06,180
getting upgrades done and all this kind
of stuff

228
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:10,910
completely automating everything in a
pit stop here this this opera decide

229
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:15,850
defined data center and that's the whole
point it's not just an acronym

230
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,740
where everything is good you wouldn't
believe it I've even been to customers

231
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:28,120
that only had you know very small data
centers with a couple hundred servers

232
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,139
and they're going after this full
automation model too because they know

233
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:36,660
if they can't be Adil some guy in a
basement writing code is gonna

234
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,260
take their customers and that's reality
that's actually what everybody you know

235
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:49,110
next to deal with the future is very
elastic slowed maintenance all these

236
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,639
kind of things

237
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,490
trippin is this all comes down to know I
T as a service broker this part in the

238
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:57,450
middle

239
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:03,340
with the automated and repeatable
portion that one to me a little bit and

240
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:07,100
say let's take this automation and
enable security at a higher level

241
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:12,439
because if I take the fact that I don't
have to check a bunch of boxes and

242
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:18,539
firewall dunno plug cables in which
servers in the fact that somebody has to

243
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:24,970
doesn't have to do all that parently the
complaints about security should start

244
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:31,110
to dissipate if I think about security
up front and as part of my deployment

245
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:37,908
actually planned for it so if I'm sure
many lines of code scripting a couple

246
00:21:37,909 --> 00:21:42,820
hundred lines of code in order to roll
out server load balancers and I'm doing

247
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:47,200
all this it's actually really easy to
have a couple extra lines talk about

248
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:57,909
four walls or iPS or whatever I need
this number I'm sure you've seen over

249
00:21:57,909 --> 00:22:03,380
and over I couldn't bring myself to take
it out the real thing we're worried

250
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:06,160
about here is this lateral traffic
inside

251
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:10,340
is a number something like eighty
percent most of your traffic is inside

252
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:16,399
today to assume you've seen something
like this by now ready to wear the CAPEX

253
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,030
and OPEX and this kind of thing when I
mention the large companies laying

254
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:24,280
everybody off that's where the optic
savings in his

255
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:30,590
is not saving anybody many hazards not
gonna save you money I don't care of

256
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:33,209
microsoft says not gonna happen

257
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:39,640
AWS is not saving you money it's about
operational flexibility that really what

258
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:52,850
it comes down to that whole agility
that's the bigger deal an application

259
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:57,500
service catalog did a video I'm gonna
drop to a little bit as I don't waste

260
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:03,820
your time if you haven't already seen it
basically the web portal go to a request

261
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:13,899
to server and new service just here but
that's really going to this really the

262
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:18,910
sky here really has to do with the
frames this Morgan explanation of the

263
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:22,950
specific technologies that everything
I'm just summarizing glazing over

264
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:28,120
but really hypervisor make a change the
color on this one that didn't turn out

265
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:28,889
so good

266
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:38,440
hypervisor I don't care what it is again
as we're KVM and you know the SXi I

267
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,330
don't care what hypervisor is the STN
later there's a lot of players

268
00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:51,980
what I've seen most recently in the last
14 months running around doing my job is

269
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:56,200
that companies so you're go they're
doing this

270
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:03,639
internally it to determine who's going
to do ac I was gonna do NSX that was

271
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,159
kind of a big fight

272
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:10,129
are we gonna do a CRE gonna do when it's
argued a center people they want to be a

273
00:24:10,129 --> 00:24:13,219
more product network people they want
the Cisco product

274
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:20,429
there was a year ago 99% of the
conversations I have with customers now

275
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:26,030
are about which parts of each other
we're going to use most customers at a

276
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,250
large scale it anyway

277
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:35,010
are gonna have both and they're starting
to realize so I don't care which one it

278
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:35,779
is

279
00:24:35,779 --> 00:24:38,779
cloud management pretty simple

280
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:43,740
that's the orchestrator that talks to
all of these things right and again the

281
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:48,470
fact that I say I don't care about a Cir
in a sax or new I'm sure who it is

282
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:54,380
doesn't matter right there after next

283
00:24:55,250 --> 00:25:00,520
so we have some new challenges and it
put the questions in there because I

284
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:06,050
don't think they're new I think it's
just a revitalized conversation because

285
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:12,520
new technology today that windows ninety
technology today is allowing us to do

286
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:17,280
things in an easier fashion than we had
ten years ago ten years ago to get to

287
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,789
the level of integration that we have

288
00:25:19,789 --> 00:25:22,789
in some of the technologies that are
coming out now

289
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:29,960
I was very very very very expensive so
first ones the perimeter gateway alright

290
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:35,270
we know that have to have one but what
it doesn't do is protect your lateral

291
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:41,530
threats right all takes a log on to the
Council on Windows box and go to the

292
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:44,960
Dropbox order their gmail open anything

293
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,289
and the whole farm could be told

294
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:52,169
that's all

295
00:25:52,169 --> 00:25:59,559
number to this is the harder to changing
IP addresses singer sleeping they wake

296
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:03,139
up we're all starting to build these VDI
farms now so people don't have work

297
00:26:03,139 --> 00:26:06,600
stations and they can have remote access
this kind of stuff

298
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,769
VMware except that doesn't have a patch
you know all of these different things

299
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:13,429
it's all about that dynamic content
that's really what it comes down to

300
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,410
especially since those farms are moving
all over the place right now we've got

301
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:24,310
the excellent kinda like GRE only on
steroids

302
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:29,490
take a machine from data center a little
high the sudden changes I don't care

303
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:33,510
Cisco did something like that a couple
of years ago but it didn't really take

304
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:38,510
off except a large-scale mainly because
I think they try to do it on our

305
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:45,440
platform that had a lot of patients so
the third one is all of these things

306
00:26:46,809 --> 00:26:52,480
with all your platform that's really
where r is a private cloud public cloud

307
00:26:52,480 --> 00:27:02,080
private cloud doesn't matter I don't
handle all this stuff really it's all

308
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:07,158
about managing managing almost tools
that slide with all the red tools all

309
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:07,909
over the place

310
00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:10,909
how do I handle this well as we move
forward

311
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:17,800
faraway manages that's the bigger
question of the day we go for a red hat

312
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:25,270
is this a big list of all the cloud
service providers yes but few choices

313
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:28,270
companies are going through this and go
oh my god what we do

314
00:27:31,539 --> 00:27:34,580
mostly JSON base

315
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:41,920
so those dogs in the room or greater
than 90 Jason learn it live it you can

316
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:47,810
eat it all these different tools have
their own security feature sets

317
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:55,379
so does it make sense for you to try to
use the cloud private data center with

318
00:27:55,380 --> 00:28:01,020
as your or with Fujitsu or with any
other service provider

319
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:05,570
and then try to use their security tools
which for the most part are nothing more

320
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:11,770
than overgrown ACL's with some logging
and that's not just you know saying that

321
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:18,740
out loud because there were actual facts
on treating this disease he sells for

322
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:23,020
example their security groups they
didn't even have good logging into the

323
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:30,520
persian chemo the spring and even then
just what they do if I want a log after

324
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:36,340
insert more quarters because of the
server and I want to log the slow flow

325
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:40,970
monitor or eight quarters that's a
service where the log 00

326
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:49,460
they go to my box they go to my day they
go to the ps3 ps3 bucket well that's

327
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:54,070
another quarter so you can't see you can
turn on logging sure what you're gonna

328
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:58,370
use a specific feature that he should
have just baked in very high visibility

329
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:06,129
is key as I have this one causing here
because I want to make one point a year

330
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:12,040
ago it was nowhere in terms of my
visibility and my customers it was all

331
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:20,020
Amazon it was all in a sex was always
see eye if your are in MSP for some of

332
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:25,129
the really big dogs you talkin OpenStack
you must be talkin OpenStack with center

333
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:31,330
or 12 and KVM because doesn't cost them
anything they can do it and the people

334
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:35,939
that can move on as their contractors
and then they can just operated and they

335
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,040
can build really really slick interface
isn't always really cool stuff but

336
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:44,070
overall it makes them more money this is
where VMware's had a hard time with him

337
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:48,790
is peace because they are expensive and
MSP size P landscaping don't like that

338
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,399
any

339
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:58,580
Azure is easily forty percent of what I
do today one year later VMware and other

340
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:05,530
companies they poke the bear Microsoft
is spending an enormous amount of

341
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:06,780
resource

342
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:13,990
capital everything in order in order to
overtake everybody in the central region

343
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:22,600
alone the VP of azure networking as a
hundred and twenty Rex open at all what

344
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,580
about it

345
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:30,639
the data centers themselves are
purpose-built unlike AWS which was an

346
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:36,890
accident and if you haven't heard that
story I'll give you the rundown time to

347
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:38,419
time

348
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:45,960
Amazon built their cloud to support
their customers that's not you and me

349
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:54,669
it's not put its monster companies right
the excess capacity became AWS he became

350
00:30:54,669 --> 00:30:59,830
sellable to us once they realized they
could actually act like they're making

351
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:00,779
money using it

352
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:08,730
selling it right there is purpose built
the networking actually is better if you

353
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:09,730
heard about this thing

354
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:13,820
classic hearses resource group most
resource-rich mode can be considered

355
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:17,668
considered as your 2.0

356
00:31:18,379 --> 00:31:22,408
July ish last year changed all the guys
missed everybody off but it's better

357
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:30,090
the west point is that because there are
three main security dead centers for

358
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:32,790
Azure

359
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:35,629
checkpoint cars to really be interested
to know

360
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:40,000
that summer teller who used to go around
two conferences like this and black hat

361
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:47,430
is a fairly well-known person and the
security circles within the us- he was

362
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:51,020
checkpoints chief evangelical for a
number of years as well he's actually

363
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:55,150
one of the heads of the azure security
program he went to Microsoft couple

364
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:56,100
years ago

365
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:00,610
he also brought a whole bunch of people
have a wonderful relationship with it

366
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:01,379
with them

367
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:06,260
actually really really cool to be able
to have conversations with their product

368
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:15,549
managers directly and all that kind of
stuff so moving on this part is just a

369
00:32:15,549 --> 00:32:19,530
personal feeling having dealt with
VMware and other companies for a number

370
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:28,470
of years I feel HP Oracle everybody else
is just asking you to trust them by our

371
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,289
staff

372
00:32:29,289 --> 00:32:34,070
it'll be all better now gonna get locked
into specific vendor

373
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:39,360
if you're looking at has your or AWS for
example they have these things called

374
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:45,889
direct connect and express road there
are fiber based service or trade your

375
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:51,179
company cool enough to do VPN or the
internet and I don't have to pay for VPN

376
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:55,679
gateways great now you've got a hard
line with a monthly bills straight here

377
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:01,490
provider are you stuck there for awhile
yes you are it's a business plan that's

378
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:11,200
a business so just pay attention to that
going on I feel strongly that the

379
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:17,230
topographic best-in-class model is
thoroughly broken and needs to be tossed

380
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:20,700
away and if you look at some of the
gardener stuff that's coming out in the

381
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:24,010
last 18 months to two years they're
starting to agree

382
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:31,090
previously I bought the best product
from everybody if you have that kind of

383
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:36,620
money otherwise use the couple's
integrated solution that would happen

384
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:39,820
forget to click sorry

385
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:45,700
API's or Qingdao period and the story
using API's integrate your security

386
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:53,940
solutions with your network solutions
and I don't like and are you wouldn't

387
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:57,530
believe how many conversations where
I've been in a room with some executives

388
00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:02,840
and their architects and have actually
had found the architects because it just

389
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,540
works like this

390
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:08,110
some of these people have no idea what
they're talking about just go to Amazon

391
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:16,850
and I get a console just like VMware
vCenter telling as CIO that this guy

392
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:18,020
fired

393
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,820
but

394
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:25,560
saw about the API integrating
integrating integrating that's it I

395
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:33,739
really believe this one of the things I
lifted from this conference in Calgary

396
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:42,429
this gentleman's actually one of the
founders of the GST moving into in its

397
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:50,330
entirety so just go through that were
operational security is it relevant from

398
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:55,569
our perspective from checkpoints adding
security features that are easily

399
00:34:55,570 --> 00:35:02,960
distilled are completely pointless we
are all about I am all about and that's

400
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:09,910
all there is to it I feel the industry
has misled everybody for some time

401
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:14,060
i'm happy to work for one of the
companies that has never said the things

402
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:20,890
that some of our competition says
detections fine for mediations ok don't

403
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:25,000
block your network traffic 80 cause an
operational audit things like that

404
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,610
they're telling the OPs people what they
want to hear in order to get their coins

405
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:37,350
give us your quarters it's ok what
really happens is you can't preach and

406
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:39,170
then you can say

407
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:44,660
going so service that helps me with this
to write what's wrong with that model

408
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:53,820
seriously what is wrong with that my
honesty box that shows you your true but

409
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:57,480
if you call me maybe I can keep you from
getting fired with this team of people

410
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:07,320
that are coming I'm supposed to be a
hard time with very clearly some

411
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:12,640
companies and there's there is not just
one that actually operate that way but

412
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:21,069
have a competition have teams and act
like that is what it is I don't believe

413
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:23,550
it

414
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:30,270
lastly what is the job security
department anybody in ninety security

415
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:33,100
here everybody has an answer right it
should be

416
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:42,120
it should not be really to manage risk
that's it

417
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:49,769
that's all we're supposed to be doing is
managing rest well with all of those

418
00:36:49,769 --> 00:36:53,788
solutions being thrown at you how do you
handle at my God look at all these

419
00:36:53,789 --> 00:36:57,269
choices we have to make well

420
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:05,500
simply call it to secure all this
infrastructure that is easy I'm not

421
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:11,060
saying you need a big ready but what you
do need a tool that allows you to

422
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:16,210
automate everything because once you can
get to that level where you can automate

423
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:17,480
everything

424
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:21,460
the complaints from your UPS people
start to go away

425
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:30,939
security slows my job now that's a great
deal were you I'd think every firewall

426
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:36,609
admins to you by Deborah visited has it
but API's can eliminate that problem

427
00:37:36,609 --> 00:37:43,150
because it forces everybody forces you
to think about it and not come back and

428
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:45,420
say we need to do service chaining

429
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:52,359
oK what's your plan which is deployed
three thousand VMC ok well guess what

430
00:37:52,359 --> 00:37:58,210
it's actually not that the retro that
type of environment and the other thing

431
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:07,250
get my point it's tough out order the
other point about that is that this

432
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:11,410
automated service there were talking
about automatically deploying security

433
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:18,210
of any flavor your vendors better be on
their best behavior and do a good job

434
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:20,880
because five years from now

435
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:28,559
it's gonna be that easy to replace any
because an SDN landscaper things are

436
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:30,700
automated and script it

437
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:36,669
if i dont like this which it would I do
what I gotta do is change the flow to a

438
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:37,800
difference

439
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:44,300
inspection and turn off the one I don't
like that means things better work

440
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:51,009
from my perspective right and if you're
the champion of this technology that you

441
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:56,810
had for 10 years for you say to
obviously but you know it's a

442
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:58,380
double-edged sword

443
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:04,840
forces us to stay honest and 10 work
harder at the software level but it also

444
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:08,560
gives customers leverage and why would I
be standing up here telling you this if

445
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:13,799
it's negative to me I don't think it's
negative to me already worked for an

446
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:19,070
award winning company and I don't care
we're gonna do a good job so moving on

447
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:23,770
there are three major points you need to
ask any vendor that you're about to

448
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:31,390
engage with in a nest in landscape one
can you provide automated insertion of

449
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:37,580
advanced threats threat prevention
solutions pretty simple answer to

450
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:41,700
moslems yes but these three things need
the axe

451
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:48,150
to about automated provisioning of those
tools once they're deployed and what

452
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:51,190
this means is IPS profiles

453
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:56,730
URL filtering up this application
updates say there's an OpenSSL

454
00:39:56,730 --> 00:40:02,270
vulnerability that whole thing to fix it
or can I do you know if there's just a

455
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:05,329
sport patch whatever

456
00:40:05,329 --> 00:40:13,880
to the security engine cattle security
visibility inside the datacenter I need

457
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:20,329
great visibility inside right down to
the VMware Tools

458
00:40:22,309 --> 00:40:32,349
really really all this one right

459
00:40:32,349 --> 00:40:36,749
doing it on time this is gonna close
with a little video and this what this

460
00:40:36,749 --> 00:40:40,430
is is if you see a demo from VMware in
the last two years

461
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:47,410
you'll recognize this this is the Center
Orchestrator interface noticed this is

462
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:51,879
not a checkpoint product this is just
one of the many many many orchestrator

463
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:58,619
is that I get to deal with this is a
cookbook once I press go its gonna start

464
00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:05,269
doing stuff and the stuff it's doing is
telling a checkpoint manager here's my

465
00:41:05,269 --> 00:41:08,279
whole agnostic part just kind of went
out the window for the last minute but

466
00:41:08,279 --> 00:41:14,719
sorry had to do it I don't have any
demos of other guys stop essentially

467
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:19,449
that service chain can get kicked off
from a web portal that your admins are

468
00:41:19,449 --> 00:41:23,959
using or it could be an admin clicking
going in this fashion and what I'm doing

469
00:41:23,959 --> 00:41:26,959
here and I know it's hard to read but
these are a group

470
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:32,269
machines to group install policy all of
these different things that you would

471
00:41:32,269 --> 00:41:36,058
have to do it in the dashboard or in
your security tool in order to provision

472
00:41:36,579 --> 00:41:41,959
somebody does this cookbook at a time in
any time a new products rolled over

473
00:41:41,959 --> 00:41:45,328
whatever security comes with it so

474
00:41:45,329 --> 00:41:52,640
as i click Go to get up here so I can
cause it so we're starting

475
00:41:55,020 --> 00:42:01,590
when you see it turning green I missed
it anyhow what it started doing is going

476
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:06,090
through that service so again that could
be initiated through a web portal that

477
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:09,910
your admins are built for their own use
or for your right to users user whatever

478
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:15,690
or somebody building that manually know
what we're looking over to is what is

479
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:18,240
occurring on the checkpoint side

480
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:27,569
follow VMware VMware is telling us what
to do so go you gonna see rules you see

481
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:31,270
objects in the database and this is all
real time with the dashboard open

482
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:35,780
all this stuff is just populating
because Mr says so

483
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:40,149
this is a level of integration your tool
needs to have

484
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:49,800
some of our friends out but we're all
they're doing similar things but so far

485
00:42:49,800 --> 00:43:01,570
so you're all machines these rules you
know there's a threat prevention policy

486
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:08,730
attached here you know the drop the wall
the logging all of that kind of stuff a

487
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:12,710
provision everything phone and the first
thing it did what you can't see and hear

488
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:16,700
was it actually told it to create the
virtual gateway in the first place so it

489
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:20,839
created a virtual gateway and then it
started writing rules around it and then

490
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:25,410
at the man you know the video plays out
at the end here you see it actually

491
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:31,560
provision the provision security done
that took all the talk longer than it

492
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:35,350
took to actually happen so when I was
talking about those three things you

493
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:42,299
have to have this is that's a level
that's where we're we're kind of the the

494
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:50,830
gold standard should be from my
perspective that's everything I had to

495
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:56,660
talk about I will be around for a little
while if anybody wants to talk about

496
00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:01,940
specific products and how we do that or
enable this but have a great day in and
