1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,490
met good afternoon thank you for those
of you who don't know be there still

2
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:20,810
time to go back and for those of you who
do I'm sorry my name is bad I am the

3
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:27,640
founder of inter hack and I'm gonna talk
a little bit about forensic computer

4
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:34,809
analysis and I'm gonna talk generally
about forensic analysis and the

5
00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:40,989
presentation of scientific evidence I'm
going to look at it from the perspective

6
00:00:40,989 --> 00:00:48,879
of somebody who's challenging that work
so I'm curious before we get going how

7
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:54,349
many of you in your day jobs or your
night jobs the case may be

8
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:02,140
are involved in the creation or the
collection for the analysis of

9
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,939
electronic evidence that may be used in
some kind of a proceeding

10
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:19,100
a bunch how many of you have been
ordered to testify in a deposition how

11
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,100
many of you at trial

12
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:28,740
how many have seen things like the court
documents that's a scary things like

13
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,360
motion in limine

14
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,540
talk about some stuff here

15
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:40,270
alright so if you have questions feel
free to pipe up you could throw things

16
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:45,320
at me that sort of stuff is all fair
game usually giving a talk I'll get

17
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,289
probably no more than 10 minutes into it
before people feel the need to start

18
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:55,150
hurling things at me for various reasons
if the kind of thing that I'm talking

19
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:59,770
about sounds very interesting to you and
you want to play at the grown-ups table

20
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:04,720
then we should talk because as I am
desperate for people who can survive

21
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,489
this crazy environment that I called my
office right

22
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:18,070
the kinds of things that we do are quite
remarkably serious this is an analyst at

23
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:25,519
my firm who was given an award and that
award is what we call the verified kill

24
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:32,000
the verified kill and the associated
skull pin you get to where that goes

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:40,709
along with it is the results of
encountering evidence that has been

26
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:43,170
presented by somebody else

27
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:47,298
the analysis of which you have knocked
out

28
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:53,540
so in this particular case we had an
expert on the other side who had some

29
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:58,810
things that he said and Matt here had a
look at it he said

30
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:06,360
problems here gave a line of questioning
to counsel filed some paperwork that

31
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:14,090
identified some problems and the judge
ruled in a pretrial hearing that one of

32
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:18,790
his four opinions his his big-money
opinion that this iPhone has been reset

33
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:23,840
at this particular date after the fire
the judge said you can't tell the jury

34
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:33,379
that that is not a scientifically
defensible opinion sucks to be you by

35
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:36,470
the way anybody know what happens if you
have that kind of thing happened to you

36
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,440
you lose the case

37
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:47,970
money back if a court rules that you are
offering an unreliable opinion your

38
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,130
career is over

39
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:54,650
nobody hires you anymore to give their
opinion in that area it's kind of a

40
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:59,300
continuum so it's not necessarily you
never ever worked as an expert again but

41
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:04,090
you may in fact have that kind of thing
happen to stakes are high not only for

42
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,600
the people who are involved in the
litigation but the people who are

43
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:15,720
involved in the delivery of the evidence
so the question arises what is an expert

44
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:20,040
witness it's important to understand
that because before we get to talk about

45
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,580
how we analyzed evidence and how we
present the data and all that kind of

46
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,650
stuff we understand the role that we
play in this process the role that we

47
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:36,039
play as an expert witness is a
relatively humble one we don't really

48
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,260
matter in the grand scheme of things

49
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:44,560
who matters in this will be the
plaintiff who has some kind of the beef

50
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,470
the defendant who has a right to defend
himself against this complaint

51
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,970
their lawyers matter because it is the
lawyers who are going to be making the

52
00:04:54,970 --> 00:05:00,500
arguments the judge matters because the
judge has to ensure that this judicial

53
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:07,430
process is being administered fairly the
jurors matter because they're the ones

54
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:12,240
who had to take a couple of weeks out of
their lives to listen to all of this

55
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,630
pitiful and do their civic duty so that
we have an option besides killing each

56
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:24,650
other whenever there is a dispute that
we can't resolve my arm wrestling so our

57
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:33,590
job as experts is a humble one our job
is to help the people who matter do

58
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:40,150
their job that's all we do is we help
the people who matter in this process

59
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:49,540
do their job properly so we will apply
technical expertise experience things

60
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:56,490
that the lawyers say beyond the kin of
the jury that they have the ability to

61
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,490
understand what all of that junk means

62
00:06:00,409 --> 00:06:07,429
to be able to offer that opinion there
are several things that you need to have

63
00:06:07,429 --> 00:06:17,318
this is the Federal Rule of Evidence 702
there is also an Ohio ruling on their

64
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:22,809
own rules of evidence and whatnot but
they all boil down to basically this

65
00:06:22,809 --> 00:06:29,050
four prong test and it's not get to
choose which one of these I'm gonna be

66
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,089
able to get in with option be

67
00:06:32,089 --> 00:06:38,789
you have to do all of them that is that
you have to have that kind of technical

68
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:45,110
or scientific knowledge that is going to
help the trier of fact the jurors to

69
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:50,589
understand what's going on with all of
this stuff you're gonna have to base it

70
00:06:50,589 --> 00:06:55,699
upon sufficient facts or data you can't
pick two data points call it a trend

71
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:59,539
testified to it and say what's going to
happen on your third data point that no

72
00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:02,210
worky has the technical term

73
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:06,250
the other thing is that you have to have
your testimony be the product of

74
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:13,940
reliable principles this is not the time
to get experimental and innovative if

75
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:19,080
you're galileo and you're saying that
the Sun is actually the center of the

76
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,849
universe the time to present that is it
a technical conference at a scientific

77
00:07:23,849 --> 00:07:27,669
research outlets not in a trial

78
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,640
finally you have to apply those
principles and methods reliably to the

79
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:39,030
facts of this case you don't get to go
take a look at what's happening in

80
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:43,559
general all the stuff that's generally
happening out there and somehow score

81
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:49,810
some kind of points in this particular
case you have talked about this case for

82
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:50,390
that too

83
00:07:50,390 --> 00:08:01,070
to be admissible everybody with me so
far so good now I want

84
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:05,390
to emphasize again the point about what
we're doing

85
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:10,700
being very important is not just a
question of each other for getting

86
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:15,880
killed in that sort of stuff some of the
stuff we talked about his criminal we're

87
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:24,990
talking about the government's wanting
to deprive someone of life or liberty we

88
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:34,810
have a documents that defines how we are
going to operate and that includes a

89
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:43,839
provision in this document that
provision is amendment number six the

90
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:50,290
sixth amendment to the Constitution of
the United States requires that when

91
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:59,469
someone is accused that he is afforded
the right to be confronted by the

92
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,140
witnesses against him

93
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:09,470
to have compulsory process for obtaining
witnesses in his favor and to have the

94
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:19,240
assistance of counsel for his defense so
if you go back to your office you fire

95
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,630
up in case

96
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:24,110
print out a report

97
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:33,320
who is the witness testifying against
the accused and by what process is the

98
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:39,790
right of the accused as articulated in
the sixth amendment going to be afforded

99
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:49,490
it is ultimately the person the person
has to be able to meet that test if you

100
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:54,610
don't have the ability to meet that test
in the rule of evidence then you've got

101
00:09:54,610 --> 00:10:00,550
no business doing this this is very very
serious stuff as seen by some of these

102
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:10,599
cases that were working on we see a lot
of development as things get very very

103
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:15,060
important and we have more and more
information becoming increasingly

104
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,920
sensitive coming under attack from
nation states and all that sort of stuff

105
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:27,589
and every sheriff's office in the
country wants to be SEAL Team six and

106
00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:32,430
they want to be the equivalent when it
comes to the forensic stuff so they go

107
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:33,120
to their end

108
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:39,230
training 58 training and they get their
20 hours of boot camp and then they want

109
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:40,390
to do a report

110
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:49,470
well okay but we've got a process that
we need to go through that sixth

111
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:56,390
amendment thing what prosecutors have a
bit of an issue with ads on the way to

112
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:02,899
talk about why not a good idea and
remember the Casey Anthony trial Casey

113
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:06,459
Anthony trial we got to hear about
nonstop why because nancy grace for her

114
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:07,779
bully pulpit

115
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:18,310
CNN has decided that we've got somebody
who's guilty we've got ourselves a young

116
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:25,010
mother wants to be a party Carroll and
that daughter is kinda getting in her

117
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:31,110
way of her lifestyle so we're gonna try
her on TV and we're going to convict her

118
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:36,270
on TV and that's how this is gonna work
she was such a good prosecutor that he

119
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:39,270
cited a TV host

120
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,520
this guy

121
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:49,970
sergeant Kevin Stenger Orange County
Florida sheriff's office he was called

122
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:58,220
as a witness for the state he testified
that in his examination of Casey

123
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:04,540
Anthony's computer he found that the
term chloroform was searched for 84

124
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:10,650
times why is that important how's that
relate to the facts of the present case

125
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:14,750
how was it the little girl was killed

126
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:19,020
chloroform was involved

127
00:12:20,329 --> 00:12:29,170
84 times if you're a juror and you have
this terrific set of circumstances put

128
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:35,110
in front of you and that guy sits on the
standards is 84 times her computer had a

129
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:41,459
search term chloroform is that powerful
to you that mean something to you this

130
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:47,540
is it just what's after the fact if not
random once before the fact eighty fair

131
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:56,129
times effect repeated over and over
again by the prosecutor eighty four

132
00:12:56,129 --> 00:13:03,610
times the little problem with that the
guy who wrote the software the sergeants

133
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:11,309
tanker used to eighty four times as a
lot so he decided he'd better have a

134
00:13:11,309 --> 00:13:19,519
look at a software found a bug in his
software he said holy moly we got

135
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,429
ourselves a problem so he calls his
client Orange County Sheriff's Office

136
00:13:23,429 --> 00:13:31,549
hey guys there's a bug in my software
the areas in might want to fix it what

137
00:13:31,549 --> 00:13:39,839
they do they ignore him so he calls the
prosecutor hey guys are seeking the

138
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,410
death penalty here before you kill a
citizen maybe wanna get your facts

139
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:47,410
straight what they do

140
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,369
ignored him

141
00:13:51,939 --> 00:13:58,929
so he calls the defense attorney hey
guys guess what I'm real sorry but

142
00:13:58,929 --> 00:14:07,409
there's a bug in my software I'm trying
to get the record cleared up after

143
00:14:07,409 --> 00:14:14,479
having all this notice the prosecution
puts on sergeant Stanger 84 times they

144
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:21,199
say and what they don't realize is that
the defense had been in touch with the

145
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:26,809
guy who wrote the software found the bug
fixed it and got the right number

146
00:14:28,569 --> 00:14:34,519
anyone want to get the right number one

147
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:42,130
that was important

148
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:53,800
anybody remember the result the verdicts
returned by the jury not guilty does

149
00:14:53,800 --> 00:15:00,260
that mean that she didn't do the thing
necessarily the state failed to prove

150
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:07,939
its case doing stupid stuff like this to
try to get an advantage because you've

151
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:15,690
got somebody you're sure is guilty is
not just corruption of the process it

152
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:19,890
ultimately is not going to get you the
result that you're really looking for

153
00:15:20,449 --> 00:15:27,229
anybody know this lady and a Dukan a
chemist's Massachusetts state crime lab

154
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,969
she was every prosecutor's favorite

155
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:38,829
focus on drug cases anytime they needed
somebody to come through they gave her a

156
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:44,400
call why because she was always able to
make the connection that they needed why

157
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:51,880
well because she did all the evidence
that's why and we now have thousands of

158
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:57,380
cases thousands of convictions which
have to be reopened and reanalyzed

159
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:03,710
because we've got somebody fooling
around with the evidence so we could get

160
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:08,440
the conclusion that we wanted that would
be bad

161
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:25,209
heard about this elite team of forensic
hair sample analysts at FBI between 1985

162
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:35,320
and 1999 268 criminal cases across the
country the elite hair sample analysts

163
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:45,550
at FBI came in to testify in 257 of the
268 testified wrongly in favor of the

164
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:51,020
defense I'm sorry in favor of the
prosecution favorite the state you got a

165
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:56,890
state agency going through this process
using hair samples to type people to the

166
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,670
location of a crime

167
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:06,938
32 defendants were sentenced to death 14
or either executed or died in prison

168
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:23,250
everybody alright with this is people
are dead and no on Friday that serious

169
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:30,240
the stuff is what does not about
computers well I do computer stuff I do

170
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,240
death penalty cases it is that serious

171
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:42,420
in one of the cases that we worked on we
were dealing with an iPhone iPhones are

172
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:57,270
all the rage now we're so fast that
right back to the iPhone so the deal is

173
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:00,270
anybody had to make an insurance claim
lately

174
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:06,790
car crash fire in a kind of the
insurance company ask your phone

175
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:12,159
wait for it they're coming after your
phone

176
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:17,300
the reason why they want to know where
you were they wanna know how fast you

177
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:23,870
were going they want to know you're
talking to your house is on fire because

178
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:30,060
insurance companies are there to deny
your claim for your convenience

179
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:43,990
like Incredibles you know the
bureaucracy so we've got a case where

180
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:47,830
we've got an insurer and they want to
deny somebody's claim

181
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:58,290
to have their house that has burned down
because they had some guy look at the

182
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:07,610
phone super duper forensic eight er 2015
open up reads the data out and this

183
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:16,280
report this god-awful report has
conclusions in at one of which was the

184
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:23,340
location services disabled before the
loss and never relabeled the phone was

185
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:30,600
reset after the loss the owners
selectively deleted data we've got some

186
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:35,879
stuff in here that has been chosen and
also there's an encrypted backup

187
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:41,200
somewhere maybe that might have more
information on it if only we could get

188
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:48,370
ahold of putative encrypted backup that
might exist now when we start taking a

189
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:52,479
look at this what are some of the
questions that come to your mind if

190
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,640
you're looking at this and you're
thinking about ok somebody is trying to

191
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,420
make a claim that their house has burnt
down and they want to be paid for that

192
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:07,060
ok well it seems a reasonable thing to
ask you by the way to just set the fire

193
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:12,879
yourself if you got evidence that
somebody has in fact set the fire that

194
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,940
might be important

195
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:19,760
if somebody has tried to cover up such
evidence that also might be important

196
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:25,310
and clearly this is the kind of thing
the insurance company wants fine now has

197
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:29,610
anybody ever contracted to provide a
service to an insurance company

198
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:38,939
insurance companies as you know are
always looking for the most optimal

199
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:46,530
solution to their problems whatever the
cost right but they are shaped as all

200
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:55,610
get out they will tell you if you have
told them it's gonna cost $10,000 could

201
00:20:55,610 --> 00:21:04,649
do for a nickel copper nickel that's the
kind of thing that you get into which

202
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:10,900
means that the tires of experts that
have been lined up by the insurance

203
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:17,190
company are probably doing so based on a
low rate with the promise that yeah you

204
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:24,200
might lose money on every deal but will
make up for it in volume this is where a

205
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,990
lot of these guys get this thing so they
start getting a lot of hype around boom

206
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:31,410
boom boom boom

207
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:37,100
and you get stuff like this now if this
is something that you're interested in

208
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:48,149
understanding locations services has
been disabled before the fire never if

209
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:53,080
you're working for the other side if
you're working for the claimant how are

210
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,810
you going to address that kind of
assertion are you gonna take their word

211
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:59,470
for it

212
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:04,980
call me call me skeptical about what I
have a look at this riddle me this

213
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:10,830
Batman how come when I start looking at
the palest data around here I start

214
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:19,050
finding that there are apps that record
when they last looked at the location

215
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:25,580
services and why is it that there are
time stamps in there after the loss

216
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:29,780
could you answer that question for me
that would be really great

217
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:37,970
the fact is when you offer an opinion
within a reasonable degree of scientific

218
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:46,300
certainty that is the phrase that pays
you have to meet that standard if you

219
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:56,399
can identify a simple null hypothesis
and be sure that it's not linking then

220
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,950
you might have a little bit of a problem
because I'm good stuff and in fact we do

221
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:05,160
look for that in fact did find it

222
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:11,840
the question of whether the phone was
reset after the loss of 10 the

223
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:17,330
foundation that would be too if you
needed to establish that with an iPhone

224
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:20,370
how much you go about doing that

225
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:23,679
timestamps you could find on the phone
somewhere

226
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:36,230
ok white 3 o'clock 15 well there's no
log off there is however going to be a

227
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:41,330
timestamp associated with records the
import into the phone and in fact after

228
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:44,449
the loss we found out there were a whole
bunch of things and contacts that were

229
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:51,790
all the same time stamp so what we have
will soon be loaded a bunch of contacts

230
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:57,220
in the phone Africa loss and you want to
go from there to the phone was wiped

231
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:05,760
really the owner selectively deleted
data this might be my favorite so

232
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:12,430
difficult with this case with the iPhone
there is a notion of a serial number

233
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:21,460
right recorder with it with a picture
like a picture 106 107 108 109 114 117

234
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,270
132

235
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:31,010
we're missing a few so clearly if you
had a fire and you're missing a few

236
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:36,930
photos in sequence then you deleted
pictures that you took of your house

237
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:45,330
burning right that's the conclusion but
the owner selectively deleted data

238
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:48,330
selectively

239
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:55,320
does anybody use celebrate to do those
phone analysis I mean this is the great

240
00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:00,280
new tool everybody loves their celebrate
right could you tell me which button on

241
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:04,780
their tells you will selectively what
what what what is the test used to

242
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:09,490
establish whether something was deleted
selectively or can you tell me why

243
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:14,500
somebody chose to delete one thing but
not another anybody ever taken up at

244
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:22,090
picture before might have been blurry I
got the thing up site was in the way and

245
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:30,199
that kind of stuff now if you do have
that problem of them because if ever one

246
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:35,070
day you need to make an insurance claim
you don't want that to say well clearly

247
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:38,070
you deleted the evidence that you set
your house on fire

248
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:43,410
that's what they were claiming this is
amazing

249
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:50,040
in this case

250
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:59,590
as you saw earlier we had somebody do
some work on this issue number two and

251
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:04,449
in a pretrial motion the judge tossed
that said that you can't say that to the

252
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:08,540
jury you're not allowed to ask the
question counsel and you mister expert

253
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:16,210
are not allowed to say that they read me
but the rest of these three things

254
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:22,030
they're still on the table were going to
allow the jury to hear that and then

255
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:25,320
they can decide whether they're gonna
believe that or whether they're going to

256
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:33,010
listen to bow tie boy that's ultimately
going to be a question for the jury what

257
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:39,040
are the things that we do in the process
of preparing for trials not only to help

258
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,950
counsel figure out the line question to
ask us about our story will get out

259
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:47,450
there but we also do work to figure out
who's on the other side what they're

260
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:50,670
gonna say what their approaches how
they've testified in previous cases

261
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:54,750
where they've gone to school all the
training they've taken everything that

262
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:58,740
they've bumped up in the entire history
of their existence and we're going to

263
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:01,740
put that into a machine

264
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:09,380
its way to spit out a line of questions
and these are not comfortable questions

265
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:18,550
the remaining three questions
conclusions that were put up here the

266
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:24,419
opposing expert was allowed to say
opposing counsel asked the questions he

267
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:33,840
the pontiff occasion and then it was
time for cross-examination and in the

268
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,480
cross-examination he started taking a
look at this business of location

269
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:45,790
services and he presented the defense
attorney so they played his attorney

270
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:49,740
who's suing the insurance company
presented an exhibit that showed the

271
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:56,020
location services table and all the time
stamps on it now mister expert can you

272
00:27:56,020 --> 00:28:04,090
tell me what the date of the loss was
and can you tell me in light of your

273
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:08,760
opinion that location services was
disabled before the loss and never

274
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:15,830
reactivated how it is that the table
looks like this how does this get

275
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:21,850
updated well when text location services
and say that the table there you can see

276
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:22,310
it

277
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:27,110
ok fine now how many of them are after
the date of the loss can you count them

278
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:30,750
for us we can wait

279
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:35,669
that would be more than 0

280
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:43,370
so riddle me this Batman how is it that
we have these dates in here

281
00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:52,990
well I guess location services had to be
reacted location services had to be

282
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:59,669
reactivated after the time of loss so in
fact your first opinion here would be

283
00:28:59,669 --> 00:29:02,669
wrong is that correct so I try to stand
that correctly

284
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:19,669
yeah okay and he would make his day
you've also said selectively deleted the

285
00:29:19,669 --> 00:29:25,779
data could you explain to me that you
use to establish what the data had been

286
00:29:25,779 --> 00:29:35,080
selectively deleted and then what is the
significance of that well you'll notice

287
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:43,049
the gaps in the photos exist where we've
got the old photoset stops before the

288
00:29:43,049 --> 00:29:48,799
loss and then there's some photo to
continue after the loss so there were

289
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:53,129
five photos taken in this period of time
between these these these two dates for

290
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:53,980
days apart

291
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:54,950
yes

292
00:29:54,950 --> 00:30:03,919
and which date were those taken on or I
don't know who's between four days the

293
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:08,510
fire lasted for five hours and you're
saying that out of the out of the whole

294
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:11,919
thing with the significance is that it
might have been the five hours where

295
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:16,799
there's a fire is that right yeah ok now
did you look at the rest of all the

296
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:21,418
photos in here see the sequence there
was no alright well let me show you

297
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:28,399
exhibit so we show the entire list all
photos by number how many do we have as

298
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:31,870
part of the series how many are skipped
before the next series continues and so

299
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,459
on

300
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:38,279
would you say that this period they're
looking at is consistent with the rest

301
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:43,460
of the use of this phone over a period
of eight months that's consistent so

302
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:49,440
what is the significance of your
conclusion that these photos were

303
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,500
deleted when they were taken at this
period of time I guess it doesn't have

304
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,330
any significance

305
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:01,350
so anyone can make a mistake and anyone
can say something that has no

306
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:08,620
significance I understand what about
this encrypted backup if you see an

307
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:15,600
encrypted backup know any evidence that
encrypted backup actually exists no in

308
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:26,490
fact the probative value of this would
be nothing no further questions that

309
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:39,140
sounds great presentation but I gotta
tell you it is painful to watch but it's

310
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:42,200
really rough to watch somebody go
through that especially when I'm the one

311
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:50,100
drink in the screws down on him on the
other hand remember we don't matter so

312
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,159
much

313
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,620
who matters the woman's house burned
down

314
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:58,850
she headed insurance policy

315
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:07,639
and those knuckleheads use this to deny
payment so for the last year while this

316
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:14,500
litigation is going on she is living in
a motel 6 with her family that's who

317
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:18,330
matters in this thing and that's the
reason why as much as I hate to do it I

318
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:21,820
will turn the screws down when it is
necessary

319
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:31,649
don't do that any questions on that
would make good tampering obstruction

320
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:41,260
and false alibi in this case we had a
criminal case very very high profile

321
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:49,620
criminal case we had an elected official
holding a press conference we are going

322
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:57,350
to put this guy away for twenty years
why because we know that he was involved

323
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:00,610
in the cover-up of this crime

324
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:07,719
we don't have any evidence directly
showing that he was doing any cover-up

325
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:14,380
but it is necessary to know that over
two-thirds of the unallocated clusters

326
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:33,510
contain the hexadecimal value 00 the
forensic report says decibel 0000

327
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:43,390
encrypted so what does this in an
interview transcript we see one of the

328
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:48,870
investigators getting a little flustered
well we can't get anything that he's

329
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:57,699
touched has been white with the globe
elsewhere in one of the reports we see

330
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,350
the contents of

331
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:07,830
were not consistent with wiping at least
a third of you raise your hands when we

332
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:14,279
were asking who's involved the analysis
of data for this purpose can anybody

333
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:18,010
tell me in a nutshell what the test that
we would apply

334
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:28,460
to data to establish whether the
unallocated clusters had been wiped was

335
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:42,260
to test for that might it be possible 00
as interesting as a Mac you know what

336
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:46,240
happens on a Mac or any PSP system for
that matter

337
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,610
computer

338
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:57,690
if you use our aim with the dash capital
P on it they get it right zeros

339
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:02,009
but not at first

340
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:09,750
rights FFS and then it writes 00 and
then it right Steph and that's the state

341
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:14,850
that leaves it in anybody know

342
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:22,400
what happens if you use the the trash on
the Mac and do the secure delete that

343
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:28,030
way what what what what what what
remains of the clusters their leaves

344
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,440
behind 00

345
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:41,010
decimal 00 no less and now for the
kicker if you get a new hard drive and

346
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:49,170
you never ever write something to it you
know what's there there there

347
00:35:49,170 --> 00:36:01,650
hexadecimal 00 that death you tell me
the fact that over two-thirds of the

348
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:08,390
disc unallocated clusters contain the
hexadecimal value 00 what difference

349
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:09,730
does that make

350
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:28,910
0 hexadecimal now let's revisit the
situation we have a guy who is being

351
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:33,920
tried in the press because we got an
elected official standing up in front of

352
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:39,310
the world and the whole world is
watching this case songs are being

353
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:46,940
written about this case the TV is on and
on about the case with Rolling Stone

354
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:53,700
everybody's going on about this case
worker to put this guy away for twenty

355
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:57,220
years what evidence do we have that he
did any of the stuff that covered up

356
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:00,029
nothing but how do we know they did it

357
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:05,360
two-thirds of that allocated spaces
hexadecimal 00 were gonna put them away

358
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,360
for twenty years because of that

359
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:16,370
sounds good to me this is a problem I'm
not okay with that

360
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:23,410
nevertheless this is the kind of thing
that can happen now does this mean that

361
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:33,080
the analyst is Ryan too far with the
data the analyst said only this another

362
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:36,069
analyst actually said this about the
unallocated clustered not consistent

363
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:42,460
with wiping but it is the prosecutor who
read that and use it for foundation for

364
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:48,260
what she wanted to see and was prepared
to tell that to a jury until I got my

365
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:58,000
report and then things got ugly long and
short of it is rather than trying the

366
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,450
case on the data are supposed to pick a
jury he said your honor we would like to

367
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:06,839
drop the charge as long as all quit his
job

368
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:14,510
he'd been on administrative leave a year
and a half to go back to that job he

369
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:19,120
doesn't have to plead guilty to anything
to give any licensee known and just

370
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:27,770
don't go back to that place okay twenty
years so that not good

371
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,040
alright last what real quick

372
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:38,630
we're building up to a crescendo here

373
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:44,529
once upon a time there were naughty

374
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:53,440
you could procure naughty bits
file-sharing networks the standard for

375
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:59,660
being convicted of child pornography of
your possessing a disturbing as you have

376
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:03,980
to do it knowingly with any criminal act
you must know what it is that you're

377
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:09,930
doing so you get something like this the
question becomes re we've got some

378
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:13,700
naughty bits on a computer here how do
we know that this was done

379
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:20,540
knowing what we have is a report that
came from investigator poking around out

380
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:26,759
there in a big scary internet big scary
internet says well we got some naughty

381
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:31,820
bits over here they go and they serve
warrants on the phone company phone

382
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:37,940
companies as well as where he lives so
because computer guys are scary they

383
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:45,060
come beat the door down before dawn they
grabbed the computer and they resent the

384
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,700
files in evidence

385
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:53,049
well we need to establish this guy knew
what he was doing how do we do that

386
00:39:53,050 --> 00:40:00,020
let's look for the terms that we have
here

387
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:08,730
underage underage underage must be
searching for underage and upon that

388
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:14,070
foundation they go forward this guy's
gonna have to register as a sex offender

389
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:18,350
for thirty years because he's got
pictures of somebody underage

390
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:28,118
now it comes to us take a look at what's
going on here I want to complete said is

391
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:31,890
I want to see everything I want to
understand what you're talking about hey

392
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:36,970
look at underage sure enough it's their
underage sure enough it's there and it's

393
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:41,080
there we do in fact have three files
assay underage in them isn't that

394
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:47,710
interesting however if we take a look at
the rest of the files we see the word

395
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:57,090
porn porn porn porn porn porn porn porn
you tell me is the search term are

396
00:40:57,090 --> 00:41:00,090
likely underage are more likely porn

397
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:18,019
in this case Perry County Ohio we've got
to explain to a jury there how

398
00:41:18,019 --> 00:41:21,019
peer-to-peer file sharing works

399
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:34,150
28 count felony indictment 10 get tossed
by the judge before trial starts we've

400
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:39,010
got another nine that we're dealing with
as the state's putting on its evidence

401
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:47,850
and then after that the judge has look
at some of the stuff and says you you

402
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:52,730
you you you have not met the threshold
here it's outta here now we're down to

403
00:41:52,730 --> 00:42:01,960
nine counts and there I am on the stand
using the state's own exhibit to apply

404
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:06,840
their own method to the complete set of
data instead of the small set that they

405
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:11,090
selected for themselves not guilty

406
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:18,940
I don't think I did it for this is a
computer that was in the middle of the

407
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:22,660
house the whole family lived there a
bunch of people would come over the

408
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:30,420
house regularly and in fact when we take
a look at the timestamps associated with

409
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:38,220
it all those downloads are at the same
time making the single session so what

410
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:44,410
we learn from all this when we are
putting together forensic evidence we

411
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:51,680
have to understand that it is imperative
for us to meet a proper standard for the

412
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:57,308
stuff to be used against somebody else
because the sixth amendment requires

413
00:42:57,309 --> 00:43:03,970
that the stuff get confronted and there
is exposure that we have individually as

414
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:09,118
analysts our careers literally can be
over anytime we get up on the stand

415
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:14,650
common mistakes and things that you can
watch out for when you're doing your own

416
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:19,569
work number one is not accounting for
the alternative theory you have actually

417
00:43:19,569 --> 00:43:23,940
thought about what else could explain
the data here and do we have a better

418
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:25,839
explanation

419
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:31,859
then you've not done your work your job
is not to listen to somebody else's idea

420
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:36,839
and then to go about proving it your
jobs develop a hypothesis and then what

421
00:43:36,839 --> 00:43:38,819
do you do next

422
00:43:38,819 --> 00:43:44,160
you develop knowledge hypotheses the
things that will disprove what your

423
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:50,828
hypothesis is a new test for that when
you have tried everything that you can

424
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:56,539
think of everything that the literature
articulates and that theory still holds

425
00:43:56,539 --> 00:44:03,519
then you've got something that you can
go with the next is not applying any

426
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:07,319
kind of a test not bothering to
articulate how you tell the difference

427
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:18,509
between X&Y selectively selection bias
you choose the files that you want you

428
00:44:18,509 --> 00:44:23,829
ignore everything else is cherry picking
the stuff and what happens when you're

429
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:29,279
looking for something you'll find it but
if you don't see all the other stuff

430
00:44:29,279 --> 00:44:35,369
you're blind and as a consequence you
wind up getting confirmation bias to

431
00:44:35,369 --> 00:44:42,430
play into it and I just knew it I just
knew he was a naughty boy and ultimately

432
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:45,430
that sloppy work

433
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:51,649
in that trial in Perry County the
defense attorney made me answer the

434
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:59,320
question when talking about the state's
experts was this confirmation bias was

435
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:09,880
the selection bias or was this just
careless I like the guys on the other

436
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,000
side of this thing

437
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:16,460
professional working relationship advice
they screwed up but they're good guys

438
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:23,430
well as careless I'm sorry I couldn't
hear you Mr Curtin could you say that

439
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:25,019
again

440
00:45:25,019 --> 00:45:35,189
no joke careless not guilty that's all
that stuff happens so as you were going

441
00:45:35,189 --> 00:45:41,689
about the process always remember
important always remember your role in

442
00:45:41,689 --> 00:45:47,848
this process never forget the stakes
apply these five lessons from seeing

443
00:45:47,849 --> 00:45:51,739
these mistakes and you should be able to
do well thank you
