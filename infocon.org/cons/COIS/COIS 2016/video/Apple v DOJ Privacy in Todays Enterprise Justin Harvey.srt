1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,339
on on cybersecurity but what makes me
really nervous is like standing in front

2
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:11,790
of my peers trying to talk to you guys
about stuff we already know about so

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:18,288
forgive me if my voice is a little is a
little shaky I guess let's start off

4
00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:23,920
with an icebreaker here right so I made
this joke last week for my four-year-old

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,019
son and I want to try it out on you guys
we're seeing is utopia so what do you

6
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:40,620
call a sheep that the cop anyone sheet
that the cup of police officer at work I

7
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:47,870
mean I worked for my four-year-old so so
I'm Justin hardy I've been doing cyber

8
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:52,629
security for 22 years I got started in
1994 when I worked for the first

9
00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:59,039
national ISP and if you remember company
called netcom anyone anyone there you go

10
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:06,310
old old ISP they get gave out UNIX shell
accounts back and center was for 13 days

11
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:13,530
and had a like a little slip PPP product
they had for Windows and one day this

12
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,140
japanese guy came in and said you guys
have been owned course he didn't say oh

13
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:22,119
and that's like what the last 10 years
that we've figured out what underpins

14
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:27,890
means and he's like this guy came in
I've been tracking them seem credit card

15
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:32,189
from you guys we had to put up the first
firewalls that way before Cisco you had

16
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:37,309
a fire also like 94 livingstone firewall
he goes remember though the Livingston

17
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:42,829
company will that guy turned out to be
tsutomo shimumora the guy who hacked our

18
00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:47,779
company was kevin mitnick so that's
really how and why I got into security

19
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:53,250
and since then I worked big breaches
like Sony in 2011 my team was on the

20
00:01:53,250 --> 00:02:00,159
ground that Sony Playstation they want
done in to respond to mainland China I'm

21
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,380
probably the only American ever do set
foot on China doing actual incident

22
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,770
response was out there for a couple of
months

23
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:14,069
and so what I want to talk to you today
about is the Apple vs DOD case and just

24
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:20,299
seems like every day we hear new stuff
happening and kind of how it affects us

25
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:27,110
in the commercial world so in in the
ordering of events you know first off I

26
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:31,769
did say that a lot of this is is my
opinion so it's not that it's not

27
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:38,360
necessarily shared by the company said
Ellis we make network analytic security

28
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,780
products have an endpoint product that
does detector response in the end point

29
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:48,230
we have a consulting team but response
to breaches so the first thing here is

30
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:56,560
my labor work or the the thing that not
ever lose sight of his number one

31
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,670
fourteen people died in a lot of people
were injured so my heart I think all of

32
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:07,869
our hearts go out to the victims of this
senseless domestic crime and this guy

33
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:14,489
and his wife murdered all of these
people and he had a work iPhone in

34
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:23,290
January 2016 the FBI requested the
iCloud password to be changed and this

35
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:30,858
is really what created what started the
big who + so just an informal poll just

36
00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:38,040
an informal poll who here is an Apple
user or I iPhone Wow jeans I'd say I'm

37
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:43,290
wrong but that's like 80% 85% maybe
eighty six and a half percent

38
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:50,390
and when you when you change your iCloud
password you gotta do it in two places

39
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,760
right you gotta

40
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,350
if you do on the web you get a change it
on the web and then you go to go to your

41
00:03:55,350 --> 00:04:01,530
device and change it on your phone and
when you change your iCloud password in

42
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:06,660
this manner meeting on the web or Apple
did it it created this problem so that

43
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:14,640
Saeed Farooq's iPhone couldn't have been
backed up right because when you it will

44
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,950
automatically back up to the cloud by
default if you have a power source and

45
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:25,440
you're connected to a trusted wifi so if
if the FBI had not requested that of

46
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,050
Apple we probably still couldn't plug in
his phone he could have taken it to the

47
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:35,140
what was cited for employers San
Bernardino County of mental health right

48
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:39,830
with the health department so they maybe
I could have just taken in his phone and

49
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:43,380
plug it in and it was an older phone it
was a five see so there was no

50
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:52,159
fingerprints so you couldn't take his
corpse and put his thumb on the on the

51
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,200
unlock because it was an older from the
feisty doesn't have it so they created

52
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:02,710
this problem and they realize that the
last iCloud backup with six weeks old so

53
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:06,780
before the attacks or six weeks ago he
backed up you must be in the office and

54
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:11,309
backed up and then nothing happened
between them so the FBI naturally wants

55
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:15,970
and I believe they are correct in their
investigation procedures they need to

56
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:24,060
unlock that phone and see that six-week
period I part of my role at Fidelis is

57
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,880
also to work with the media which I do
about 90% the time and I we all know

58
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,280
this I think I hope all of you know this
but the media kept asking me like I got

59
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,400
it received increased three weeks ago
from political there like what the FBI

60
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,568
hope to gain in a six-week period am i
mean

61
00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:47,059
you never know who he's who's texting
who he's i messaging who he's doing any

62
00:05:47,059 --> 00:05:53,709
of this to and political came back with
wall what the carrier args what about he

63
00:05:53,709 --> 00:05:58,339
was probably with Verizon Sprint or AT&T
right for the most part what about their

64
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:01,830
Kerry likes kids they collect many data
they collect who you're calling they

65
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:06,568
collect SMS numbers they don't know the
content percent maybe they do

66
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:12,719
SMS is not encrypted or maybe Apple
could have said that I message recipient

67
00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:17,029
was this e-mail address or this or this
phone number but they want to see the

68
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:21,839
content they just don't want to see the
metadata around the transaction may also

69
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:28,050
want to see if Saeed was downloading
something like Skype or whatsapp

70
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:33,419
something that that the carrier really
wouldn't have disability into and in

71
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:39,430
that respect so I believe they had
absolutely Cinemark West comey told the

72
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:45,830
senate and 2009 we're still trying to
unlock yet and they started to go to

73
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,800
Apple and ask them for help

74
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:53,789
also in February a couple more things
happened once it became public that the

75
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:56,438
FBI requested Apple unlock it

76
00:06:56,439 --> 00:07:05,059
the there is a big public outcry just do
this one found just unlocked this and

77
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:09,089
the government will go away right just a
terrorism case well the fact of the

78
00:07:09,089 --> 00:07:14,009
matter is had Apple unlocked at the new
york district attorney and a state

79
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:18,289
attorney had over a hundred and
seventy-five iPhones ready to go

80
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:24,808
ready to subpoena Apple thing used that
same tool that you made to unlock it and

81
00:07:24,809 --> 00:07:32,860
I believe the next speaker's ahead and
Christopher great lawyers and attorneys

82
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:37,459
are going to be there in this room or in
another room I highly recommend you go

83
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:40,849
there to hear about this but they're
going to talk about the All Rights Act

84
00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:46,060
of 1789 which was which is really darn
cold

85
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:52,860
two hundred and twenty or thirty years
old that said the government can compel

86
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:58,950
individuals or organizations to comply
or assist them in a time of need an

87
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:05,639
investigation or situations so without
that the the government had no right and

88
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:11,070
no legal ability to ask Apple perform
some development now what's one thing

89
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:15,520
that to subpoena a vendor and saying
push this button we know you have the

90
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,740
capability today

91
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:21,060
unlock this phone or change this
password for instance that's easy or

92
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:26,540
hand over documents that you have is not
easy to say develop sit down with your

93
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:33,339
developers and spend year on resources
to develop what i do to be a weapon and

94
00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:37,919
I'll get more to that and then hours
before the scheduled court appearance

95
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:44,360
this last Monday it was funny right but
30th or was it happened around the 21st

96
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:51,680
it was Monday right so hours before the
scheduled court appearance FBI postpone

97
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:59,089
the hearing in this Monday the same day
that Apple released 93 they said they

98
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:05,320
drop the case so I'm gonna get my next
flight ok sorry this is this is another

99
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,660
reason it makes me nervous is like I can
belt out and talk for probably 24 hours

100
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:13,120
on my normal routine you wanna hear
about incident response and all the

101
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,920
stuff what we're saying and how to
combat advanced threat defense but this

102
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,160
is makes me nervous to the content I
don't normally do so I'm a little bit

103
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,890
shooting from the hip but to analyze a
few of these things i wanna if there's a

104
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:34,790
little bit of advice I want to give you
today to use this as a as an example if

105
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:39,040
anyone has an iPhone today and you're
not using multi-factor authentication

106
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:46,230
highly recommended and if you're as well
if you are backing up to the iCloud for

107
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:49,370
convenience I recommend not doing that
as well

108
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:55,060
and I'll tell you I'll show you why so
this exact thing the FBI request the

109
00:09:55,060 --> 00:10:00,750
iCloud password when you are in
possession of someone's iCloud password

110
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:06,550
and they back up to the cloud which is
both default ok not having a password

111
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:10,219
but clear text password or just a normal
password not using multi-factor

112
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:14,540
authentication which Apple supports you
can do things like this and this is

113
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:20,469
exactly what the FBI did there is a
Python script called I loot and when you

114
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:27,700
run by loon to you supply and iCloud
username and password and it goes out

115
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,510
and programmatically uses

116
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:37,939
iCloud CPI to active you and it lists
all of the devices that you have this is

117
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:44,670
not me by the way so don't think that I
own a 3G yes you select the device and

118
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:49,900
then it goes out and normally when you I
didn't think it was possible I kinda

119
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:56,250
understand how it how they do this what
they do is to impersonate you and an

120
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:03,470
apple gives you the ability to any
programmers in the room one dude come on

121
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:07,600
there's gotta be some other people have
a right to in programming this there's a

122
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,720
function called and says go to this part
of the files so if you've got a eight

123
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,240
gig file you know that something is in
the middle you can say seek to the

124
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,920
middle of the file so what Apple does is
they give you the capability to keep

125
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,969
certain parts of your huge backup I mean
if you get a hundred twenty eight gig

126
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:29,560
and you're uploading photos and stuff
your backup is pretty huge so what

127
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:36,410
they're able to do this script can do is
say go like what you have and then you

128
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:42,560
can download someone to address book SMS
and photos and it's worrisome for us as

129
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,339
consumers not using multi-factor if we
use multi-factor he whoever had your

130
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:48,510
password when people do

131
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:52,390
this is they wouldn't have the
capability to put in the code it's also

132
00:11:52,390 --> 00:12:00,260
worrisome to extend that and I should
have told you this in the beginning I'm

133
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:07,510
a bit of a 10 40 hat where but I think I
think it's justified given a lot of the

134
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:13,500
stuff and I'll go over why I think some
of this is warranted but the reason why

135
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:19,640
this is doable because people back into
the cloud to be they're not using

136
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:24,240
multi-factor authentication see i think
thats create the condition where

137
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:32,630
combined with the Apple's refusal and
I'm gonna have to say this Google and

138
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:36,250
other providers have stood behind Apple
said you know we're not gonna I'm not

139
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:42,830
devices but hoping entrust them Google
Microsoft those guys that if vendors

140
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:48,960
won't unlock phones and if the
encryption and if they don't outlaw

141
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:53,740
strong encryption which I'll get to that
it creates a condition where the

142
00:12:53,740 --> 00:13:01,690
government in order to order to run drug
cases anti-terror cases or whatever are

143
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:06,810
gonna start developing malware to attack
citizens and attention to grab their

144
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:10,239
passwords and do things like this that
they can't get your SMS or criminal or

145
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,950
suspected criminals text history they're
gonna figure out a way to do it and you

146
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:19,490
think I'm a 10 40 where we'll go Google
a company called the hacking team the

147
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:26,980
hacking team was Italy Italian based
firm that did for profit hacking they

148
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:32,630
develop malware for nation state they
themselves got hacked by an Eastern

149
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:37,540
European crime syndicate and all of
their malware got released but they also

150
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:41,430
released purchase orders and guess who
was guess who two of those entities that

151
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:46,479
were purchasing now where we're partners
Justice Federal Bureau of Investigation

152
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,710
and the NSA why are they doing that well
the FBI according to the press if they

153
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:55,900
were doing it because there are other
malware as a backup to the other malware

154
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:03,370
why is this not front-page news why is
this not so do we have a right to

155
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:06,850
privacy hope there are no lawyers in
their room because I'm gonna use a

156
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:13,390
Slashdot / ready term I and what does
that stand for I am NOT a lawyer think

157
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,080
users and get some here

158
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:22,330
personal statement I believe that it is
an inalienable human right to have a

159
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:27,960
private conversation but digitally and
in the real world unfortunately our

160
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:33,130
current current unfortunately our
Constitution doesn't specifically allow

161
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:39,020
for that this is the the amendment to
the constitution before that says that

162
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:44,640
we can be secure in their persons houses
papers and effects now this is several

163
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:51,140
hundred years old toy right but so it
doesn't say digital communication and

164
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:57,900
says papers and effects so that leaves a
little bit there against unreasonable

165
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:03,380
searches and seizures and I'll come back
to that in a sec and this is Bradley

166
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:10,810
being interpreted two different ways the
first is the one that I support which is

167
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,880
humans have a fundamental right to
privacy

168
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:20,320
affected one is what is being taken by
the government spying that allowed when

169
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,010
there's a probable cause and judiciary
oversight the check-and-balance to this

170
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:31,060
through the legislative branch but this
guy changed at all now personal

171
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,319
statement here

172
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:39,670
number one I don't agree with what he
did the method I in your little homework

173
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:45,310
thing right and giving his homework go
out and watch the movie citizen for very

174
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:49,640
good in one scene citizen for not enough
of you

175
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,220
125 people 67 come on

176
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:57,000
please I implore you watch the movie
citizen for because it start issues you

177
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:05,130
from start to finish the release of the
top secret files of snow it's an actual

178
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:09,640
factual account so it shows the camera
starts rolling

179
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:15,650
well first off I can spoil it we all
know what happens behind but essentially

180
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:20,360
showed you the build up all of the
congressional testimony people like an

181
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,050
associate director saying we're not in
front of Congress were not collecting

182
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,449
metadata we're not doing that
surveillance we're not doing all of

183
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:30,890
these things then you go to snow D
flights to Hong Kong gives all the doc

184
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:34,670
the top secret documents to Glenn
Greenwald the Guardian shows all the

185
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:39,490
Guardian guys my friend Julian border at
The Guardian is in possession of all

186
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:47,120
those but the point is he he he promised
he made a note he swore to uphold the

187
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:53,240
Constitution and to keep things secret
and so he broke his word and it's it's

188
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:58,390
the situation where he did something
really horrible but he also expose

189
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:03,270
something horrible as well so it's like
in my mind I'm compartmentalize things

190
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:09,400
i'm saying yeah the guy and he should
have done this but what he did disclose

191
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,550
cannot be ignored

192
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:19,300
right I guess one more but now it's
there can be arguments made on both

193
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:25,889
sides on whether or not people's lives
were at risk I think that one way to

194
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:30,100
look at would have been if he would have
been may be justifiable people would

195
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:34,300
have been dying because of this but
Americans like what if it was to expose

196
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:40,090
murders or torture or something like
that but on the other hand what he did

197
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:43,679
also probably could have put soldiers
lives and dangers but then again there's

198
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:49,330
also the drone strikes that he was he
was talking about how it was operating

199
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:58,250
so on so but what he changed was I think
before snow I I was very much

200
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:03,879
a trusting government never been there
been too trusting of members and open to

201
00:18:03,879 --> 00:18:08,198
things in my life that it really just
resonated with me that changed my view

202
00:18:08,199 --> 00:18:13,459
the first thing is the Iraq war when we
didn't find weapons of mass destruction

203
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:19,349
that made me really mad and the second
thing was when the government the NSA

204
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:24,859
was testifying said we're not doing
these things and then they were and it

205
00:18:24,859 --> 00:18:30,399
wasn't just it wasn't just yeah we're
collecting metadata defined threats it

206
00:18:30,399 --> 00:18:34,899
was were collecting meditated and did
you know about all these abuses people

207
00:18:34,899 --> 00:18:39,069
like anything co-workers were spying on
their spouses or spouse spying on their

208
00:18:39,069 --> 00:18:43,609
neighbors and pulling their phone
records looking at their messages in

209
00:18:43,609 --> 00:18:50,859
their tax and i know im gonna bungle
this but the the the quote that I love

210
00:18:50,859 --> 00:18:58,908
is its by the barren and time from
England it was go something like this

211
00:18:58,909 --> 00:19:04,869
you know power power corrupts but
absolute power corrupts absolutely right

212
00:19:04,869 --> 00:19:09,569
and that is as politicians and as
governments get bigger you can't trust

213
00:19:09,569 --> 00:19:13,589
them to compartmentalize what what they
have access to but the more and more

214
00:19:13,589 --> 00:19:19,359
they have access to and and and and in
essence the government or the anything

215
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:25,499
had followed this power there were quite
a few abuses so he changed a lot of our

216
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:30,179
perception because I'm not sure that I
would have really had a problem with

217
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:34,019
apple and locking up a bit like that
people are deal breaking stuff is

218
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:37,749
happening so how about you do that and
I'm here

219
00:19:37,749 --> 00:19:46,259
ok the things that I would say is I my
personal opinion is Apple do the right

220
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:50,779
thing I think they did the right thing
because it's not that I didn't believe

221
00:19:50,779 --> 00:19:53,779
that the San Bernardino Bernardino
attackers

222
00:19:55,430 --> 00:20:01,970
didn't deserve the truth or what could
be another six weeks I felt like Apple

223
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:07,740
would be developing a weapon they would
be developing a weapon because if they

224
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:14,310
were to develop a code to unlock any
firm but then what happened to that code

225
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:17,990
they can then be subpoenaed by the
government that can be taken by the

226
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:22,110
government or they could give it to the
government and then you've essentially

227
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:27,540
created this weapon that is into hands
at an Apple fans and send the the

228
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:34,850
government's hands and and you at this
point it's still kinda be like ok I'm

229
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:40,290
kind of with you but then when you see
things like opium or the Joint Chiefs

230
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:45,659
emails being fished and secrets going
out the door if we can't keep our own

231
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:50,450
top-secret files top-secret instead of
getting a nation states hands what

232
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:54,700
possible hope that we have for not
letting this thing

233
00:20:54,700 --> 00:21:00,700
escape because even if it escapes there
will be lives in our customers and our

234
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:05,930
livelihood in danger because there's
already documented cases where

235
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:09,880
executives will go to another nation
state to negotiate a merger and

236
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,850
acquisition to do a business deal and
the chinese will grab their phones and

237
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:18,699
laptops in customs and they'll pick them
into a back room and not come out what

238
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:23,210
happened they were probably imaging and
shame on anyone who goes to a different

239
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:30,000
country doesn't use a burn laptop or a
or heavily encrypted devices small

240
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,660
personal care if you type in Fidelis
welcome to the jungle I do a whole

241
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:39,930
webinar on this talks about operational
security there is cases of executives

242
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:44,490
going over to that wasn't homework that
would be really self-serving but if you

243
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:45,210
want to

244
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:54,149
there's cases of executives going to
other countries and their their hotel

245
00:21:54,149 --> 00:21:58,889
rooms were bugged my hotel room was
bugged when I was working the breach for

246
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:05,260
42 months in Shenzhen China the phones
were bugs so there's if this is out and

247
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:09,549
of course every nation state on earth
would want this here is a piece of

248
00:22:09,549 --> 00:22:13,139
homework go out and rent a movie called
me

249
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:22,470
sneakers and sneakers is filled with
Robert Redford and Ben Kingsley and I'll

250
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:26,399
boil it down for you essentially Ben
Kingsley invents this magical box that

251
00:22:26,399 --> 00:22:32,070
can decrypt anything right they plug
into the modem in a double doj they can

252
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:38,210
see everything they dial the FAA and
they can see and then there's openings

253
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:47,159
flying around over phoenix was in there
too and the quote that I love in there

254
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:52,649
there's two quotes in that is number one
no government on earth would ever

255
00:22:52,649 --> 00:22:57,309
government on earth would kill for this
capability and that box that he made is

256
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:03,510
the same as that unlocking iPhone if
Apple were to develop that the second

257
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:09,140
thing is that the Kings equipment
arrived for quote thanks Ben Kingsley

258
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:15,870
said the battlefield today the way they
that nation states are running battles

259
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:22,850
its 2011 that's not with a gun anymore
so we have to really make sure that

260
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:28,020
there are no back doors and whatever we
do because we can't trust me it's like a

261
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:32,639
mathematical fact we can't trust that
whatever backdoor whatever we create

262
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:38,190
will not fall into enemy hands and we
there's a long pressing that this let's

263
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:44,550
look at the past few breaches target and
Home Depot 10 p.m. and Sony and

264
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:49,300
all of these big companies they spend
tens if not hundreds of millions of

265
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:55,730
dollars and they still get hit they
still get hit by that one guy or gal who

266
00:23:55,730 --> 00:24:02,780
clicks on the FedEx rewrote package
phishing email and then there is right

267
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:12,110
and this has created this sort of
juxtaposition between spying for

268
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:21,030
legitimate to to find the thread and
spying on on the citizens is really a

269
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:27,270
macro version of what I feel like we're
struggling with in in the industry

270
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:37,379
full disclosure I work for services and
product company and we make products

271
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:43,420
that do surveillance on the network but
then again satisfy arises lol so it is

272
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:47,750
cisco and sort of all the beating so I'm
not saying it were unique I'm saying

273
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:55,410
that as vendors we're running we are in
a in a pickle right now if my PR team

274
00:24:55,410 --> 00:25:00,850
were here they'd kick my butt if I am
going to open this up a little bit they

275
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:06,949
kick my butt because there was a case
where currently going through some of

276
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:14,210
this right now in california the
University of California went through a

277
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:22,070
bunch of breaches with nation states and
Berkeley who do you know who the

278
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:29,409
University of California Chancellor is
trivia question anyone Janet Napolitano

279
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:31,100
Sochi

280
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:35,789
she understands how serious it can be
when when information gets out and

281
00:25:35,789 --> 00:25:39,770
universities are a treasure trove for
nation states because of things like

282
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:43,580
health care information and stats and
research so why should a nation state

283
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:50,649
develop their own capabilities in their
own people to perform research when they

284
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:54,549
can just get it from these universities
so the University California last year

285
00:25:54,549 --> 00:25:59,150
have agreed with public they brought us
in and we were collecting network

286
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:02,910
metadata on threats looking we weren't
decrypting the thing we weren't doing

287
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:07,039
all of these things that the government
is doing but we were still caught up in

288
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:12,570
a student backlash saying you guys are
conducting surveillance you guys meeting

289
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:18,720
university-california president's office
of the president and so it's kind of an

290
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,610
ongoing thing we're not we're not at
fault for not really were personally

291
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:26,418
involved cuz were brought in to find
nations to a threat or not we weren't

292
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:31,500
being brought into that but it's a it's
a really fine line I think we're running

293
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:38,210
and corporations today and I think this
as information security professionals

294
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:42,740
it's up to us to do a lot of Education I
guess I should have put that message at

295
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:47,760
the beginning of September to whether or
not you agree with me on any or all of

296
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:53,879
these subjects up to us to educate our
family and friends in the press and the

297
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,960
government and helped influence it I
don't know about you guys but in a

298
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:03,280
furious me to see congress people
talking about key escrow or 13 or hoping

299
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:09,000
that they can just tell Silicon Valley
to develop some new crap you know some

300
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,780
new software that'll fix all this there
it's a temp fix map you also can't fix

301
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:24,149
stupid but but I'm just really concerns
me that I was going to be a surprise but

302
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:29,030
it did it just concerns me that our
legislators don't get it you know

303
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:33,000
another piece of homework go watch if
you're if you're ok with obscenities

304
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,059
watch John Oliver's thing on DOJ vs
apple from a couple weeks it was pretty

305
00:27:37,059 --> 00:27:37,710
funny

306
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:43,669
and I do have a tremendous amount of
respect for the senator who said

307
00:27:43,669 --> 00:27:48,039
something to the effective if Apple
won't do it or can't do it they're

308
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:51,990
stupid and then he came back later on
after that he was educated actually

309
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:56,970
stood up and he didn't stand up one of
his subcommittee meetings he said I was

310
00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:05,419
wrong so I don't remember yes Republican
right I'm not a republican but I respect

311
00:28:05,419 --> 00:28:09,210
that guy for his views and and be able
to come out like him and say ok I was

312
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:17,090
wrong i mean that's a lot of 422 yeah
yeah yeah that's so it's up to us as an

313
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:21,428
industry to really educate people on as
the city's that could attract but we're

314
00:28:21,429 --> 00:28:28,330
not all executives here pretty telling
me I'm just talking head it's up to us

315
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:32,260
to educate I guess here is one of the
things is to educate the board in the

316
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:37,950
c-suite that it's not just a simple as
putting devices on its not as simple as

317
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:45,309
supporting or being against an issue
there's a lot more it's really

318
00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:49,850
complicated to be able to go to wade
through a lot of this and I feel like

319
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:59,699
the polls are are sweet in a direction
because it's so complicated that the

320
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,399
american people just aren't keeping up
with it like I looked at a Washington

321
00:29:03,399 --> 00:29:11,149
Post poll that was like 63 or 60%
sixty-seven percent of Americans said

322
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:14,850
that Apple should unlock the phone but
that's because they don't have all of

323
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:22,600
this extra information so what I think
in drawing a parallel between the

324
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:28,129
anything during wholesale surveillance
on the populace in collecting metadata

325
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:31,130
in and abusing that reverses

326
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:40,309
for the for the public explanation of
finding or monitoring for threats and

327
00:29:40,309 --> 00:29:45,110
and the microcosm of that which is in
our corporations what's the difference

328
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:50,760
between the NSA spying and because we we
essentially do that right I mean we put

329
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:55,889
these Palo Alto devices down health
devices misfire I devices and it does

330
00:29:55,889 --> 00:30:00,408
things and it sends information source
right orator log management orator

331
00:30:00,409 --> 00:30:06,470
dashboards and we look at it we can see
where people are browsing the I don't

332
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:14,179
have any answers for you but what I will
say is I personally think it comes down

333
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:21,750
to communicating what is going on to
your boys and it comes down to

334
00:30:23,049 --> 00:30:28,668
and and I haven't seen this very very
often when you join a company saying or

335
00:30:28,669 --> 00:30:32,720
you go to school you find all these
documents and we don't read half of them

336
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:39,679
but i dont the fine print like those
apps that have always been termed the

337
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,850
terms of agreement like us

338
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:48,690
but it it's critical to be transparent
and clearly communicate to the employee

339
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:56,850
that if you are on the corporate network
then you will be subject to two

340
00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:01,909
surveillance and surveillance is a dirty
word thats word right I don't know if

341
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:05,700
I'm not politically correct but if I
were to see so I'd probably say

342
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:10,320
something like monitoring for threats vs
surveillance but let's call a spade a

343
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:16,030
spade acceptable use policies and really
clearly defined the usage of personal

344
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:22,030
versus corporate assets and think
through the the the mess that the San

345
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:26,040
Bernardino County Health can send
Bernardino County Health Department must

346
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:30,470
be going through with a lot of this I
mean it wasn't their device that he had

347
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:36,610
and that that is embroiled in all of
this and maybe it sheds new light on

348
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:42,939
BYOD as an old school security guy I
hate DoD int but I know I know it's

349
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:54,740
necessary but but you know my my two
senses don't ever allow personal devices

350
00:31:54,740 --> 00:32:00,290
but that also an Energex some problems
MDM mobile device management there's a

351
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:03,960
couple of them like iron watching
MobileIron and we're recruiting as

352
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:12,030
quagmire by doing bio BYOD because on
one hand the lazy way I should be doing

353
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:18,450
this room hates the in the the the less
risk more risky way is to do BYOD you

354
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:23,250
are you sign a document say ok now
testing can bring his iPad to work in

355
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:27,840
use it to do work you can use Outlook
and he can join the protected wifi right

356
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:33,260
without doing anything that's really the
the most risky way because then you have

357
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:38,870
to trust that whoever brings their iPad
or their Fire tablet or their laptop

358
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:43,899
that it is properly secured they're not
doing some crazy things like I don't

359
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:48,690
know it doesn't have like four digit
passcode with no 10 attempt white things

360
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:49,660
like that

361
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:56,220
and then of course you the next level
are at the top level that is BYOD but

362
00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:03,620
you gotta sign something and we're going
to learn why I was so tired MobileIron

363
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:09,530
and air watch so that you if the company
can monitor that device but then that I

364
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:14,350
think we're going to start seeing more
legal cases of companies abusing that

365
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:21,379
and it's your personal rabbis and those
MDM can be really sneaky peek can record

366
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:26,860
all the URL to go to so what if your
employee you love your iPad you want to

367
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:30,149
use it in meetings because everyone's
schedules meetings and you're in there

368
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:35,150
and you can play Angry Birds what people
are talking and you have your little by

369
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:39,900
little innocuous MobileIron icon there
and MobileIron is great because you can

370
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:43,400
do things like I did ministration
provision your email account just like

371
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,240
that on your device you don't even have
to know the exchange or any of that

372
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:56,610
stuff but what did you go home and new
Browns pornography near into certain

373
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:59,590
things and you're going to those sites

374
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:04,590
well what happens when the administrator
looks at your browser history or look at

375
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:09,909
some of that information and exposes it
or the company uses it against you that

376
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:12,909
you have an illness there this sort of
juxtaposition

377
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:19,050
i think im just waiting on this to
happen and when it hits the court it's

378
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:23,220
going to be really a difficult case to
try because it's a personal device in

379
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:26,310
the personal house but he got your MDM
on there

380
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:38,330
and and forget the USS first SEC did you
guys know and Europe that you have to

381
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:43,889
get special privileges to do incident
response on an endpoint like you have to

382
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:47,770
there's a little asterisks all companies
are all countries are different right

383
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:56,580
but the the strict one like Germany and
Luxembourg Brussels boy they will kick

384
00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:00,540
your butt if you're an instant responder
and you can't even really do

385
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:05,080
threat scanning on these endpoints you
you really have to get the employees

386
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:09,500
permission to do something proactive at
the stuff does hit the fan you can do I

387
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:18,930
R but the lot there's a lot there's a
lot more employee privacy rights and by

388
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:23,580
the way my just speaking to an audience
anyone to international business

389
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:28,810
anyone couple people could write a few
there's a thing called the GDP art I

390
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:32,570
think the UN should have this to GDP R
stands for general data protection

391
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:38,310
regulation it's this new European Union
thing that says companies have to tell

392
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:44,080
their to inform the public what they
collect what is considered private how

393
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:48,380
they can use it how they can analyze and
and then all of the citizens of Europe

394
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:53,360
had the right to be forgotten so they
can say Google forget about me and

395
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:57,990
Google will erase you from from search
histories that there's a little bit of a

396
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:03,220
crappy that's what the going back and
forth as you you can essentially use it

397
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:07,120
to abuse it to take out search results
were your less than favor in news but

398
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:12,670
that's a different and you know that the
us- doesn't have any of those laws we

399
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,300
don't

400
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:19,570
we don't have any law that characterized
what is considered private data I i

401
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:25,730
testified in front of senate on data
brokers in November and these big data

402
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:30,770
brokers like axiom and experience and
all these others we had no idea what

403
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:34,380
they have on it they they have what's
the next level up from terabytes

404
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:46,950
from that its 180 alright let's just say
they have a massive amount of data on

405
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:50,629
all of us think that we didn't even know
it's possible they that's a really big

406
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:57,450
data right when we call are you know are
five terror by Sports Club cluster big

407
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:57,859
data

408
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:02,640
yeah they operate on a totally different
skills such as Google and Facebook and I

409
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:08,279
kind of feel like the EU is way ahead of
us here in the states because they

410
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:15,460
actually classified what is what is
personal data but what is what's really

411
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:20,150
gonna be funny is you guys know this
term brags it who knows what brings it

412
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:27,670
means what exactly so if you doing very
smart check out the big brain on Brad

413
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:36,790
pulp fiction right ok just making sure
if Britain leave the EU that gonna leave

414
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:41,090
all of this in disarray for the United
Kingdom so if you're doing business over

415
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:47,290
there good luck it's gonna be an
interesting case I have no idea what I

416
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:52,200
meant by Romanian case involving a
messenger and we think here there was a

417
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,700
I think it was the law

418
00:37:55,700 --> 00:38:01,189
disk i/o remember this remaining I was
using instant messenger at the office

419
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:04,880
and they were legally able to spy on him

420
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:10,480
it was against company policy to use the
instant instant messenger and so the

421
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,730
company spied on him and saw him using
it in the suit thing you know have the

422
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:19,200
right to to spy on me even though I was
breaking the Acceptable Use Policy

423
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:25,519
actually lost so it's actually an
interesting victory but you know I guess

424
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:31,689
to to bring in around two to the topic
and which was privacy in today's

425
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:36,369
enterprise I guess hopefully you guys
are walking away a little more

426
00:38:36,369 --> 00:38:41,940
knowledgeable but also I hope that you
are you guys are able to understand it's

427
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:46,759
it's never as simple as we're going to
keep your private data private it's a

428
00:38:46,759 --> 00:38:53,089
deal with all of these devices with all
of this monitoring for threats in

429
00:38:53,089 --> 00:38:59,200
network here that there's quite a room
for abused and not only at the corporate

430
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,598
level but at at the macro level at the
government level and we're seeing that

431
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:12,430
today with the gym so with that opened
in cash and tell me what you guys think

432
00:39:13,069 --> 00:39:17,910
disagree with me something completely or
parking or different tell me any

433
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:21,629
questions or anyone want to make a
statement

434
00:39:23,869 --> 00:39:37,440
yes sir thank you thank you where I was
going with this is I don't ever wanna

435
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,940
hear the word key escrow or third-party
key ever because as soon as you have

436
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:45,089
that capability you guys know what I
mean by that right

437
00:39:45,089 --> 00:39:50,509
personae if talking in person behind
talking to my coach Guy back to its Mike

438
00:39:50,509 --> 00:39:56,750
Sherman runs our central division here
at the company if i'm having a private

439
00:39:56,750 --> 00:40:01,099
conversation with Mike if he gives me
his key I gave him my kids were having

440
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:06,760
complications two keys the third key
would be giving

441
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:11,240
you the government so I have to create a
third key to give to you so it in time

442
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,580
in the past you can go back and look at
our thirty

443
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:20,390
escora 13 and the problem with this and
the government trying to do this in the

444
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:25,370
nineties trivia question what was it
called clipper to ya like one clapper

445
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:28,370
talks about the clipper to thats funny
admiral clapper

446
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:43,140
he had clapper that intelligence
disarray but yeah so the IAEA DNI and

447
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:46,299
the problem with this is that you have
to trust the government they want the

448
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:51,130
view that third key and currently
congress and help feinstein said that

449
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:55,900
she was going to introduce this bill if
no one else did this would just simply

450
00:40:55,900 --> 00:41:01,110
weekend our our our security and it
would weaken it because just like the

451
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:05,800
weaponization the iPhone back door if
anyone were to get ahold of these

452
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,720
third-party keys that would essentially
mean they could like that box from

453
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:13,660
sneakers they can plug in the box and
see in encrypted traffic ticket CI

454
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:16,890
messages they could see all this stuff
so let's play it out

455
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:22,480
suppose feinstein gets her way and and
they're able to ram rod this through

456
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:28,070
congress to say all the major
manufacturers let's start there all the

457
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:31,050
major manufacturers Google Facebook
Microsoft anyone who makes the device

458
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:32,010
has to do

459
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:35,380
key escrow so

460
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:40,720
and by the way I'm gonna say this in the
smartest manner if they do it in a way

461
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,779
that they got the the Cyber Security
Information Sharing act through at the

462
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:47,560
end of the year which was kind of dirty
they put it into a big appropriations

463
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,730
bill to end of the year and it just
slipped through even though a lot of us

464
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:52,410
were lobbying against it

465
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:57,109
don't get me started on information
security cheering so if they get through

466
00:41:57,110 --> 00:42:00,990
then the biggies will have to comply
right Microsoft Apple all these people

467
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:06,189
will complain or start to give the
government their third party teens you

468
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:11,560
can kind of monitor and audit that but
what will happen is the terrorists

469
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,820
criminals

470
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:17,180
us cybersecurity professionals we're not
going to use iMessage anymore what are

471
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:22,859
we gonna use no not carrier pigeons
you're right we're gonna we're going to

472
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:30,790
use a third-party ad were gonna use
whatsapp and Skype and my daughter uses

473
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:31,950
it and I have a big problem

474
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:35,250
the two but I hate when things just
disappear you know why the kids you

475
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:43,730
think those pictures disappear yeah so
we're gonna go one level down we're

476
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:47,400
going to third party apps let's say
congress comes back again and says if

477
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:55,200
there's a threshold that began across
outlaw at any app developer would be

478
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,439
required to give a third party to be
government I think they're crossing a

479
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,090
line I think they're crossing a line
because that would be the first time in

480
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:07,380
history that a developer cannot develop
what they wanted his right now in the

481
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:14,420
you s right now I can sit down and I can
program the worst matter where in human

482
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:17,380
history i mean nothing I have a
capability probably don't let's just say

483
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:22,110
I did it could overwhelm a nuclear
reactor could crash finds you do

484
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:26,010
whatever as long as I didn't infect
anyone that I can have it safely on my

485
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:33,440
laptop but I didn't have my pictures of
something it with illegal but the minute

486
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:40,560
that congress says that for the third
partyies crew don't do it they have

487
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,870
introduced two problems number one is
its it impinges upon my freedom of

488
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:48,240
speech to be able to write whatever I
want whatever code I want and not have

489
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,180
to give any of it to the government

490
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:55,660
the second thing is it's unenforceable
because they can't what is the way that

491
00:43:55,660 --> 00:44:00,210
the government would audit this if they
want to ensure everyone is in compliance

492
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:07,660
yes right and what you gotta do the
carrier like some stuff into the network

493
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:11,640
news since we gotta go do survey of mass
surveillance again

494
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:17,670
under the purposes of auditing the
people are in compliance so those are

495
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:21,900
mine that's my things about the end in
plus it's mathematically there's no

496
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:27,309
mathematical model that will support
building a back door there's just not

497
00:44:27,309 --> 00:44:31,390
the problem is the government had that
has that back door there was one dude

498
00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:35,390
who posted an encryption algorithm that
said in order to decrypt something

499
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:40,078
personal person could communicate but in
order to decrypt that communication

500
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:43,789
there wasn't a third-party keen there
was like a third party that was built up

501
00:44:43,789 --> 00:44:49,220
in New six yards and six people had to
come together in order to decrypt that

502
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:54,520
traffic then you're just sitting there
fishing going to every nation state or

503
00:44:54,520 --> 00:45:00,980
every person who has that short in
assembling it together so we're almost

504
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:06,930
out of time here any other questions or
comments I guess I'm lying on the open

505
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:07,910
discussion thing

506
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:16,770
questions comments concerns flames
constructive criticism ok I'm ending

507
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:20,779
with 30 seconds to go thank you guys SO
much for laughing at my jokes like to

508
00:45:20,779 --> 00:45:22,240
thank you
