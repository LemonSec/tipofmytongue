1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,700
yes there are people selling it but
let's talk

2
00:00:45,870 --> 00:01:05,349
there's still some seats up front so why
don't we go ahead and get started so

3
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:09,259
today we're going to talk about the
cloud Britain talk about how clouds a

4
00:01:09,259 --> 00:01:14,110
bill is gonna be a lot of a tutorial
will dive deep into some things and

5
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:18,460
we'll talk about how to secure the cloud
which is very important as well so

6
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,460
before start time

7
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,850
my name's Lisa guess I'm with juniper
Networks and I vice president for the

8
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:29,250
systems engineering team there but also
want all of you know since we have a

9
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,899
large group of I T folks I started my
career back in the late eighties at

10
00:01:33,899 --> 00:01:38,210
Shell Oil Company and I was in there I T
department then so a lot of the

11
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:42,369
challenges that you may have now you
know I'm not always been on the vendor

12
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:47,069
side I spent about ten years on the
customer side so I am well aware of the

13
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:51,550
challenges and decisions and and the
different tradeoffs you have to make

14
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:56,459
every day as a nightie professional so i
just want to get that brief intro so

15
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:01,250
before we jump into the cloud and talk
about that I I think about cloud we hear

16
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:07,330
cloud everywhere just the other day I
was at my moms and she goes what is the

17
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:11,590
cloud and I thought why is my eighty
three-year-old mother worrying about

18
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:16,370
what the cloud is you know and that's
how ubiquitous it's become and I was

19
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:21,220
thinking where did that term really come
from so I'm also a trivia buff and I'm

20
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:25,840
going to give you a few tidbits so you
can entertain and amuse your colleagues

21
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,650
at your next cocktail party so it's it's
somewhat nebulous origin but the first

22
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:36,140
known reference to a cloud related to
networking in an official capacity was

23
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:41,980
in 1977 when there was an ARPANET
diagram and instead of showing the

24
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:46,488
actual network elements it actually was
a cloud so that was the first known use

25
00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:53,610
of it they did not use the word yet but
it was a symbol in 1994 Wired magazine

26
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:59,990
used the term cloud in a reference to
general general computing that was

27
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,960
available the time that's really the
first known reference in an official

28
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:10,360
document to cloud and then it wasn't
until 2006 Amazon actually launched

29
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:16,570
their enabled and elastic computing
cloud and so this is all of fairly

30
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:20,709
relative term relatively new term and
it's amazing to me how quickly things

31
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:25,510
have evolved over time and how important
and ubiquitous the cloud is now even in

32
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:31,100
our own personalized tee shots so try to
remember that and use it next time and

33
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:37,380
people will really enjoy it I'm sure
just like you guys did so the promise

34
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,130
the cloud is is it an important one

35
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:43,180
its on demand computing its pay as you
go

36
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,450
its elastic computing you know it's it's
rainbows and unicorns it's everything

37
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:54,609
you could want but we really get to what
the cloud is like this you know it's a

38
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:59,860
pile of spaghetti it's hard to manage
its hard to secure its hard to automate

39
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:04,019
and that's what we're talking about
today how do we simplify secure and

40
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:09,360
automate a real cloud and all the
elements that go into it so what are the

41
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,760
business challenges that might even make
you want to embrace the cloud you know

42
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,120
how do you secure it how do you innovate
without disrupting your business it's

43
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,430
really hard to go from what I would term
a legacy data center very monolithic

44
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:27,360
into a virtualized data center that you
may be on your own premises and then

45
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:35,200
even harder to leverage public public
clouds and to hybridize it so if you

46
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,390
look at where I T is now it must be
pretty important because 57% of

47
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:43,020
respondents and is actually slightly
dated this is from 2014

48
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:48,940
over half of all the respondents from a
fairly major survey had I T shops moving

49
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:54,560
toward the cloud and you'll see but
you'll also see as many people that want

50
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,870
to deploy it you still have more than
half of infrastructures don't have any

51
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:02,099
cloud infrastructure whatsoever yet and
that's because there are several

52
00:05:02,099 --> 00:05:07,860
challenges that we're talking about so
why why go to all these challenges

53
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,960
what's driving it first floor
applications are changing things used to

54
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,460
be what we called ourselves so you have
a very monolithic environment might be

55
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:20,180
your finance department and they want to
use an ERP system or your sales

56
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:24,280
department might have wanted their own
isolated CRM system now we have social

57
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,880
networking we've got all kinds of
applications like PeopleSoft or

58
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,650
different CRM programs now a lot of your
traffic is east west and this is

59
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:38,760
fundamentally changing your traffic
patterns in your data center and driving

60
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,200
a lot of the need for the change to
cloud your needing flattered apologies

61
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:47,099
and we're gonna go into a lot of detail
about what exactly beings we also have

62
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:50,760
some elements network virtualization
available to us that we didn't have

63
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:56,060
before we should be lands for quite a
while probably season's early nineties

64
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,789
or so but we really haven't gotten to a
point where we can start to virtualized

65
00:06:00,789 --> 00:06:05,780
network and run virtualized network
functions on bare metal ware and talk

66
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:09,809
about that as well as we talk about
apologies and then we get into

67
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:14,050
everything as a service at Juniper we're
starting to see more and more of our

68
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:19,650
customers either leasing I T as a
service from a large provider or maybe

69
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:24,599
even large companies that are using a
multi-tenant setup where they're

70
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:28,580
providing everything as a service to
their different business units so those

71
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,550
are playing in more and more
environments not really just you just

72
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:36,409
care about it if your Amazon or if your
Google you really care about it even in

73
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:42,370
every day every day I T shops so today
you're here you know how do we get where

74
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:47,690
we need to be and so by that I mean here
being you got it

75
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:53,140
customer and user they want a service so
days or weeks later you provision head

76
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,950
and then suddenly it comes up and it's
running and that's really not fast

77
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:01,599
enough to satisfy them and I remember
when I started back at Shell all these

78
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:02,580
years ago

79
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:09,758
I was working on their infrastructure
and it took minimal one month to

80
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,439
provision of service and we were using
3270 terminal someplace showing my age

81
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:17,830
to view some of you probably haven't
even heard of this nearly cried as she

82
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:21,639
talking about you know we'd have a and
user in all they would want to do is go

83
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:25,080
from ok I'm really gonna see if anybody
knows this region

84
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:31,960
3278 mod 2 230 2785 and that took a
month to provision that all that was

85
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,840
just changing out of terminal in the end
of a coax cable did anybody know that

86
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:42,520
term I see if you think you so that's
where we used to be what we really

87
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,378
really really wanna be is where that end
user clicks its provision and they're

88
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:50,229
getting used to that today and everyday
environment you know it won't be long

89
00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:54,610
until they have a Comcast service or att
service at home all they have to do is

90
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:57,370
click on not only do I get provisioned

91
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:02,009
also can add firewall services or
content acceleration services on the fly

92
00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:07,310
by myself using a portal without even
calling anyone and and that's where the

93
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:12,490
world is going in a very ubiquitous
fashion even in our own I T shops what

94
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:16,409
goes into all that all of these
different buzzwords John Harris TN

95
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:21,120
orchestration you get all the protocols
you've got automation so those things

96
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,830
are important to understand and to
factor into where you are and here is

97
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:30,109
where many many networks are today we
think about your datacenter or even your

98
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:35,690
campus your resources are in silos you
know you talked earlier about your

99
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:40,110
finance department needed a specific
application and you put that in and then

100
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:44,420
sales needed specific thing and you put
that in but everything is siloed and

101
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:48,170
it's not working well together or you
have to go multiple hops for the network

102
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:54,560
to get to it where you need to be aware
you have a physical infrastructure that

103
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,040
is a very high utilization because
you're able to virtually overlay

104
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,000
networking elements on top of it and
utilizing much like what you're probably

105
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,600
already very familiar with doing today
on your high-end servers running several

106
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,990
virtual machines on them or maybe you
got Fibre Channel storage and you got a

107
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:13,810
storage area now

108
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:17,560
work that's where networking is going as
well when we get to this ubiquitous

109
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:22,219
ability to have virtualized networking
is it easy to get there

110
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:27,579
know there's a lot of impediments to it
you got a complex network you know you

111
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:32,710
got sub optimal topologies when your
traffic was going only in a north-south

112
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:37,310
direction and not be stressed you don't
really care if you have multiple hops it

113
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,589
had to go through when you're going

114
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:45,300
application to application directly all
the sudden multiple hops not turn into

115
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,430
two times multiple hops and then you
start out performance issues so we have

116
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:54,479
problems there we have manual processes
everybody still used to using CLI to

117
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,080
configure their routers switches you
know we're not we may have some good

118
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:03,029
things on our sonar firewalls but you're
going to Vice by device that's another

119
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:08,310
impediment and then let's talk about
security what a challenge that can be

120
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:13,479
then you got this complex network and
now you're trying to overlay security on

121
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,410
top of it and figure out where do I put
the firewall do I care if I need a

122
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,730
firewall between a virtual server and
another virtual server on the same

123
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:26,350
physical hardware what do i do or you
know is it like the old days and all I

124
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,800
cared about was just the pipe coming
into my data center

125
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:34,130
things things have changed quite a bit
in the past few years we use some a real

126
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:38,490
example to talk about this so this is
the application silos I talked about

127
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:44,630
primarily in North Salt traffic then we
evolve over time and you evolve you

128
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:48,050
separate your database are starting to
get better structured data so you have a

129
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:52,630
datasource you have an application
front-end it still siloed and you still

130
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:57,380
are able to share the data but all of a
sudden one day your customers figure out

131
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:00,820
hey be really cool if I can just
directly access your order management

132
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:06,230
database or H R figures out oh I'm not
the only one who needs to see your

133
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:11,580
PeopleSoft application maybe every
employee could directly interact with my

134
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,709
people management application to all of
sudden you got this

135
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:19,339
any to any traffic and this is where I
was talking about earlier in today's

136
00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:25,330
typical data center and network greater
than 75% of your data is taking this

137
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,800
east-west pattern

138
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,099
which is fine because it's got
connectivity but the performance is not

139
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:35,860
gonna be what you want it to be so you
sit down one day and you have a nightie

140
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,410
planning session you say okay here's
where we are

141
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:43,050
here's where we wanna go here's our next
step is we want to have a virtual data

142
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:49,010
center so we want to virtualize our data
center are absurd quite resilient yes

143
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:53,600
you know they still made five nines
reliability out of the data center so

144
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,360
i'm gona designed for that but I'm gonna
bring in virtual machines have high and

145
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,459
x86 servers I'm gonna bring in virtual
machines I'm gonna put an ass and have

146
00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:09,380
shared storage and then I'm gonna have
layer 2 switching in my fabric so that's

147
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:15,860
a much better choice but you still have
challenges with that and you also want

148
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,410
to incorporate let's hear cloud data
center where you're absurd more

149
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:23,250
resilient to think to some of the
applications that sit in the cloud today

150
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:28,850
like PeopleSoft sitting in the cloud
salesforce.com is much more resilient

151
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:34,020
than it used to be able to sit in the
cloud and if you're especially for

152
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:38,370
leasing cloud services from a larger
provider as part of your overall

153
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:42,230
solution now you're only gonna really be
able to count on three nines of

154
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:47,890
reliability because now we're going over
that I P public network so you need the

155
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,959
resiliency but you also get the
virtualization you're able to use

156
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:55,140
network attached storage and have a lot
more flexibility

157
00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:01,439
let's talk about some of the decisions
you make their applications so let's say

158
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,230
you got a partner at you know we talked
about your partners might want access to

159
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:09,600
it and that's maybe not as
mission-critical tu as maybe your

160
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,370
inventory management or your order
management and maybe you might even

161
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:18,149
decide I'm gonna save cycles and I'm
even going to put the partner

162
00:13:18,149 --> 00:13:22,040
application into the cloud so that I can
free up my own resources in my own

163
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:26,860
management overhead so that I can manage
my own mission critical critical

164
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,560
applications

165
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,029
you looking for processing now you put
that into the data center and it's much

166
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:38,570
more efficient now you still own all the
infrastructure yourself and you think do

167
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:41,790
I want to put that in the cloud no I
don't because that's where my revenue

168
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:46,360
comes from and i really can't afford for
my order processing to be down for some

169
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,240
of you it might be customer management
whatever it is that your core business

170
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,460
and you want to maintain that control of
it

171
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,900
common examples are in our financial
industry they put everything they can to

172
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,550
the cloud but things that are really the
crown jewels they leave in their

173
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:05,199
virtualized datacenter and move as much
as I can't now maybe you got this very

174
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,750
ancient inventory database that you
don't have an ability to move it into

175
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:13,980
the virtualized data center but you find
other applications that you can move in

176
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:17,770
there like mail is a great example in
our personalized we all use mail in the

177
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:22,569
cloud we all use CRM and the cloud
that's the PeopleSoft think of a char

178
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:28,180
sorry that's the PeopleSoft
salesforce.com is in the cloud so my

179
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:32,880
point is as you're thinking about this
you're not gonna one day wake up and say

180
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,650
everything's gonna go into the public's
out you're gonna have to think carefully

181
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:41,370
through all of your applications and
which ones can migrate in which ones are

182
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:45,920
unable to and the network is gonna be
key to that and it's going to be more

183
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,990
important than ever that your network
has when I'm going to define him it's

184
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:55,150
called coherency meaning I don't care
where I sit in the network it was my

185
00:14:55,150 --> 00:15:00,449
legacy data center my my newer upgraded
virtualized section of my data center or

186
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:07,000
my public cloud I've got a coherent
network provisioning has always been a

187
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,220
big challenge with braised networking
with servers and storage and I don't you

188
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,490
tell you that you know I told I
illustrated with this is my story

189
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:22,110
earlier so in the old days back when you
had to bring up a physical server it

190
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:24,150
might have taken two months you had to
order it

191
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:28,310
provision it find a rack space for it I
remember those days to this is like in

192
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:34,069
the mid nineties and we're using NetBIOS
and enterprise LAN server from IBM

193
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:42,520
anybody remember that so it took a
couple months to really provision that

194
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:47,189
server so it didn't matter if it took me
two weeks to bring up the network or the

195
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:52,060
storage guys took two weeks to bring it
up but now the advent and prevalence of

196
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:56,050
the virtual machines in server world you
can actually bring it up in two minutes

197
00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:02,069
in fact one of our customers very very
large online retailer they actually

198
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:06,780
bring up servers on the fly in may be
less than five seconds to accommodate

199
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:10,730
for high workloads during the Christmas
season it's fascinating some of the

200
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:15,300
automation that that our customers have
him play but what sticks out like a sore

201
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:21,050
thumb now is his two weeks time to
provision your network and storage so

202
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:25,310
what do we do about that and that's what
we talked about a lot later in the

203
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:30,449
presentation we need to orchestrated and
we need to automate it there are those

204
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:36,420
two terms equivalent they're actually
not so I hear them used interchangeably

205
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:44,439
quite often think of automation as I
think of wine grapes he will put the

206
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:49,040
grades and then stop the grapes you know
you got think of Lucy from that old show

207
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,599
I automate that and all the sudden now I
am crushing grapes in an automated way

208
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,520
it's still a single function and it's
not really related to other functions

209
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:05,030
but I'm doing a lot faster so that's
automation orchestration think of that

210
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:09,209
is making wine so there's different
automated things that happen like I've

211
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:15,089
got my bottler I've got thing that much
the cork in the great pressure but think

212
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:20,020
about a true bottle of fine wine that is
what orchestration is it brings all of

213
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:24,660
those things together it has
intelligence across the processes you

214
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:28,620
know how long those crushed grapes of
SATA near Barrow you know when it's time

215
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:32,340
to bottle and then you know when it's
time to ship it out and that's really

216
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,850
where orchestration comes into play and
that's where the master winemaker comes

217
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:36,909
into play

218
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:41,420
so that's that's a way to look at these
two things differently and they're both

219
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:48,590
critically important so we've talked a
lot about the path to the cloud just

220
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:52,970
gonna summarize the dive into three main
elements of how we're gonna get to the

221
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:58,280
cloud so we consolidate we got our
legacy data sooner you start to

222
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:03,300
virtualized servers a lot of you're
probably passed that phase in your into

223
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:07,149
the optimization phase where you're
looking at automating your network

224
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:11,880
automating your provisioning automating
your storage provisioning and then we

225
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,830
really want to get you is where you have
a soft provision cloud where your end

226
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:20,710
user can go click on a service and your
network provision itself and that gives

227
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:24,720
you a lot of time to do a lot of your
for planning do more efficient things

228
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:30,280
with your time rather than sit in front
of a sea lion type commands what does

229
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:34,410
that look like in reality physically I
like I'm an engineer I like to look at

230
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:38,100
where these boxes really look like you
know these are all pretty conceptual

231
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:43,419
things I'm talking about so if you look
you got an on-premises data center we

232
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:46,690
talked about the legacy which should be
physical and in the virtualized

233
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:50,300
datacenter you might have a managed
service provider that's gotta element of

234
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:55,360
both and then you might have a cloud
service provider as well today all those

235
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:00,330
things don't necessarily talk to each
other in an in a very seamless way but

236
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:04,560
where you really want to get is this
coherent network this network that

237
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,889
doesn't perform differently depending on
where you are this network that is a

238
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:12,820
provision differently depending on where
you are is something that works both

239
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:17,480
within all of your data centers and
within your public cloud and enables you

240
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,520
to have a hybrid cloud getting back to
that point I made where your application

241
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:27,540
system should sit where they need to be
male and H are apps fit really well in a

242
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,850
public cloud order management probably
fits well in your private cloud

243
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:36,960
so what are the three steps that you
need to go through to get there the

244
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,400
first step you need to do is to simplify
your network you need to secure your

245
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,610
network and you need to automate your
operations

246
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,950
let's talk about simplifying your
network so in your old model you got a

247
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:55,620
rotary switch and see their RCL I am
bringing things provisioning the server

248
00:19:55,620 --> 00:20:00,580
and doing everything on its own but in
the new model you got the network where

249
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:04,689
it can do self provisioning and part of
the way you get to that is you start to

250
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:10,570
simplify it I talked earlier about the
challenge you have in the way we build

251
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:15,610
networks fifteen years ago even in five
years ago so again

252
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:19,919
think about that traffic going in north
and south she went from an end user up

253
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:24,480
to a server you don't have server to
server communication you don't care how

254
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,750
many layers you had necessarily you get
your router layer you got an edge you

255
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:32,820
can access you got aggregation but then
when you look at the way a server to

256
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:36,970
server has to communicate its not
performing very well so the very first

257
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:40,790
thing you want to do is to get into
something known as a spiny leaf

258
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:45,300
architecture where you're taking out one
of those layers were your spine reef

259
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:50,310
you're already in a better performance
because one of your layers is gone but

260
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:53,850
the next thing that's really important
that starts you down this path to

261
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:59,379
getting to the coherent network is you
start deploying protocols like something

262
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:06,240
known as multi chastity link aggregation
so in this scenario think of your your

263
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,250
access layer you got your end users out
there

264
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:14,400
your spine layer acts as one switch
because you're doing a multi chassis

265
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,600
link aggregation so your your network
access doesn't care which of those two

266
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,800
it goes across already you then
eliminate that need to do manual

267
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:27,159
provisioning the next thing you can do
is start to build what's known as a

268
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,780
virtual chassis fabric for your home
network looks like one ethernet switch

269
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:35,149
and all of a sudden now you don't have
to worry about where are my view

270
00:21:35,149 --> 00:21:39,498
lands where does this provision as
houses port talk to the other one its

271
00:21:39,499 --> 00:21:45,729
all Cutler to connectivity to itself and
its managed as one ethernet switch the

272
00:21:45,729 --> 00:21:51,950
next step is to start to deploy an IPO
opens fabric in the scenario and so your

273
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:54,450
your network now has all managed as a
whole

274
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:59,429
within your own entity but what this
enables you to do is then when she got

275
00:21:59,429 --> 00:22:03,649
this platform set up now you can do
coherence were called beyond the edge

276
00:22:03,649 --> 00:22:08,678
and start to exchange data with an
Amazon or whether Google and related

277
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:13,049
link state to them or response times and
start to choose the best best pads for

278
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:18,200
your traffic so this is this is the
simplify the network part there's a lot

279
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:24,349
of details behind it but this is the
conceptual notion of it and where do you

280
00:22:24,349 --> 00:22:27,289
use these different pieces you know when
should you worry about what

281
00:22:27,289 --> 00:22:32,469
so if you're if you're any legacy or
private data center and it's not a large

282
00:22:32,469 --> 00:22:36,440
datacenter you're probably fine with the
most HSE leg and that's a standard

283
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:41,580
protocol standard Lee used in your
common Ethernet switches you're not

284
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:46,619
sitting here pitching proprietary thing
we do then you have the notion Ethernet

285
00:22:46,619 --> 00:22:50,968
fabric so that fits in both as you get
into private cloud data centers and

286
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:55,649
larger data centers and then you get
special into the public cloud all the

287
00:22:55,649 --> 00:22:59,459
sudden your IP connectivity becomes
critical because now you're going over

288
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,259
distance you're connecting your
datacenter as you're trying to do

289
00:23:02,259 --> 00:23:08,589
backups over distance and you need to
have the right foundation do that what's

290
00:23:08,589 --> 00:23:13,109
the next challenge that you have so we
talked about simplify your next

291
00:23:13,109 --> 00:23:17,918
challenges how do I secure this network
if if you look at all the elements and

292
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,570
house built it can be really tough to
figure out where does that firewall go

293
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:29,710
or where where do I need to worry about
security will answer is unfortunately a

294
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:33,469
lot of it I know this is a crowd in
particular is very focused on it

295
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:41,270
if you look if you go back a few years
there's a call the castle model of a

296
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:46,150
castle and it's got a moat around it and
you inherently assume everything inside

297
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:49,870
the castle is safe and there are no
threats inside the castle and its

298
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:54,040
enemies come with the drawbridge put
some alligators in the moat and there

299
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,100
you go

300
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,270
what we have to think about today those
are threats from everywhere there's even

301
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:04,020
threats from non-human entities that are
just coming through bots and and

302
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:08,120
programs that clone themselves and so
think about it like the hotel model

303
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:13,770
thing about this hotel here so it's it's
your room now has a room key cuz you

304
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:17,860
can't assume the halls are safe so
that's that's one element of it but the

305
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:21,219
other element and all other things for
me this idea in your presentation

306
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:26,370
earlier today but the other element is I
have specific points were in for

307
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:31,909
security but also have an overall threat
intelligence that a coordinate so

308
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:34,320
imagine if there is a threat

309
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,450
entering the hotel there's a security
room in this hotel has security cameras

310
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:42,770
everywhere and they can see ok there's a
problem here there's a problem here

311
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:47,660
there's a problem here not just relying
on you to have an access key to your

312
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:51,980
room for your safety they're looking at
the whole hotel and their correlating

313
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:58,210
threats around the hotel it's much like
that in networking so where does all

314
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:03,010
that fit so this is a breakdown of the
same thing I've been showing you so this

315
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:07,629
is that data center topology you can act
as well you get the spine and I'll leave

316
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:13,690
and the router so typical firewall in
the castle would sit in this box one and

317
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:17,600
this is still critical to stateful
firewall keeps things from outs you know

318
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,879
bad things outside coming in but you
have a lot of other places that you need

319
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:26,790
to do enforcement along the way you got
now virtualized servers running on a

320
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:30,480
physical server what if one of your
virtualized server and it never

321
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,190
exercised the server it goes in
threatens another virtualized server and

322
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:39,150
it's lacking in that way so you need the
ability to have virtual firewall running

323
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:42,370
between your virtual machines in your
server

324
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:48,959
you may also have a need to do filters
or access control lists and that can

325
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,760
take a lot of load off of this main
fireball lit the fire on number one and

326
00:25:53,760 --> 00:26:00,540
what really helps all this work is if
you have a and my clickers are going to

327
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:06,100
have an orchestrated central policy
engines of think of that as the hotel

328
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:10,610
security staff sitting in their room
watching for where the threats are and

329
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:14,479
enforcing security where it makes the
most sense you got your room key at your

330
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,190
door you may have doors that lock after
hours at night so it's not relying on

331
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:23,710
just one layer of securities relying on
multiple layers of security and it gives

332
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:29,940
you the threat intelligence that you
need so you can so you can send off

333
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:39,900
unwanted attacks so we've talked about
simplify and secure so the final thing

334
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,750
is let's let's say you got all that in
place now what's left for you to do is

335
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:47,280
to automate operations so that you can
get to this nirvana

336
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:51,800
of the end user be held revision or even
yourself provisional things very quickly

337
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:58,200
within seconds what goes into place so
again we talked a lot about where we

338
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:05,360
were gonna go quick little story when I
was really early in my career at Shell

339
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,820
and it was a really new I T apartment
you know things were kinda knew about

340
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:14,889
them and sometimes things didn't work
that well we're doing source route

341
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:19,950
bridging and we had some groups network
I get called up to the CIO and to

342
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:25,340
present to talk about why was a network
down and my model was worried you know

343
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:29,580
where we've been where we are now where
we going so I think learning all those

344
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:33,649
lessons of how to get a hot water back
in my twenties helps me design my

345
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:39,309
presentation so I liked about we're
worried and now where we want to go so

346
00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:45,830
no bond on managing your network devices
using a CLI or something pretty brutal

347
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,649
wars

348
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:51,230
rather than automating but what we want
to do is get to the point where we have

349
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:55,710
an automation stack and we can
orchestrate from there now I'm 0

350
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:59,470
hardware engineer so I'm not a
programmer and I'm learning all this

351
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:05,400
probably along with a lot of folks in
the room but if you look at the stack

352
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,070
this is this is where we used to be

353
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:11,480
we would have arch St you be running
some kind of a proprietary operating

354
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:16,230
system on this in this case or cases
juneau's other router vendors have their

355
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:21,500
own operating systems however we're
starting to get to World War II got your

356
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:26,150
XML so I can start to run pretty
primitive scripts but I can start to

357
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:30,350
program and saucer programming interface
interface now I can write a script for

358
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:34,870
this one device oh and now there's other
things are improving all the protocols

359
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:41,610
and adding more ease of use to you got
netcom you've got Python Ruby

360
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,300
just goes on and on the buzz word of the
day that you can have these are all very

361
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:51,090
important they're all very useful I hold
as a team is going through class to

362
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:56,110
learn about answerable so now you get a
lot more richness in your scripting

363
00:28:56,110 --> 00:29:01,850
language and chef aid those things are
providing you know they're they're

364
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:07,370
amazingly simple to use even for someone
who is a software developer and you can

365
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:11,120
look at that and say here's what I wanna
do and then tools like puppet in shelf

366
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:16,419
enable you to very easily script and
automate your network so they're very

367
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:20,240
valuable and in those are all again
those are not something our company

368
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,440
makes us something widely available in
the market and something many many

369
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:29,810
companies use so that its 21 bucks
though now what do I do when I get ahold

370
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:35,659
networks each of those boxes is running
that whole thing she got a couple ways

371
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:39,690
you can approach the problem of your
network coherence and your automation

372
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:45,290
you can look at a network management
system such as ours or there's a lot of

373
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:52,040
third-party systems and you can you talk
about some of the puppet type on the

374
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,680
world is really becoming a much more
open world these days and it's important

375
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,429
to understand where to leverage is
different

376
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:03,720
bodies that bottoms-up approach is
Israel for the day I called the do it

377
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,889
yourself Thurs they may either write
their own scripts or they may use some

378
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:13,149
things off the shelf there's also a
wealth of of trolls now for folks that

379
00:30:13,149 --> 00:30:16,830
want to buy more integrated solutions
and I just throwing up several examples

380
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:22,129
here these things from VMware IBM HP
there's OpenStack solutions that are an

381
00:30:22,129 --> 00:30:26,248
open-source you know freeware that you
can use or you can even build your own

382
00:30:26,249 --> 00:30:32,869
but what is happening that in here
that's the missing link so network

383
00:30:32,869 --> 00:30:39,928
virtualization let me describe this
fairly simple example you can't get

384
00:30:39,929 --> 00:30:45,090
where you need to be unless you can get
to a virtualized network also known as

385
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:50,480
Sdn or also known as overlays and under
lays whatever terminology used to using

386
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:57,619
what is that exactly mean so let's let's
go back to my simple example and we used

387
00:30:57,619 --> 00:31:01,059
to think we had some element of network
virtualization with VLANs so that's

388
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:07,100
virtual local area networks so I've got
the green network and I said I V LAN and

389
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:13,840
on the exact same infrastructure I set
up a red network that's great I was

390
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,709
already there why do I needed Sdn or
anything else I can already do that

391
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:23,980
actually hear your problem let's say
you're a one service needs to migrate to

392
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:28,019
different port for whatever reason yuri
provisioning server you're bringing in

393
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:34,470
new capacity you're feelin didn't move
with it did it know now you gotta go in

394
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:39,320
and manually reconfigure that VLAN to
get that to now provide connectivity to

395
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:43,490
it so there goes your automation and
orchestration that was a weekly

396
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:47,299
interchange where we want to go next

397
00:31:47,299 --> 00:31:51,499
so this is it I'm gonna see the promise
of overlays because St and it's still a

398
00:31:51,499 --> 00:31:56,590
relatively new technology it's it's
picking up very very quickly though and

399
00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:01,230
so here's here's the promise of it we're
already seeing come to bear so same

400
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:06,519
example agree network and now I have my
red network and by the way I'm using a

401
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:08,990
centralized controller to provision

402
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:15,780
now the centralized controller can
understand when that server instance has

403
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:20,899
to move to a new port and now be
centralized controller that is automated

404
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:25,290
is able to reap revision on the fly so I
no longer have to go to manual

405
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:31,620
intervention for it and when I get from
that is not only the ease of use for the

406
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:35,949
automation but now see what happens so
let's let's look at this in logical

407
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:40,260
fashion here's my red network of my
green network what if those two are talk

408
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:46,690
to each other now what I do so now I can
do what's called service Cheney who I

409
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:50,950
don't want them I don't want finances
talking to a chart deserves some serious

410
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:55,250
data breaches that might happen either
way so now I can have virtualized

411
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:59,550
firewalls virtualize intrusion
protection I can have a load-balancing

412
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:05,169
network address translation and those
also exist on virtual machines inside my

413
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:10,990
data sooner and so I can have the
overlay controller now say oh I want to

414
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:14,690
load balancer a firewall between the red
and green network and just from my

415
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:19,679
console or even just setting up a
template of a policy I now can have that

416
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:24,760
automatically provision and by the way
this is what large carriers like Verizon

417
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:32,440
AT&T Bill Self sorry that's my age again
you know like bTW that's what they're

418
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:36,020
doing as well as a provision in your
home services so you know we're all

419
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:42,220
gonna benefit from the automation that
is already in existence but even you

420
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:49,470
know being developed and simplified a
very very quick way so that's really the

421
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,760
Pats in the cloud

422
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:55,460
these are the parts of the cloud we
talked about how to simplify your

423
00:33:55,460 --> 00:34:00,440
architecture we talked about different
ways to secure it and why it's important

424
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,750
and how overall threat intelligence is
important

425
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:09,120
and then we talked about all the pieces
that go into automating it and and why

426
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:13,239
that helps you provide the fast
provision for end users and make sure

427
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:19,479
