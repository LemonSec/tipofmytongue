1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,170
alright I gotta make a quick so so I
worked with us we are a security company

2
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:13,790
everything we do is focused around
security we have suffered slaps on the

3
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:17,460
back in which is essentially we get all
of our threat intelligence that's why

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,510
we're always monitoring the threats that
are in landscape things that are coming

5
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,510
in what we need to build defenses for
and I'm talking to talk a little bit

6
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:31,420
today about what we're seeing from Soho
slats and I'm gonna focus a lot on

7
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:36,890
anyone here in somewhere a little
worried about ransomware pretty hot

8
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:43,180
topic obviously so customized today's
presentation about rent somewhere in

9
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:50,710
what was so everyone knows gone is the
day where you know Packers were

10
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:57,510
descriptive word on command line trying
to really just trying to face things

11
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,750
trying to get some notoriety just like
screwing around trying to get some

12
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:06,549
attention it's turned into big tits
focusing on the companies that have a

13
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:09,340
lot of financial transactions going on
in their network

14
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:15,360
trying to take advantage of a lot of you
can think you know in sales

15
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:20,048
it's a numbers game and when you look at
all of the machines that are out there

16
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:26,150
on the internet really you can get in
somewhere for for example you can get

17
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,600
that down to all these different
machines and just skimmed off the top

18
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,610
little bit turning into

19
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:38,220
billion dollar businesses so now just a
couple couple of points here on the

20
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:46,119
growth of the industry what it's what
it's believed to be 1.5 trillion dollars

21
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:51,710
by 2019 there's a lot of damage to their
credit card companies having to go and

22
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:57,399
you pay fines send out new credit cards
they're really obviously becoming a pain

23
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:00,399
to do a lot of corporations

24
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:12,530
I like talking about the case and
easiest way is 44

25
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:18,739
hackers to infiltrate into machines
previously used to be that you had an

26
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:27,330
Internet firewall they were now that
everyone connected to the Internet and

27
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:32,010
the kind of the lines of your perimeter
have blurred

28
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,760
got all the mobile devices that are
around people are getting your network

29
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:42,260
their kids are on their machine does it
really becomes right now those machines

30
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:49,160
and trying to get people to go to
websites about a lot of the websites

31
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:55,880
that are owed on them are legitimate
websites so rather than them standing up

32
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,980
websites and trying to get people to go
to them they're attacking him so people

33
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,250
are going to them

34
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:06,590
clicking on you know their their
favorite forum that they go to talk

35
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:12,310
about gene searching or whatever it may
be there they're not necessarily have

36
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:18,329
the most sophisticated security measures
put in place on these websites so it's

37
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:26,220
an easy place to attack with a drive-by
download sites they are able to get some

38
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,700
of the malicious code in there and
execute that code and and then take over

39
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:35,369
these machines do you think of the
botnets this has been around for quite

40
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:40,900
some time this on hardware operating
systems do not forgotten in the mobile

41
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:48,200
space there's about four million
believed in in the you s different Zeus

42
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:58,980
botnets that are out there so that
trader or spread around some some new

43
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,048
malicious code that they've got an
obviously these militias kind of doesn't

44
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:10,069
have to change that much to try and get
around some of the defense's at 10 days

45
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:19,149
threats the only reason I have ever
loved watching

46
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:26,719
children actually talking computer lingo
and the owner of the computer guys right

47
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,250
here and they're going in and taking
advantage of this is believed just a

48
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:37,250
little over a year statistics there was
80 day threats that existed sure most

49
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,380
people know this year and threats are
essentially the threat to sit there and

50
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:46,409
we're just not aware that they haven't
yet so essentially that's where you know

51
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:49,460
it's it's just brand new threats and
vulnerabilities are able to take

52
00:04:49,460 --> 00:05:04,770
advantage of this email that was sent
out spam continues to be a big issue and

53
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:05,659
I sent the spam

54
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:13,370
we try to have a long time it's always
changing gone is the day getting a

55
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:19,729
really you may get some of them but an
email very poorly worded that's very

56
00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:21,539
obvious that span

57
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:25,479
there's actually behind the spam emails
that are going out there is language

58
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:29,349
they're making sure that it's not broken
English so when they're sending us out

59
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:36,030
it looks like a legitimate email a pic I
might add a lot of my presentation he

60
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:42,659
received from the lawyers I opened it
and he followed up and let me know that

61
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:49,000
he was he had been now it got a virus or
not she expecting anything from a signal

62
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,080
from him so so I went ahead and open it
because it's coming from a trusted

63
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,310
source he's actually must be legitimate
email

64
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:04,139
Excel spreadsheet with it and he opened
it and in turn got hit with it

65
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:10,849
this within the image itself this is
made to see this is actually looks like

66
00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:18,719
their Black Friday wanna get a new SUV
within can make it out here but there is

67
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:27,450
embedded in there is a link that
actually owed on it to get to get the

68
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,830
the users to click on the

69
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:40,099
see what kinda deal they can get on my
credit so I like this site because

70
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:46,350
flipping it around from now talking
about that it's not just consider

71
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:50,260
sharing her and packing anymore is
really big business has turned into some

72
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:54,460
multi-layer marketing essentially you
can buy kit if you want to actually go

73
00:06:54,460 --> 00:07:00,609
and whether there's just the city
corporation wanna go out here or you

74
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:05,740
know maybe there's some rightly having
in your corporate world that you want to

75
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:12,470
go after and get some information from
them this is actually showing depicting

76
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:20,230
the revenue for Internet ads and how
much this is gone up and this is really

77
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:27,920
where a lot of malicious code is being
put in so FL Rublev ski

78
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:35,020
tongue twister to say I recommend
writing down and just looking him up

79
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:42,140
he's very interesting russians you
actually have legitimate business for no

80
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,030
pay

81
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:48,479
where she and I going to say have
started this company together and they

82
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:55,340
are not very unsavory characters there's
so many of them out there that just you

83
00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:00,729
can tell there's a lot of shady business
going on he's almost as interesting I'd

84
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:05,250
love following on Twitter I think he is
one of the most interesting characters

85
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:10,910
to follow he's got a lot of exciting
things happening around so just just

86
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:18,140
take a look on the bright side here I
recently went to jail time for the

87
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:28,099
tossing his previous partner his company
there's also a lot of hats pharmacy

88
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:32,130
online pharmacy where they're actually
selling oxycontin

89
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:40,439
coding and so on it and they got raided
actually recently from from some some

90
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,560
Russian police

91
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:47,170
low so just take a look at it and he's
really when we talk about the big

92
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:52,130
business around trying to infiltrate
into machines and you know ransomware

93
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,670
spam and so on

94
00:08:54,670 --> 00:09:01,360
really just in my mind one of the
kingpins but so many go through them out

95
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:08,770
back to decide on this is where the big
businesses coming in and where they're

96
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:13,670
actually trying to to get that malicious
code down again the industry user here

97
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:18,120
going out to a website this web site at
my friends and it got some static

98
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,270
content and dynamic content that it's
got in there and this is gonna show you

99
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:27,240
all real time for the user can get the
ad network and then within their third

100
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,800
party they're gonna go to and then
there's gonna be some real time bidding

101
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,910
at that point they're going to have to
mention geography

102
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:41,119
we're coming from on what actually put
on those at sure a lot of people do

103
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:47,220
Amazon looking at something else and you
got some other website exactly what

104
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:47,740
you're looking at

105
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:52,460
popping up on their own input on this
information about you this real-time

106
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:57,890
bidding is happening less than a second
hundred milliseconds support and not

107
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:04,390
support this information down feat India
now you can see the team asked obviously

108
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:13,650
in your network but essentially that
that they can either be legitimate

109
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:19,069
credentials for these ad networks or
they can be compromising networks

110
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:24,640
including in the sky so again if we go
back to talk about the job

111
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:32,319
this is how they're going to impacting
in that code so again drive-by downloads

112
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,830
you're heading website did you get my
drift

113
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:45,360
perfect topic think about the cheesy
smile by fidel right here at the top and

114
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,850
then they're taking advantage of / so

115
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,959
I'll talk a little bit about the exploit
kits here but there you know like I said

116
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:00,450
they're not sitting and just doing seal
I just ripped through that I've got some

117
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:03,560
videos and will be at the booth here a
little later she like to come back and

118
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:08,810
show you some of the videos that a team
of us internally put together where it's

119
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:14,859
it's pretty much like driven application
that you can and sometimes internally

120
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:19,920
and other works for security come in
your boss and say he's testing something

121
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:26,740
click here generally not a good idea I
got rick rolled so it was pretty

122
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:31,800
entertaining but one of the things that
you know talk about a couple just

123
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:37,900
practices everyone knows now you can
quit all the threats

124
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:44,020
defense lawyers in in place but but
patching a still really really important

125
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:48,420
and i know in large corporations that
easier said than done because you have

126
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:52,640
to have a test plan when these patches
come out by the way I heard something

127
00:11:54,770 --> 00:12:02,339
gots to that when I so think about all
these patches all these wonderful either

128
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:07,210
being released on Tuesday's workout for
most people are going to be getting

129
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:14,310
those all patched on Wednesday now so
why go and find out what all these

130
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:20,910
abilities are handed to you at that
point then they can just take advantage

131
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:28,100
of those use it against invading the

132
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:34,319
the malicious code down ok so anger is
one of the exploit kit that I was

133
00:12:34,319 --> 00:12:40,630
talking about I've got a video on PC but
this is again one of the kids that you

134
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:46,449
can actually purchase all really driven
and you're going to actually get support

135
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:50,709
for these kids as well so is talking
about the multi-layer marketing

136
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:55,339
essentially this is all just just being
driven it's changing it it's essentially

137
00:12:55,339 --> 00:13:01,730
a whole new side and business they're
they're in it to make money just like

138
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:07,519
all the other corporations that we work
or or exist around us and that's just

139
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:15,540
one of the most used so another thing
really all I really want to highlight

140
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:23,790
I'm just talking about the proxy
networks so when did you already have a

141
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:29,849
machine that there quietly sitting on
and they're essentially the servers to

142
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:35,670
hide their identity a lot of the big
thing about the RSA not too long ago

143
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:40,500
that was really directly targeted went
into our essay so they can get into

144
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,870
lockheed-martin they still don't really
know where that came from because of the

145
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:50,639
proxy networks and the complexity around
that their lives their stocks that maybe

146
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:56,529
it was China but that's just all
speculation may be educated speculation

147
00:13:56,529 --> 00:14:08,720
so that almost all of these are for
financial gain

148
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:14,569
track was to the ticket financial
credentials the ransom morning see the

149
00:14:14,569 --> 00:14:23,000
crypto Locker Hurt Locker as well here
obviously you can't see this but I

150
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,120
wanted to keep the side in here at this
is actually a machine that had been

151
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:33,750
compromised by crypto wall and they feel
like they're on the internet Robin

152
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:38,620
Hood's but actually feel good by the
internet that toward the very top

153
00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:41,579
come part of a large community

154
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:51,630
crypto all so congratulations and and
actually down in year one point to a

155
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:57,510
project is not malicious or intended to
army so talk a little bit about this

156
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:02,319
again they have helped us for people
when they get infected by this it's in

157
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,530
their best interest that when someone
actually gets their data encrypted that

158
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:12,600
they're able to get it back but if not
I'm just gonna go to backup or where

159
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,270
they're going to maybe be a little more
meticulous about doing backups which in

160
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,120
turn

161
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:24,100
chairman 200% competent in all their
other backups and user feedback and

162
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:30,540
things up but I really think there is
the problem here and trying to present

163
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:36,060
that way so yeah just a list of some of
the files

164
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:42,950
they're not just going to go and they're
gonna go and hit the ones that really

165
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:47,000
hurt you you know family pictures Excel
spreadsheets maybe they've been working

166
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,089
on for a couple weeks that you just
haven't had a chance to back up its

167
00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:56,570
corporate name one thing when actually
it's one user's machine and decrypting

168
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:59,839
all their data hopefully they happened
on that but when I have mapped drive

169
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:05,570
comes out and starts hitting and hitting
all the network that's where it really

170
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:13,300
can be disrupted 22 companies and end up
costing a good bit of money

171
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:22,360
one thing on the on the payment such a
little bit more in the early in the

172
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:28,670
early instances of ransomware there was
asking for credit card information to be

173
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:33,260
paid the ransom but they were able to
track that down there isn't a lot of

174
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:41,360
other things like a pic 14 / me right
now but I can go to send them to get the

175
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,690
Manila

176
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:51,230
hey it's a lot harder for its track and
they're just give in to this so this is

177
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:58,690
just an example different emails
everyone knows microsoft office you got

178
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:08,220
the option to enable the contents how
many people are actually concerned so

179
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:19,290
this is my Sharona protect people from
that that executing but really you can

180
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:32,030
go ahead and this is different so this
turned out so if you want to see what

181
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:34,780
this actually that is trying to tell you
a little bit you want to see what this

182
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:41,410
actually go ahead and click on this and
this will show you the Unrated version

183
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:46,000
of this one straight up at the bottom of
the Linksys click on any content at the

184
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,150
top

185
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,160
incontinence

186
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,730
click the content to be the pastor and
thus protected document just couple

187
00:17:55,730 --> 00:18:04,140
examples here so this side everyone can
see maybe maybe not I don't know how

188
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:08,430
that shows up towards the back but
there's a spider and that in their

189
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:14,610
little bit of nature with the spider
hidden you are is not like this because

190
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,689
it's kind of the hiding in plain sight

191
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:21,360
going to the different websites users
are actually able to to get compromised

192
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:29,979
and you know all unbeknownst to them
sitting there right in front of them so

193
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:40,200
so we'll have a lot of research on the
web servers that are actually reminds me

194
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,950
a lot of us I think she'll like Linux is
just a lot more robust or a lot less

195
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:49,790
likely to be compromised but i dont the
Linux web site they went and did a

196
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:56,280
search for details on how they reached
out there is a hundred and eighty

197
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:01,520
thousand different websites are running
Linux that had actually been improper

198
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,520
months this is Alyssa now you know we
always give Microsoft a hard time with

199
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:17,920
the company and you see here with Apache
web server its largest chunk of hair so

200
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:27,210
this so obviously internet everything
started so really everything you can see

201
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:31,660
in the next up here you know as we get
more and more into smartphones and the

202
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:38,110
amount of control with that connectivity
in the internet into homes cars that are

203
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,110
getting internet-connected

204
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:44,909
can't help but think that at some point
that's that's going to turn into a

205
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:49,060
weapon and where you can actually take
over a car and especially with the

206
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:54,960
self-driving cars that Google and others
are working on right now the Smart TV

207
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,810
this one actually I think it's home from
a corporate network perspective because

208
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:00,980
how many people are corporations are
actually

209
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:08,360
going out and buying smart TVs dropping
on their network and adding a lot of

210
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,620
them are not segmenting that out to
respond more of like a guest network

211
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:16,559
can't touch the rest of the network so
you have to think that those are really

212
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:21,820
becoming another point where they maybe
take over the video and that monitor

213
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:28,750
aboard a boardroom actually what's going
on what's being discussed to get some

214
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,750
may be inside trader information
whatever it may be

215
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:41,350
current situation is pretty
two-dimensional you know everyone has

216
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:45,928
all of these different things that
they're putting in place to to monitor

217
00:20:45,929 --> 00:20:48,340
the threats coming in

218
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:55,159
anyone in here have just too many
resources on your I see the monitor if

219
00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:01,210
you take a pic on target really quick
target had all of their actually had a

220
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:07,630
lot to see the issues that were coming
through they just it was kind of an

221
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:11,470
overload of information and there was a
new product that they just weren't that

222
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:16,970
familiar with to see all of the data
hearing you know all of the data Simon

223
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:20,169
just staring at it they don't really
know what they're looking at so you're

224
00:21:20,169 --> 00:21:26,780
able to fine-tune resources are
obviously a big part of the problem and

225
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:35,800
when I worked at four years but I worked
at 7:11 for about 12 years on the

226
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,399
network team and we saw a lot of people
actually trying to get in you can

227
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:46,360
imagine 30 million credit card
transactions on our network and can talk

228
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:51,290
about it but you know maybe the FBI came
in and took two machines that we never

229
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:59,430
saw you but it's amazing how when you do
get exploited or or someday that leads

230
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:05,040
your network there isn't a whole script
it slipped you go from yeah well that's

231
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:09,580
a little inconvenient if we put these
security controls in place to we don't

232
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:15,449
really care it's not for the user for
that security down and I have to say I'm

233
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,230
being in that position

234
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:22,280
actually kind of enjoy it is it really a
lot more control not to mention the

235
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,860
pockets opened up from a budget
perspective on the things you've been

236
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:29,490
saying that we needed to do and we
wanted at that point it was like okay

237
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:38,210
this actually happened the day before it
became big things to think about when

238
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:43,070
you watch the news now how a ton of the
news and the tickers undergoing by the

239
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:47,389
screen are talking about different
things that have happened and it's

240
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:53,110
actually causing a lot of random but now
back on when when I was involved but it

241
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:59,669
wasn't quite sure where it was being
publicized as much as it is now let's

242
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:05,740
talk a little more enduring and it was
kind of touched on a little bit on this

243
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:13,450
but you can see whether a website that
exploit kit control spam with the

244
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:21,470
infected attachment then one thing I
haven't talked about it one of the

245
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:26,990
things that basically not found home
back to wherever the server

246
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:32,470
infrastructure maybe so if you think a
locker locker can actually sit down on

247
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:37,680
me but if you're able to block that
connection running back they're not get

248
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,320
those encryption keys they need those
keys descend on the backend

249
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,350
infrastructure

250
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:46,020
so you make him a good buy their payment
when you go in and pay to your dad about

251
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:51,780
encryption can pull it down then you're
able to keep it from going out and start

252
00:23:51,780 --> 00:24:07,539
encrypting the data on that machine but
obviously the encryption of their couple

253
00:24:07,539 --> 00:24:12,740
different types of ransomware one being
honest talking about rates looking for

254
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:18,580
specific dates and encrypting it another
one would be like screen locker and

255
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:23,918
you're being my dad support he got hit
by a screen locker when every time he

256
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:37,450
booted up on the senate over later and
the fine but when he did that get into

257
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:44,600
doing it all I live in doubt so my dad
engineer I had to walk him through

258
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:49,840
booting up in the same networks or
utility that we cleaned everything off

259
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,459
there but being an electrical engineer
everything I said to my dad he very slow

260
00:24:54,460 --> 00:25:02,890
repeated back so is one of the most
frustrating but we gotta clean up

261
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:20,408
gotta get them quickly and how their
actual payment another thing that they

262
00:25:20,409 --> 00:25:24,200
kind of works through over the years was
where was a sweet spot on how much

263
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:29,390
ransom that they started pretty low when
quiet people are parents so they jumped

264
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:38,639
up think they got up around $800 your
show now to $500 range seems to be where

265
00:25:38,639 --> 00:25:43,500
a pain point for people where they're
willing to go and pay this special if

266
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:50,710
they know that they're going to get the
data back just kind of walking through

267
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:56,980
the house payment is made and then once
the ones that payment is made no not

268
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:02,480
provide that key back so because this is
big business

269
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:09,630
their variants lucky one more recent
ones at the scene and you can see Justin

270
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:13,720
in 2016 it was four hundred thousand
different machines have been affected by

271
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:21,539
it so just continuing to grow and become
more threatened to shoot her people this

272
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:26,760
is telling you how one of the common
lockheed attacks sending an email

273
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:41,220
attachment with a year that's where
enable macro failed to execute that the

274
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:44,380
encryption kicks off and they're going
to prompt you at the

275
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,668
Decrypter and how you can actually go
about getting your key trends and and

276
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:56,610
getting your dad about another one I
won't go through each and every one of

277
00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:02,049
these variants of this kind of the same
idea CTB locker

278
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:11,620
and then so anglers something that we
talked about a little earlier and this

279
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:18,428
really a little more recent on the scene
and I got a pie chart here coming after

280
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:27,830
this site but you can see it's grown and
notoriety since 2014 and angry that you

281
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:34,050
ninety thousand tons per day and you can
see ten percent of those were served up

282
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:40,899
exploits within that per day and this is
different

283
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:47,090
exploit kits and how much anger has
grown so definitely take a look at I

284
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:51,449
recommend going out and take a look at
anger just getting some more information

285
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:56,600
on it and how how it's being leveraged I
think a lot of it we can to get tied up

286
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:01,080
in the talking about you got all these
different things to put in place but I

287
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:06,178
think it's really trying to do some
things that they're doing because it

288
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:10,850
puts a little bit more in in the mindset
when we've done some testing internally

289
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:18,090
with would be finding it shows you the
point of view from from a hacker and

290
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:25,959
that specifically what the videos that
you liked it so why are the attacks

291
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:36,809
about this and it's really a lot of
social engineering is going into this so

292
00:28:36,809 --> 00:28:43,428
you know it's really important to
patching put in place and have a very

293
00:28:43,429 --> 00:28:48,470
good spam protection but as everyone
knows bro is playing catch up with what

294
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:54,860
the hackers so when you think of some of
the advanced persistent threats and in

295
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:59,520
most cases if they really want to get in
a really kind of comes down to the

296
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,150
education and training of your users to
not get them to you to click here to buy

297
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:11,040
on some of this because I think they
hear a corporation with a thousand years

298
00:29:11,779 --> 00:29:17,669
and expand it to you really don't need
many people click on it

299
00:29:18,529 --> 00:29:24,869
average spam email about 3% membership
so she can get 3%

300
00:29:26,529 --> 00:29:30,269
thousand user corporation to click on
that you actually got a lot of machines

301
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:33,519
in the now and here on the inside
depending on what controls you can get

302
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:43,330
put in place than what you can take over
that's really all you need is actually

303
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:46,129
just talking about you know a lot of
different things

304
00:29:46,129 --> 00:29:59,199
job realities over the years and you
know soon that will be changing it so I

305
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:05,019
talked a little bit about the back
having inadequate that the FBI's got a

306
00:30:05,019 --> 00:30:10,249
little bit lately because someone spoke
I think in Baltimore mainly from the FBI

307
00:30:10,249 --> 00:30:13,549
and basically in not so many words kind
of saying

308
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:19,160
if you really need the date about you
know what to do and that's just

309
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:26,880
encouraging the ransomware to continue
to take over the kind of back that I'm

310
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:34,830
not but honestly how much you a lot of
people are going to go ahead and paid a

311
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:39,629
certain backups obviously a very
important from from the end user and

312
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:50,970
from those network shares the dates and
patching take it and that's sorted right

313
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:57,310
now but it's believed that about 20% the
Internet is still comprised of people

314
00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:04,320
using older than 11 so obviously not
being passionate mark no no more patches

315
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,320
for that going forward so we continue to
be the problem as the user's

316
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:14,990
dangerous users rights and permissions a
lot of different things from what are

317
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:19,400
you looking at like an application
whitelisting blacklist you can do tend

318
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:28,470
to lock down the what will execute on
the machine and whites rights that may

319
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:33,060
be what rights they need the network
shares that we're talking about maybe

320
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:38,090
they don't need it right on everything
you can lock that down a little bit and

321
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:47,899
the user just talking about the biggest
issue networks but again that has seen a

322
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:53,230
lot of cases are at least in a recent
ass I just being overhead so it's kinda

323
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:58,300
hard to get people to take that time
attention to it and and also to to get

324
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:07,690
the funding for that training and talk
about the security fortunately I cases

325
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:12,790
maybe the sea level they don't want to
have to deal with things so a lot of

326
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,240
times

327
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:19,870
they ask for those two different
controls to be removes but if you're

328
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:23,209
really trying to hack into a company and
really get some of the juicy information

329
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:34,090
to be gone after all right so these are
just some some best practices that

330
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:43,659
regular backups keeping the backup not
enabling the macros within embedded

331
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:48,440
within email you can see have touched on
this a lot this one is very important

332
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,920
because that's a lot of the winds that
this is actually coming into to

333
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:58,650
corporate environments and users
machines be very cautious about

334
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:02,830
unsolicited attachments we all know that
in here but just the general population

335
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:10,730
does not or you can take it is something
that just tight enough to make them to

336
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:14,890
want to click on it when they click on
its too late now it could be could be

337
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:20,400
taking over that machine and again the
right permissions not given yourself

338
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,400
more power than you need

339
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:30,090
may be different people that don't need
the full version of Microsoft Office

340
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:36,459
have number on the viewers or maybe they
can run both of them and it's given up

341
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:43,620
on things up and begin catching catching
nearly matching often and I'm trying it

342
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:50,709
goes out as expeditiously as possible
and spent a lot of people that our

343
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:56,200
products and they may not want
professional service in that party

344
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,309
running tight on budget we're gonna go
ahead and configured are so I know

345
00:34:00,309 --> 00:34:05,670
coming from the corporate world can't
tell you how many times actually thought

346
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:12,520
something someday I'm gonna get to them
and get it in its worth its weight in

347
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:12,969
gold

348
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:18,658
yes from the actual company you're
purchasing things from to get them to be

349
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:22,080
good to know everything they do day in
and day out there gonna get a bigger

350
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:26,399
properly for you and you know I always
say it will use the TPS is actually

351
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,500
training products

352
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:36,889
work with so you can learn a little bit
more about that product alright so I

353
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:45,740
won't touch down on everyone in the one
thing that's that's that's up here there

354
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:52,209
are some ten boxing invasive techniques
are me when someone trying to compromise

355
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:57,850
your machine and wait for maybe 10 or
something before it'll actually go out

356
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:02,580
and execute but again depends in large

357
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:07,970
blocking risky file extension that's
something we've been doing for a long

358
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:15,480
time but again I'm unions versus charity
a big 12 touch on here is the HTTPS

359
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:22,660
filter last 30 percent about Internet
traffic was going out over HTTPS

360
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:27,540
how many different websites you go to
you type it in and it redirects HTTPS

361
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:33,210
not only our users can use that to avoid
maybe what you got from web filtering

362
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:38,140
perspective but who also is actually
going pretty obvious the Packers

363
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:49,960
I had a 20 terabytes grabbing a trapping
captures when I was compromised went

364
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:55,900
back to look at the data to see what had
actually been taken on back out so you

365
00:35:55,900 --> 00:36:01,760
could see transmission everything can
actually see us know it isn't always the

366
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,030
easiest thing to implement to put in
that man in the middle attack that's

367
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:10,250
essentially what you're doing is
basically having to terminate that a

368
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:17,870
section on the backs of the decrypted on
the fly

369
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:23,390
gotta get that machine to trust it but
now 30% of the Internet traffic and

370
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:27,100
growing is leveraging its so

371
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:39,980
touch this was talking to some of these
other sites so don't panic

372
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:43,210
obviously a lot of this kind of going
through a lot of doom and gloom there

373
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:47,360
are a lot of products out there that
we're in security company everything

374
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,540
that we do these folks around security a
lot of people think of us as just an

375
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:54,460
endpoint antivirus company but we do
have next campfire while we have the

376
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:59,580
spam solutions we got mobile control and
where we're actually just went public

377
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:08,400
last year there's a lot of great things
going on here itself also just trying to

378
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,840
add value naked security at
southwest.com it's great that we have

379
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:18,380
we're constantly releasing content on
there a lot of different articles that

380
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:22,390
were writing just to kind of keeping up
with what's going on in in the security

381
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:26,680
and threat landscape definitely
recommend either follow follow that on

382
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:32,810
sweater and actually the website
Facebook yeah just some really good

383
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:40,070
content that we have is hard at
southwest.com and that's actually a tree

384
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:42,800
client free to use I know a lot of
people actually come by and said they're

385
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:49,400
using our free UTM firewall home also so
take a look at that and it's just

386
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:54,240
something you know again like I said
we're we're part of the problem so just

387
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,359
an enabling you guys with some super
easy tools that you can take a look at

388
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:09,630
we've actually played a video of wrapped
around are synchronized security that

389
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:14,910
we're doing with our we have our end
point in our firewall communicating and

390
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:20,250
there's a lot of really funny and just
see the videos that are out there but

391
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:26,810
they gonna make me take a look I don't
want you to think I'm pretty funny in

392
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:30,210
one or they're actually they go from
arguing like this and then they turn

393
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:39,380
into a boys and their video guys have
any questions feel free to come by our

394
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,590
booth

395
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:48,650
wanted to question if anyone else like I
said I got this video you like to do

396
00:38:48,650 --> 00:39:12,840
that and talk about a product please
come by using that as maybe like you

397
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:20,190
hire someone out to see what what you're
gonna be alright thank you appreciate it
