1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,299
for the whole time and it either gonna
be you guys lapping with me or at I'm ok

2
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:12,120
with either so as well as long as this
can be entertaining for everyone and you

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,000
might even learn something I've
accomplished so that's what I'm trying

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,279
to do here what I would encourage
everyone here is don't don't be afraid

5
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,090
to participate

6
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:29,060
there's a couple times where I'm
encouraged audience participation so if

7
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,488
you can do that at all possible it'll
make it more fun for all of us

8
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:35,670
likewise if there's any question that
you have anything nice to say that

9
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,700
sounds something that I want to know
more about if I say something that

10
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,000
sounds really stupid call me out please
because someone else in the audience is

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,280
probably thinking the same thing and we
can all learn from that as well so

12
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,110
without further deal will start getting
started and talk about stories to lobby

13
00:00:53,110 --> 00:01:01,980
and the stock was my managing partner
come to me time we love it when you give

14
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,070
presentations but you have to give a
presentation about what we do because

15
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:12,259
hurricane labs we do a lot of work with
logging and tools that work with logging

16
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:16,890
the big one of course banks and I'm
gonna try to give a talk that talks

17
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,500
about logging while saying spunk as
little as possible which is going to be

18
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,330
a challenge said call me I don't know if
I try to do what I do not want to be

19
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:29,798
someone to say a certain product I hate
it when someone comes up representing

20
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:33,329
some kind of product or vendor and
starts talking about all the absolute

21
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:39,380
right to be as technology agnostic as
possible but presentation and we will go

22
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,839
from there

23
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,670
logs are one of those things that exist
everywhere in an organization we all

24
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:51,210
have to think that produce log their
systems that produced locks how many of

25
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:57,110
you have recently looked at clock yes I
love to see that when we have an

26
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:02,009
audience that it's actually knows that
walks sometimes I would say like eight

27
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:05,799
what logs and I just got a bunch of
blank stares and that's really really

28
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:10,440
depressing so it's great that you guys
at least know that lots of tests so I

29
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,319
don't have to worry about that basic

30
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:16,339
awesome thank you very

31
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,939
this is one of those topics though you
know we have locks were bringing in lock

32
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:25,090
potentially there so many sources blogs
that we have in our organization and i

33
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:30,510
wanna make this talk something that
makes sense of walking and gives you

34
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:34,540
something that you can use as an example
when you're trying to talk about logging

35
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,519
in the context of maybe some people that
are all that tactical who don't

36
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:42,379
necessarily understand the value of the
logs that you have and maybe even

37
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:47,200
looking for options for things to do
what your walks are given how many of

38
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,510
you are currently running some sort of
similar logging solution decent number

39
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:56,388
awesome how many of you are just kind of
scratching their expert with that right

40
00:02:56,389 --> 00:03:02,260
now just getting started but maybe
bringing in some types of data that's a

41
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,280
start there how many of you would say
you're doing a little bit more of an

42
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,030
advanced sort of thing you're you're
bringing in more sources of data may be

43
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,000
not just your security team is looking
at it but your development team is

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,319
working with your sources couple of
people a decent about how many you make

45
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:25,179
your solution is awesome then you have
everything you'd ever want no one will

46
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:29,280
get there that's good is not going to be
the know it all in the room that's going

47
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:36,250
to take the microwave so without further
ado i'd like to get started it with the

48
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:43,939
story because this is Tori to logging so
what's up the scene so we have a

49
00:03:43,939 --> 00:03:49,049
worldwide financial services
organization will just call them big

50
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:55,079
bank incorporate they have millions of
customers around the world this is

51
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:59,750
online banking institution what
something that an online making

52
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,750
institution

53
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:13,220
the question number share if it's online
how do people get to their numbers yes a

54
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:17,600
website they probably have more than one
website they might have some observers

55
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:25,610
you think their customers are gonna care
if they can get these websites yeah yeah

56
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:29,160
so this this this is their business
that's something that they care about

57
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,620
and that is something that would be
considered one of their most important

58
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:38,900
resources so what happens when something
goes wrong what happens when there's a

59
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:45,200
problem what happens when that website
is impacted that brings us to April 7

60
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,890
2013 May so what's happening

61
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:58,659
ecommerce site it's because I'm lined
baking and you're not able to do online

62
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:05,500
banking things that set you up servers
are crashing and everyone knows what a

63
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:11,180
web server crash it splits right down
the middle and that's also that your

64
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:15,120
server administrators are happy about
that and your developers are just like

65
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,640
you know how can I write code on
something that's in two pieces of course

66
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:25,090
your business is impacted because you're
not able to run the transactions can

67
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:31,979
access the website to transact
everything like that so I was wondering

68
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:37,270
what's going through your head you're
facing this situation put yourself in

69
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:41,919
your role either as an administrator and
Auditor in whatever role in that

70
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:49,150
what are you thinking right now when
faced with this will cost sharing with

71
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:52,489
the information you have provided

72
00:05:52,490 --> 00:06:01,330
what might you be thinking is potential
yeah I heard it right there

73
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:11,150
what other things i would tell your
share you have situations where there

74
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:19,888
are maybe a server having problem maybe
an application issue maybe tonight what

75
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:23,419
types of things and what questions you
have

76
00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:36,500
when you're faced with this kind of a
situation very well that's excellent

77
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:41,030
point and definitely something that
happens you have a big situation that's

78
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:45,729
going on and then out the door they're
taking some information and everyone's

79
00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:51,030
focusing on the need to us that it's a
very good point something that happened

80
00:06:51,030 --> 00:07:02,969
as you said you've seen exactly how
chapter getting that slide but yeah

81
00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:07,259
that's a great question that everyone
really should be considered when

82
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:13,060
something's happening what changed now
this situation

83
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:17,380
modified to protect the innocent is
based on a true example that I faced as

84
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:23,680
a security engineer in this case this
event where an e-commerce site was

85
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,000
impacted severely and that look like a
very serious denial of service attack

86
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,550
happened right after a firewall upgrade
I was the person who upgraded a firewall

87
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:44,479
and my firewall upgrade cost the denial
of service attack and quote from one of

88
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:50,560
the people there why did this happen we
never had this issue so how many of you

89
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,199
been in the situation where you have had
been faced with a quick team to make

90
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:00,020
sense like this but you need a way to
explain I'm sure

91
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:10,090
you seen that happen before and how do
we how do we deal with step let's take a

92
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:16,229
step back get back to that story this is
what I actually get to the title slide

93
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:22,540
presentation where there was a time
where I was saying this is where all

94
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,930
that shakes that I read in high school
came into play and then I was like

95
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:36,320
that's not shakespeare so it was the
best of locks so if too much attention

96
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:44,250
literature class but that's good because
I only deal with 10 this is the face I

97
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:49,100
usually get when I start talking about
looks as if established with guys you

98
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:54,690
know about lobs you're here that's great
but all too often I see the case where

99
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:59,450
yes I like well we have lots of those
things that would be really great if we

100
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:06,050
do have those looks that being said it's
even better to have a lot in advance and

101
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:12,449
will get to this later but he can't make
that you don't have people seem to just

102
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:18,100
think you can magic locks into existence
for whatever reason I swear if there was

103
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:22,270
if anything you want to start a bit you
make locks for things retro actively you

104
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:28,020
can be purchased copy editor so just
that's a business idea if you guys do

105
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:34,949
that from the commission but locked
they're really really useful they tell

106
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:39,920
the story of exactly what's happening
from a very very detailed level just

107
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:46,729
like this service service service that
by itself really really really but in

108
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:51,730
the context of all of your service and
then you know maybe one of us down what

109
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:57,750
breaks a leg network cable clips and how
whatever happens we have a record of

110
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:03,200
where that changed and we can see maybe
nasa not necessarily a single server

111
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,020
crashing is a problem or single service
stopping walking but we can see the big

112
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:11,020
picture when we start looking at logs
and global scale

113
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:21,329
these locks tell us exactly what's going
on at any given point now inevitably

114
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:27,170
people ask me where do outcome what
happens you have any surrender mommy

115
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:36,610
service love each other very much but
seriously I'm glad you and your network

116
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:41,720
that has some capability of doing
something in some way and will produce

117
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:47,910
lots you might just have two courses lot
of times logging is enabled by default

118
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:52,540
lot of times some administrators don't
know this and don't know what

119
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:56,649
information is being collected and what
the little bit optimization you can even

120
00:10:56,649 --> 00:11:02,870
more and better and more useful but yeah
when we look at it from a entire

121
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:07,230
organization perspective a lot of times
when the best sources of information

122
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:11,360
about what's going on and i were quite
level is looking at your firewalls and

123
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,839
network devices to get start your fire
also tell you what traffic is coming in

124
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,769
and out

125
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:21,550
tell you what's allowed three
organizations work bout will tell you

126
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:26,170
what system and individual users
communicating where you can identify

127
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:31,459
alotta information about potential
malicious activity just by looking at

128
00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:38,699
and that's not even considering all the
other sources of information network

129
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:42,800
devices are also great because they
can't tell you things about routing

130
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:48,059
changes for example in your router's
they can tell you about switch ports

131
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:52,199
going up and down to someone connected
to the network your wireless network

132
00:11:52,199 --> 00:11:56,519
devices that can tell you what users are
authenticated what MAC addresses are

133
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:02,670
talking where where someone's allocated
based on what experts there can you look

134
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:06,860
at that just from the network level you
can find out automatically where someone

135
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:12,170
is in the building what they tried to
access and network devices also have

136
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:17,569
auditing capabilities to see if
something changed me a lot just working

137
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:21,959
at the network level not even going and
applications like that

138
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:26,560
servers they have all different types of
blocks not just that

139
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,529
vacation and operates two blocks but
other types of blocks as well

140
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:36,480
the hardware capability if there's a
problem how much CPU is being used

141
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:42,250
there's information that exists in the
web server or what type of traffic

142
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,260
coming in

143
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:49,620
users are indicating the server network
shares of there being utilized that's

144
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:54,089
just all information that can come from
a single server on top of that your

145
00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:57,170
application services have different
types of locks as well

146
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,819
now these types of walks that the
applications have are often here are

147
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:09,160
some developers are really really good
at things other ones really think it and

148
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:14,550
a lot of times you look at something
makes perfect sense the developer we try

149
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:18,390
to look at it from a security
perspective or from the perspective of

150
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:22,990
someone is actually trying to you know
read what's going on with this guy

151
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:28,790
smoking some buds and there's things
that need to be done often with these

152
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:32,800
types of locks to make more sense for
what application we're trying to look

153
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:38,430
but just because something is producing
a lot it doesn't need not valuable we

154
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:41,859
have to understand what the purpose of
it is and if it's something that will

155
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:47,700
benefit our used his also access control
systems and miss you really run the

156
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:52,339
gamut you could look at your traditional
authentication services such as like

157
00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:59,080
your radius in your LDAP system but you
even think about walking into building

158
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:05,070
for example a batch or keep up he's
quite that you have an access lock their

159
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:10,430
of entering an area you can use that
data or not only determining if someone

160
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:16,630
walked into the data center but you can
also see who is utilizing a space are

161
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:23,370
you using the space that you have we
just who's coming and who's going

162
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:32,660
also your phone systems they have locks
and we look at all the reports of the

163
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:38,990
social engineering techniques that go up
so you're looking at targeted iPad apps

164
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:46,210
where the users are being attacked not
through something that is a web page for

165
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:51,180
dinner might be targeted email but all
too often you're seeing that comes to

166
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:56,199
try to either get someones credentials
or to just capture information to go

167
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,110
back to the icky known even when they
were talking about getting information

168
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:03,940
to write a bad check all you need to do
is call up accounts payable and they'll

169
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,060
give your routing number and bank
account number that's something that you

170
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,069
can have a phone call

171
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:14,760
record up to at least know this happen
and investigate it you'll know who

172
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:21,990
answered the phone call and we're also
look at it from the customer service you

173
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:25,460
have a customer that would call in a
phone number that phone number is

174
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:29,520
something you can associate to an
account that count my network is

175
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:34,439
associated with better place to your
website all these pieces of information

176
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,220
you can buy a single user and their
transactions

177
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:43,620
there are so many applications for
tracking down not only issues so that

178
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:49,140
user has a problem placing an order you
already know before the calls but you'd

179
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:54,110
also have the ability to look at
potential fraudulent behavior if the

180
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:59,140
case you have an IP address for example
placing orders that are associated with

181
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:03,839
the same email address all in a country
that does not match where the orders

182
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:11,339
coming so by making sense all of your
online orders for example you can easily

183
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:16,360
not easily but you can at least look for
patterns of organized crime fraud

184
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:25,040
email systems have a wealth of
information you can get details just

185
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,559
from looking at email letters to see
where emails are being sent from types

186
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:34,219
of emails that might look like phishing
emails just based on the header

187
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:39,699
information that sells well now there's
things that can be done if you grab even

188
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:45,089
more now but what I find there's
concerns about the amount of data

189
00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:51,769
capturing for that and also privacy so I
wouldn't say it makes sense to log all

190
00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:56,489
of the content of all of your email in a
way that your security team can do that

191
00:16:56,489 --> 00:17:02,110
because people like freaked out a little
bit there might be some implications

192
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:07,149
with that but just by having details
about who is communicating with who and

193
00:17:07,148 --> 00:17:14,158
where is that email coming from you can
get a lot of security information really

194
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:18,459
that's an essay for example talks about
their medidata that's a lot of what

195
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:25,049
their get whatever software I know it's
all in the butt of a lot of jokes in the

196
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:30,760
industry but at the end of the day
almost everyone has some point client

197
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:35,740
now wear protection on their setups if
you have that to walk when something

198
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:38,490
happens if it's not cleaned up

199
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:45,010
director Service Desk to investigate it
but that information can be correlated

200
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:51,899
with other formation other systems to
get some more depth knowledge and also

201
00:17:51,899 --> 00:17:53,000
your idea

202
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,279
IPS systems those are kind of the
anything that that your malware or

203
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:09,909
you're not going to get those will help
CDI medication as well because pretty

204
00:18:09,909 --> 00:18:13,220
much anything that's malware or
malicious software is going to go out

205
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:19,799
and try to help out in some way so that
traffic is getting somewhere something

206
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:24,799
on your networks and you should be able
to get a better idea by looking at maybe

207
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,320
there's an IDS alerts but you're also
seeing something from that client

208
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,500
getting blocked your firewall as well

209
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,960
hey this is something that

210
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,550
team to be a legitimate thing that we
did investigate as opposed to just go

211
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:44,649
there was a malware scan now but really
the thing to keep in mind is that almost

212
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:53,040
any does the trick is to understand what
you can get from gathering those locks

213
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:58,170
what information you can find that
special how it can benefit the security

214
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,960
program that you're trying to implement
and I want to even encourage you to look

215
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:08,330
beyond security program a lot of us we
like to think of security is where the

216
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:11,980
security people we have all the cool
toys and tools but really something like

217
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:16,670
this has greater business gatien's and
if you're looking for trying to expand

218
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:21,730
something in your organization by saying
more than security for our application

219
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:26,370
team can use this to better improve how
we handle site issues and application

220
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:29,699
issues our customer service team can use
this to better interact with customers

221
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:36,150
so much more so much better business use
case something that's easier to get

222
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:42,570
funding for its support for the
organization thing to keep in mind about

223
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:48,730
law is their machine data and machine at
it like I said earlier example the

224
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,810
server walking but not your shakespeare

225
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:56,990
Charles Dickens novel no one's gonna
read that they need something to go to

226
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:03,550
sleep but there's plenty of industry why
papers that were just so you guys all

227
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,070
realize lots exist

228
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:10,929
great this is an example walked one of
the systems that I had a lab working

229
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:14,010
just walk through this real quick so
that you can see what a Linux system

230
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:19,680
really the question to ask what are they
trying to tell me they're just a bunch

231
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:26,130
of violent hey what's up what it is like
trying to say well we extracted will see

232
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:33,410
a bunch of and he was like AT&T PDT and
Damon is talking out to this random I

233
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,860
know this random IP address

234
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:39,860
actually making magic rating

235
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:47,899
yeah so there there's an event for no
service reachable when there was an NDP

236
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:56,570
failure we see a couple other and
innovation event so wonder like why here

237
00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:11,689
was that not accessible and then we'll
see here at the bottom there was maybe a

238
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:17,690
little suspicious especially if you're
not allowing logins so you know maybe

239
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:21,929
we're seeing a case that what's going
out looking at this individual server

240
00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:27,070
but clearly you know what seems to be
normal behavior may be some network

241
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:33,149
interruption and then we'll interesting

242
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:46,830
really lot of people would probably get
this point why should I care about logs

243
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:53,230
its boring and they're just tell me what
my systems out during I don't care what

244
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:59,350
we really like I said earlier you can't
retroactive lemay clocks so if you need

245
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:04,949
some kind of plot for a breach that
happens or some other security event and

246
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:09,530
you're not collecting it that's things
and you're not gonna be able to get that

247
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:13,700
information you're not gonna be able to
solve your problem so really the time to

248
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:19,150
think about these things as well before
you run into a situation where you

249
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:23,170
should understand your locks have them
and be able to work with them so that

250
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:25,920
when you run into a case where you need
them

251
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:35,800
prepared for this is when I want to go
back to some of the stories up with a

252
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:43,060
bunch of that you saw the situation that
we talked about earlier we're just to

253
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,220
kind of bring you back up to speed

254
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:49,840
we had a firewall upgrade causing a
denial of service attack which at face

255
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:56,409
value seems absolutely ridiculous what
we ended up working through this sort of

256
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:01,520
the case was starting by looking at the
behavior here what we're seeing in our

257
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,110
part because when you're having a lot of
incoming traffic that CD crashing

258
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:09,879
applications that's going to be the
boundary where most anything is going to

259
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:15,190
happen so looking truck are all odds we
identified patterns where this topic

260
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:21,730
quickly by saying what IP addresses are
sending the most rap to over this period

261
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:27,040
we identified a couple of interesting
batters first and foremost we are able

262
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:31,790
to identify when that firewall upgrade
happened based on ticket updates saying

263
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:36,620
when this was cut over we are able to
demonstrate 36 hours of everything

264
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:41,169
behaving normally after the firewall
upgrade no change between in our new

265
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:45,790
firewall firewall and then a sudden
change in the middle of the afternoon

266
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:49,600
where this started

267
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:55,169
the other thing we notice looking at a
lot of the IP addresses that were

268
00:23:55,169 --> 00:24:00,480
causing and we picked out a couple one
that looked interesting in with a source

269
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,980
of a lot of the traffic so this denial
of service

270
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,549
really appear to be all that distributed
there were a number of posts that were

271
00:24:07,549 --> 00:24:13,559
way off the church the amount of traffic
that were coming in so we took the IP

272
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:18,220
addresses and put them into a
sophisticated resource to her research

273
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:22,900
tool known as Google and we're able to
determine that this these IP addresses

274
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:31,210
were associated with the detox
mitigation actually which kind of this

275
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:35,230
was not a case where he organization
that upgraded their firewall was getting

276
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:42,580
beat us they were participating in it
because they had a public-facing website

277
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:49,220
now a lot of times what happens you know
denial of service situation is someone

278
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:53,380
will be the person that is going to be
attacked and you love a bad guy that

279
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:58,289
want that person and it's not practical
but the bad guy and it just be you know

280
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:03,840
I'm his machine sending traffic in each
use other things on the internet service

281
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,730
so he of course has about that because
every person who as an attacker or is it

282
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:14,360
accurate they have a botnet in this was
actually using request set up a

283
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:19,899
different type and your DNS for the
denial-of-service neck so these were

284
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:25,340
accessing this website with a sport a
spook source address the source address

285
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:30,668
being the company that they wanted
sending traffic to this company's public

286
00:25:30,669 --> 00:25:35,140
website web servers were acting like the
web server should be returning traffic

287
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:39,880
where they thought they'd traffic was
coming from and that's the source was

288
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:46,789
receiving not only my customers requests
but a whole bunch of other requests when

289
00:25:46,789 --> 00:25:48,490
you have a flood of incoming

290
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:53,590
he returned traffic that you did request
you are the recipient of a denial

291
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:58,129
service so they were using a service to
try to mitigate that by sending

292
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:03,409
basically denial of service request to
the web servers that were forced to them

293
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:11,190
so it's kind of like we were in the
middle of this but it was bad now by

294
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:14,810
trying to figure out this sort of
situation by just looking to log

295
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:19,030
individually it's not something you're
going to be able to figure out in any

296
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:24,540
reasonable at the time being a person so
using correlation tools and being able

297
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:29,580
to simply understand we are the top
sources of information coming from what

298
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:34,090
do these IP addresses do variable to
figure out what's going on is that does

299
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:39,740
that make sense it's a really simple
example but it really shows just looking

300
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:44,470
pretty much a firewall logs without any
shorter really advanced correlation what

301
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:50,200
you do that's really based getting in
some kind of sense this is a simple

302
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:59,540
thing that you can do it some other
situation that you see is let's say you

303
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:06,480
have an employee that you know might be
someone who did the potential for taking

304
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:12,120
some information which is called me know
snowden for example he he he he took

305
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:18,870
some information that he probably should
think about the situation of what he

306
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:23,080
might have been doing so if you're
someone who wants to make a lot of

307
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:28,530
probation from the government and share
it with people what do you need to do

308
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:36,830
like another it's not a trick question
you take a lot of information what do I

309
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:43,419
need to have to take it easy to access
information share you also need to be

310
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:47,760
able to collect all that she need a lot
of information to be able to give away a

311
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:53,830
lot of information we have to be able to
access all that it so now that we've

312
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:58,000
talked about logging and you're
accessing information what is something

313
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:11,680
that might happen when you access any
case I heard was over there yet so when

314
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:15,670
you're accessing assist them whether or
not you have permission to do that

315
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:21,490
that's something that gets a lot so
let's just say you know someone gave

316
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:27,260
snowden domain admin access good access
everything sure this is gonna stop them

317
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:32,840
but they should be logged hey you access
to all these things so we have access

318
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:39,860
locks authentication locks for Snowden X
he's probably going to more than like

319
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:43,149
one or 2 I'll service to get all this
information or we're all basically

320
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:46,620
screwed the government's putting
everything I like you know government

321
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:51,850
file server 01 so he's probably getting
more than one file server generating a

322
00:28:51,850 --> 00:29:00,459
lot of authentication compared to you
know average IRS or you know no one in

323
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:05,840
congress access any files anyway so
their authentication just not but like

324
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,240
other people actually do work in the
government like you know you guys who

325
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:15,190
are here where government and some
capability you do things you access the

326
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:19,650
good side of the government that
actually does though so do your job

327
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:25,100
you're gonna be accessed but still if
you're trying to steal information from

328
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:29,760
a wide range of systems your
authentication types are going to be way

329
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:36,900
off let's just assume also that
information out of the system or out of

330
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:42,150
the company's now what are some ways
that you might want to try to export

331
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:44,640
trade information and let's not even
think so

332
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:51,430
hit like if I wanted to send you know
information somewhere use Google Drive

333
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:58,670
Dropbox you could use email grant those
are really not sophisticated ways to do

334
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:03,610
it but you could actually headed that
way let's look at it from the

335
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:08,810
perspective of we have an employee who
has a significant number authentication

336
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:13,000
authorization attempts and file share
access they're not even invalid once

337
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,390
they're just ate way off the chart
number we also have someone in spending

338
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:25,280
a lot of information to file sharing
site that's something that employee

339
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:30,190
needs to be looked at as a potential
source of either leaving the company or

340
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:34,980
leaking information and the only thing
we looked at they didn't do anything

341
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:40,100
wrong per se because they have
permission to access those things by key

342
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:44,610
access that's giving now granted those
permissions could be up but they haven't

343
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:49,969
violated any thing that they were
allowed to do by the software policies

344
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:54,490
that were there this is just looking for
an anomaly in determining it as a prop

345
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:59,800
jets something that can be done in just
kind of relating that to an example

346
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:07,990
large amounts of other types of
activities such as web browsing that's a

347
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:16,580
key indicator based on what a system is
doing so you might be able to say this

348
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:21,679
user does this sort of behavior now when
you're looking at website traffic you

349
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:28,210
can use your proxy Log firewall logs but
with a lot of traffic in each yes and

350
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:29,850
not always something that you want it

351
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:34,449
decrypt for both performance and
liability reasons there are other ways

352
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:41,720
what's going on a great example for that
is using DNS DNS lots are probably some

353
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,760
of the easiest want to generate some of
them were collected some of the most

354
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,980
powerful lots that you can have as long
as she could track the DNS request this

355
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:52,640
course where it was created

356
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:59,470
so you look at a system that is making
DNS requests how to something that is

357
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:02,470
determined to be suspicious how do we
determine something suspicious

358
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:11,090
well domain names are things that people
access for example someone goes to

359
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:15,040
google.com microsoft.com that's probably
not gonna be something that DCS very

360
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:21,620
suspicious that's what if you see a
domain request for a domain that's never

361
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:26,810
been seen your organization and you look
at when that domain was created and it

362
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:33,940
was registered registered a day ago in
russia which probably not the coolest

363
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:38,090
site on the internet that everyone
should be going to be so a lot of times

364
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:46,850
we created domains that our only seen
one in her organization from a potential

365
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:49,070
suspicious looking registrar

366
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:53,389
a randomized domain name that can be
something associated with you don't need

367
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:57,830
ideas you don't need we should still
have this but you don't need them to say

368
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:01,870
just by DNS requests this machine looks
like it's doing something that shit

369
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:07,840
that's really a source of grabbing that
sort of a match

370
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:15,620
in any of you else are any of you have
other examples of things that we might

371
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:24,260
be able to build apartments that you've
seen you wanna share like many other one

372
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:31,140
where you look at access lots where
people are accessing the building you

373
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:37,160
have your key card locks you can see
where someone is going and you can work

374
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:40,950
with your security key not only from a
network perspective but also working

375
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:46,890
with your physical security as well you
will get the perspective we're talking

376
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:53,380
about four blocks you can say this phone
number keeps calling in all the time

377
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:59,900
when I see this phone number I see my
client access he doing some other

378
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:03,760
behavior like resetting a password
account that phone numbers not wear that

379
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,280
you normally calls in from this is
something that looks like it could be a

380
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:13,040
fishing or social engineering so really
it there's so many different things they

381
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:19,070
do a lot of correlation and each really
really fascinating it's all about

382
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:23,130
finding the things that make sense of
your organization I really encourage you

383
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:29,570
to start small and go from there at this
point you're probably thinking well what

384
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:36,390
can I i'm glad you asked most important
thing really is to start to know and

385
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:41,009
understand your locks understand where
these logs are created in your company

386
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:45,200
understand what information they're
trying to get understand what

387
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:49,069
information you might have that you
don't know you have or that you could be

388
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:53,320
collecting that you're not these are
areas where you can get more visibility

389
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:58,750
into what you have and what you are
doing and then really all we get the

390
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:03,270
point where you're managing your lots
and having that some central collection

391
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:08,820
toll whatever may be yourself to bring
in all that data together and then start

392
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:15,790
understanding and using that security
information and really you wonder how to

393
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:18,630
help us

394
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:23,320
I always kind of bias to the security
approach just because that the side I i

395
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:28,510
see the most but really we want to look
at this from beyond the perspective of

396
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:34,540
the gist being something that benefits
you think about the operational and

397
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:38,560
other system administration benefit that
you can have and even some of the core

398
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:43,960
business it back if you can use a
correlation with your customer service

399
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:50,510
and you have phone supporters or just
even call center of what you're looking

400
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:54,950
to do or what your organization has to
do to support their customers if you can

401
00:35:54,950 --> 00:36:00,520
improve that area so when your security
too and the most important thing I

402
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:05,500
always try to save his security people
we have the reputation a lot of times as

403
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:09,620
being the organization the people that
say no and we have the people who are

404
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:13,600
often seen as a roadblock in their
organizations to be able to get things

405
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:18,480
done I don't want to stab that that I
don't want us to be the evil security

406
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,290
people who are not the ones that are
allowing the business to function while

407
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:27,259
still keeping its here so anything you
take from this understand that you

408
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:31,080
should be the people who are
understanding how to make things work

409
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:35,650
yes we can do something but let's work
together to make something secure so

410
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:41,040
he's take that and bring that out
because i dont wanna industry to just be

411
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,020
the No

412
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:47,200
part because we had that reputation grew
up to it that I want open the floor for

413
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:52,870
any questions feel free to ask whatever
they're so thank you very much
